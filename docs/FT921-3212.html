			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Perestroika without glasnost WHO WAS right: Mikhail Gorbachev or Deng Xiaoping? On the face of it, recent events in what used to be the two great bastions of doctrinaire Marxism-Leninism appear to throw that question into stark relief. In the former Soviet Union, the collapse of communism has been accompanied by economic misery and social chaos. In parts of still-communist totalitarian China, however, a form of capitalism is thriving, bringing with it an economic boom and strongly improving living standards. What is more, it seems that the ruling Politburo - encouraged by the 87-year-old Deng - is gearing up for another drive for economic reform. Although the process is fragile and vulnerable to attack from party hardliners, it is beginning to look as if China is again setting itself unequivocally on the road to the market - and that it has just as much chance of succeeding as has Russia in its own anarchic transformation. In fact, contrary to conventional wisdom, China never really abandoned the path of reform in the past three years - the repression of June 1989 notwithstanding. At the centre, to be sure, Tiananmen square did seem to presage a pause in Beijing's opening to the outside world, and bring hardliners to the fore, with their warnings against instability and cultural contamination. But all the while, out in the fields and factories, private economic activity continued to grow; foreign investment to flow in; and exports to mushroom. In short, market reforms have shown astonishing resilience - to the point where they may be declared to have developed their own unstoppable momentum. Reformers' initiative Now the reformers have again seized the initiative. After months of ideological struggle, the official press last week carried banner headlines endorsing Deng's line in favour of foreign trade, investment and management practices. The decks are evidently being cleared for the crucial 14th party congress this autumn, which - if Deng and his acolytes have their way - will set the seal on reform policies and usher in a new, somewhat younger generation of party bosses to implement them. Deciding the line, of course, is only part of the battle, and the challenges facing the leadership are immense. For alongside China's rapidly growing private and collectively-run businesses - concentrated mainly in the south - is a collection of state-run industries in a state of near-collapse, with losses and debts that are sucking the state coffers dry. The bureaucracy is stultifyingly inefficient. Pricing signals are hopelessly confused, making sensible management decisions virtually impossible. Social dislocation None of these problems will be resolved without great economic and social dislocation. For example, the leadership has little chance of improving the profitability of state industry without imposing job losses on a massive scale. This may be politically infeasible, which is why the state has in recent years relied on private sector activity and foreign capital as the twin motors of prosperity. People should not delude themselves that a further loosening of the economic throttle will be followed by a relaxation of the party's ruthless political grip. On the contrary, the lesson Deng drew from the overheating of the economy which preceded Tiananmen is that economic reform necessitates the maintenance of tight political control. The continuing strains that result - caused by corruption and by growing inequalities between and within regions  -are likely to reinforce that view in Beijing. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the economic transformation now under way will ultimately spark demands for greater political freedom, and that the authorities will have to listen, just as they have been forced into another wave of market reform to maintain the growth in living standards. While remaining strong in their condemnation of human rights abuses, western governments should seek to encourage such economic change in China. That means keeping the import and investment channels open, not attaching political conditions to trade concessions as the US Congress has been trying to do.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Company News: American Airlines consolidates recovery AMR Corporation, parent company of American Airlines, one of the biggest US airlines, turned in a second consecutive quarter of profit yesterday. Net income was Dollars 118m for the third quarter, compared with net losses of Dollars 100m last time. Mr Robert Crandall, chairman, said the profits were 'insufficient, but a step in the right direction'. 'While we remain far short of our goals, we are pleased that our continuing efforts to control costs and maximise revenue have begun to improve results,' he said. The company also took the opportunity to dismiss reports that it was seeking an alliance with Sabena, the Belgian national carrier. American Airlines is the only large US airline not to have secured a significant alliance with a European partner. American Airlines, like others in the US industry, has been dogged by tough competition from lower-cost operators offering cheaper fares. Last month it underlined its determination to bring its own cost structure into line by announcing plans to eliminate 5,000 jobs and ground 11 of its DC-10 aircraft. Mr Durham attributed the latest quarter's result to a 1 per cent reduction in capacity, stable passenger traffic, and higher fares. The figures for the comparable period, he pointed out, had been distorted by a fares war in which American Airlines offered a 50 per cent reduction in fares. Turnover in the third quarter was Dollars 4.2bn, a 13 per cent improvement on the comparable period, and net income per share was Dollars 1.33 compared with a loss of Dollars 1.32. Net earnings for the first nine months are running at Dollars 143m , compared with a loss of Dollars 275m. USAIR, the US airline in which British Airways has a 24.6 per cent stake, produced the latest in a series of dismal results with a third-quarter loss of Dollars 177.6m.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (11): Doubts persist on resilience of recovery - France: government incentives have helped the industry but celebrations are muted The French car industry has turned the corner after the black year of 1993, boosted by special government incentives for car buyers and a revival in the French and European economies. Monthly sales figures so far this year have generally recorded double-digit rises, providing a stimulus for broader economic growth. The two giants of the industry, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault, are both on course for healthy increases in results for 1994 and are benefiting from revamped product ranges. At Renault, the outlook has been helped by last month's announcement that the government will partially privatise the state-owned company, an operation which will be accompanied by a FFr2bn capital increase. Despite such uplifting factors, however, there is only muted celebration at the headquarters of the French car manufacturers. Doubts persist about the resilience of the recovery, while the structural problems in the European industry have been masked, rather than resolved, by economic revival. In France, government measures to boost sales, including a premium of FFr5,000 to car buyers who trade in a vehicle more than 10 years old to buy a new one, have had a temporary, if significant, effect. For Renault, there are additional question-marks about its longer-term strategy after the collapse at the end of last year of its plans to merge with Volvo. Jacques Calvet, Renault's chairman, expressed the general caution at the recent launch of a new version of the company's Xantia mid-range car. Predicting an increase of about 4 per cent in Europe's car market this year, he said that was still 'bad when you realise that 1993 brought a drop of about 15 per cent on 1992'. As for France, he said: 'I am not so pessimistic as at the end of July, but I do not hold with the forecasts of a French market of 2m cars in 1994.' For the Peugeot boss, and for most industry observers, the French market should nevertheless see a healthy rise this year. 'I think we will see a rise of about 12 or 13 per cent to just over 1.9m units,' says one analyst at a French merchant bank. That kind of improvement should lead to earnings growth at the French manufacturers. Peugeot Citroen is on course to bounce back to profits after a net loss of FFr1.41bn in 1993. In addition to improved market conditions, the company has been implementing productivity measures and reducing its debt burden. Net debts are forecast to fall to about FFr10bn at the end of the year, compared with FFr16.7bn at the end of 1993. The improved competitiveness of its range - which has seen the introduction of the 106 and 306 models and, more recently, its passenger van rivals to the Renault Espace - is also shown in market share figures. In the first eight months of 1994, the Peugeot group captured 12.7 per cent of the European market, compared with 12 per cent in the same period last year. At Renault, already one of Europe's most profitable car manufacturers, the current year will also see a strong rise in earnings. First-half results announced last month revealed net profits of FFr1.7bn, more than double the figures in the comparable 1993 period. The results were flattered by the impact of exceptional gains from the sale of shares in Volvo, Renault's erstwhile merger partner. They also masked a decline in operating profit, partly reflecting the lower margins of entry level models favoured by the government's incentives. For the full year, however, both Renault and industry analysts expect a strong improvement in the bottom line. Part of this will come from improved international sales. Like Peugeot, Renault has been extending its tentacles into emerging markets in eastern and central Europe and Latin America. Like its domestic rival, Renault has benefited from a revamped model range. The Twingo, the popular mini-car, has helped restore its reputation for innovation. The Safrane has strengthened the company's position at the opposite end of the market. The question marks over the state-owned group relate more to its longer-term strategy in the wake of its failed alliance with Volvo. The spectacular collapse of merger plans at the end of last year deprived Renault of significant cost savings from economies of scale and the sharing of design costs and components. This was a particularly important factor with respect to RVI, its trucks and buses subsidiary. Since the departure of Volvo, the centre-right government of Edouard Balladur has indicated that industrial partners need to be found before Renault can be privatised. The state will retain a stake of at least 51 per cent following Renault's forthcoming flotation, due to be held by the end of the year. The implication is that Renault's future must be guaranteed in the increasingly competitive car industry before it can be released to the threats of private sector predators. For the time being, Renault is pursuing a strategy of specific targeted alliances, rather than a grand partnership a la Volvo. Thus, it has recently concluded an agreement with Iveco, Fiat's truck subsidiary to co-operate on the design and development of cabins, while rejecting the merger of its foundry facilities with those of the Italian group. It already has extensive co-operation agreements with Peugeot for the development of components. Speculation is bound to continue, however, about the formation of bigger alliances. That is unlikely to deter potential investors in Renault, particularly given the restricted supply of shares in its forthcoming flotation.</p>

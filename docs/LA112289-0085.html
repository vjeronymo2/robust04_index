			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEVER TOO YOUNG FOR SAFETY LESSONS;  </P> <P> HUNTING: DFG PROGRAM PROVIDES MANY YOUNGSTERS WITH FIRST EXPERIENCE UNDER  CONTROLLED CONDITIONS.  </P> <P> Hunter, stepping carefully through brush with shotgun ready, follows dog into  field.  </P> <P> Dog comes to point. Pulse pounding, hunter turns in direction indicated.  Pheasant flushed and takes flight. Hunter raises stock to shoulder, flicks off  safety, takes careful aim . . .  </P> <P> It's a familiar fall tableau, especially for the dog. Jake, an 11-year-old  English pointer, has flushed more pheasants than the hunter probably will ever  see. But it's all new for Sara Autry of Chino, who is only two years older than  Jake.  </P> <P> She was one of 109 people 17 and younger who got dressed up in bright orange  vests provided by the California Department of Fish and Game last weekend to  celebrate graduation from the state's hunter-safety program with a free  pheasant shoot at Raahauge's hunting ranch in Norco.  </P> <P> There was a similar program at Blythe the same day, and others are scheduled  from San Jacinto to Lone Pine through December, including another at Raahauge's  Dec. 2. The purpose is to give young hunters their first field experience under  controlled conditions.  </P> <P> A DFG press release called them "young adults," but that was stretching it in  some cases. Zachary Morse of Norco was only 9, and others appeared to be even  younger. All carried guns -- some as long as the youngsters were tall. All had  live ammunition. All were licensed hunters. All got home safely. Most got their  birds.  </P> <P> There was no cause for alarm, said Capt. Rick Wheeler, the warden who is  coordinator of hunter education for the 10 Southern California counties in DFG  Region 5.  </P> <P> "We put this under the most controlled situation that we possibly can," Wheeler  said.  </P> <P> Two hunters, a guide and a dog were assigned to designated fields, far enough  apart that harmful shots couldn't reach an adjacent area. Only one hunter at a  time was allowed to load, and then only one shell. The DFG provided two birds  per hunter, Raahauge's donated 300 more for its two hunts and guides planted  them in the field immediately before each pair of hunters went out, giving them  maximum opportunity for success.  </P> <P> "It also allows us to look at them in the field," Wheeler said. "Maybe a number  of them are doing something wrong. But we haven't had any accidents. The junior  hunters as a group are very mature."  </P> <P> In some ways, they may have a better grasp of what hunting in Southern  California will be like in the 21st Century. Shrinking habitat and challenged  morality are rapidly changing the face of the sport.  </P> <P> "Most of the adults are used to, on a Saturday morning, grabbing a dog and  going out to a field near the house and hunting," Wheeler said. "Those days are  over. (With) the mass of population in Southern California, the habitat is not  what it used to be."  </P> <P> Raahauge's leases 3,400 acres of flood-control land along the Santa Ana River,  2,500 for pheasant hunting.  </P> <P> "We're probably the largest pheasant-hunting club in the United States,"  proprietor Mike Raahauge said. "We shoot about 46,000 birds a year."  </P> <P> If that is to be Southern California's pheasant hunting of the future, the next  generation of hunters doesn't seem to mind.  </P> <P> "This is all they know, so they're showing the same enthusiasm," Wheeler said.  "They have a very good grasp of what's going on (with the) environment and  conservation. Then you have some (older) hunters so set in their ways that they  don't understand times have changed. Especially in Southern California, as  crowded as it is, if you don't compromise, you lose your position. That's one  of the neat things about bringing on new hunters."  </P> <P> According to the DFG, hunter numbers have dropped from 700,000 to 400,000 in  the last seven years. Wheeler thinks part of the reason is fewer new hunters.  </P> <P> "We have a high incidence of divorce in Southern California and, normally, the  mother takes control of the children," Wheeler said. "For the most part,  females have not been exposed to hunting, so their children can't be exposed to  hunting, so we're losing a group of potential hunters that won't have the  opportunity."  </P> <P> At some stage, potential young hunters also may have to face the peer pressure  of anti-hunting attitudes that are gaining political strength -- a difficult  experience at an impressionable age.  </P> <P> Some already have. One parent said that when his son wrote a report on what he  did on vacation -- hunt -- his teacher ridiculed him in front of the class.  </P> <P> Wheeler said: "I talk to them about it. It might affect them, and if the child  in his mind perceives that it is wrong, I'm not going to try to change his  mind. I will tell him that, given a certain set of circumstances and the  environment we have, that hunting is a necessary tool in conservation. If he  wishes to believe that, more power to him."  </P> <P> Anti-hunters may accuse the DFG of brainwashing kids.  </P> <P> "I would expect them not to call that brainwashing, because I don't call what  they do brainwashing," Wheeler said. "When we reach the point that people are  not allowed to have their opinion, we'd better back off and take another look  at the situation."  </P> <P> Jim Morse, Zachary's father, said: "We've talked about it but not a whole lot.  I haven't wanted to give him any of the negative aspects of it. Generally, the  people that are anti-hunting aren't aware of the whole situation . . . that  hunters have supported wildlife over many years through their contributions and  the (conservation) work they do."  </P> <P> Morse said his son has been tagging along for a number of years.  </P> <P> "It's fun just to be out together," he said. "It helps teach respect for the  animals . . . to learn their habits. It doesn't matter if you get anything. The  hunting is just the reason. It's a benefit if you're able to put something on  the table to eat."  </P> <P> Stephen Phillips, 12, of Downey said: "They don't sell pheasant in the markets.  You've gotta go out and hunt 'em."  </P> <P> Each youngster needed to be accompanied by a parent. For most, it was a father.  Phillips was there with his mother, Irene, a lifelong hunter.  </P> <P> "What's wrong?" she asked, looking around. "Don't any women hunt anymore?"  </P> <P> Sara Autry will be one. She already has a sound hunting ethic, largely fostered  by her grandfather, Bud Clinton of Anaheim, who taught her to safely handle a  single-shot .22 when she was 8. She isn't too squeamish to clean her own game.  She cleaned about 100 fish on a large family outing last summer.  </P> <P> She got her 20-gauge Winchester for her 10th birthday.  </P> <P> "A lot of my friends didn't believe that," she said.  </P> <P> With the wisdom and idiom of her 13 years, she said: "People have been hunting,  like, forever, not just to kill but to survive. Whatever I catch, I'm gonna  eat."  </P> <P> The youngsters were given the same safety course adult hunters must take to get  a license.  </P> <P> "It's tougher because you're dealing with a youngster who may not understand  all the words," Wheeler said. "But we don't compromise the program because of a  child's age.  </P> <P> "These kids all show a healthy respect for firearms. You won't have the  shooting accident in the home after the classes they've gone through."  </P> <P> Raahauge said: "Just the world we live in, I think everybody ought to take a  hunter-safety course. There are guns everywhere. People ought to be familiar  with them, even if they never shoot 'em."  </P> <P> Before the hunt, Raahauge cautioned: "Let those birds get up and way over your  head before you start shooting."  </P> <P> Wheeler reminded them -- probably for the umpteenth time: "Ninety-nine percent  of hunting accidents are not accidents. They're pure stupidity."  </P> <P> Before driving to the fields, guide Del Pettengill reminded all: "Chambers  open."  </P> <P> The one-day course covers outdoor survival, how to clean game and the safe  handling of a weapon -- unloaded in a vehicle (that's the law) and when  climbing through a fence or over awkward obstacles. And the safety on at all  times.  </P> <P> "There is no need for you to take that safety off that firearm until you're  absolutely ready to take the shot," Wheeler said. "It's like wearing seat  belts. If you're taught young enough that that's accepted procedure, you won't  have a problem with it in later life.  </P> <P> "You keep the finger outside the trigger guard and up alongside the stock of  the weapon. When it comes times to shoot, the finger comes down and hits the  safety and follows on through to hit the trigger. If you teach 'em that from  Day 1, they get real good at it.  </P> <P> "Anything that will delay that shot will give you a little bit more time to  look and see what's going on. You want the bird to get up and clear the dog. So  you spook the bird, the bird flies, you bring your finger down and click off  the safety, you put your finger on the trigger. By that time the bird has  cleared the dog and also is committed into which way he's gonna go fly -- in a  safe direction or not."  </P> <P> Wheeler wasn't concerned about the few girls in the group.  </P> <P> "I don't know what it is about a female hunter, but she seems to be more  meticulous and very serious," he said.  </P> <P> Before entering the field, Clinton reminded his granddaughter: "Remember, left  foot forward, boxer's stance . . . "  </P> <P> "I know, Grandpa," Sara replied.  </P> <P> Lining up her first pheasant along the barrel, she took all of the lessons into  account. Gun up, safety off, track -- bang.  </P> <P> Feathers flew. It all happened very fast.  </P> <P> "Pretty cool," she said afterward. "Pretty cool."  </P></p>

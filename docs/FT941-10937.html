			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Great bull run may have lost steam - International Many analysts on Wall Street believe that when the Federal Reserve raised its Fed funds rate target to 3 1/4 per cent on Friday from 3 per cent, bond traders sensed that the end had finally come. The end, that is, of a bull run in the US Treasury market which has lasted more than three years. The rally has exceeded the expectations of analysts, many of whom were calling the end of the bull market a year ago. It is not unexpected: 10-year US bond yields backed up  1/2 a point at the end of last year, as strong economic data convinced traders that a change in Fed policy was on the way. Friday's move may have been the first of several policy tightenings designed to head off the threat of inflation. Mr Dick Hoey, a fund manager at mutual funds group Dreyfus, says: 'It could very easily be a two-stage, 50-basis point rise.' Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, brokerage firm, believe the next move could come soon. Investors should 'be wary of a further move within the next few weeks to 3 1/2 per cent'. Another Wall Street house, Salomon Brothers, expects even bigger rate increases by the Fed, arguing that 'money market rates and short-term bond yields will be pushed higher in the next few months as robust economic growth data will justify additional tightening moves that could total 50-75 basis points by mid-year'. While the prospect of further tightening is bound to trigger a sell-off, the longer-term outlook, given continued low-inflation, is favourable for long-dated bonds. Salomon believes that upward momentum in long-term Treasury yields will stall, because investors are likely to adopt the view that the Fed's vigilant stance against inflation is positive for the bond market. Longer-dated government securities are less likely to suffer from a concerted sell-off following further rate rises because bonds have been sold heavily in recent months in anticipation of such a move. However, Mr John Lipsky, Salomon's chief economist, says it may be some time before the benefit of the Fed's actions begin to show through in lower bond yields. 'This move helps set the stage for an ultimate return of long-term interest rates, at least in my opinion, to back below 6 per cent. But that's not likely to occur anytime soon. Quite the contrary, if we're right about the economic data, over the next few months the risks lie on the other side  -of higher long-term interest rates.' Almost everyone agrees that, after several years of a steep yield curve, the gap between short and long yields will start to close. Mr Dennis Bushe, managing director of Prudential Investment Advisors, says 'longer term, there will be a flattening of the yield curve' because markets will gain confidence from the Fed's pre-emptive strike. Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Securities in Chicago, is another who believes that last week's rate rise is positive for longer-dated government securities. 'It protects the long-end from having a blow out on the upside. I think if the Fed hadn't tightened you would have seen long bond yields rising. I think you'd have seen the bond market vigilantes riding it.' The negative knock-on effect on the European bond markets could prove relatively short-lived. True, since the US economic cycle is ahead of Europe's, the US market offers a taste of things to come. But the fact remains that the US and Europe are at quite different points in the economic cycle, and the start of Fed tightening, when European governments are expected to ease further, means that it no longer makes sense for European bonds to track the US market. 'We are going to decouple,' said Mr Kit Juckes, international economist at S. G. Warburg. He believes real interest rates in the US had fallen too low. For example, real short-term rates in the US are below 1 per cent compared with 2 1/2 per cent in the UK. The Fed move leaves room for further tightening of spreads between European bond markets and the US Treasury markets. In the current low yield environment, these spread-trades are likely to become an increasingly common feature of investment management strategy.</p>

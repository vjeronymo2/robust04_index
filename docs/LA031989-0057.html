			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'MEANING OF ROE VS. WADE'  </P> <P> In your editorial "Meaning of Roe vs. Wade" (March 10), you wrote " . . . What  is at stake in the case: American women may no longer be protected by law if  they decide, for whatever reason, to end a pregnancy by having an abortion."  This statement needs clarification:  </P> <P>  -- They decide, i.e., choice.  </P> <P>  -- Whatever reason, i.e., don't want the baby.  </P> <P>  -- End a pregnancy, i.e., destroy a child.  </P> <P> What the woman chooses to abort is not a part of her own body. Biologically the  zygote is a separate entity from the mother. It has a different blood supply,  and may have a different blood type. It has a different heredity, only partly  derived from its mother.  </P> <P> Pushing back to the earliest state of this development in the womb, an expert  biologist can distinguish a human embryo from that of any other animal by its  anatomical features. All biologists know that each species has its own DNA,  (the collection of genetic molecules in the zygote), which determines the  details of the heredity of the individual.  </P> <P> We know it is human from the moment of conception.  </P> <P> The embryo is alive and it is human. Therefore, it has human life. Human life  has to be in a human body, as tiny as it is in its beginning. This alive human  body must have a human spirit, i.e., a human soul. It is a human being.  </P> <P> REV. JOSEPH O'GARA, S.J.  </P> <P> Ventura  </P></p>

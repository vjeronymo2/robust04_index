			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Appeal for UN help over Afghans RUSSIA and the Central Asian republics have appealed to the UN to mediate, and to send observers to the Tajik-Afghan border, in an attempt to end Afghan attacks on a strategic border of the Commonwealth of Independent States. At a weekend summit to discuss the Tajik crisis, Russian President Boris Yeltsin failed to extract specific commitments from his Central Asian partners for a joint peace-keeping force. So far, the brunt of peace-keeping has been carried by the Russian army, with help from Uzbekistan and a single battalion from Kyrgyzstan. The president of Turkmenistan, which plans to operate alone economically and politically by relying on vast reserves of natural gas, did not attend the meeting. Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan endorsed, with Russia, a vague statement that they would respond appropriately if attacks were to continue, and that Tajikistan would receive more military and humanitarian assistance. The foreign ministers of the five countries appealed to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, for mediation to pave the way for talks with Afghanistan. They also asked the UN Security Council to send observers to the border and to examine urgently a crisis combining attacks from Afghanistan and civil war in Tajikistan. Meanwhile, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the leader of Georgia, another war-torn republic south of Russia, found himself the sole master of the local combination of economic mess and civil war, his cabinet having been forced out of office by parliament on Friday. Mr Shevardnadze, adding the premiership to his already dominant role as head of state, claimed Georgia faced extinction unless emergency powers were concentrated in his hands.</p>

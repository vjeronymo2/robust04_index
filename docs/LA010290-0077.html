Officers Brian Smith and Tom Sayles tried to stop Mark Ivey, 28, as he drove  eastbound on Casa Loma Drive about 1:15 a.m., CHP dispatcher Linda Stevens  said.  </P> <P> Ivey did not stop his pickup truck, so the officers pursued him until he  stopped in his driveway in the Rexland Acres area, Stevens said. As Officers  Ken Perez and Victor Lacey arrived to join Smith and Sayles, Ivey pulled out an  assault rifle resembling an Uzi and fired at least one round at the officers,  Stevens said. All four of the officers returned fire.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Captain 1st Rank V. Luzgin and Retired </F> Captain 1st Rank, Lecturer S. Smirnov, under the rubric:  "Questions of Theory": "Electronic Support to Combat Command and  Control"]    [Text] Electronic situation coverage occupies a special  place in the series of measures for the support of command and  control of combat and everyday activities of naval ships. The  sphere of its operation extends in space from the surface of the  sea to its bottom, on the one hand, and to near space, on the  other hand.    At the present time, various guiding documents and official  publications contain a certain inconsistency in the  interpretation of the concept "electronic support", including  the electronic situation coverage process as the initial  component of this type of support. At the same time, there are  certain theoretical and practical accumulations here. As a  result, normalization of the existing views is becoming an  urgent task. In our opinion, we can most graphically present the  entire process of electronic situation coverage in the form of  the structural diagrams that are depicted in Figures 1, 2 and 3.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-18A>           Figure 1. A Graphic Algorithm of the </FIG>       It is customary to proceed from the fact that, as shown in  Figure 1, this process objectively consists of the successive  resolution of the following missions at any level of command and  control (of a ship and its weapons, a task group, a task force,  etc.):    1. Continuous surveillance of the surrounding situation,  using electronic detection and identification systems, that  consists of three stages -- target search, target detection and  identification and also target tracking during a specific period  of time.    2. Gathering information on the situation and the reciprocal  exchange of information among task force (task group) ships and  also with external sources via radio nets and radio lines of  automated VZOI systems. There are two stages present here:  Gathering information on the situation from internal ship  sources and the reciprocal exchange of information with other  sources.    3. Processing all initial information that has been obtained  on the situation (What? Where? In what quantity detected?);  contact plotting (electronic tracking) of target movement with  detection of target motion and maneuvering and formation of the  target history in MRO systems or in STsVS [specialized digital  computer system] in BIUS [Combat Information Command and Control  System] loops or in BITs of ships; identification of all  information on the situation and depiction of models of tactical  situations with their extrapolation for the immediate future.  That is, operational data is divided into three stages --  initial, secondary and tertiary processing of information on the  situation.    4. Analysis of the situation that has developed in the BITs  of ships. (An assessment of mutual location, target motion and  maneuvering, and detection of the composition of the enemy  forces is the first stage; discovery of the operating tactics,  the degree of threat and the enemy's intentions is the second  stage).    5. A report from the BITs of ships and presentation of the  initial and processed, analyzed information on the situation to  the command authorities in graphic form on ARM [automated work  station] screens; to the GKPs [Primary Control Station] of  ships, the command posts of task forces, and to other command  posts -- consumers of information on the situation. The initial  abbreviated report with the information: What has been detected  and is being observed, the numerical composition of the group  targets and where they are located -- coordinate data; a more  precise report with indication of certain target motion and  maneuvering parameters; and, finally, a complete report with the  addition of target tactical composition, the proposed nature of  operations and the degree of threat, and revealed enemy  intentions.    Based upon the theoretical bases that assume the gradual  nature of the resolution of each electronic situation coverage  mission that is depicted in Figure 1, the algorithm reveals  existing communications and dependence between the stages  examined above and displays a definite symmetry in the dynamics  of its implementation.    Based upon the results of the electronic situation coverage,  information processing support must be attained using the MRO  systems, combat information command and control system loops,  BITs equipment or PU-N recommendations. Taking these into  account, the Primary Control Station and other command posts of  ships or the task group or task force command post make  decisions on the command and control of the electronic situation  coverage systems themselves, electronic jamming systems, weapons  systems, ships, task forces and coordinating forces. The process  of carrying out each of the possible decisions also entails a  number of consecutive conditional stages. The majority of these  stages, in turn, require electronic support through the  utilization of target identification and target designation  systems and schemes, weapons fire control systems, electronic  warfare systems, shipborne aircraft take off, flight, vectoring  and landing control systems, diagrams and shipborne combat  information command and control system loops, navigational  radars, etc. The composition of the command and control  missions, based upon which the recommendations indicated above  can be developed according to the electronic situation coverage  and also the primary stages of electronic support of the  resolution of these missions is shown in Figure 2.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-19A>           Figure 2. Recommendations for Combat </FIG>       Consequently, based upon electronic situation coverage, we  can totally achieve the required level of electronic support of  command and control during combat and everyday activities of  ships and task forces (Fig. 3) ONLY as a result of ALL of the  examined processes. What has been set forth above is called upon  to ameliorate to a certain extent the existing inconsistencies  in understanding and interpreting the issues of "electronic  support" and "electronic situation coverage".   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-011-20A>           Figure 3. The Content of Electronic </FIG>       In conclusion, it is appropriate to point out that the  examined provisions can be accepted as a sort of methodological  basis of the scientific and academic discipline being formed --  "Electronic Support of the Command and Control of Ships, Their  Weapons, and Coordinating Forces". In our opinion, this  discipline must follow the content and patterns of the  resolution of various electronic situation coverage missions and  electronic support of combat command and control on the whole  and, through its stages, the patterns of interrelationships and  the dependencies of these stages. The development of  recommendations of a technical and organizational context for  the effective electronic support of combat command and control  of naval ships and task forces must be its practical solution.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by S. Beric: "The Guards Have Gone, the Company Has </F> Remained"]    [Text] Erdut, 25 April -- While the Serbian Volunteer  Guards [SDG] of Zeljko Arkan Raznatovic were on the territory of  the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK] and its main body was  stationed at the training center in Erdut, a gasoline station  was built at the approach to Erdut, a new commercial building  was built, and Dafina Milanovic promised additional investments.    A firm named Dafiment Centar was established in a joint  venture with Dafina Milanovic, and Dafina Milanovic herself  visited Erdut twice, where she met representatives of the RSK  government. In the presence of then RSK president Goran Hadzic  and Zeljko Arkan Raznatovic, she promised to invest large  amounts to update industrial and agricultural production,  primarily on the territory of eastern Slavonia and western Srem.    Following the well-known events that befell Dafiment Bank,  there was no longer any talk about any investment, but the  business facility at the entrance to Erdut was entirely  completed. However, when the training center in Erdut was  abandoned, and when the SDG left the territory of the RSK,  especially after the feature article published in DUGA and  certain statements by Dafina Milanovic, stories emerged in  public about the fate of the facility that had been built, about  its origin, about its present owner, and so on.    Various stories began to circulate in the local population  even before the SDG left Erdut. According to some, the investors  and owners of the facility no longer wanted even a financial  presence in the RSK, and they were looking for a buyer for that  facility to recoup at least some of their money. According to  others, the owners of the facility had up to that point already  been making maximum use of their presence in the RSK and had  derived financial gain, so that the fate of the facility was not  even very important to them. However, Stojan Novakovic, who owns  90 percent of the shares and is president of the SDG Company in  Erdut, categorically denies all such stories.    "The SDG is the Guards, and SDG Company is a company, and  there is no connection between them," says Stojan Novakovic.  "The company is registered with the economic court of the RSK in  Beli Manastir as SDG Company Erdut, Joint-Stock Company. With  its presence in this area, the company plans to work for  improvement of the RSK economy by changing the old style of  economic management, above all in agriculture. The company has a  plan for doing that, but real economic relations have not yet  evolved in Krajina, above all because of the danger of war and  battles between political parties."    According to Stojan Novakovic, the SDG Company began in 1992  to build a business facility and invested more than $3 million  in it. This is a business facility consisting of a gasoline  station with a capacity of 400,000 liters, a railroad junction  immediately alongside the facility, and a commercial building  built to all European standards with 2,300 square meters of  floor space. The commercial building itself, according to Stojan  Novakovic, consists of a production shop with an area of 760  square meters intended for wood manufacturing, and then a large  warehouse and office with an area of 760 square meters. There  are also a duty-free shop, a restaurant, and a bank in the  building, and the entire project is appraised at $10 million.    "In a joint investment Dafina Milanovic and I established  the  firm Dafiment Centar, but Mrs. Milanovic did not fulfill all her  obligations," says Stojan Novakovic. "Under the contract Mrs.  Milanovic was supposed to invest $3 million. We will continue to  invest, but as for the funds and debts of Mrs. Milanovic, we  will have to talk about that with her and straighten out  relations."    Stojan Novakovic, the company's president and investor, says  that he plans to build a greenhouse with an area of 40 hectares  in the vicinity of geothermal springs, where he will be  concerned with plant genetics and the development of new  varieties of highly profitable farm products. The president of  this company also says that he personally did the design of the  free trade zone and port in Vukovar and that he is ready to  offer business associates the best terms for construction of the  zone. In a very short time the duty-free shop, bank, restaurant,  production shop, and warehouse will also begin to operate in the  new commercial building in Erdut.    "I am saying all this because certain political parties and  individuals, pursuing their own petty political points, misuse  construction of this business facility, referring to us all as  war profiteers," Stojan Novakovic says. "But I wonder whether  any war profiteer invested $3 million in an unsafe area. If I  had built this facility on the Belgrade-Novi Sad highway, I  would have had 1,000 times more traffic, and the facility would  have been worth 50 times more. Once again I put the question --  is that war profiteering or patriotism?"</p>

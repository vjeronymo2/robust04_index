			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Jan (NA) -- President Carlos Menem  today blamed the appearance of the self-styled Zapatista  National Liberation Army (EZLN) in the southern Mexican state of  Chiapas on "the presence of many mercenaries and professional  subversives."    He also denied the charges pressed by six Mexican human  rights organizations of the alleged genocide of civilians,  wondering "what could be done if when subversion takes to arms,  those who are killing people are said to be preserving human  rights."    "Our interpretation is the same we had for the subversion in  Argentina, even though the situation is not similar and has  deeper connotations, such as the ethnical side. In Argentina,  subversion tried to reach power after the declaration of  liberated zones such as that in Tucuman," the president said.    In a conversation with journalists accredited to Government  House, Menem said the situation in Mexico was not "improvised,  because even if at the beginning it appeared to be something  unplanned, it was later seen that the EZLN was well organized."    The president admitted that "displeasure" is the main reason  for the creation of subversive organizations that "take  advantage of this to engage in something broader, which does not  meet the people's demands and which upsets legal order."</p>

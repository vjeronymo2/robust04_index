			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Boeing net earnings set to drop Boeing, the US aircraft manufacturer, forecast that its operating margins would be largely maintained in 1994, positioning it for the next expansion cycle, Reuter reports from Seattle. In its annual report it added that corporate net earnings would fall as a result of declining sales and research and defence expenditures that will increase from last year's Dollars 1.7bn level. The group again warned that it expected sales to fall in 1994 to around Dollars 21bn from Dollars 25.4bn as aircraft deliveries continue to decline, reflecting the downturn in the world travel market, Sales at its defence unit should rise by about 10 per cent over the Dollars 4.4bn level of 1993 because of the company's recent designation by the space agency Nasa as prime contractor for the space station. Because of higher R&amp;D expenses, mainly on the 777 commercial jet and a next-generation 737, 'there will be a significant decline in net earnings as a per cent of sales for 1994', Boeing said. It predicted that the world air travel market would grow at an average annual rate of slightly more than 5 per cent until 2010, creating a total world market for commercial jets of about Dollars 800bn over the next 16 years.</p>

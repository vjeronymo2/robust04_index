DPR&hyph;33, DPR&hyph;52, DPR&hyph;68, DPR&hyph;77, DPR&hyph;79. These licenses are issued to the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for operation of the Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant Units 1, 2 and 3 (BFN) located in Limestone County, Alabama, and the Sequoyah Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (SQN) located in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee. In addition, by this action, the Commission is considering issuing a similar exemption to TVA's Watts Bar Nuclear Plant Units 1 and 2 (WBN) located at TVA's site on the west bank of the Tennessee River approximately 50 miles northeast of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Operating licensers have not been issued for WBN; they are currently under Construction Permits CPPR&hyph;91 and CPPR&hyph;92, for Units 1 and 2 respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> Environmental Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> Identification of Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The proposed action is in accordance with the TVA's application dated October 24, 1994, for exemption from certain requirements of 10 CFR 73.55, ``Requirements for Physical Protection of Licensed Activities in Nuclear Power Reactors Against Radiological Sabotage.'' The exemption would allow implementation of a hand geometry biometrics system to control site access at BFN, SQN, and WBN so that photograph identification badges for non-TVA employees who have been granted unescorted access into protected and vital areas may be taken offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 73.55, paragraph (a), TVA shall establish and maintain an onsite physical protection system and security organization. Regulation 10 CFR 73.55(d), ``Access Requirements,'' paragraph (1), specifies that ``licensee shall control all points of personnel and vehicle access into a protected area.'' Regulation 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) specifies that, ``A numbered picture badge identification system shall be used for all individuals who are authorized access to protected areas without escort.'' Regulation 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5) also states that an individual not employed by the licensee (i.e., contractors) may be authorized access to protected areas without escort provided the individual ``receives a picture badge upon entrance into the protected area which must be returned upon exit from the protected area. *&blank;*&blank;*'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, unescorted access into protected areas of BFN and SQN (with plans to establish a similar system at WBN) plants is controlled through the use of a photograph on a badge/keycard (hereafter referred to as a ``badge''), which is stored at the access point when not in use. The security officers at each entrance station use the photograph on the badge to visually identify the individual requesting access. The badges for both TVA employees and contractor personnel who have been granted unescorted access are given to the individuals at the entrance location upon entry and are returned upon exit. In accordance with 10 CFR 73.55(d)(5), the badges are not allowed to be taken offsite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

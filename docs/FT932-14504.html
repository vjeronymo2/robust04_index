			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Donors 'undermine their efforts' by tying aid to companies at home AID donors are undermining their own efforts to help developing countries by tying their assistance to requirements that goods or services be procured from companies in their own countries, the World Bank warns, George Graham reports from Washington. Such donors, the bank believes, could generate another Dollars 4bn a year of benefits for the third world by untying their aid. Tied aid is meant to help domestic employment and exports, but may have little effect in the donor country, the bank argues. 'The lobbying of individual sectors or business firms in the donor country for directed subsidies is a more rational, if less laudable, explanation for tying,' it concludes, in its annual review: Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries. For the recipient country, however, the direct cost may be more than 15 per cent of the aid given. 'Untying all aid flows would generate economic benefits to developing countries of as much as Dollars 4bn per year, which equals one-fifth of the nominal increase in aid flows over the past decade,' the World Bank says. Some improvement has occurred: 44 per cent of aid was tied in 1989, and 7 per cent partially untied, compared with 48 per cent tied and 12 per cent partially untied in 1977-1979. A further improvement in the percentage is likely as a result of the agreement last year by industrialised nations to abide by new guidelines by way of limiting the use of mixed credits, which combine aid, export credits and non-concessional loans.</p>

He disagreed with a news agency report that a passport had  been seized from the accused "Ivan L." because he had refused  the summons of the police corps investigator for quite a long  time. Lexa said he had been deprived of his travel documents  because of the character of his criminal activities and not  because he had refused the summons.    Slovak Alien and Passport Police seized the documents from  Lexa in connection with the accusation of defamation of the  state and its representative. Lexa is alleged to have cast  doubt on the morals of President Michal Kovac and his  professional capabilities due to his age.    According to Slovak Radio, Lexa's lawyer lodged a complaint  against the defamation charge and demanded that it be labelled  as illegal.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Subcommander Marcos of the EZLN by </F> David Aponte and Matilde Perez U. in Chiapas; date not given]    [Excerpts] Lacandona Jungle, Chiapas State, 15 Mar --  Subcommander Marcos, of the Zapatist National Liberation Army  [EZLN], has reported that his organization will not initiate any  warlike action and will stop all "warlike advancements"  regardless of the results of the discussions for an honorable  peace.    He categorically stated that the EZLN will not unilaterally  open fire in spite of provocations against the peace process by  farm owners and ranchers in Chiapas. He noted: "If the farm  owners do not take a military initiative against us, we will not  take one against them because the Indian Revolutionary  Clandestine Committee decided on its own to respect the August  elections process."    Marcos explained: "At this moment political work is above  military actions, and our watchword to the communities of the  region and to all the country is: `Here we are! This is our  call now.'"    Marcos was interviewed in a rebel military operations  center.  The subcommander spoke about his military strategies and  tactics, the social support his movement enjoys in the  communities, and governing the rebel-controlled zones for the  past two years. [passage omitted]    [LA JORNADA] Is the EZLN surrounded by the federal Army in  the jungle?    [Marcos] In a military sense, yes, our forces are  surrounded.  We cannot make any offensive movement or muster big or small  units of troops or try an offensive like the 1 January one. But  we maintain a defensive position, and we are in our territory.  We are trained for this. When we withdrew after the attacks on  the municipalities, we adopted this position.    [LA JORNADA] Has this cease-fire period represented a  military advantage for the Mexican Army? Have they located you?  Were you prepared for this phase?    [Marcos] We are. When the cease-fire came on 12 January the  federal Army said to itself: "I have located them. I have their  barracks and their communications centers, and I am ready to  bomb them," and it did. They bombed several of our positions  even after the cease-fire order had been given and later argued  that the troops did not know about the cease-fire. What  happened is that the Army already had complete military  intelligence reports and then planned to definitely push us out  of the towns into the mountains and then engage in a  counterinsurgency phase, but now without the media being on top  of the Army.    Then the federal Army realized that the Zapatist positions  were, geographically speaking, in the center of rural towns.  The Army then decided, within the framework of the fabrication  that came out of the Persian Gulf war that it is possible to  wage war against a nation and to kill only the military without  harming the civilian population, that a surgical-type  annihilation would be easy. I imagine that the political cost of  this was estimated.    The government and the Army were bewildered. They wondered  who is really behind this movement. They looked at each other  out of the corners of their eyes wondering if the person at  their side could be the one sponsoring it. Then they decided to  go for the cease-fire and for the dialogue, to see who is behind  all this.    [LA JORNADA] What is the difference between the EZLN and  other guerrilla movements, such as those in Central America?  The EZLN seized some municipalities and then withdrew.    [Marcos] Yes, because our force is made up of peasants. We  have no forces in the cities. Of course the peasants can  control the cities and the roads militarily. They do not have  to attack cities to control them. The peasants may attack a  city to recover weapons, ammunition, or to do propaganda work.    We began our struggle with political work and with the  formation of militias in the towns for the self defense of  territories, but we do not have the capability to carry out  urban military actions. The truth is that those urban military  actions that took place during the armed conflict were the work  of other organizations. We had nothing to do with that.    The current EZLN stage is one of survival, and we have to  see  that no life is lost, in the best of cases, and that this allows  us to keep our territory to survive as a combatant force.    Another objective is to receive the support of the people,  who have told us: "Do not surrender the weapons." First they  used to say: "Talk, make peace." Later they said: "Talk, but do  not believe in what the government says; do not surrender the  weapons because if they are going to give us something it is  because we are armed; if you put down your weapons, they will  give us nothing." We received this kind of advice from many  people.    [LA JORNADA] The interview was interrupted by a combatant  who  brought a message. Marcos concluded the interview with an  anecdote from General Francisco Villa.    [Marcos] His people used to ask him where he was going to  sleep, and he always named a place, but the next morning he  would wake up in a different site. He was afraid of being  betrayed."</p>

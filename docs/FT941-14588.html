			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Russian economy's prospects hinge on crisis talks Hopes of restoring confidence in the rouble and the Russian economy hinged last night on the possibility that the reformist finance minister Mr Boris Fyodorov might agree to stay on in the new government. After three days of crisis talks between President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, there were conflicting reports about Mr Fyodorov's position. While Interfax news agency said he would remain in the government, the minister still appeared to be standing by pre-conditions for staying on. He told the independent radio station Ekho Moskvy last night: 'I am not withdrawing my demands. I am not about to take any post if my conditions are not accepted.' These terms include a ministerial rank commensurate with the central position he accords to finance, and a cabinet commitment to a radical reform policy. According to Interfax, Mr Chernomyrdin, a political centrist, had refused to accept Mr Fyodorov's conditions, although the minister had dropped a demand that Mr Viktor Gerashchenko be relieved of his post as central bank chairman. Interfax also said that Mr Alexander Shokhin, like Mr Fyodorov a deputy premier in the present government, had accepted the post of economics minister. The indications were that Mr Oleg Soskovets, who is close to Mr Chernomyrdin and has taken a moderate path on reform, would retain his title as first deputy prime minister in the new cabinet with overall responsibility for industrial policy and possibly the economy. The doubts over Mr Fyodorov's future confirmed indications that forming a government was growing more difficult, as President Yeltsin fought to retain both him and a moderate reformer in Mr Shokhin at the levers of the country's economy. The markets are reacting badly to the sidelining of leading reformers. Amid a rapidly worsening financial position, the rouble yesterday again lost more than Rbs100 to the dollar to stand at Rbs1,607. Signs of panic began to appear in the banking community and the population. Queues again formed to exchange roubles for dollars in Moscow. The possibility that Mr Fyodorov might serve in the new cabinet indicates the continued commitment by the government and the president to at least the appearance of economic reform. It also shows the split in the liberal ranks after the weekend resignation of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister and leading reformer.

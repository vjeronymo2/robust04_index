			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Kuo Hung-chih (6753 1347 </F> 3112): "Unwilling To Serve as a 'Political Vase," CPPCC Fights  For More Real Power"]    [Text] "Political consultation should not remain at the  level of making one's position known!" "The Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is very important when  the session is held, but it disappears once the session is  over!" "The CPPCC should give more "belated advice!" "The  Government Report should be discussed by the CPPCC first!" "We  always visit upper houses of other countries when we make  overseas trips, the upper houses have voting rights but we do  not. To take part in political consultation, it is necessary to  have voting rights!"    Compared with past terms of the CPPCC, the Eighth CPPCC is  really different in many aspects. Former CPPCC chairman Li  Xiannian assumed office when he was 79. His membership of the  CPC Central Committee was forfeited before he took the CPPCC  chairmanship, and the CPPCC work was equivalent to a transition  to retirement. However, incumbent chairman Li Ruihuan is only 60  and he is also a member of the Political Bureau Standing  Committee of the CPC Central Committee, which holds real power.  For him, the CPPCC chairmanship is not, in any sense, a  transition to retirement. Li Ruihuan still has a promising  political future, but he does not really lay hold of any part of  the party, government, or military systems, so he is very eager  to rely on the base of the CPPCC to bring his political  influence into play.    Last year when he took over the CPPCC chairmanship, Li  Ruihuan made a speech which was full of fighting will at the  closing ceremony of the First Plenary Session of the Eighth  CPPCC and vigorously stated that it was necessary to give play  to the CPPCC's functions. His remarks were greeted with warm  applause by members who were present. At that time, many people  predicted that Li Ruihuan would reform the CPPCC. After a  year's time, the CPPCC cannot break away from its constraints in  the political structure and is still an organization for  "political participation and consultation" without real power,  but it is striving for more real power step by step.    In the past, special committees under the CPPCC were only  some united front organizations without real functions.  However, over the past year, Li Ruihuan reinforced the staffs  and enhanced the functions of the 15 CPPCC special committees  and devoted efforts to studying policy proposals. Policy  proposals put forward by the CPPCC are not legally binding on  government departments, but when the CPPCC special committees  started showing their strength, government departments did feel  the pressure.    This year, what CPPCC members have taken delight in talking  about is that a report submitted by the CPPCC Economic Committee  last June was accepted by government departments and it formed a  part of macroscopic regulation. Li Luye, spokesman of the  current session, also pointed out that over the past year, there  was a growing trend that study reports submitted by the CPPCC  were accepted by government decision-making departments.    Under all these conditions, many CPPCC members have shown a  strong intention to strive for legal status similar to that of  upper houses in foreign countries. If the CPPCC can make a  breakthrough on this, it will certainly be a great revolution in  the CPC's constitutional system. As far as the reform of the  constitutional system is concerned, a considerable number of  factors are involved, and it cannot be achieved overnight, but  CPPCC Chairman Li Ruihuan is undoubtedly a key factor in  determining the result of the reform. If he merely treats the  CPPCC as a stepping-stone, it will not be easy to achieve  success in the CPPCC's structural reform. Yesterday, at the  CPPCC group discussion, CPPCC member Zhao Jing said that he  hoped Li Ruihuan would work not only at the CPC Central  Committee office but also regularly at the CPPCC office.    Li Ruihuan must devote more efforts to the CPPCC if the  "vase" is really to be removed.</p>

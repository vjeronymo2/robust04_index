			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Mandela warns of need for change: S African business community 'will have to rise to challenges' Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress and the man likely to be South Africa's next president, said yesterday he did not believe South African businessmen could be trusted to develop a post-apartheid economy without state intervention. In a tough speech to the International Press Institute, meeting in Cape Town, Mr Mandela criticised the South African media for being white-dominated, and implied this would have to change under an ANC government. The senior editorial personnel of South African newspapers 'are white, they are male, they are from a middle-class background . . . the principal players in the media have no knowledge of the life experience of the (black) majority,' he said. The economy as a whole remained minority-dominated, and this had to change. 'We are convinced that left to their own devices, the South African business community will not rise to the challenges facing us,' Mr Mandela told more than 400 international editors and publishers. 'The objective of our policies is to create employment as our highest priority. While the democratic state will maintain and develop the market, we envisage occasions when it will be necessary for it to intervene where growth and development require such intervention.' One example would be affirmative action programmes to promote blacks and women. The ANC recently published a detailed economic programme calling for selected state intervention in the economy, coupled with private investment. ANC policy has always fudged the issue of how much state intervention would be required to achieve the ANC's development goals. No clarity on this issue is likely before April's all-race elections.

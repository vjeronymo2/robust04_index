			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Chancellor Franz Vranitzky by </F> Elmar Oberhauser; Vranitzky in Washington -- live]    [Excerpt] [Oberhauser] Good evening, Mr. Chancellor.    [Vranitzky] Hello, Mr. Oberhauser.    [Oberhauser] I begin with something that you have just  experienced. Mr. Chancellor, what was the talk with President  Clinton like, from your point of view?    [Vranitzky] From my point of view and, I think, also from  his point of view, it was a very good talk. We not only talked  about Bosnia, we not only talked about Bosnia's reconstruction  after the end of the disastrous war but we expressed common  views and will also prepare something for this purpose. We  talked about Partnership for Peace as a next step in Europe and  noted that Austria has already tackled a number of activities  before this idea came about. I told him that yesterday we were  in close contact with Congress in order to discuss the problem  of financing nuclear power plants in neighboring states once  more and we moved on with a message that was not bad at all. In  short, I also gave him advance notice of an invitation to make a  stopover in Vienna on his way to the CSCE summit in Budapest at  the end of the year.    [Oberhauser] Have you already received an answer to that?    [Vranitzky] Well, he said that he would like to accept this  invitation if political developments in the United States permit  it. This is an answer that one probably has to accept.    [Oberhauser] Mr. Chancellor, we are waiting here in suspense  for his television speech on Bosnia. What is his attitude on  this matter at the moment?    [Vranitzky] Within the next hour -- if it takes that long at  all -- you will hear his statements, and I would be grateful to  you if you concentrated on Clinton's original statements and did  not expect me to give you some sort of summary before the speech  is actually made.    [Oberhauser] After this talk, do you see any chance that  progress will be made, that there is indeed a path toward peace  in Bosnia?    [Vranitzky] Mr. Oberhauser, I see such a chance, but I would  have seen it also without this talk. However, my talk with  Clinton has confirmed my view, because it is inconceivable that  the international community ceases its efforts in view of  Gorazde. He told me that he had talked to Mitterand and Chretien  and with other NATO leaders and that he will continue to do so.  This means, he will develop a large-scale diplomatic and  political initiative. This is certainly indispensable and  correct and necessary.    [Oberhauser] How was your suggestion accepted to convene a  conference for the reconstruction of Bosnia in Vienna?    [Vranitzky] Positively.    [Oberhauser] With approval?    [Vranitzky] Yes, it was accepted with approval. [passage  omitted]</p>

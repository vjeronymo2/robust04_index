			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Athens casino licence awarded Greece has awarded an Athens casino licence to a Greek-South African consortium for Dr11bn (Dollars 45m). The casino, due to open at the end of 1995, will be managed by Sun International, owned by Ms Sol Kerzner, South African hotelier and casino operator. The consortium, in which Sun International has a 10 per cent stake, also agreed to invest Dollars 400m in building a 300-bed hotel, marina and conference centre on a waterfront site leased from the Greek state. The other participants are four Greek construction companies and Marracom, a Greek-backed investment company. The other shortlisted bidder for the project, the largest private investment in Greece for more than a decade, was London Clubs, the UK gaming concern, which offered Dr10.8bn for the 12-year licence. The tourism ministry postponed decision on a second casino licence as the only bidder, Hyatt Casino Corporation, gaming arm of the US hotel group, offered only Dr11bn to take over an existing state-owned casino at Mount Parnes outside Athens which was valued initially at more than Dr20bn. Hyatt earlier this year won a licence for a casino at Thessaloniki, northern Greece.</p>

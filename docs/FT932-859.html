			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Vineyard loses champagne ruling THE WORD 'champagne' must be taken off bottles of a fizzy, non-alcoholic drink being marketed as 'elderflower champagne', the Court of Appeal ruled yesterday. The court allowed an appeal by the French champagne producers, led by Taittinger, against a High Court ruling that although the label on the bottles of the elderflower drink was 'a misrepresentation calculated to deceive', the risk of damage to the reputation of genuine champagne would be nil or minimal. The French were granted injunctions banning Thorncroft, a Surrey-based vineyard, from 'passing off' its product by use of the word 'champagne' and from breaching European Community regulations designed to protect wine producers from the misleading use of their exclusive appellations. Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, said no one with knowledge of wine would be deceived by the elderflower drink, even though it was sold in champagne-style bottles with wired corks. However, any product which was not champagne that was allowed to describe itself as such must 'inevitably erode the singularity and exclusiveness of the description 'champagne', and so cause damage of an insidious but serious kind'. Sir Thomas said Thorncroft was anxious to use the word champagne because it imported 'nuances of quality and celebration, a sense of something privileged and special. But this is the reputation which the champagne houses have built up over the years and in which they have a property right.' Allbev and Thorncroft Vineyard, which make and market the elderflower drink, plan to appeal to the Lords.</p>

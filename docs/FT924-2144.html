			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Reform hope in balance as Russia names new PM 'THE difference between a reformer not able to reform and a non-reformer who can do some reforms may not be very great.' This evaluation from a foreign expert in Moscow of the change in prime minister from the reforming Mr Yegor Gaidar to the non-reforming Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin was the most positive given yesterday. The foreign response has so far been cautious - reflecting a view that Mr Gaidar himself had been unable to stem the ballooning budget deficit and inflation spiral, and that a replacement need not necessarily be worse. This contrasts sharply with the views of Mr Gaidar's circle: one aide last night went so far as to question whether democracy could continue. Observers and advisers in Moscow gave a variety of reasons yesterday why Mr Gaidar's resignation and Mr Chernomyrdin's election do not constitute a disaster for Russia. First, Mr Chernomyrdin knows the system, and could force closures and restructuring of inefficient enterprises where Mr Gaidar and his inexperienced team could not. Second, Mr Chernomyrdin's promise to deepen reform while seeking to slow the fall in production and increase social security is merely repeating promises made by Mr Gaidar. Third, unless he re-establishes the command-administrative system, he faces the same financial and other constraints Mr Gaidar faced; if he ignores these, the financial system will collapse. Many in Moscow believe reform can begin only after such a collapse. Fourth, Mr Gaidar could not achieve financial stability, and under his premiership, the rouble was heading for hyperinflation. It is better for it to get there under someone else. Fifth, Mr Chernomyrdin is not, at 54, old for a prime minister, but has been unwell recently, and needs constant treatment. He has little or no popular base, and is explicitly not President Yeltsin's choice. He does not seem to be a long-term candidate. A possible sixth reason is that it is simply not clear why Mr Gaidar went. His advisers were saying this weekend they were prepared for him to be replaced as prime minister, but that he would stay as head of economic reform. Mr Yeltsin was clear that he would support him. Mr Yeltsin could have nominated Mr Gaidar who came in the top three in a ballot by the Congress. If this nomination was not confirmed by the deputies, Mr Yeltsin could simply have appointed him acting prime minister for a further three months. By this time the referendum on a new constitution would be imminent and, if approved, a new parliament would have been elected. The political fallout may be immediately greater than the economic one. The democrats, supporters of Mr Yeltsin, were terribly let down: Father Gleb Yankunin, a leading radical deputy, said yesterday: 'After we did everything to provide Yeltsin with a winning position, he let us down.' Mr Leonid Volkov, another presidential supporter, said it was 'the end of a reforming cabinet - at the choice of the President'. He has now, it seems, put himself in the hands of the 'centre', an amorphous group inside Congress and out, which includes real reformers and real opponents of reform. Those who want change are disoriented and puzzled about Mr Yeltsin's intentions. The departure of all of the key ministers, including figures like Mr Anatoly Chubais and Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime ministers in charge of privatisation and foreign economic relations respectively, could deal a blow to reform and to the fragile trust of foreign businessmen and governments.

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Richmond Oil accounts qualified as losses mount AUDITORS have qualified the accounts of Richmond Oil &amp; Gas, the natural resource group which yesterday reported a dramatic increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 795,000 to Pounds 43.9m for the year to March 31. Touche Ross, which signed off the delayed results yesterday, said Richmond's ability to continue trading would depend on asset disposals. Furthermore, the accountants stated, there were 'uncertainties' as to the value of some intangible and tangible properties. Mr Robert Fox, Richmond's chairman, said the group's future depended on the sale of its coal bed methane interests. He added, however, that he was confident the company could be returned to profit. The company narrowly escaped a qualification last year by announcing the sale of the coal bed properties in September. However, a dispute over mineral rights prevented completion in April. Richmond had received some Dollars 12.6m of the agreed Dollars 20m price. Mr Fox said Richmond had to complete a deal on some of the remaining San Juan methane properties in the next 60 days. He added that Richmond was also intending to sell a stake of more than 50 per cent in its joint venture in Siberia. Losses last year were magnified by the foreclosure on Richmond Ranch, purchased just two years ago for Dollars 80m. The company took an exceptional charge of Pounds 37m as a result. Mr Fox admitted that, with hindsight, Richmond had over paid. Richmond also took a Pounds 4.8m write-down on its Texas Panhandle properties. Restructuring costs brought the total exceptional charge to Pounds 43.1m. Operating losses jumped 87 per cent to Pounds 347,000 on sales 51 per cent ahead at Pounds 11.4m. The loss per share was 48p (1p). Richmond also announced a management reshuffle, with Mr Fox becoming chief executive. Mr David Wilkinson would resign as joint managing director to become chief executive of the Russian venture. The board had decided not to send Mr Wilkinson to Siberia. He will be based in London and remains an executive director. The SFO inquiry into aspects surrounding Richmond's 1989 flotation continues.</p>

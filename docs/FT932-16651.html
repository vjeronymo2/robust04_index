			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Report endorses private prison WOLDS, Britain's first privately managed prison for nearly 200 years, combines successful features with causes for concern, a Prison Reform Trust report says today. The trust says that available evidence about Wolds, opened on Humberside a year ago to accommodate remand prisoners, 'contradicts both the view of the apologists for privatisation and the wilder claims of the prison's critics'. It says the prison, managed under a Home Office contract by Group 4 Remand Services, offers prisoners up to 14 hours a day out of their cells and better entitlement to visits than comparable prisons. Staff generally treated inmates in a 'just, fair and humane way' and were responsive to reasonable requests. But, says the report, the level of incidents and disturbances at Wolds was worse than national averages. Use of drugs by prisoners was a problem in many prisons, but the trust understood that at Wolds the level of the problem was 'alarming and getting worse'. Public accountability was hindered by the fact that financial details of Group 4's contract with the Home Office were confidential. 'The company is not required to produce an annual report to the Home Office and, if it was, presumably this too would have been secret. In any event, proper value-for-money comparisons cannot be made.' A second privately managed prison, Blakenhurst, Hereford and Worcester, is about to open, and later this month ministers will consider public and private bids to run Strangeways prison in Manchester. Bids to manage the new Doncaster prison, and possibly others, are likely to be invited later this year. Wolds Remand Prison: A First Year Report, PRT, 59 Caledonian Road, London N1 9BU.

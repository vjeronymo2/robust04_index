			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Item from roundup of ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, ITAR-TASS reports </F> under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" rubric: "Far Easterners  Discuss Incentives"]    [Text] A draft presidential edict "On Special Measures in  Managing the Socioeconomic Development of the Far East and  Transbaykal in 1994-1995" was discussed yesterday at a session  of the Interregional Association for Economic Collaboration  Between Federation Components in the Far East and Transbaykal.    Territory leaders believe that it is essential to set  uniform  electricity and heat tariffs for Siberia and the Far East, to  recompense from the budget 50 percent of the expenditure  incurred both on importing fuel and foodstuffs into the region  and on exporting produce made here, and to repay the debt owed  by the federal budget to state sector enterprises. The draft  also provides for restrictions on tax deductions from profits,  and customs and tax incentives.</p>

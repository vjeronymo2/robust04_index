			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE 'TALKING' AT MCEG IS NOW ABOUT WHAT'S NEXT  </P> <P> With an impressive $127 million in box office grosses, the sleeper hit movie  "Look Who's Talking" has helped a little-known independent film company in more  ways than one.  </P> <P> The film proved that Management Co. Entertainment Group, the movie's producer,  was capable of more than art-house fare. It resuscitated the career of John  Travolta, a key MCEG client and the film's star.  </P> <P> And it established the credibility of MCEG's chief executive, a flamboyant  young lawyer named Jonathan D. Krane, who arranged the production deal with the  film's owner-distributor, Tri-Star Pictures.  </P> <P> For MCEG, now comes the hard part.  </P> <P> Four months after the success that put it on the map, the Santa Monica concern  is looking for follow-up hits, hustling to refinance a pile of debt and trying  to quiet persistent industry talk that with rapid growth has come internal  dissension and disarray.  </P> <P> "This is a critical time for them," says Dennis McAlpine, analyst with the  Oppenheimer &amp; Co. investment bank in New York. "They've got a hit behind  them, and a lot of questions ahead."  </P> <P> In some ways, MCEG's story illustrates the predicament now faced by most  independent movie companies. After booming growth through much of the 1980s,  Hollywood's smaller film production and distribution companies have been forced  to make a crash adjustment to a world where financing is hard to come by and  the major studios have increased their financial muscle and reach.  </P> <P> Krane's efforts to put together the company also illustrate the irresistible  lure many feel for building a small film company, against lengthening odds.  </P> <P> Krane, 37, has expanded MCEG in seven years from a tiny talent management  agency to a diversified concern with production, distribution and finance arms  and with revenue that may approach $200 million this year. His most ambitious  step was last July's $83-million acquisition of a much larger foreign  distribution company, Virgin Vision, from Richard Branson, the British  entertainment and airline entrepreneur.  </P> <P> As he has built the company, Krane, who graduated from Hollywood High at 15 and  studied law at Yale, has earned a reputation as inspired, hard working,  abrasive and domineering.  </P> <P> "It wasn't easy making all this stuff happen," says Krane, who is married to  actress Sally Kellerman. "I have to say 'no' to a lot of people. . . . I'm sure  at times I come off like a jerk."  </P> <P> Contributing to the appearance of disarray at MCEG has been the departure over  the past several months of a series of top managers. Among them were Al Newman,  marketing chief; Glen Shipley, chief financial officer; Michael Lauer, head of  business affairs, and Beth Cannon, at one time head of the talent management  operations. Last month, Charles Weber, who had been MCEG president for 10  months, abruptly gave up the post to become a consultant to the company.  </P> <P> Company officials describe the turnover as growing pains, brought on in part by  its efforts to eliminate overlap after the acquisition of Virgin Vision. "We  outgrew some people, and some people outgrew us," says Krane.  </P> <P> Yet company officials also acknowledge that there is lingering bitterness among  some who have left the company. "Some people have been spreading nasty things  about Jonathan," says William J. Rouhana Jr., MCEG's vice chairman and  co-founder. "Hollywood is a jealous place."  </P> <P> MCEG faces a lawsuit from producer Simon Lewis, who contends that Krane fired  him without cause as producer of "Look Who's Talking" during the filming of the  movie. Lewis says Krane later slandered him by telling a reporter for the trade  paper Daily Variety that Lewis was never the film's producer but only Krane's  production assistant. Krane says the suit has no merit.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, people close to the company say the investment firm of Kidder,  Peabody &amp; Co., which loaned $67 million to MCEG for the Virgin Vision  acquisition and is also its investment banker, is keeping a watchful eye on the  company. Kidder has been influential in a number of key moves recently,  including the appointment and departure of key executives, these people say.  </P> <P> Krane, the company's controlling shareholder, has been intimately involved in  every aspect of the MCEG's operations, from talent management and casting to  film editing, although he has recently relinquished some role in production.  </P> <P> "Jonathan is the sun, and the rest of the company revolves around him," says a  former insider.  </P> <P> The son of a Los Angeles auto leasing executive, Krane founded MCEG in 1982 and  worked as chief executive of Blake Edwards Entertainment from 1983 until 1987.  He says he met Kellerman, who is 16 years his senior, at a group therapy  session.  </P> <P> Krane is known for a taste for expensive Italian clothing, Rolls-Royce sedans  and books on advanced physics. He and Kellerman live in a home perched above  Laurel Canyon that has drawn wide attention for an addition designed by the  architect Frank O. Gehry.  </P> <P> Krane's blueprint for the company was designed to help it avoid the pitfalls  that have undone so many independents. MCEG's talent management, movie  production, distribution and finance arms are supposed to support each other to  increase their odds of success.  </P> <P> The company's films, for example, sometimes provide work for MCEG-managed  actors and directors. The distribution operations can help MCEG cover  production costs through sales of the company's movies to theaters and  television and for home video use. With the Virgin Vision acquisition, MCEG is  betting that it can exploit growing overseas demand for lower-budget U.S. film  hits.  </P> <P> Krane is also trying to cultivate a reputation as the cheapest guy in  Hollywood. He says MCEG plans to keep the production cost of its average film  to about $3 million -- compared to about $18 million for the majors -- so the  company doesn't risk too much on any single project.  </P> <P> But will this master plan work only on paper, as some competitors contend?  </P> <P> What the company can do in cutting costs, Krane says, was demonstrated in "Look  Who's Talking," a comedy about a baby who speaks with an adult voice (provided  by actor Bruce Willis).  </P> <P> Krane struck a deal with Tri-Star Pictures based on his hunch that he could  keep production costs to about half of the budgeted $14 million. He signed  Travolta for about half his usual $4-million fee, shot the film in lower-cost  Vancouver, Canada, and shortened the production schedule. Costs came in at  about $8.6 million.  </P> <P> Amy Heckerling, the film's director, gives MCEG a lot of credit for the  picture's success. Tri-Star, the film's owner and distributor, had been moving  without haste to shoot the picture and planned a limited regional release that  didn't promise great profit.  </P> <P> Five years after director Heckerling had written the script, three potential  leading actresses had read it and "I was getting very depressed," Heckerling  says. "It was a 'go' movie that wasn't going anywhere."  </P> <P> "Look Who's Talking" was Hollywood's top box office money maker for five weeks  last fall, and now there are plans for a sequel, a TV sitcom and perhaps a  cartoon series.  </P> <P> Still, MCEG's take may be rather modest. Of the $127 million gross, MCEG may  net $10 million to $12 million, industry officials estimate.  </P> <P> Any earnings MCEG does receive will come in handy, for the company isn't  expected to report a profit until at least next year as it digests the Virgin  Vision acquisition.  </P> <P> Kidder's loan for the acquisition was supposed to be repaid by last Dec. 15.  Instead, the deadline was extended to March 30, and Kidder put up an additional  $5 million in fresh loans.  </P> <P> At a time of jitters in the credit markets, the delay stirred speculation that  MCEG may have had trouble lining up lenders. Richard Intrader, the Kidder  banker in charge of the deal, acknowledges that "the lending environment had  changed between August and December."  </P> <P> But Vice Chairman Rouhana insists that the company has had no trouble and will  soon complete the refinancing with bank loans, commercial paper and funds from  possible deals he won't discuss. "We're in the middle of doing a number of  things," he says.  </P> <P> Rouhana boasts that within six months the company will cut its $131-million  debt burden to 50% of capital from its current heavy 85%.  </P> <P> Christopher Dixon, a Kidder securities analyst and MCEG's biggest fan on Wall  Street, claims that the Virgin Vision acquisition will make MCEG the  third-largest overseas distributor of English language films, hedging the risk  of MCEG's movie-production ventures. "This company is superbly positioned," he  raves.  </P> <P> The stock market seems less enthusiastic. MCEG's stock, trading at $4.125 a  share during the peak of the success of "Look Who's Talking," has since  slumped, closing Tuesday at a bid price of $2.0625 a share, off 6.25 cents, in  over-the-counter trading. MCEG lost $11 million on revenue of $31 million for  the six months ended last Sept. 30.  </P> <P> In March, MCEG expects to release two films: "Chains of Gold," an action story  about a social worker fighting New York drug lords, which stars Travolta, and  "Boris and Natasha," a film based on the two Russian spies in the old Rocky and  Bullwinkle cartoons that stars Kellerman and Dave Thomas.  </P> <P> Krane says the company may soon break with past practice by working out a  so-called "rent-a-major" deal with a major studio or an independent movie  company for domestic theatrical distribution of its films. Such deals reduce  the risks for producers but also can limit their money-making potential, since  distributors typically claim 15% to 30% of box office rentals.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, MCEG is a company in flux. The concern has scaled back its talent  management division, laying off 25 employees just before Christmas as part of  what Krane says is a new strategy of relying on fewer but higher-producing  talent managers. "Managers whose client base didn't excel left the company," he  says.  </P> <P> Observers are watching to see how smoothly MCEG will refinance the debt.  Further down the road, a key question is whether MCEG will be able to produce  or acquire, and then market, the two dozen pictures a year that Virgin Vision  will need to remain a player in distribution.  </P> <P> What the company really could use right now, outsiders say, is another hit.  Company officials insist that's not necessary. "This company isn't dependent on  any single film," Rouhana says.  </P> <P> </P> <P> MCEG AT A GLANCE  </P> <P> A diversified entertainment concern, Santa Monica-based Management Co.  Entertainment Group manages talent and produces, distributes and finances  movies. The company lost $2.5 million on revenue of $34 million for the fiscal  year ended March 31, 1989; for the six months ended Sept. 30, it lost $10.9  million on revenue of $31.1 million. In August, MCEG acquired Virgin Vision, a  British-based distributor with revenues of $148 million for the fiscal year  ended July 31, 1989.  </P> <P> Projected 1990 Revenue  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.43IN:2.55IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Activity  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (in millions)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> % of total  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Foreign video  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $80.5  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 41%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Film finance  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $39.0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 20  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Domestic film revenue  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $27.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Domestic video  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $27.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 14  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Foreign film  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $17.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 9  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Talent management  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3.1  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> TOTAL  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $194.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 100%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Feature Films  </P> <P> * Look Who's Talking (production only; owned and distributed by Tri-Star),  1989.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The private visit of Taiwanese President Li  Teng-hui has triggered strong reaction from the Chinese  Government. On 16 February, the Chinese Government reportedly  issued a protest note, accusing Thailand of violating the  agreement and understanding between each other on the one-China  policy and emphasizing its strong regret on the matter.    The note was issued after the Taiwanese president's visit to  Thailand, which took place between 14 and 16 February during  which the Thai Government organized a reception in Phuket.  Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai was at the reception, played golf,  as well as discussed economic cooperation with the visitor.    Thailand was the last leg of President Li's visit to the  region. He was in the Philippines and Indonesia and was received  by Presidents Fidel Ramos and Suharto despite the Chinese  Government's charge that the visit would affect its relations  with those countries. The Chinese Government issued two protest  notes to the two countries and canceled a visit of Chinese  parliamentary foreign affairs committee to those countries.    The Chinese Government resorted to the same two practices  vis  a vis Thailand. There was a reminder from the Chinese foreign  minister. The Thai Government, however, viewed the Taiwanese  president's visit as private to "rest for three days to play  golf."    In any event, China has made an initial protest by canceling  indefinitely an official visit by an NPC foreign affairs  delegation, originally scheduled for 23 February-1 March. A  protest note also followed.    Meanwhile, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai told reporters that  Thailand firmly abided by its one-China policy and that the  Taiwanese president's visit would not affect that policy. He  said the Thai Government should be able to practice a basic  principle in the conduct of its fully independent foreign policy.    China and Thailand established diplomatic relations in 1975,  and Thailand ceased diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which  China regards as one of its provinces.    In any event, it was reported that on 16 February the king  hosted a dinner for the Taiwanese president at Phuphing Palace,  Chiang Mai Province. Prime Minister Chuan Likphai was present  at the dinner. [passage omitted]</p>

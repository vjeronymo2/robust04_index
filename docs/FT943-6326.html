			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Gone but not forgotten: As Russian troops leave Germany - Future relations between the two countries The last train to Moscow from the village of Wunsdorf, south of Berlin, departs tomorrow, just as President Boris Yeltsin will be attending the formal ceremonies in the German capital to mark the end of Russia's 49-year military occupation of east Germany. For the past week the village, hitherto headquarters of Moscow's so-called western group of forces, its army of occupation in Germany, has almost drowned in a tide of celebration and nostalgia. Vodka and champagne have flowed as the departing Russian soldiers bade a tearful farewell to friends. When the last Russian troops leave, the effects of their long stay in east Germany will certainly not disappear. For a start, they are leaving behind them, in Wunsdorf as on 250,000 hectares of other Soviet garrisons and airfields, shooting ranges and waste dumps, an environmental nightmare: untreated sewage, pools of toxic chemicals, oil and petrol, unexploded shells, and abandoned equipment. The cost of the clean-up is still unknown. Yet the environmental problems are not the real issue. For the departure of the Russian troops ushers in a new era in German-Russian relations which will remain for the foreseeable future both acutely sensitive, and central to the lasting stability of the European continent. For Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his government, as well as for the vast majority of the German people, the highly visible and symbolic departure of the Russians is a matter for whole-hearted enthusiasm. More than any other event since the breaching of the Berlin Wall, this marks the end of the second world war, and the return of a united Germany as a sovereign state. Indeed, Mr Kohl is exploiting the event for all it is worth in his ambition to be re-elected chancellor in October, presenting it as the ultimate achievement of his government over the past four years. For Mr Yeltsin, it is an altogether more problematic occasion. It emphasises the retreat of Russia from its erstwhile empire, and it gives grist to the mill of the nationalist lobby back in Moscow. He has to emerge looking dignified, even in what many former Red Army officers see as a defeat. It is a dilemma about which Mr Kohl is sensitive, even as he seeks to gain all the votes he can garner from the television pictures of the departure. In recent weeks the German government has embarked on a public relations exercise aimed at reassuring the Russian people that the end of their military occupation can only improve their bilateral and international relations. There is no doubt that the fear exists in Moscow that Bonn will mark the Russian retreat either by downgrading its relations with its biggest eastern partner, or by adopting a much less (financially) generous attitude towards its yawning debt and development needs. In an interview with Mr Kohl in Izvestia last Friday, Mr Sergei Sosnovsky of the Interfax news agency suggested that 'there is a view that following the withdrawal of the troops, the Germans will begin to speak a 'different language' to the Russians, because the Russians will have lost their final trump card in relations with Germany'. 'Those fears are groundless,' Mr Kohl retorted. 'Germans and Russians have learned the lessons of history. Both sides have a vital interest in promoting the cause of stability and peace on the continent through far-reaching co-operation.' It is certainly true that the whole direction of Germany's Ostpolitik - its policy towards the east - since the demise of the Soviet Union, and its own re-unification, has been aimed at the preservation of peace and stability on its eastern border - and that has meant above all in the former Soviet Union. This policy has underpinned Germany's diplomatic strategy, and its financial contributions to the Russian economy in a host of ways. 'Germany is streets ahead of the entire international community (in terms of its support for reform),' Mr Kohl told Izvestia. 'We did not do this just because of the presence of Russian troops. Rather, we regard this contribution as a good investment in a long-term relationship between Germans and Russians.' According to Deutsche Bank, traditionally the most heavily involved of the German commercial banks in the former Soviet Union, the German banking sector has outstanding loans to Russia of between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 12bn. That amounts to about 25 per cent of all the loans to the former Soviet Union owed to western banks grouped in the London club of commercial creditors. In addition, Hermes, Germany's export credit insurance agency, has a total exposure of about DM45.65bn, although it has cut back on its business in Russia in the past three years, except for insurance cover for east German exporters. Bonn has also paid Moscow DM14.6bn to assist the withdrawal of Russian troops from east Germany, primarily to pay for their rehousing back home. It has also contributed an additional DM4.7bn in technical and humanitarian assistance, and DM4.2bn for financing investment projects. On the negative side, trade between the two countries has been declining since 1990, and last year totalled DM22.1bn - one quarter of Russia's total foreign trade, but only 2 per cent of Germany's. As for the Ostpolitik, officials in Bonn are adamant that the troop withdrawal will not change the basic direction of its foreign policy: to promote stability across eastern Europe and, crucially, to reassure Russia that its own security interests will not be threatened. 'It would be stupid for the Russians to think this will be changed,' according to one senior German diplomat. 'Of course the symbolism of the troops leaving east Germany is important. But the main plank of our foreign policy towards Russia has been in place for some time, and we will continue to pursue it.' Again and again, Germany's foreign policy specialists stress the need to put Moscow's own security fears at rest. 'Russia sees its security interests as being under threat from eastern Europe, in the sense that Nato will be extended to the borders of Russia, leaving Russia vulnerable,' the diplomat said. 'That is why we, and our European Union partners, have had painstakingly to explain to the governments of eastern Europe that we could not bring them into the (Nato) Partnership for Peace programme without including Russia.' The counterpart to that policy of reassuring Russia is to dampen the expectations of the central and east Europeans, including the now independent Baltic republics. 'We are trying to explain to them why they must not block out Russia,' the diplomat said. 'It is too dangerous. They must establish new relations with Russia because an eastern Europe which is perceived to be hostile by Moscow could play into the hands of the nationalists and lead to instability. Russia lost eastern Europe. It now needs a new relationship with eastern Europe in order to come to terms with the west expanding towards its borders.' When Finland joins the EU next January, the EU will itself have a Russian frontier. Bonn believes that Moscow understands the importance of the bilateral relationship, and will itself try to preserve it. It wants the German government to continue to act as a sober, moderating voice in international organisations, allowing Russia to pursue its interests. 'Those interests are becoming clearer,' said another German diplomat. 'I believe Russia is pursuing a sober, if not cynical, strategy. It wants to be the first among the former Soviet republics to get on its feet.' Bonn is prepared to back that self-interested strategy, not least because German officials are haunted by a nightmare. That is the danger of big differences between the rate of economic growth in different parts of eastern Europe, leading to a backlash against the slow pace of reforms in some of them. 'They could be drawn back again into the former Soviet Union. In such a scenario we should not exclude the prospect of a new military-type Warsaw Pact Two emerging,' the diplomat said. That is the concern which will temper too much triumphalism tomorrow on the streets of Berlin when President Yeltsin comes to bid farewell.</p>

He told Interfax that even if the complete sovereignty the  official Grozny talks about is true, "we must share in the  operation of the federal authorities. In my view, this would  not harm our sovereignty."    Avturkhanov emphasized, however, that elections would not be  held in the district if they were not held throughout the rest  of Chechnya.    "I have no intention to separate myself from my people," he  declared.    He said that Chechnya did not have proper sovereignty.    "The law of the jungle prevails under which only the  strongest survive. People do not need this kind of  sovereignty," he said.    In his words, Dudayev is supported only by those in the  middle class who managed to get rich under his rule.    Dzhokhar Dudayev had earlier told Interfax that there would  be no elections to the Federal Assembly on March 13.</p>

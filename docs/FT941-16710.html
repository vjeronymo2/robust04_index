			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Williamson Tea ahead at Pounds 6.15m Profits of Williamson Tea Holdings rose from Pounds 4.23m to Pounds 6.15m pre-tax for the six months to September 30. Turnover rose by Pounds 2.97m to Pounds 20.7m. Directors said the results should not be taken as a guide to the full year because owing to its seasonal nature the tea crop is not harvested equally throughout the 12 months. Adverse climatic conditions reduced the Indian crop but there were improvements in both Kenya and Tanzania. Earnings emerged at 100.8p (74.33p) per share and the interim dividend is a same-again 10p. The company is ultimately owned by George Williamson Holdings.</p>

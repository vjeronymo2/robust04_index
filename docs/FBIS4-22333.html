			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by L. Semiletov, deputy chief of administration for </F> price policy of the Ministry of Agricultural Production of the  Russian Federation: "Held Captive By the Financial Deficit"]    [Text] The opinion persists that the large amounts of  subsidies and compensation being issued by the state to  agricultural producers in our country are being used  ineffectively. Is this actually the case? Let us first compare  the budgetary funds being made available to agricultural  producers both here and abroad. Last year these payments, per  hectare of sowing area in Russia, amounted to 10,000 rubles, or  less than 10 dollars, and in the U.S.A. -- more than 90 dollars  and almost the same amount in Canada.    As you can see, support for the agrarian sector in our  country is negligible compared to that for states with developed  market economies. It does not cover even a portion of the  tremendous increase in the prices for resources, the result of  severe inflation, excessive taxes and high credit rates.    Owing to the severe financial situation, the farms are no  longer able to maintain the production potential created  earlier. Last year the withdrawal of fixed capital in  agriculture exceeded by fourfold the placing of such fixed  capital in operation. The workload borne by existing equipment  increased greatly and this is bringing about an increase in the  periods of time required for carrying out agricultural  operations and also shortfalls in the production of goods.  Moreover, a considerable decline in investments is posing the  threat of a drastic drop in productivity in field crop husbandry  and, in the final analysis, in livestock husbandry operations.    Compared to 1991, when in order to procure one tractor and  depending upon the machine model, the farms had to sell from 29  to 43 tonnes of grain, today the figure is almost twice as much.  And in order to purchase one tonne of mineral fertilizer, today  they must sell 3-22 times more agricultural products, depending  upon the type of product involved. Hence, earnings in  agriculture are considerably lower than that in other branches.    Taking into account the non-equivalent exchange of products  between cities and the countryside and the severe financial  situation, importance is attached to increasing financial  assistace for the agrarian sector. In our opinion, it must be  directed primarily towards adapting the agricultural producers  to market conditions, maintaining equivalence in inter-branch  exchange, protecting peasants from competition by foreign  entrepreneurs and towards the development of a market  infrastructure and implementing measures aimed at  demonopolization in the agrarian sphere.    Moreover, the state must present the farms with the required  guarantees with regard to the sale of their products. They must  signify that if producers, for one reason or another, are unable  to sell their products through direct market channels, the state  will procure them at firm prices declared in advance. Such a  system will prompt the farms to develop the production of the  needed agricultural goods.</p>

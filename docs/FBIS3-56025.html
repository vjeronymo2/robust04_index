The election race has shown that the  voters' preferences will depend on how convincing a presidential  candidate's plan is on the two main problems: the conflict with  Ingushetia and a political status for South Ossetia acceptable  for the northerners.    There are six presidential candidates in the race today.  They are Akhsarbek Galazov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of  North Ossetia; Prime Minister Sergey Khetagurov; Taymuraz  Batagov, the deputy internal affairs minister; Ilya Bekmurazov,  chief of the republic's tax inspectorate; Mukharbek Kisiyev,  chairman of the Pension Fund; and Georgiy Kodzayev, rector of  the Highlands Agricultural Academy. Akhsarbek Galazov and  Sergey Khetagurov stand better chances. True, Galazov's rating  dropped somewhat in the wake of Boris Yeltsin's visit to the  Northern Caucasus. He is being accused of a compromise approach  to the Ingush-Ossetia problem. Galazov's opponents try to blame  him for President Yeltsin's edict, which rescinded the local  parliament's decision on the impossibility of Ossetians and  Ingushi living together and caused an explosion of  dissatisfaction in Ossetia. At the same time, Akhsarbek Galazov  secured 138,000 votes in the elections for the Federal Assembly.  This is an impressive showing if one considers that the  elections were taking place right on the heels of Boris  Yeltsin's visit to the Northern Caucasus.    The other contender -- Sergey Khetagurov -- also has high  chances to win. He is a new-wave politician, a pragmatist. He  is supported by local economic managers, directors, and  entrepreneurs. Even the economic troubles worsened by the  conflict with Ingushetia and the republic's active part in the  South Ossetian problem have far from dismayed the North Ossetia  premier. On the contrary, they have only made his authority  stronger. One piece of evidence is an unofficial dialogue with  Chechnya President Dzhokhar Dudayev, held on Khetagurov's  initiative. The result: After these negotiations Groznyy has  repeatedly confirmed its noninterference in the Ingush-Ossetia  conflict. The North Ossetia prime minister's positions became  even stronger after Boris Yeltsin's visit to the state of  emergency zone. Sergey Khetagurov spoke sharply against  Moscow's stance. He thinks that as an arbiter the Kremlin  gambles on force whereas one should give a possibility and time  for Ossetians and Ingush themselves to agree. The fact that  Khetagurov swims against the stream, never fearing for his  career, secures him additional votes.    Aleksandr Dzasokhov, former CPSU Central Committee  secretary,  was seen as the third main candidate for presidency of the  republic. However, the "Styr Nykhas" public organization asked  Dzasokhov to pull out of the election marathon. He complied,  announcing that a radical change of leaders threatens the  republic with tipping the fragile political balance. Another  argument given by "Styr Nykhas" is that the victory for  Dzasokhov, for example, may cause a repetition of the Chechnya  variant. A power struggle against the backdrop of the South  Ossetia problem and the dispute over Prigorodnyy Rayon may split  North Ossetia.    Evidently only Sergey Khetagurov is trying to outdistance  Akhsarbek Galazov. According to unofficial information, one of  the four remaining candidates, or all of them, might do on the  last day before the elections what Dzasokhov did.</p>

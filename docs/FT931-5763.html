			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Bosnia Moslems sign pact at UN: Military disengagement accord maps out withdrawal of forces and weapons UNITED NATIONS attempts to negotiate a peace settlement between the warring parties in Bosnia moved a step forward last night when the Moslem government followed Bosnian Serbs and Croats in signing an agreement on military disengagement. The accord, which will not take effect until all sides agree on a division of Bosnia, maps out how forces and weapons would be withdrawn under UN control after a final settlement. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the UN and EC mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, said that, along with constitutional proposals agreed in Geneva, two of the three main elements of the peace package were now agreed. But he stopped short of calling the signing a breakthrough and warned that a lot of tough bargaining was still ahead. While the decision to sign by President Alija Izetbegovic had restored momentum to the peace process, a lot of 'muscle' would still have to be applied by governments to push the parties to a final accord. The constitutional proposals provide for maintaining Bosnia-Hercegovina as a single state divided into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. It is disagreement on their frontiers that remains the stumbling block to an overall settlement  -without which the military disengagement accord remains a dead letter. The Moslems previously withheld agreement on disengagement partly because of the lack of firm guarantees on control of heavy weapons. Perhaps 40,000 UN soldiers, a larger force than originally calculated, may be needed to maintain peace and take control of heavy armaments. Mr Eckhard indicated that President Bill Clinton's decision to commit US ground troops might have influenced the Bosnian president's change of heart. In response to a US request, UN Security Council members last night held consultations over Serb attacks on Cerska, eastern Bosnia, and called a meeting for early today at which a statement was expected calling for an end to the fighting. Earlier, President Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said the air-drops of relief supplies into eastern Bosnia would continue. On Tuesday night, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, had given the impression that the air-drops, which he described as 'symbolic' and 'a great success', would be suspended indefinitely. But Mr Christopher said there was 'no evidence at all' that the air-drops had prompted greater Serb assaults on the Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia. He added that in view of the 'disturbing' reports of greater fighting and refugee flows 'the air drops will be continuing'. The renewed US commitment to the air-drops appears much influenced by Tuesday's announcement that Russia was willing to join the US airborne aid efforts. The US Air Force said yesterday the US European Command would be sending a five-person team to Moscow. Thousands flee, Page 2</p>

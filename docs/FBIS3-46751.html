			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The Vietnamese Communists Have Transported </F> Ammunition and Tanks from Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh Through  the Mekong River To Continue Kindling the Vietnamese War of  Aggression Against Cambodia"]    [Text] According to reliable sources, 20 to 30 tanks and  300 tons of assorted ammunition were transported from Ho Chi  Minh City to Phnom Penh via the Mekong River. This is the plan  of the aggressor Vietnamese communists, Vietnamese puppets, and  their allies to continue fomenting the war in Cambodia in  opposition to peace and the king's national reconciliation.    In fact, the two-heads-three-eyes government has no money to  buy tanks, arms, and ammunition to continue the war. This is  possible because the allies have given the money to buy  Vietnam's ammunition and arms provided it by the former Soviet  Union. Moreover, Vietnam wants to continue the war in Cambodia  in line with its aggressive, annexationist, expansionist, and  racial extermination strategy against Cambodia. Thus, (?Russia)  is also the one who sells this ammunition, and the allies are  the paymaster.    Various observers said that it is not the  two-heads-three-eyes government but the Vietnamese communists  and their allies who are managing Cambodia's current state  affairs. In the two-headed government, the Vietnamese puppet  administration set up since 1979 is controlling the countryside  by 100 percent and 99 percent of the Phnom Penh authorities who  are always ready to follow their boss' order.    The question is: Can the continuation of war by the  Vietnamese communists solve anything?    1. The Vietnamese communists waged war for 13 years by  themselves with the full support from former Eastern Europe bloc  and former Soviet Union in an attempt to eliminate the Cambodian  nation and people so that only the Vietnamese and Vietnamese  puppets are left in Cambodia, but they were shamefully defeated  by the Cambodian people.    2. After the Paris agreement was signed, the Vietnamese and  their allies inside and outside UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority  in Cambodia] jointly carried on the war for the whole two dry  seasons and two rainy seasons that followed. They maintained  and used the old and new communist Vietnamese troops and  maintained all Vietnamese puppet military and civilian  authorities. UNTAC spent almost all of the 2 billion dollars in  attacking Democratic Kampuchea. Both the Vietnamese communists  and their allies tried very hard, particularly on the  battlefield, to create an administration made up of the  Vietnamese communist half-breed and Eurasians in Cambodia.    At present, this half-breed government is born. That is, it  has two heads and three eyes. But actually, it has a pure  Vietnamese body formed by Vietnam since 1979.    The people said that there has never been any government  that  has two heads and three eyes in the history of Cambodia and that  of the world. It is very villainous and ill-fated. Only a few  months after its birth, it has brought calamity to the country.  The nation and society have plunged into serious disasters in  all fields and all aspects. The people both in rural and urban  areas, students, pupils, civil servants, and teachers are  revolting against the parliament and the two-head-three-eyes  government. They are opposing the Vietnamese communist  administrators even more violently everywhere. The people want  only a government and a national administration that come from  the national reconciliation policy of King Norodom Sihanouk.    In a situation in which the national trend and Cambodian  people are very furious with the two-heads-three-eyes government  and supporting the king's national reconciliation policy, will  it be possible for the aggressor Vietnamese communists, their  allies, and their puppets to carry on war and suppress the  movement of the Cambodian nation and people with the weapons  that they have just brought in?    The history of the Cambodian nation clearly emphasizes this  fact to the communist Vietnamese enemy and its the allies. In  fact, the entire Cambodian nation and people oppose the  two-headed government, Vietnam, and the allies. The  overwhelming majority of the puppet and Para soldiers [Son  Sann's group] do not want to fight any longer. Therefore, can  the weapons of the Vietnamese and their allies fight by  themselves when the people from all social strata, particularly  the rural people, absolutely oppose them and are tightening the  noose around their neck.    This fact has been and is being confirmed by history.  Desiring to kill a nation and people who fight for their  national survival is not an illusion. Just take a look at the  Cambodian countryside and at present-day Phnom Penh. Just take  a look at Somalia, former Soviet Union, the Middle East, former  East Europe, and present-day Africa.</p>

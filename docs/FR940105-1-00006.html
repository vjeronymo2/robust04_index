			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In the event of its adoption, no retroactive effect would be given to this proposed rule, and applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted before any judicial challenge to the application of these provisions. Those administrative procedures are set forth in 9 CFR 381.35. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Effect on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Administrator, FSIS, has determined that the proposed rule would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule would permit the use of TSP at the establishment's option. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Establishments that decide to use TSP as an antimicrobial agent on their products would incur a one-time expense for the necessary equipment and an ongoing cost for purchasing TSP. The cost for the treatment equipment would be approximately $45,000 per processing line. The cost for the TSP would average about 1/2 cent per bird. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The production of ready-to-cook poultry containing lower amounts of bacteria than such poultry now available would contribute to the national effort to reduce the incidence of pathogenic bacteria in foods. Most consumers are willing to pay more for poultry products that are raised or processed in a way that reduces the levels of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Salmonella  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on such products. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  Therefore, the market for TSP-treated poultry carcasses would likely attract most consumers who desire additional protection from harmful microorganisms. In turn, poultry establishments that market TSP-treated poultry carcasses could benefit from increased sales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rhone-Poulenc Food Buyer Telephone Survey, January 1993. A copy of this survey is available for public inspection in the office of the FSIS Hearing Clerk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit comments concerning this proposal.

Under the PPIA (21 U.S.C. 451&hyph;470), FSIS provides mandatory inspection of poultry and poultry products shipped in interstate and foreign commerce, as well as in designated States. Continuous inspection of poultry slaughtering establishments is intended to assure that fresh, ready-to-cook poultry carcasses and parts are free of visible signs of disease and contamination. FSIS inspectors examine the outside, inside, and viscera of all birds presented for inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

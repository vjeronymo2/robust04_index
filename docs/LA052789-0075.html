			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> PARRISH A MAJOR FORCE IN IMPROVED ANGEL PITCHING  </P> <P> The scouting report on the California Angels' pitching staff has changed from  last season, even though only two of the faces -- Bert Blyleven and Jim Abbott  -- are new. The Angels aren't so wimpy now.  </P> <P> Yankees pitching coach Billy Connors sees it: "Their overall look is more  aggressive." And they're not the least bit afraid to use the inside edge of the  plate, so watch out. Connors said they're throwing more heat, relying less on  finesse.  </P> <P> And the staff ERA reflects this brazen new approach. It's down from 4.32 last  season to a league-leading 2.70.  </P> <P> Although the staff is healthier with more experience this season, some people  point to new Angels catcher Lance Parrish for the coming-right-at-you approach.  He may not be the reason for the turnaround, but he is one reason.  </P> <P> "I've tried to express to everybody that I'm a very big believer in pitching  inside," said Parrish, sitting with crossword puzzle in hand at Yankee Stadium.  "We've been around and around with that. Everybody is starting to see it's a  vital part of the game. You can't get respect of the hitters unless you throw  inside."  </P> <P> Manager Doug Rader credits the pitchers themselves for the improvement, but  appreciates the veteran catcher's approach. "It's always nice to know Lance  likes that philosophy and that the pitchers adhere to it," he said.  </P> <P> This winter, Parrish, 32, came over from Philadelphia the same way former  Angels catcher Bob Boone departed California for Kansas City -- through free  agency.  </P> <P> Angels starter Mike Witt doesn't want any pro-Parrish comments to reflect badly  on Boone. "Just as a change in scenery is good for a hitter, I think a change  in catcher has helped this staff," Witt said. "Lance is a little bit more  aggressive, not only in calling of games, but in his actions. I've had times  when he's come out and chewed me. He's not afraid to say anything in any  situation."  </P> <P> Parrish is as happy to be with the Angels as they are to have him. His two  years in the National League after nine with Detroit weren't what he or the  Phillies intended, and the fans never let him forget it. Billed as the answer  to their catching prayers, Parrish hit below .250 both seasons with no more  than 17 homers or 67 RBI either year. "I just ran into all kinds of problems,"  he said. "I was disappointed in the way I performed and the way the team  performed. I didn't see the situation getting better. Everything was in  turmoil."  </P> <P> Although he hit a two-run homer off Rich Dotson in the Angels' win Wednesday  night, Parrish is less worried about his offense (.248, five homers, 19 RBI)  and more intent on his defense. "I'm more concerned with us winning ballgames.  My No. 1 priority is to be a leader behind the plate.  </P> <P> "People had a lot of questions about this pitching staff. It's nice to get that  confident look back in their eyes. This has been an awful lot of fun."  </P></p>

A spokesman for  President Rabbani's troops said they have repulsed the attack.  General Dostam's jet planes also attacked key positions in  Kabul. According to the International Red Cross estimate, at  least 4,000 people have been wounded in the past 12 days and  hundreds more are feared dead. The UN secretary general has  stressed the need for humanitarian assistance for the displaced  Afghan people. In a statement, the secretary general deplored  large-scale fighting in Kabul and called for an immediate end to  the fighting.    The government of Pakistan, with the collaboration of  Jalalabad Shura [council], has decided to set up two camps  inside Afghanistan to facilitate delivery of relief assistance  to the displaced people. The commissioner for Afghan refugees,  Rustam Shah Momen, told a meeting in Peshawar today that two  camps with the capacity of 100,000 will be set up in Samarkhel  and Asrashahi near Jalalabad. The meeting was attended by the  representatives of the United Nations and aid giving NGO's  [nongovernmental organizations] to discuss the arrangements for  providing shelter and emergency relief to the war affectees of  Afghanistan. The commissioner for Afghan refugees asked the  United Nations agencies and other NGO's to transfer their  establishment to new sites inside Afghanistan. He apprised them  of the decision regarding the closure of the Pak-Afghan border  and said that the government does not recognize the new arrivals  as refugees. However, the Afghans, who have already crossed the  border, are being accommodated in Nazir Bagh and Agha Khel  tented villages near Peshawar.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Legal actions to go ahead LEGAL CHALLENGES to the pit closure programme brought by the miners' unions will go ahead today despite the government's substantial climbdown. The concessions announced yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine were widely seen as going some way towards meeting the unions' central complaint about the lack of consultation. However, the unions' lawyers maintain that enough issues - particularly surrounding the exact nature of the consultation being proposed - remain undecided. Mr Mark Stephens, for the National Union of Mineworkers, said it appeared that the consultation was going to take place only as a matter of form, rather than in any meaningful or open-minded way. The action to be heard today is that brought by the NUM and Nacods, the pit deputies' union. This is a two-pronged challenge which alleges a breach of UK law and of European law over the miners' contracts. The unions are also challenging British Coal's failure to go through the modified colliery review procedure before implementing the closure programme. They argue that the workforce has a legitimate expectation of being consulted in such circumstances. The second action - a judicial review won by the Union of Democratic Mineworkers - will start on Thursday after the judgment has been made on the NUM-Nacods case. The UDM case also centres on the alleged lack of consultation by British Coal. However, unlike the NUM-Nacods action, which is based on private contract law, the UDM action is based on public law in seeking to show that British Coal has failed in a statutory duty to consult as established by the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act. The outcome of the pits dispute will ultimately depend on political rather than legal factors and Mr Heseltine's shift in position has further reduced the significance of this week's legal battles. Nevertheless, the courts' decisions will prove vital ammunition to the winning side, whichever win. Even if the government loses in the courts, that could make a further political climbdown easier to explain.</p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Arts: Profitably challenged - The Edinburgh Festival Brian McMaster has pulled it off. He planned a challenging programme for the 1994 Edinburgh Festival - a seven and a half hour Oresteia in Russian; three and a half hours of Antony and Cleopatra in German without an interval, and more - yet is contemplating a 30 per cent increase in ticket sales and record box-office revenue of Pounds 1.8m. The good financial result, which means a minimal loss at the worst, owes little to the foreign drama. It was the well received music and dance which saw the festival home. The bias towards Beethoven has enabled the Usher Hall to be 81 per cent full; the Queen's Hall, 84 per cent full. The American ballet companies were a roaring success, at least critically, and Mark Morris is already committed to bringing his dancers back in 1995. In contrast the Oresteia sold 2,000 out of 3,700 seats, but McMaster was delighted. 'We should programme difficult things, special festival events. If we are doing our job well, drama will always be controversial. I will be intellectually rigorous again next year. Only if we had failed would I have been forced to think about more popular works.' For a festival with 150 performances, there were remarkably few crises. The NDR Symphony Orchestra of Hamburg cancelled one performance and Franz Welser Most and two sopranos belatedly ducked out of Schumann's rarely-played Faust, which caused a few artistic and financial headaches as substitutes were rallied. But McMaster can credibly claim: 'I've had the most wonderful three weeks.' The major disappointments were a new work by Robert Lepage The Seven Streams of the River Ota and the static Torquato Tasso, but the rest of the programme found at least some fanatical supporters. McMaster is happiest at the way the Festival has nourished artists, most obviously Peter Stein and Mark Morris but also the pianist Richard Goode, who sold 30 per cent of the Queen's Hall two years ago; 50 per cent last year, and has queues around the block this time for his Beethoven programmes. Next year will bring a major opera company to the Festival Theatre and probably another visit from Peter Stein. Much still needs to be planned, but with funding apparently secure, McMaster can concentrate on his next ambition - finding a proper HQ for the Festival. On the Fringe it was not quite so simple. Here drama was strong and one production, Tom Courtney's one-man show Moscow Stations is being fought over by the Riverside Studios, the West End and New York - but stand-up comedy is losing its appeal and no comic alternative has yet emerged. Some venues, especially the smartened-up Pleasance reported ticket sales up by over 20 per cent while the biggest Fringe venue, The Assembly Rooms, was 5 per cent down. Director Bill Burdett-Coutts blamed the rail strike. Overall the Fringe office sold around Pounds 1m worth of tickets, about the same as last year. New director, Hilary Strong, had a quiet initiation, with no scandals. She plans to grade venues in terms of facilities and to try to open more ticket offices around town to make customer access to the 1,300-odd fringe productions easier next year. There is an Edinburgh stand-off between McMaster and the city's other cultural heavyweight, Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries of Scotland. McMaster wants total control of the Festival and refuses to accept Clifford's ambitiously-planned art exhibitions in the official programme. Clifford is carrying on regardless - next year's big one will be devoted to Scottish art. But as the Festival ends today, Clifford is the happiest man in Edinburgh. He could confirm that Baron Thyssen was giving the Pounds 800,000 needed to keep the Three Graces in the UK. They will make their Edinburgh debut in the National Gallery next August.</p>

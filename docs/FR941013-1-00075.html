			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Selection of Regulatory Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Regulatory Alternatives for Existing Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Different regulatory alternatives for control of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organic HAP emissions from existing sources at off-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste and recovery operations facilities were defined. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternative was defined by combining the MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor determinations for each of the five emission point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types (labeled ``Regulatory Alternative 1''). Four additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory alternatives for the off-site waste and recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations source category were defined which would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasingly greater amounts of total organic HAP emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction from the baseline level of organic HAP emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (labeled ``Regulatory Alternative 2'' through ``Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 5''). Additional organic HAP emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements were added to the controls defined for Regulatory Alternative 1 in order of increasing emission control incremental cost effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 1 requires application of air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission controls on tanks, containers, and treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processes managing waste or recoverable material with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOHAP concentration equal to or greater than 100 ppmw as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined at the point of where the material first enters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the facility. For tank and container emission points,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 1 requires use of a cover on each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit. For process vent emission points, Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 1 requires connecting the process vent to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control device that reduces organic HAP emissions by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 95 percent. For land disposal unit emission points,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 1 requires treatment of the wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to disposal to reduce the waste VOHAP concentration to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than 100 ppmw. For equipment leak emission points,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 1 requires for equipment handling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste or recoverable material streams with a total organic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HAP concentration equal to or greater than 10 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of a leak detection and repair (LDAR) program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and certain equipment modifications. The requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the LDAR program and equipment modifications are consistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the existing NSPS process equipment leak standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgated by the EPA under CAA section 111 (i.e., 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 60 subparts VV, GG, and KK) and for certain NESHAP process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment leak standards promulgated under CAA section 112  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i.e., 40 CFR 61 subpart V).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 2 adds additional control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for containers. The control requirements for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the other emission points remain the same as for Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 1. In addition to using covers on containers,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 2 requires use of submerged fill when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes or recoverable materials are transferred into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> containers by pumping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 3 adds additional control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for tanks. The control requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other emission points remain the same as for Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative 2. Tanks in which the organic HAP vapor pressure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the waste or recoverable material in the tank is equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or greater than 5.2 kPa (approximately 0.75 psi) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to use a cover and be vented to a control device  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that reduces organic HAP emissions by 95 percent. Tanks in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the organic HAP vapor pressure of the waste or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recoverable material in the tank is less than 5.2 kPa use a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cover without additional controls (i.e., a cover only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without being vented to a control device).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 4 changes the LDAR program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the equipment leak emission point category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The control requirements for the other emission points  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain the same as for Regulatory Alternative 3. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative 4, the LDAR program would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted in accordance with procedures consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hazardous Organic NESHAP (HON) promulgated by the EPA under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 63 subpart H.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

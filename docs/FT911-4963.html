			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Arts: Top Girls - Royal Court On the one hand . . . ; on the other . . . This is a superlative revival of Caryl Churchill's important 1982 play, which has gained new resonance in 1991; and one of its several first-rate performances is haunting. Yet I can't accept it as the great play it has been, and is still being, called. It should be seen, applauded and argued about. Both as theatre and as politics, Top Girls is exciting and irritating. The dialectic of its final scene, between the Thatcherite Marlene and her socialist sister Joyce rings true as you listen. The terms in which the sisters argue about Thatcherite politics have not dated. Here are the two nations of the 1980s: those who've got what it takes and those who haven't. And, of course, Marlene now resembles a later prime minister when she says 'I don't believe in class.' But the more evidently Top Girls expresses a Point of View, the worse as theatre it is. How glibly, in that final scene, Churchill weights the dice against Marlene's Thatcherism. I resent theatre that weights the scales that easily, whichever way. I think also that Top Girls occasionally exemplifies the noisy slickness that it criticises. Indeed, what makes the play so striking is its own ambition. The first scene will always be its most startling feature, with Marlene celebrating her recent ascent to the directorship of the Top Girls appointments agency by throwing a not-of-this-world dinner for five famous women from history. The women, so different in their attitudes, are a miniature Babel. They drive you up the wall as they talk across each other, but they also hilariously illustrate Marlene's dilemma: who should an ambitious woman take as a role model? What must be sacrificed? I have nothing but high, higher and highest praise for the seven actresses in this revival of Max Stafford-Clark's original production. Part of the play's considerable fun is in how brilliantly six of them take two or more dissimilar roles. Lesley Manville, who is the central figure of Marlene, neatly captures her brittle elegance and ambition. Very fine the wry, defensive way she resorts to drink as things get out of hand. Lesley Sharp is Dull Gret ('painted by Breugel') and Angie. Her expression of inarticulate and half-comprehending emotion, now stolid, now inarticulate, is funny, poignant and viscerally exciting. Best of all, though, is Deborah Findlay. The details of eye and voice she brings to the Victorian explorer Isabella, suavely martyr-like, and the tense, conservative and domestic Mrs Kidd are remarkable. And as Joyce - like Sharp, she has an uncannily perfect Suffolk accent - she is exceptional. She shows a powerful countrywoman weightiness and a smouldering force that are deeply stirring.</p>

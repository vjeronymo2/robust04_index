			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK Company News: Manx fraud squad to investigate Merlin Intl OPERATIONS OF Merlin International Properties, which faces possible receivership, are to be investigated by the Isle of Man fraud squad. 'I have no reason at this moment to believe there has been criminal activity,' Mr William Cain, the Manx Attorney General, said yesterday. The investigation was ordered after some shareholders complained about heavy losses by the company and circumstances surrounding a recent takeover bid for it. A Pounds 2.9m agreed offer of 5p per share from Luirc, a British Virgin Islands company, was announced at the end of February. The bid failed to get Stock Exchange approval because its funding was conditional, and was withdrawn two weeks ago. Luirc is still keen to mount a further bid if it can get dispensation from the takeover panel. A further bid from the same source would not normally be allowed within 12 months of collapse of the first one. Some of Merlin's Manx-based private shareholders say the identity of the bidder has not been made clear, and suspect some past or present directors may be acting in concert with the bidder. Luirc has stated that there was no connection between it and Merlin directors.</p>

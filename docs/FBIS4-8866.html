			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dejan Lukic] </F>   [Text] Washington, April 18 (TANJUG) -- Washington is  viewing with confusion and uncertainty the developments in  war-shattered Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly around the  eastern Moslem enclave of Gorazde.    The White House is awaiting the outcome of Russia's  diplomatic effort to effect a ceasefire around Gorazde, while  sending confused signals about its determination to keep up its  military pressure on the Serbs and the priority it attaches to  political dialogue.    President Bill Clinton on Sunday indirectly intimated that  the United States would be willing to do an about-face in its  current policy towards the Serbs, which has been signaled also  by THE WASHINGTON POST. Quoting high-ranking sources in the  administration, the daily said that the United States was  prepared to consider lifting sanctions against Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) as an incentive to the Bosnian Serbs to  agree to a ceasefire in Bosnia.    On Sunday, Clinton discussed the Yugoslav crisis with  Russian  President Boris Yeltsin, as did Secretary of State Warren  Christopher with his Russian opposite number Andrey Kozyrev.    Information available at this time suggests that Kozyrev  asked Washington to agree that the Bosnian ceasefire deal  include a provision on a phased lifting of the anti-Yugoslav  sanctions, with Christopher agreeing, albeit reluctantly, that  the Serbs needed to be stimulated in some way.    Meanwhile, Washington is in a ferment with speculation about  what the United States should do in a situation where it is  largely considered that the current policy of limited military  pressure on the Serbs has been defeated and that the Serbs have  humiliated the United States, NATO and the United Nations.    The advocates of an intervention are strongly on the  offensive, the most rabid of them being former secretary of  state and ambassador in Belgrade Lawrence Eagleburger, who has  told the C.B.S. network that, if Clinton has crossed the Rubicon  and used force, he should now follow through with massive  bombings of targets not only in Bosnia-Herzegovina but also deep  inside Serbia.    The campaign has been actively joined by Bosnian Moslem  Vice-President Ejup Ganic, who has made several television  appearances for local networks in which he called for a massive  air raid on Serb targets and demanded that Clinton immediately  send arms to the Moslems in Bosnia.    Appearing in a television show with Ganic, Congressman Lee  Hamilton poured cold water on both demands, explaining that the  United States could not unilaterally exempt the Moslems from the  arms sales embargo which has been in force against all of former  Yugoslavia since late 1991, as that would in effect constitute  an invitation for an escalation of war, and that a massive  intervention was not envisaged in the mandate of the United  Nations.</p>

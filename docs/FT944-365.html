			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Unilever makes Spanish frozen foods purchase Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group, yesterday agreed to buy 60 per cent of a Spanish frozen food company from Danone, France's largest food group. Danone said that Frudesa, a leading frozen vegetable and fish group, did not fit into its strategy of concentrating on ready-to-serve meals. Neither company would give any financial details of the transaction, although Unilever said the deal would be financed partly from internal funds and partly from loans. It also intends to increase its stake in the future. Unilever will take full management control of Frudesa, which had sales of Pounds 110m this year and employs 1,200 people. The group said the Spanish market offered good growth prospects as Spanish consumption of frozen food was below the European average. Frudesa was transferred to Danone following the merger of its ready-to-serve food business with that of Saint Louis last spring, creating the third biggest European company in the sector. Danone has a Spanish ready-to-serve offshoot, Pycasa, which leads the market. Danone is also in the process of acquiring 100 per cent of Gelax, an Italian group specialising in value-added frozen products.</p>

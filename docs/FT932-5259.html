			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Bett Bros Pounds 0.5m back in profit BETT BROS, the property investment and development group, returned to profit for the half year ended February 28 and resumed dividends after a one-year absence. Pre - tax profit was Pounds 551,000 and an interim dividend of 0.5p is being paid from earnings of 3.7p. That contained a contribution at the operating level from each activity - housing, property and Bett Inns, the pubs and hotels division. Bett was currently trading in line with expectations, the directors said. Further progress was expected in the second half. In the comparative half year the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.93m, equal to 66.2p per share. The deficit was reduced to Pounds 4.22m by the financial year-end. The directors said they were sufficiently confident that problems associated with certain of its south of England property developments were under control, although not yet completely resolved.</p>

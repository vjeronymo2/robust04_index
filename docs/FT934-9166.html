			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Hoechst loses premium after third quarter slide INFLATION figures in the US cut less ice than they did on Tuesday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT lost Tuesday afternoon's gains, the DAX index closing 1.10 higher on the session at 2,023.84, and the Ibis-indicated DAX falling from 2,040.74 to 2,020.11 at the post-bourse close. Turnover rose from DM7.8bn to DM8.4bn. Company results news was uninspiring or worse. Mr John Blackley of James Capel chose the first adjective to describe flat profits and dividend from Siemens, which ended the post-bourse with its shares in similar condition at DM715. Capel reckoned that heavy provisioning hit Hoechst, with the chemical company's pre-tax profits down by 40 per cent after nine months and worse in the September quarter. The shares fell DM5.50 to DM268.70, 60pfg higher than BASF - to which they stood at a DM41, or 20 per cent premium at the beginning of this year. Meanwhile, Asko's sensitivity to upcoming news was reflected in a new 1993 high on the sale of its stake in Adia, the Swiss employment agency group. The shares rose DM33 to DM991; the sale was predicted in March of this year, but the actuality meant that, for the German retailer, a potential liability was at an end. PARIS lost virtually all of Tuesday's gains. It was influenced by a number of factors, including a 13 per cent fall in Euro Disney. The CAC-40 index ended down 25.56 or 1.2 per cent at 2,087.33. Turnover was FFr3.6bn. The market will be closed today. Euro Disney was twice suspended, once before the announcement of its FFr5.3bn loss for the year ended September, and then when, on resumption, it went limit down at FFr37.40. The shares eventually closed off FFr5.70 at FFr38.00. Mr Michael Woodcock, French analyst at Nikko Europe, commented that the problem with the theme park had more to do with poor turnover of paying customers than expenses. 'The group has done all it can to reduce expenses, but it has failed so far to attract sufficient quality visitors who will spend,' he said. 'The park has also proved to be far more seasonal that Disney ever thought, and compared with other theme parks it still remains expensive.' The operation was faced with huge gearing and a need for massive restructuring, added Mr Woodcock, and it was going to be a long time before the shares attracted investment support. AMSTERDAM weakened, largely on technically inspired trading related to selling of futures and options. The CBS Tendency index eased 1.8 or 1.3 per cent to 134.2. Further negative reports regarding Alcazar, which involves negotiations between four European airlines on forming an alliance, left KLM down Fl 1.20 to Fl 38.10. Royal Dutch closed off Fl 2.40 to Fl 201.60 ahead of results which are expected to be released today; Unilever went against the trend with a gain of 60 cents to Fl 216.60. MILAN derived little benefit from Senate approval of key parts of the budget late on Tuesday. Shares were dragged lower again by further sharp falls in telecoms stocks. The Comit index gave up 12.93 or 2.4 per cent to 533.45. Sip shed L100 or 3.2 per cent to L3,004 in volume of 27.7m shares while Stet fell L192 or 5.2 per cent to L3,507 in volume of 21.9m shares. Analysts noted that the very high volume of trading in the shares indicated profit-taking by US investors, already unnerved by the country's fragile political situation. The sell-off was sparked on Tuesday by the exclusion of Italian companies from a possible link between AT &amp; T and the German and French state telephone companies, a development which, yesterday, many analysts doubted would have any negative impact in the medium term on Stet and Sip. Fiat, cutting December car output, shed L77 to L3,345 in volume of 9.4m shares following comments by Mr Giovanni Agnelli that recovery in European car demand could be delayed until the end of 1994. ZURICH continued higher although shares ended off their best levels with the market unable to maintain the momentum seen on Tuesday. The SMI index, 30 points ahead during the morning, finished 15.0 higher at 2,742.1. Bearer shares in Adia, the temporary employment group, shed SFr1 to SFr173 as the company announced that Mr Klaus Jacobs was buying the Adia stake held by Asko, the German retailer. However, the participation certificates surged SFr40 to SFr168 in response to news that they will be converted into bearers as part of a share simplification plan. Sulzer, the engineering group, eased SFr5 to SFr770 after a day's low of SFr764 in response to its forecast of steady profits but a fall in new orders. SMH dipped SFr6 to SFr224 as the watchmaker said it had chosen an as yet unnamed car producer as a partner to build its environmentally friendly Swatchmobile city car. MADRID's general index closed 1.12 higher at 300.66 in turnover of some Pta23bn. Trading was edgy, but Cepsa, the oils group, rose Pta25 to Pta2,410 on a 56 per cent rise in nine-month profits and Fecsa, the Catalan utility, put on Pta7 to Pta793 on Iberdrola's sale of a 4 per cent stake to Endesa.

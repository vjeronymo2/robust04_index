			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qeren Neubach] </F>   [Excerpts] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said today that  Syria possesses new Scud missiles which pose an even greater  threat than the ones Iraq had during the Gulf war. Rabin made  this observation in an address to the Zionist General Council  conference. Some of the conference participants, who paraded  with anti-government placards, were taken out of the auditorium.  Qeren Neubach reports:    [Begin recording] [Neubach] [passage omitted] After the  protesters were removed, Rabin was able to speak undisturbed.  He devoted a major part of his speech to the military threat  from Arab countries. Those who claim that the Arab world has no  military option against us, Rabin asserted, are frivolous and  irresponsible.    [Rabin] What is happening today in the Arab and Muslim  world? In addition to the Scud-B and Scud-C missiles, Syria has  just received production capability from North Korea. And,  believe me, the quantity and the quality of the Syrian  surface-to-surface missiles makes the Iraqi missiles, to which  we were subjected during the Gulf war, child's play.    [Neubach] As for the peace process, the prime minister said  that the only peace attained so far was achieved after Israel  responded to all the territorial demands of Egypt, its  negotiating partner at that time.    [Rabin] Those who say we should have peace as well as the  entire Golan are saying there will be no peace. There can be no  such thing! [end recording]    [Reporting on the same Rabin address, Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el  in Hebrew at 1600 GMT on 22 June adds: "Prime Minister Yitzhaq  Rabin said that what will avert war is the number of tanks on  the Golan Heights, and not the number of settlements. It may be  annoying, but it is a fact, the prime minister said."]</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Bank cuts base rate THE BANK of England signalled a  1/2 percentage point cut in UK interest rates yesterday by offering lower rates at the short end of its dealing operations in the discount market. The base rate reduction to 10 per cent was the first rate cut for nine months, but the market appeared unsure as to what time scale to put on money at this level of interest. After signalling a shortage of around Pounds 900m, the Bank purchased Pounds 10m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 659m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 5m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. That interest rate compared with a rate of 10 3/8 per cent offered for short-term bills in Bands-1 and 2 last week. The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 950m before taking account of the early operations. The bank subsequently purchased Pounds 300m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The overnight rate fell in line with the rate cuts, reaching a low on the day of 7 3/4 per cent and finishing at around 9 7/8 per cent. Other period rates, however, indicated, if anything, that the market expects this to be the last rate cut for some time. The rate for three-month money finished at 10 3/16 - 1/8 per cent, compared with 10 1/2 - 3/8 per cent one week ago. Further out, the rates ended at 10 3/16 - 1/16 per cent for everything from four-month money to one year. In the futures market, volumes were high in the wake of the base rate cut. After trading in a 12-tick range, the June short sterling contract finished at 89.92, after a high of 89.99. The closing price indicates an implied interest rate in June of 10.08 per cent, roughly in line with a 10 per cent base rate. The market's eyes are now fixed on whether the German Bundesbank might raise rates, a move that would put pressure on sterling following yesterday's reduction. Close attention will be paid to Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank's general council. 'Nobody in the market expects the Bundesbank to raise rates on Thursday,' said Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International. 'But there is a fear that German money supply figures for April will ratchet up again.' As a result, the market's focus is even more firmly set on the Bundesbank meeting in two week's time, after the M3 figures have come out.</p>

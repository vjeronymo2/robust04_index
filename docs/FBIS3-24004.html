The newly-elected President of  Crimea is interviewed by Sergei Tikhy, MN correspondent in Kiev.    MN: What, Yuri Alexandrovich, is the  superconfidentiality which surrounded your first visits as  President of Crimea to Kiev and Moscow linked to?    Yu.M.: If I were to speak about my trip to Kiev,  the point is not about superconfidentiality, but in the concrete  circumstances of this key meeting. A representative of the  administration was sent to the airport, the car arrived without  any escort. From the first moments I came to feel that my visit  was of no special importance for Kiev, and that there was no  special attitude towards the Republic of Crimea in comparison  with Ukraine's other regions. I convinced myself that the  meeting had a routine, rank-and-file character. It was a meeting  not with the President of the Republic of Crimea, but with a  clerk who represented some part of the administration. I had to  behave accordingly, as was dictated by the Kiev administration:  no press conferences and no coverage in the press -- all of this  would have been unreasonable, even illogical.    And as far as the meeting in Moscow is concerned, there I  felt like I was on native soil. The visit was businesslike and  concrete. Natural hospitality, a natural well-wishing reception,  and a lot of work. But in virtue of a number of circumstances I  didn't find it possible to broadly notify anyone about these  meetings in advance in order not to complicate things for  persons with whom I met.    MN: In what way could you have compounded these  persons' position?    Yu.M.: There was a warm attitude towards me and I,  for my part, made no moves without their agreement, without  obtaining permission for the coverage of this or that meeting in  the press.    MN: Who met you in Moscow?    Yu.M.: You are again leading me to specifics about  who participated in the meetings.    MN: Why, after your visit to Kiev where, as you have  said, you were received as a clerk, the press service of the  President of Ukraine circulated an official communique on the  visit which had been agreed upon with you, whereas in Moscow,  where you were accorded a welcome befitting a president, even  the information on who met you was classified? Incidentally,  were you accompanied in Moscow by the officials of the State  Traffic Inspectorate?    Yu.M.: In Moscow there was everything  indispensable for a meeting at such a level.    MN: Nevertheless, judging by press reports, you were  satisfied with the results of the Kiev meeting?    Yu.M.: Indeed, the discussion was normal,  concerning economic problems. I don't want to say that the  meeting was patently hostile in character or that attempts to  injure someone's pride were made during the course of it.    MN: The Supreme Soviet has adopted amendments to the  constitution in accordance with which the President of Ukraine  has the right to cancel the decisions of local authorities,  including your own. Do you anticipate clashes with Kiev on this  question in the immediate future?    Yu.M.: The adopted decision contradicts the  Constitution of Ukraine. The structure of the executive branch  has no right to decide questions on whether the statutory acts  being adopted by local authorities are consistent with the  Constitution. This is a prerogative of the Constitutional Court  of Ukraine.    MN: In other words, the decision of Ukraine's Supreme  Soviet is not legitimate, right?    Yu.M.: It is not legitimate in this given case.  Let's put it this way: it is a disputed issue.    MN: And what about the invitation to Mr. Saburov to  occupy the post of Crimea's head of government? Insofar as  Saburov has no Ukrainian citizenship, this flies in the face of  Ukraine's Constitution.    Yu.M.: The question is about deciding economic  matters. And if we begin pulling out commas and try to formalize  the procedure of appointment with commas, I will put so many  squiggles on the Kiev administration's table that they will be  sorting them out until the end of the year. Whatever has been  promised to the citizens of the Republic of Crimea will be  carried out. I have no other obligations to anyone. My  programme, for which the citizens voted, will be carried out  with the help of the most highly competent specialists.    MN: In other words, for the sake of fulfilling these  tasks you may violate the Ukrainian Constitution?    Yu.M.: This does not amount to a violation of the  Constitution of Ukraine. Such matters are decided by the  President of the Republic of Crimea.    MN: Under what conditions would the question of  Crimea's secession from Ukraine not be raised at all?    Yu.M.: But it has not been raised. The question is  about establishing normal civilized relations on the basis of a  treaty, as it is written down in the Constitution of the  Republic of Crimea.    MN: During the election campaign an adventurous,  putting it mildly, situation took shape in Crimea: pursuits,  assassination attempts, shootouts. It was even rumoured that  before the second round you left one of the apartments along the  fire escape. Is this true?    Yu.M.: I was guarded by the Scorpio group. The  boys volunteered and guaranteed me the highest level of security.    MN: And what about the fire escape?    Yu.M.: If I go into detail, this will take a lot  of time. The investigation is not yet over and many  circumstances are still being studied.    MN: Yuri Alexandrovich, your colleagues both here, in  Simferopol, and those in Kiev and Moscow have noted one feature  of yours: you give no names, no figures and no facts in general.  Is this your fundamental guidepost?    Yu.M.: If these remarks are essential, I will  surely listen to them and adjust my line of behaviour. The mass  media point to my weak, vulnerable sides, and I am grateful to  them for this.    MN: With what forces in Russia would you not cooperate  under any circumstances?    Yu.M.: With those people who preach views not  permitting a normal person to shake hands with them.    MN File: Yuri Alexandrovich Meshkov was born  in 1945 in Sinelnikovo, Dnepropetrovsk Region. Graduated from  Moscow University's Department of Law and worked as an  investigator at the Simferopol District Procurator's Office, a  post which he had to quit over a conflict with superiors. Worked  for three years on the merchant fleet. In 1990 was elected  deputy to the Crimean Regional Soviet (subsequently, the Supreme  Soviet of the Republic of Crimea). Worked as a lawyer. In 1991  the leadership of Crimea's Bar turned to the leadership of the  Regional Soviet with a request to dismiss lawyer Meshkov for  numerous violations and complaints from the clientele. In August  1991 Yuri Meshkov was among the few Crimean politicians who  denounced the coup leaders. In January 1994 was elected  President of the Republic of Crimea. Is married and has two  children.</p>

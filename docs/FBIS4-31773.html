			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 13 (CTK) -- Former Premier  Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) will  lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Court against  President Michal Kovac because he allegedly breached his  constitutional duty to call referendum, Tibor Cabaj, chairman of  the HZDS deputies group, said today. The Slovak Constitution  stipulates that the president can be dismissed if he fails to  observe his constitutional duties.    In February the HZDS organized a petition campaign in  support  of a referendum through which they wanted to resolve the  political crisis. The citizens had to decide on three issues:  calling early elections, exclusion of the "renegade deputies"  from parliament (Meciar's cabinet fell because some of the HZDS  deputies had left the party which lost the majority in  parliament), and explanation of the origin of money used in  privatization. However, in March Kovac refused to call the  referendum because the 350,000 signatures, required by the  Constitution, had not been collected, as the Presidential Office  had found.    In the meantime, the parliament has dismissed Meciar's  cabinet and set the early elections for this autumn. The HZDS  has checked again the collected signatures and found out that  out of 422,054, 372,054 were valid so that Kovac ought to have  called the referendum, Cabaj said.    Katarina Tothova, the justice minister in Meciar's cabinet,  pointed to a contradiction in the statement by the Presidential  Office which had said in March that only 232,957 were authentic,  while at present it acknowledged validity of almost 325,000  signatures. She noted that law which had been in force in  February, did not stipulate that exact address and  identification number were necessary, as required now by the  amended law on referendum which had been passed last week.  Tothova also denied an allegation by Peter Weiss, chairman of  the Democratic Left Party (SDL), that the HZDS was preparing  another referendum which would shorten Kovac's five-year term.  Kovac was elected last year. "I do not know anything about  another petition committee," she added.</p>

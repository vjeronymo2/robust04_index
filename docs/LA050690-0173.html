			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELAYS ON CANAL WORK UNNECESSARY  </P> <P> As longtime canal residents and property owners, we found Nancy Hill-Holtzman's  April 22 article on the Venice Canals misleading.  </P> <P> The original concrete bulkhead project sponsored by the Venice Canals Assn. was  acknowledged as environmentally unsound in the Environmental Impact Report that  the VCA bought for the city.  </P> <P> That city bureaucrats and some property owners chose to repeatedly ignore  numerous environmental and historical cautions from the federal and state  agencies does not warrant a revision of the facts.  </P> <P> Simply put, the VCA lobbied the city, reality was ignored, and hundreds of  taxpayers' dollars were spent developing a project that was predictably  unacceptable to the state and federal agencies that had final approval. It is  to Councilwoman (Ruth) Galanter's credit that once she assumed office she  refused to allow the city to waste anymore Coastal Commission time on this  fiasco.  </P> <P> We are disappointed that Councilwoman Galanter is going to allow the VCA to  delay the project for another 18 months. During the past two years, at the  request of the VCA, the city has conducted many studies of Amorflex and  Loffelstein (types of concrete blocks). These studies always come to the same  conclusion, that Amorflex is safer, more environmentally appropriate, and  significantly less costly (two to three times) than Loffelstein.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Galanter needs to bring this to a closure. Trying to satisfy the  VCA is expensive, time-consuming and impossible. There is nothing to debate and  the city should stop pandering to the VCA. All of the experts say that Amorflex  is the material to use.  </P> <P> HELEN and BART FALLON  </P> <P> Venice  </P></p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Hong Kong Hong Kong equities continue to rise above politics. The Hang Seng index pushed through 10,000 yesterday, despite deadlock in talks on the colony's future. On a multiple of 14.5 times next year's forecast earnings - against a long-term average of 12.5 times - the market is now deep in uncharted territory. Against the heady ratings of Singapore and Malaysia, though, the Hang Seng looks a laggard. While the message from China remains soothing, the temptation will be to press higher. If new issues are any guide, international interest has barely cooled. The flotation of Kunming Machine Tool, the Chinese company which made its debut last week, was 628 times oversubscribed. While capital is flowing into Hong Kong at such a rate, talk of currency risk might seem far-fetched. The peg with the US dollar has survived 10 years of turbulence, including Tiananmen Square. The authorities have accumulated formidable reserves and are presently concerned with holding the Hong Kong dollar down. Still, bonds issued by the Mass Transit Railway Corporation have been downgraded by Moody's, partly on the grounds that the peg might not survive a Chinese shock. That is a reminder that flow of capital could easily swing into reverse.</p>

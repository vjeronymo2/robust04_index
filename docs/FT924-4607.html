			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): Muck and brass coffins HOW TO BECOME DEAD RICH by Howard Hodgson Pavilion Books, Pounds 13.99, 168 pages BRITAIN IN the 1980s was the place to be if you were young, enterprising and out to make a fortune. The heady atmosphere of the times was particularly conducive to growing businesses based on clever ideas and succeeding even on limited capital - even if the line of work was in funerals. Howard Hodgson, fifth generation in a family of funeral directors, made his fortune in the late 1980s by providing quality services for the dead. How to Become Dead Rich is the story of the rise of Hodgson from the young owner of a struggling funeral business about to fall into the hands of the receivers to a semi-retired multi-millionaire with enough wealth to 'keep his family in riches for generations.' Hodgson recounts, in a light, conversational style, how at the age of 25, he bought his father's loss-making funeral business for Pounds 14,000 and in 15 years built it up into a listed company worth Pounds 90m. He did so through a series of ambitious takeovers, rationalisations and the introduction of modern business practices to an industry that had been for decades ruled by convention and plagued by fragmentation and inefficiency. It also took the ambitious, entrepreneur 15 years of hard work, extraordinary drive and self-confidence to achieve what he did in such a short time span. However, identifying a good business opportunity and capitalising on it are only half the story. In his narrative Hodgson implies that much of his success stems from his own qualities. A school report describes him as 'pompous, arrogant, self-opinionated and inclined to think he is always right.' But he also 'hates to be thwarted in his desires,' and is 'courageous.' The reader gets the impression that it is those qualities which combined to create an unshakeable faith in his own actions that was crucial to his success. Hodgson, nevertheless, acknowledges that he was also helped by the particular business environment of the latter 1980s. He describes how he was able to expand his business on the back of the rising UK stock market. 'As Thatcherism and the bull market rolled on, Hodgson Holdings rolled with them. The personal and corporate publicity I received in abundance was of great benefit in keeping the Hodgson share price on the boil.' Hodgson knew how to take advantage of his company's surging share price. 'With my own shares on multiples in the 40s and 50s I was able to swallow others on multiples in single figure thus further enhancing my own earnings per share and consequently my share price.' In the 12 months to the end of October 1988, the company acquired 64 businesses. The book provides an entertaining insight into the conditions and personal qualities which enabled an ambitious and resourceful youth to create enormous wealth by shaking up an industry that was ripe for consolidation. Unfortunately, the story of Hodgson's years as an entrepreneurial undertaker, by far the more interesting part of the book, is marred by tiresome chapters of 'how to' advice which is supposed to help the budding entrepreneur on his road to wealth. The guidance he has to offer ranges from the basic - 'Listen to what people have to say and be objective.' - to the bizarre: 'When choosing your management team avoid people who make a lot of noise about being sworn socialists. Such people are often either well-intentioned, old-fashioned hypocrites or badly intentioned rather clever hypocrites.' The book also disappoints in its failure to set the winning qualities he points to against the somewhat different economic and business climate currently prevailing in the UK. While business opportunities exist in any age for the truly enterprising, the frenzied deal-making atmosphere of the go-go 1980s has evaporated in the recession. The 'enfant terrible' of funeral directing sold his stake and conveniently retired from the business in 1991, just as the party was coming to a disastrous end. Hodgson is building up a second business, this time in financial services, while the funeral business he sold has recently had to turn to its shareholders for money to reduce borrowings left over from years of profligacy.</p>

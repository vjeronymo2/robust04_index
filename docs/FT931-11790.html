			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: Deficit hopes spur rally in Treasuries WASHINGTON insiders have been quick to criticise the two-week old Clinton administration for policy indecisions or U-turns. Yet opinion polls show the mood in the country at large is much more forgiving, and for now that seems to include the bond market. The Treasury market continued to rally last week, with the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue ending on Friday night at 7.19 per cent, 10 basis points down on the week and the lowest in six and a half years, while the five-year note dropped 20 basis points to 5.54 per cent. Yet this happened just as the latest economic data showed growth accelerating in the fourth quarter of last year, to an annual rate of 3.8 per cent, the fastest in four years, and as Clinton officials indicated that an early priority would be a fiscal stimulus of around Dollars 20bn. A few months ago, such a combination of figures might well have sent bond yields soaring, on market fears that a Democratic White House was preparing to let the inflationary genie out of the bottle. But for now Wall Street seems happy to buy an altogether sunnier story, which tells of long bond yields eventually dipping below the 7 per cent yield barrier, in spite of some inevitable setbacks along the way. The optimism begins with an examination of the latest statistics on gross domestic product growth, which are solid, but still modest by the standards of past recoveries from recession. The labour market remains weak, as demonstrated last week by news of fresh job cuts at retailer Sears, Roebuck and the aerospace industry's Boeing and Pratt &amp; Whitney. The economy, say the bond market optimists, is sufficiently strong both to make recovery self-sustaining and to curb any major pump-priming by the Clinton administration, but not so strong that inflation is likely to re-appear as a problem in the near future. No tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve is in prospect. The President's Dollars 20bn stimulus package, runs this argument, is sufficiently modest that it will have relatively little real impact on an economy the size of the US, while allowing Mr Clinton to fulfil his election campaign promise to 'get America moving again'. His political credibility established, Mr Clinton can then get down to the much more important question of cutting the federal budget deficit. Much of the bond market's optimism stems from signs that the new administration is seriously addressing the deficit question. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the new Treasury secretary, helped spark last week's rally with suggestions that the administration was considering both energy and broad-based consumption taxes to help reduce the deficit. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, also helped, when he endorsed Mr Clinton's pledge to cut Dollars 145bn from the projected deficit for 1997 as a credible deficit-reduction target. The long end of the market has also been helped by signs that the new administration is seriously considering an idea previously floated by the Bush administration: cutting the federal government's funding costs by reducing the issuance of 30-year bonds and selling more shorter-dated, cheaper paper. There has even been market speculation - which does not appear to be well founded - that long bond issuance could be cut back sharply as early as this month's refunding. But for all this optimism, the bond market's honeymoon with Mr Clinton will remain volatile, subject to the administration's each passing policy thought until Mr Clinton spells out just what he plans to do in a February 17 speech to Congress. It could yet all end in tears. The new President has shown himself adept at making promises, but his political backbone remains in question. For now, Wall Street is giving him the benefit of the doubt.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pedro Ross Leal, secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation [CTC], chaired the workers parliaments  summary meeting in Las Tunas Province. The language of  efficiency was spoken at the work centers in Las Tunas and  results can already be seen in many of those centers, which are  directly linked to proposals made by the workers during the  parliaments. This was demonstrated during the analysis at the  meeting summarizing the workers parliaments process in the  province.    The Ministry of Agriculture [Minag], for example, has  increased the personnel directly involved in production by 10  percent. Minag also hopes to reduce its losses during 1994.  According to a preliminary analysis, only 14 of its 306 Basic  Cooperative Production Units [UBPC] will be unprofitable. On  this, Pedro Ross Leal said:    [Begin Ross Leal recording] Because if we are not more  efficient with the resources we have, we have not solved any  problem. That is where measures must be taken. [end recording]    Approximately 117,000 workers participated in the 2,577  parliaments held in Las Tunas. Some of the ideas proposed were:  increasing administrative demands; not subsidizing unprofitable  enterprises; increasing the creation of UBPC; changing currency;  and confiscating money and properties obtained through shady  sources.    At the conclusion of the analysis of the workers parliaments  in Las Tunas, Pedro Ross gave the provincial CTC the banner  declaring it foremost in the country in the financing of the  Territorial Troops Militia.</p>

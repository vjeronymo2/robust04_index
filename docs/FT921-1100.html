			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / EC launches computer guide A guidebook to help European public sector procurement officials cope with the maze of standards and specifications for 'open systems' computer and telecommunications equipment will be launched by the European Commission in Brussels today, writes Paul Taylor. 'Open systems' are designed to work easily with similar systems made by other manufacturers, unlike proprietary systems which are difficult to link. EC member states spend more than Ecu600bn (Pounds 430bn) a year on public procurement, and a growing proportion of that is on information technology. The move towards open systems within the EC is intended to complement the emergence of the single market which increasingly requires such systems for the free movement of computerised information.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: BTR condemns offshoot's window dressing BTR, the industrial conglomerate, yesterday condemned the year-end balance sheet 'window-dressing' activities of Pilkington's Tiles, one of its subsidiaries. The move followed revelations that the financial controller at Pilkington's Tiles had sent suppliers letters asking them to wait for invoice payments due at the end of November until after the group's December 31 year-end. In return Pilkington's suggested it would be willing to reciprocate for suppliers. Such an arrangement would typically enable the participants to show stronger year-end balance sheets. Yesterday BTR said: 'We neither authorise nor recommend letters of this sort. Optimising cash flow and managing working capital are normal commercial practices for most efficient companies and BTR is no exception. 'The BTR group as a whole is doing no more this year than it usually does. We are not concerned about our cash flow or gearing. The group has progressively reduced its gearing from 95 per cent at December 31, to 46 per cent at end of June this year.' Asked what action, if any, BTR intended to take against its subsidiary, the company added: 'We are currently examining the circumstances in which the letters were issued.' Analysts suggested yesterday that it was common practice for big companies to attempt to improve their cash flow and reduce their working capital. The Pilkington's Tiles' proposal, however, is embarrassing for BTR since it appears to go beyond the normal bounds of prudent balance sheet management. It also flies in the face of government and Confederation of British Industry's exhortations to big companies to reduce the length of time taken to settle bills from small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Sharp gear change - How Nissan suppliers are using training to fight hard times In the canteen of Nissan Yamato Engineering's steel pressings plant on the edge of Sunderland, a curious scene greets visitors. At one end, the cooks are preparing lunch but the pepper pots and water jugs on the tables have been pushed aside, to clear space for graphs and charts. Poring over the paperwork are teams of overalled shopfloor workers. Normally, these Wearside employees would be at home asleep, recovering from the nightshift, or producing steel pressings and welded assemblies, mostly for transportation every 15 minutes, under the Just in Time production system, to the adjacent Nissan car plant. Instead, for six weeks at a time, they are studying Total Productive Maintenance and Data Analysis Problem Solving. The reason for this sudden change of gear is the sharp downturn in the Continental European car market. This has forced Nissan Motor Manufacturing (UK), on which NYEL is totally dependent, to halve output from November 1993 to the end of February 1994 at its Pounds 900m Sunderland plant. The nightshift has been suspended and Nissan's 2,400 production staff put onto alternate weeks on day shift for the four months. An 'agreed separation programme' has been launched, offering volunteers six months pay to leave. So far over 250 have gone but Nissan will not say yet how many more it expects to shed. The original 1993 production target was 270,000. Output levels for 1994 are expected to be between 200,000 and 240,000 cars but the final figure will not be certain until the new year. Nissan's immediate problems, and uncertainty over next year's production target, are a painful headache for the eight synchronous and Just In Time suppliers set up nearby since the mid-1980s to serve the car plant. Its 1994 output target and the detailed breakdown between models and specifications provide vital planning information for these factories whose output goes mainly - in some cases solely - to Nissan. Most had intended to diversify their customer base but the European downturn bit before the majority of the factories, mostly under five years old, had tied up many other deals. A number are at present actively seeking new customers, but the downturn throughout the automotive industry has depressed prospects. For most, stockpiling is not an option because they are intimately locked into Nissan's production cycle; for example, a carpet is fitted into a Sunderland-made car precisely 42 minutes after the nearby Sommer Industrie carpet plant receives the order. Nor are redundancies an easy option for suppliers imbued with the culture of continuous improvement - or Kaizen as the Japanese call it. Their carefully selected workforces have been encouraged to unstinting effort by the expectation of secure employment. Moreover, sacrificing expensively trained, high quality employees could prove shortsighted if, as the motor trade hopes, the European market picks up before too long. Even so, the philosophy of job security is under severe strain; exhaust system maker Calsonic has shed 37 people, a quarter of its workforce, and brake and fuel line supplier Bundy a dozen, from a workforce of 53. Car seat supplier Ikeda Hoover, which employs 490, is to make between 20 and 90 people redundant, and Nissan Yamato, 80 per cent Nissan owned, has launched its own agreed separation programme. But, more unusually, the suppliers have been minimising or preventing redundancies by launching ambitious attempts to win long-term advantage from adversity. Capitalising on the extra employee time available due to the production downturn, they have brought forward training programmes, stepped up brainstorming on quality and submitted their line layouts and production methods to exhaustive analysis. 'Our philosophy is to strengthen the organisation; although it's a difficult position at the moment, we firmly believe there's a very good long term future for ourselves and NMUK,' says Phil Manning, personnel manager at Hashimoto's Boldon plant, a synchronous supplier to Nissan of metal and plastic body fitting parts. Output at Hashimoto has virtually halved but, so far, all 295 employees remain. Sommer Industrie is committed to retaining its 105 employees at least until the end of February. Those not needed for production are working on improvements to organisation, quality, costs and delivery. The sheer size of the Nissan workforce means half its production employees must stay at home each week at present; the plant cannot accommodate them all at once. But the suppliers , with their smaller workforces, have opted to bring all their employees into work each day so those not on production work undertake purposeful improvement activities. Even the basic logistics can be difficult; at NYEL, where 160 of the 580 employees are normally on nightshift, a temporary additional car park had to be built, costing several thousand pounds. The 8am start has been staggered, with employees arriving from 6am to avoid traffic congestion. And the canteen is doubling up as a training area since none of the meeting rooms is big enough. 'It's a four-month opportunity for us,' says NYEL general manager Mr Brian Cobb. 'Things are going to pick up and we want to be ready for them.' But he adds: 'I hope it doesn't last too long.' As well as bringing forward training in subjects like transfer press technology, NYEL is stepping up training for shopfloor workers in maintenance techniques and reviewing production line layout. Moving equipment in one cell has saved about five square metres; significant when multiplied. NYEL has volunteers for its agreed separation programme. Some are young bachelors tempted by the chance of a lump sum to clear off debts. Others are family men who have calculated that, without the 16.6 per cent shift bonus for night work, they would be better off unemployed than on the production staff's Pounds 11,600 basic rate. For many, the intensive training weeks are a welcome break from repetitive production work, although tinged with anxiety. 'A lot of people are pleased in some respects to get off production but they're concerned what the final outcome will be,' says Andy Seddon, a Kaizen technician. As yet, it is unclear what 1994 will bring these men and their workmates, although NYEL is adamant there will be no enforced redundancies. 'Like the rest of the supply group, we're just waiting to see,' says Mr Cobb.</p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Dunhill's slide prompts 12% share price fall SHARES in Dunhill Holdings fell 11.6 per cent, from 379p to 335p, after the luxury goods group reported lower pre-tax profits and warned about trading prospects in the current year. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 76m to Pounds 70.7m in the year to March 31, although sales increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 327m. Operating profits were flat at Pounds 55.5m, but interest income fell from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 15.2m. Lord Douro, chairman, said trading profit had been maintained in spite of a substantial downturn in consumer spending in Japan, weakening economies in Germany, Italy and Spain and only very hesitant recoveries in the US and UK. He added: 'Trading in recent months indicates that unless these leading economies improve in the near future it is unlikely that the group will be able to sustain this level of operating profit in the current year.' Alfred Dunhill's luxury accessories such as leather goods and watches had been affected by reduced demand both in Japan and from Japanese tourists elsewhere in the Far East. However, results in Europe had been encouraging. Montblanc fountain pens had achieved an excellent result in a year in which it had taken control of distribution in several of its major markets. Sales of the men's outfitter Hackett's had increased substantially from a small base, mainly because of the opening of a flagship shop in Sloane Street, London. The Karl Lagerfeld fashion brand, for which Dunhill paid up to Pounds 16m in June, had a successful year. Chloe, the fashion and perfume house, had benefited from increased sales of ready-to-wear clothes as a result of Lagerfeld's re-appointment as designer. Net cash fell from Pounds 180m to Pounds 120m following the purchase of Seeger, a German leather manufacturer, the Lagerfeld brand, and Montblanc's distribution companies in the US, Italy and Japan. The chairman said about half the Pounds 70m of extra turnover was accounted for by acquisitions, which contributed Pounds 4m to operating profit. Some 30 per cent of sales are in Europe, including the UK, 46 per cent in Asia/Pacific and 21 per cent in the US. Mr Graham Searle, group managing director, will retire in July. Lord Douro said the board had decided not to appoint a new chief executive, as each of the individual companies in the group was run as a separate entity, with its own managing director. Earnings per share fell to 26.4p (28.4p). A final dividend of 5.25p raises the total from 7.7p to 8.15p. See Lex</p>

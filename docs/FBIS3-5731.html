			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 10 KYODO -- Japan's airline industry  leader sought correction Thursday [10 March] in what he views as  "an inequality" in the Japan-U.S. aviation accord. Susumu  Yamaji, chairman of Japan Airlines Co. (JAL), told a luncheon  meeting sponsored by the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan,  "we want a U.S.-Japan agreement which reflects today's  conditions instead of the position of 40 years ago."    International aviation should be governed by a bilateral  agreement based on "a give-and-take principle," he said. But  the current accord between Tokyo and Washington, a product of  the postwar period, was influenced by "the circumstances of the  time when the power of the United States was overwhelming," he  said.    Yamaji, also chairman of the International Air Transport  Association (IATA) Executive Committee, has led the Japanese  team in civil aviation talks with the U.S.    Yamaji said Japanese airlines, for example, have only two  weekly "beyond rights" flights from Tokyo to Brazil via Los  Angeles, while U.S. airlines have 149 weekly flights beyond  Japan to countries in North and South Asia and Australia.    He also said that under the pact, Japan is forced to take a  "rather peculiar" route to Mexico via Vancouver, rather than the  more cost-effective route via Los Angeles.    "U.S. airlines are exploiting the full benefits of their  very advantageous position stemming from the 40-year-old  accord," he said.    Yamaji said U.S. airlines, bent on fully employing their  "outdated" rights, are attempting to further grab their share  and control of global markets, advocating free competition under  the name of "open skies." But the attitude has angered more and  more countries, prompting France and Thailand to end their  agreements with the U.S., and Germany once came close to doing  so, he said.    "When you talk about liberalization, you have to prepare  rules that offer fair chances to all players," Yamaji said. He  said Japan is not considering forming an alliance with other  Asian countries that have disputes with the U.S. in future  talks with Washington.    On a reported plan by JAL to raise its air fares in first-  and business-class seats on overseas routes, Yamaji said it  reflects "business judgment" made by IATA.    Any airline belonging to the 225-airline IATA must receive  its approval for a fare hike. The plan is then accepted by the  transport authorities of each country.    JAL's latest move came at a time when global airlines are  aiming to trim fares in order to survive the intensified race.    JAL has decided to slash fares for economy class, Yamaji  said. JAL, which suffered around 50 billion in pretax losses in  the latest accounting year, is expected to incur a similar loss  in the current year that ends in March.</p>

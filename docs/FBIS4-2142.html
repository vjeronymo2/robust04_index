			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Li Niangui (2621 1628 6311): "China's Internally </F> Circulated Data Reveal Maltreatment of Workers in  Foreign-Invested Enterprises"]    [Text] (Editor's note: This year's February issue of the  internally circulated CPC magazine NEICAN XUANBIAN [0355 0639  6693 4882 -- Selected Reports for Internal Reference] includes a  report by XINHUA reporter Li Niangui which reflects the fact  that foreign-invested enterprises pay no attention to the safety  of workers and that the workers are maltreated. The report  enumerates shocking examples and statistics. We have reprinted  the report here. Its original title was: Some Foreign-Invested  Enterprises Seriously Encroach on the Legitimate Rights and  Interests of Workers.)    The meeting of the presidium of the Second Session of the  12th All-China Federation of Trade Unions, which concluded not  long ago, analyzed labor relations in foreign-invested  enterprise and felt deep concern about how some foreign-invested  enterprises had violated relevant Chinese laws and regulations,  and had seriously encroached on the legitimate rights and  interests of workers. It hoped that the departments concerned  would attach importance to and concern themselves with this  issue.    At present, 153,000 foreign-invested enterprises have been  approved on the Chinese mainland, of which 47,000 enterprises,  employing more than five million workers, have been completed  and put into operation. On the whole, the labor relations in  foreign- invested enterprises are stable, and most  foreign-invested enterprises operate and organize production  according to the law, but there are some quite serious  labor-relations problems in some foreign-invested enterprises.  According to surveys recently conducted by the All-China  Federation of Trade Unions, there are five conspicuous problems:  <H5>  Safety Neglected, Labor Conditions Poor </H5>   1. The labor and living conditions of workers are very poor.  Even the most basic labor-protection measures in safety and  sanitation are lacking. Accidents occur frequently and the  safety of workers' lives is not guaranteed. Surveys conducted  by provincial and city trade unions in Guangdong, Fujian,  Shandong, and Zhejiang show that in many foreign-invested  enterprises -- especially some labor-intensive enterprises for  manufacturing plastics, toys, shoes, and textiles -- the  workshops are crowded with people and equipment, and are hot and  sultry. The air there is polluted, and the noise far exceeds  permitted levels. Zhuhai carried out a survey in seven  foreign-invested enterprises and found that the levels of such  toxic gases as benzene, toluene, and dimethyl benzene in the air  exceeded national standards by eight to 10 times. The  quarantine departments in Xiamen carried out tests on the  air-borne dust content at 21 points in 11 foreign-invested  enterprises, and found that permitted standards were exceeded at  14; air-borne toxic gases were tested at 23 points, at which  permitted standards were exceeded at 18; and noise volume was  tested at 69 points, with permitted standards exceeded at 33. A  nonmetallugical limited company in Fuzhou carried out open  operations, long- prohibited in China, at its pyrophyllite  pencil stone crushing section. The dust concentration exceeded  national standards by more than 100 times. Shenzhen checked the  health check-up forms of 260 staff and workers in  foreign-invested enterprises and found that 46 of them suffered  from anaemia or had abnormalities in white blood cells or blood  platelets, or had warning indications of other diseases in their  blood.    What is even more serious is that some foreign-invested  enterprises have ignored production safety, as well as China's  labor protection laws and regulations. Serious man-made  industrial accidents occur often and the safety of the workers'  lives is not ensured. In a tableware company that employs 400  workers in Xiamen, 38 industrial accidents have occurred since  it started operation four years ago and 39 workers had their  fingers crushed. Recently, two large fires occurred in Shenzhen  and Fuzhou in less than a month, resulting in the deaths of 144  people.   <H5>    Insult, Punishment, and Beating </H5>   2. Workers are insulted, punished, or beaten, and their  personal rights are encroached upon at will. Some  foreign-invested enterprises do not respect minimum human  rights, ignore China's laws, and use extremely brutal and  backward management methods. Some enterprises have established  rules forbidding workers to go to the toilet, to drink water, or  to see doctors during work hours, and offenders are asked to  stand before the others wearing a placard. A shoe plant in  Putian, Fujian, punishes workers by asking them to stand in the  rain, stand in the sun, or leap like frogs. A foreign  management supervisor at the Shenmei Household Necessities  Company in Shenyang found that a glass item had not been cleaned  properly. He went as far as forcing the worker concerned to lick  it with his tongue. A Taiwan businessman in Guangdong even  punished several dozen members of a work team for a mistake made  by only one of them, asking them to kneel on the floor. In  1993, case after case of male "security" personnel illegally  searching women workers were found in Tianjin and Qingdao. A  restaurant run by a Japanese businessman in Shanghai once even  illegally asked women workers to take off all their clothes  during a search. Some foreign-invested enterprises even  employed "supervisors" and "foremen" to serve as roughnecks.  <H5>  Working Extra Hours </H5>   3. Workers are compelled to work extra hours and labor  quotas are set beyond the bodily strength of the workers. The  eight-hour work day is the most basic right and interest the  working class all over the world has struggled to achieve. The  relevant laws and regulations in China also include explicit  provisions on festivals, holidays, and days off. In quite a few  foreign-invested enterprises, however, these legitimate rights  and interests of workers have been willfully violated. In  August last year, the Guangdong Provincial Labor Bureau carried  out a survey in 17 foreign-invested enterprises in Shenzhen,  Zhuhai, and Dongguan. It discovered that work hours at most of  these enterprises were 10 to 12 hours daily, and there were no  Sundays or days off. The Guangdong Provincial Federation of  Trade Unions carried out a survey in 105 foreign-invested  enterprises and discovered that with the exception of seven, in  which the workers work three shifts, all the rest asked their  workers to work extra hours. An enterprise even asked workers  to work 36 hours at a stretch. Some foreign-invested  enterprises increase workers' labor quotas at will. In a  Sino-Japanese joint-venture watch company in Zhuhai, the labor  quota per worker per shift in the the workshop turning out  second hands is fixed at 4,000 pieces, while the quota set in  Japan is only 2,500.  <H5>  Wages Are Deducted, in Arrears, and Embezzled </H5>   4. Wages are on the low side, and the wages and overtime pay  of workers are deducted, in arrears, and embezzled at will.  Regulations in China state that the wages of workers in  foreign-invested enterprises are not to be less than 120 percent  of the average of those of state-owned enterprises with similar  conditions of the same trade in the same locality. However, the  wages of workers in many foreign-invested enterprises are on the  low side, and some of them are even lower than the lowest local  wage standard. In Shenzhen's Shekou Industrial Zone, for  example, the Kaida Enterprise Company Ltd, which employs more  than 1,300 people, pays workers only five to seven yuan per day,  nearly half the lowest wage standard of 11.2 yuan per day in  1993 as announced by the Shenzhen City Government. According to  a survey carried out in 75 foreign-invested enterprises in the  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou Special Economic Zones [SEZ], the  lowest wage standard of workers in 41 enterprises is lower than  that published by local governments of the SEZ's. These  enterprises account for 55 percent of the surveyed total. The  lowest wages of workers are only 140 yuan a month.  <H5>  Not Signing Contracts and Not Fulfilling Contracts </H5>   5. Workers are not recruited openly, but at will. Labor  contracts are not signed with workers and signed labor contracts  are not implemented strictly.    Some foreign-invested enterprises do not sign labor  contracts with workers. As a result, workers' jobs are not  safeguarded, the workers are not insured against unemployment,  and workers' legitimate rights and interests are not protected  by law. The Qingdao City Federation of Trade Unions carried out  a survey in 48 foreign-invested enterprises and found that 11  had signed labor contracts with only some workers, and four had  not signed any labor contracts at all. In 1992, Shenzhen  carried out a general inspection on enforcing labor laws, made  selective examinations among 280,000 workers and 205  enterprises, and discovered that 17 percent of workers had not  gone through any labor formalities. The number of  foreign-invested enterprises in the Shantou SEZ and Zhuhai which  have not signed labor contracts accounts for 70 and 90 percent,  respectively, of the total of such enterprises. Although some  foreign-invested enterprises sign labor contracts with workers,  the rights and obligations of the two sides are not on an equal  basis. The contents of some contracts clearly violate the law,  while those of others are self-contradictory. In the contracts  of a joint-venture enterprise in Shanghai, there are articles  restricting the time for workers to go to the toilet, stating  the number of years during which workers may not fall in love  with others, and giving enterprise management the power to  dismiss any worker who does not follow the arrangements for  working extra work hours. The labor contracts of a large  restaurant in Shanghai had two versions, in Chinese and English,  but the contents of these two versions were completely  different. The boss let the workers read the Chinese version,  but asked them to sign the English one. Before the probation  period was over, some workers could no longer stand the illegal  practices of using detectors to search them or to search their  bags, and wanted to terminate their contracts although they had  to forfeit 340 yuan of cash pledge as stated in their Chinese  contracts. However, the administration of the restaurant took  out the English versions of the contracts, which stated that the  workers had to pay 5,000 yuan in compensation, in addition to  the cast pledge. A Shenyang enterprise, which was entirely  owned by a businessman from the Republic of Korea, took  advantage of the six- month probation period for new workers.  It recruited workers secretly, dismissed them in less than six  months, and recruited other workers in a bid to avoid signing  labor contracts or paying workers' insurance fees. At present,  most foreign-invested enterprises recruit young workers, then  dismiss them within a few years. In reality, this is to shift  the responsibility for paying workers' pensions onto society,  and will constitute a problem for China in the future.  <H5>  Work Stoppages, Strikes, and Go-Slows </H5>   Owing to frequent conflicts between labor and capital in  some  foreign-invested enterprises and because of tense labor  relations, some unexpected events have occurred, such as  suspension of work, strikes, and large numbers of people  applying for an audience with the higher authorities to appeal  for help. They have affected social stability and security. In  1991, the Shanghai municipal arbitration organs handled 70 cases  of major labor disputes at foreign-invested enterprises; in  1992, the number increased to 111. In Fujian Province, the  number of major labor disputes occurring at foreign-invested  enterprises in 1993 was 582 cases more than in 1991, an increase  of 82.7 percent. In Shenzhen from January to May 1993, there  were 185 cases of large numbers of workers applying for an  audience with the higher authorities to appeal for help, as well  as six strikes, with more than 100 workers taking part in each.  Twelve cases of work stoppages or go-slows occurred in the  Dalian Economic and Technology Development Zone in the first  half of 1993.</p>

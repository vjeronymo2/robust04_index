			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Fujitsu plant set for extra Pounds 300m The County Durham microchip plant owned by Fujitsu, the Japanese electronics group, is on target for a further Pounds 300m-plus of investment, creating hundreds of jobs, Mr Llew Aviss, personnel director, said yesterday. He announced that the plant at Newton Aycliffe, Fujitsu's only European semiconductor manufacturing operation, moved into profit last October, earlier than expected. The plant has also won an award from its Japanese parent as the best factory of the Fujitsu group's 400 operating units worldwide. Mr Aviss said that the company had agreed 'in theory' to doubling later this decade its facilities at the Newton Aycliffe plant. The site's present facilities will reach capacity in 1996. He added: 'We need sustained output and profitability from here on to justify the next level of investment.' The plant's performance in clearing the debt accumulated in its start-up phase will be a crucial factor. Mr Aviss expects a final decision on further investment in early 1998. If approved, work would begin almost immediately. He predicted that total employment at the site would reach 1,200 by the 2001. Investment by then will have exceeded Pounds 650m. This compares with an original forecast that the project would create 1,500 jobs in a Pounds 400m investment. The factory at Newton Aycliffe, run by Fujitsu subsidiary Fujitsu Microelectronics, opened in July 1991 and began commercial production in December 1991. It now employs 500 people, and is set to reach a maximum of 600 in its present facilities. Investment, now nearing Pounds 315m, is expected to be Pounds 350m in this first phase. The plant now produces almost 2m microchips a month. Operating profit in the second half of 1993-94 was Pounds 10m on a full-year turnover of Pounds 100m. In the first half of 1994-95, operating profit is expected to be Pounds 20m. Turnover in 1994-95 will be about Pounds 110m.</p>

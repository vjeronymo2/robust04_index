			<p>BFN     [Text] The Italian Popular Party [PPI] has rejected the  invitation made yesterday by Achille Occhetto [secretary of the  Party of the Democratic Left -- PDS] to form a common opposition  front. The news was revealed in a communique by Rosa Russo  Jervolino.    "What makes our opposition different, she explained, is its  sense of responsibility. It will be orientated toward the  common good (we are not part of the culture of extremism) and it  will have the capacity of making serious counterproposals. It  is for these reasons and because of their substantial ambiguity  that the invitation to join the PDS has received our courteous  but firm rejection."</p>

			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Industry heyday THE INDUSTRY'S heyday was in the mid 1950s, when output ran at 225m tonnes a year. Since then, it has been in steady decline, under pressure from high costs, restrictive practices and the growth of alternatives such as gas. In the past five years, British Coal's mission to transform itself into a commercial business has accelerated the shutdown of lossmaking pits. NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advisers to the government, estimates that a commercial business would have a maximum capacity of 50m-55m tonnes a year by 2000. That has meant sharp cuts in pits and jobs, and a rise in imports from virtually nothing in the early 1970s to 20m tonnes a year now. But output per man has more than doubled since the strike of the mid 1980s, and the business has begun to make a profit.</p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Vassiliou ahead in Cyprus poll PRESIDENT George Vassiliou of Cyprus yesterday appeared well placed to win re-election after Greek-Cypriot voters gave him a substantial lead in the first of two presidential ballots. Mr Vassiliou, an independent supported by the still powerful Communist party, secured 44.2 per cent of the vote on Sunday, against 36.7 per cent for Mr Glafcos Clerides, veteran leader of the right-wing Democratic Rally party. Mr Paschalis Paschalides, backed by the centre-right Diko party and the small Socialist party, won only 18.6 per cent of the vote. Mr Vassiliou and Mr Clerides will contest the second ballot next Sunday. Both men will try to forge alliances with prominent Diko members, but Mr Vassiliou is already assured of the Socialists' backing.</p>

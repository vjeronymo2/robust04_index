			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring behind Powell Duffryn surge SHARES in Powell Duffryn rose sharply after the distribution, storage and engineering company reported a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, in spite of seeing no improvement in its principal markets, the UK transport and energy sectors. Proceeds from restructuring the group helped cut interest costs from Pounds 4.9m to Pounds 2.6m, which was the main factor behind the rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 6.89m to Pounds 9.33m in the six months to September 30. Turnover was down 7 per cent to Pounds 330.8m (Pounds 355.4m). Powell Duffryn Standard, which builds rail freight wagons and bogies, and Metalair, which makes bulk powder tankers, both continued to suffer from a dearth of orders and made a combined trading loss of Pounds 2.5m. The group is closing its railway manufacturing plant at Heywood in Lancashire, with the loss of 56 jobs, and said its railway plant in Cardiff, which employs 130 people, would also be run down unless firm orders materialised. Several European companies are discussing manufacturing the bogies - perhaps under licence on the Continent. Powell Duffryn sold its quarry interest for Pounds 30m in September last year and in April it received Pounds 19m from the sale of its ship-owning subsidiary, Stephenson Clarke. This inflow helped cut gearing from 38 to 31 per cent. Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the profits increase demonstrated the benefits beginning to emerge from the major structural changes which had been implemented over the past two years. Weak summer demand for heating and industrial fuels caused the group's fuel distribution division to make a loss of Pounds 377,000, compared with a trading profit of Pounds 905,000 last time. Despite the losses at Powell Duffryn Standard and Metalair, the group's engineering division saw trading profits advance by 11 per cent to Pounds 5.5m, mainly due to the steady performance of Hamworthy's marine activities, and increased contributions from its combustion division. Shipping and storage increased trading profits from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 6.9m, boosted by a full contribution from the Tees and Hartlepool ports, which a consortium led by Powell Duffryn bought in January. The group said the performance of the ports had exceeded its expectations at the time of the acquisition. Earnings per share rose by 36 per cent to 9.1p (6.7p). The interim dividend was held at 6.6p. COMMENT Yesterday's 7 per cent rise in the share price, from 389p to a new four-year peak of 416p, reflects a surge of enthusiasm for the new-look Powell Duffryn which has emerged from the recentrestructuring. The City was also cheered by strong indications that the group will not be slow to increase its final dividend. Even where problems exists - as they plainly do in the railway businesses - the management has shown itself willing to staunch the losses. Although the profits figure is flattered by the drop in interest payments, the underlying performance is impressive in view of the flat energy and transport markets. Full-year profits are forecast at about Pounds 30m, which puts the shares on a prospective multiple of 13.5. The shares have had a good run recently, but that does not seem too demanding for a high-yield stock with recovery potential.</p>

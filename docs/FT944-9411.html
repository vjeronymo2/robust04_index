			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Pan-Europe stock market planned Plans to launch a pan-European stock market for fast growing companies were unveiled yesterday by a group of European venture capitalists, the Paris Bourse and the US Nasdaq market. The new market would provide entrepreneurially-led companies of any size with access to equity finance at an earlier stage than their national stock exchanges currently allow. The group, led by the European Venture Capital Association, hopes the market  -to be called Easdaq - will open in late 1995. This would coincide with the EU directive calling for free movement of financial services across borders which must be implemented nationally by 1996. A survey conducted by accountants Coopers and Lybrand and funded by the European Commission, established that nearly half the companies seeking a flotation in four European countries would be suitable for Easdaq. But its success rests on whether institutional investors worldwide will be prepared to invest in the entrepreneurially-led fast growth companies. Mr Jos Peeters, chairman of the working group on Easdaq, said there were 15,000 venture capital backed companies in Europe 'among which the star performers are potential candidates for a listing on the new market'. Easdaq would also appear to compete in the UK with the Alternative Investment Market which the London Stock Exchange will launch next year to replace the Unlisted Securities Market. Mr Ronald Cohen, chairman of Apax Partners and one of the main driving forces behind Easdaq, said the new market would be highly regulated against fraud. Companies wanting a listing would need a conventional investment bank sponsor and would need to keep the market fed regularly with relevant information. The London Stock Exchange does not currently expect companies floating on the Alternative Investment Market would be heavily regulated, a shortcoming for serious institutional investment, some investors say. The Easdaq would also have an independent management team, unlike AIM which would remain within the LSE. Launching the plans for Easdaq, 21 European and US financial institutions yesterday founded a new body, the European Association of Securities Dealers, which will develop the technological infrastructure and settlement systems for the new market. The Easdaq - which stands for the European Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation market - will be a profit-making company. Before the project can get off the ground the Easdaq company will need to raise about Ecu10m (Pounds 7.8bn) in equity capital. See, Lex</p>

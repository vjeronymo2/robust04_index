			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Black protests greet white MPs THOUSANDS of black South Africans demonstrated yesterday at the opening of the white-dominated parliament while inside President FW de Klerk reiterated his offer to bring blacks into the legislature as soon as possible. Mr de Klerk gave no hint of a timetable for reform, but repeated his commitment to put big constitutional changes to a referendum, a process the ANC rejected yesterday as giving whites a veto over plans for an interim government. The parliament has separate houses for whites, coloureds (mixed race) and Indians, but excludes blacks; it is effectively controlled by whites. Some 20,000 supporters of the African National Congress (ANC), the main black opposition group, staged what they called a 'people's parliament' in front of the Cape Town City Hall and then marched on parliament to present a petition calling for abolition of the legislature and the constitution. ANC organisers had expected a turnout of at least 50,000. They laid on free trains to Cape Town from the surrounding black and coloured townships, and bussed in supporters from rural areas. The ANC demanded the installation of an interim government within six months, and elections by the end of the year to a constituent assembly charged with drawing up a post-apartheid constitution. Officials of the ruling National party have said it could take at least 18 months before a multi-racial parliament could be elected: reaching political agreement on the shape of a new parliament could take many months as the two sides struggle over the Nationalists demand for protections for the white minority, followed by delays for the registration of voters and delimitation of new constituencies. In the meantime, however, the government hopes to bring blacks into the executive, and plans to establish joint legislative committees composed of members of parliament and the multi-party Convention for a Democratic South Africa. Mr Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative party, rejected Mr de Klerk's appeal to join the convention.</p>

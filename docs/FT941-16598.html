			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Books: Unholy alliance before check mate THE INNER GAME by Dominic Lawson Macmillan Pounds 14.99, 249 pages I must declare an interest. I have played two chess-games against the subject of this book, Nigel Short, and one against the author, Dominic Lawson. I lost all three. Those with Short were part of a 'Simul'. This is when a grandmaster takes on 20 or more players simultaneously. One was for a charity dedicated to victims of torture (an appropriate cause I felt as Short tied me up in knots). Dominic Lawson also participated on that occasion and held Short to a draw. The other was to celebrate publication of The Oxford Companion to Chess  - one of the players, Adam Hart-Davis, actually beat Short. My Lawson encounter was a more even contest. At the end my opponent said graciously: 'You ought to play with Freddie. You'd give each other a good game.' He meant AJ Ayer, his philosopher step-father, whom I did play subsequently, and the result was a draw. Afterwards Freddie said: 'I think if we'd gone on I might have beaten you . . .' - a good example of language, truth and logic. I mention this because it reinforces something that emerges from The Inner Game, Lawson's fascinating behind-the-scenes account of the recent World Chess Championship at the Savoy Theatre. Chess ability does not appear to be correlated with any other kind of ability. You can be a great philosopher and at the same time an eager duffer at chess. Alternatively you can be a great chess-player and a very unsatisfactory human being. What, then, are Garri Kasparov and Nigel Short really like as people? All that counted in the end was the moves they made in their 20 games. They are given in full at the end of this book. Still, after the immense media coverage the event attracted, one remains curious to know more about them away from the board and Lawson, from his privileged standpoint as Short's confidant and support throughout the match, is the man to tell us - though, be warned, in Lawson's eyes Short can do no wrong even when he loses. The Challenger emerges as a saintly Brit determined that one day his own name, and by implication his country's, shall be inscribed on chess's supreme roll of honour. By contrast the reigning World Champion Kasparov - 'Gazza', Short calls him - emerges as an arrogant self-seeking bullying two-timing thug. Whether or not this is a gross distortion, one thing is clear: the two contenders absolutely loathed each other. Nothing was ever more formal, less real, than their initial handshakes. Yet before the match began they came together to form an unholy alliance. It was like Churchill becoming pals with Stalin to defeat an even greater object of hatred. In this instance it was one Florencio Campomanes, president of FIDE, the governing body of world chess. Kasparov had never forgiven Campo from stopping an earlier world championship match with Karpov just when he (Garri) seemed to be moving in for the kill. And Short was piqued by Campo's plan to stage this championship match in Manchester - a deal made after much tortuous negotiation and concluded without consultation with Short who at the time was incommunicado on his way to Athens. Both players were incensed by the 25 per cent slice of their prize-money FIDE proposed to take for itself. Thereafter a schism in international chess opened with a newly formed PCA (Professional Chess Association), the brainchild of Short and Kasparov, setting itself up as a rival ruling body. This fracture is still unhealed. Lawson was privy to all the intricate wheeling and dealing. He had at an earlier stage in Short's career been instrumental in getting him financial backing to develop his chess from Sir Patrick Sheehy's Eagle Star insurance group. Now he was in the middle of a hurly-burly involving a consortium consisting of Rupert Murdoch's News International advised by Raymond Keene that eventually prevailed as the angel of the breakaway World Chess Championship. According to Lawson, Kasparov was keeping open the Fide option right to the end. It was a situation far more complicated than anything that happened later on the chessboard and Lawson keeps an admirably clear head describing it all. The result was two matches for the same title: a Fide-run championship between Timman and Karpov (the runners-up of the world match) in Rotterdam; and the self-styled World Chess Championship at the Savoy between Kasparov and Short, which eclipsed the other almost totally. Lawson takes us interestingly through Short's entire process of preparation for the great event. We observe him co-opting a team of fellow grandmasters like, the emigre Czech Lubosh Kavalek in the US and Jon Speelman in the UK, his long hours of work with them on his potential opening strategy. Chess at this level is played by committee with a chairman who has the power to override everything the committee proposes. Then there is Lawson's exciting blow-by blow accounts of the games themselves which, without going his into a lot of boring technicalities, are pithily recreated along with all the post-mortem sessions. Even though we know the outcome, these games retain all the tension that came across at the time. Game 16, the solitary game that a grey, drained, haggard Short won, renewing our faith in him, loses nothing of its triumph in Lawson's verbal action replay. Short's dignity in defeat was exemplary. Indeed his decorously correct behaviour in public throughout the match seems strangely at variance with his bouts of verbal abuse, especially of his opponent, recorded here. Short's wife Rea and small daughter were nearby for most of the contest whereas Kasparov's wife remained at home leaving his mum to act as his comforter - not a role much in demand. Kasparov's Jewish father died when he was a child. Short's parents' marriage broke up; his father left their Lancashire home when Nigel was a child chess-prodigy. For this Championship Short found a father substitute in Kavalek, a man turned 50, whom he then sacked half way through the match. It was Freud who said that chess was a symbolic re-enactment of the Oedipus conflict. Possibly he was right.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maria Luisa Azpiazu] </F>   [Text] Washington, 24 Mar (EFE) -- Antigua and Barbuda's  decision to break its commitment to Costa Rican Foreign Minister  Bernd Niehaus in order to vote for Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria in the post of OAS secretary general may trigger a  "domino effect" and change some voters' intentions.    In the view of an expert consulted by EFE News Agency,  Antigua and Barbuda's decision -- which under other  circumstances would have passed unnoticed -- is of paramount  importance now because it is the "first indication that the  English-speaking Caribbean bloc, which was thought impregnable,  has collapsed."    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the 13 Caricom [Caribbean  Common Market] members that -- according to what Niehaus has  said again and again -- had pledged, even in writing, to vote  for him.    Notwithstanding this, Lester Bird, Antigua and Barbuda's  deputy prime minister, explained that the commitment to vote for  Niehaus was taken last October, when Gaviria had not yet decided  to run for the OAS General Secretariat.    Therefore, Antigua and Barbuda's decision is based on the  conviction that "his election will further the interests of the  OAS in particular and those of the hemisphere's countries in  general."    According to diplomatic sources consulted by EFE, Antigua  and  Barbuda's decision "opens the door for a general exodus of  votes" from the Costa Rican candidate, who, in principle,  thought he had secured 22 of the 34 votes to be cast on 27 March.    Bird believes "Gaviria has the best profile" to meet the  challenges of the "new OAS."    This argument is shared by representatives from several  countries, some of whom had initially committed themselves to  voting for Niehaus but are now beginning to wonder about the  "sense of their vote" given the "specific weight" of Gaviria's  candidacy.    The shift in Antigua and Barbuda's position irrefutably  proves that Niehaus no longer has the 22 votes he asserted he  had some days ago. His followers contend nonetheless that  "there are still three votes more than needed for him to be  successful in the poll" since only a simple majority is needed,  i.e. 18 votes.    Member countries' delegations also have gotten involved in  the scramble for the General Secretariat race between Niehaus  and Gaviria by -- openly or silently -- endorsing one candidate  or the other. The issue has divided and stirred the OAS to such  an extent that if each candidate had the votes his followers  claim, the OAS would have 50 instead of 34 members.    With barely three days left for the election to replace  [incumbent OAS Secretary General] Joao Clemente Baena Soares,  Niehaus, who champions the right of small countries like his to  head the OAS, stressed in a news conference that he feels he is  involved in a "fight between David and Goliath." Nevertheless,  he said he has 21 votes that will secure his victory.    The Colombians and their followers challenge these figures  and, without expressing figures in their support, guarantee that  they have enough votes to "be successful" on 27 March.    Meanwhile, the OAS has become a place for lobbying and  betting where lunches and "two-to-one" bets are rampant in an  effort to discover vote preferences for 27 March.    It must not be forgotten, however, that the vote for the OAS  General Secretariat is "secret," and that anything might happen  under the cover of anonymity, even forgetting commitments.</p>

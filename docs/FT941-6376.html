			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: Ideas people at back of the field - How Europe is failing in the race to innovate Europe is being left behind in the race for scientific and technological advantage between the world's main industrialised countries. It takes only a few statistics to show how far Japan and the US have pulled ahead and how rapidly they are increasing their lead. While high technology products account for nearly a third of US exports and more than a quarter of Japan's, they make up less than a fifth of those from western Europe. Figures from the European Patent Office show that Europe is falling behind the US and Japan in registering new inventions. Mr Paul Braendli, the EPO's president, finds it alarming that initial patent filings in Europe have not increased at all since 1987, while those in the US have risen by 30 per cent and in Japan by 8 per cent. 'That is already a good indication that in Europe we are lazy in innovating or do not exploit our innovations,' Mr Braendli says. 'Something must be wrong.' Yet comparing national strengths in science and technology is a hazardous exercise, bedevilled by incompatible definitions. In principle, the inputs - resources devoted to research and development - are simple to assess. It is far harder to measure the quantity and quality of different countries' scientific output. Input data from the OECD in Paris show that Europe fell behind the US and Japan in overall R&amp;D spending during the 1980s. The European performance was held back particularly by the UK - the only industrialised country that devoted a smaller proportion of gross domestic product to R&amp;D in 1991 than in 1981 - and Germany, where there was only a marginal increase. France and Italy pushed up spending more rapidly, from a lower base. In 1991, the 12 EU countries devoted 1.96 per cent of GDP to R&amp;D, compared with 2.74 per cent in the US and 2.87 per cent in Japan. Only Germany (2.66 per cent) came close to the American and Japanese levels. Stripping out the high levels of military R&amp;D in the US and some European countries, Japan takes a clear global lead. It spends 2.8 per cent of GDP on civil science and technology, compared with 2.1 per cent in the US and 1.8 per cent in the EU. There are many possible ways of assessing the output of R&amp;D. Its industrial impact can be measured indirectly by the export/import ratios of science-based industries. These show Europe's weakness in computers and office machinery, with a ratio falling from 0.54 in 1985 to 0.39 in 1990 (compared to 3.96 for Japan and 0.95 for the US) - and its strength in pharmaceuticals, where the ratio in 1990 was 1.78 (compared to 0.32 for Japan and 1.65 for the US). But success in manufacturing industries depends on many factors besides R&amp;D, such as management and sales skills and quality control. A more direct technique for assessing strength in science and technology is to measure the quantity and quality of patents and scientific papers produced by a company or country. Europe's total share of US patents - seen as the most reliable measure of competitive strength - has declined since 1980, due to a dramatic expansion by Japan and more recently by the newly industrialised Asian countries. But again, the decline is far from even. 'The figures clearly show European countries going down the tubes in electronics but continuing to hold their own in areas where they have traditionally been strong, such as drugs, medicines and biotechnology,' says Dr Francis Narin, president of CHI Research, a consultancy based in New Jersey, which tracks patents issued in the US. In drugs and medicines, the combined share of US patents held by Germany, France and the UK slipped from 22.7 per cent in 1982 to 18.1 per cent in 1992. In electrical equipment, the corresponding European share fell from 16 per cent in 1982 to 10.1 per cent in 1992. However, there are bright spots in Europe's science-based industries - even in electronics. Siemens of Germany, the largest European electronics group, is investing DM2.4bn (Pounds 900m) in Dresden, eastern Germany, to develop and make powerful memory chips for the telecommunications and vehicle markets. And Philips, the second largest, is challenging the Japanese dominance of liquid crystal displays for portable computers, with a Fl200m (Pounds 70m) plant next to its R&amp;D centre in the Netherlands. In Sweden, Ericsson is investing 22 per cent of its turnover on developing advanced new telecommunications products. It decided boldly in 1991 to spend 15 times as much on R&amp;D as on dividends, although some investors were horrified. Now Ericsson has 60 per cent of the world market for digital mobile phone systems and more than a third of its total orders are for products that did not exist two years ago. But on the whole Europeans are less willing to take risks with R&amp;D than Americans - both at the corporate level and at the level of the individual researcher. The Japanese may be conformists as individuals but they move boldly as companies, as Sony showed when it created the Walkman market. Reluctance to take risks is one of many factors - social, cultural, political, educational and financial - blamed for Europe's failure to translate basic research more effectively into faster economic growth. Although there is no consensus about the relative importance of these reasons, few doubt that Europe's continuing fragmentation is an important handicap in the race with the relatively homogeneous US and Japan. In general, therefore, Europe's strongest suit is pure science. The further away a field lies from potential commercial application, the more likely it is that Europe will be ahead. The latest example is high-energy physics: Cern, the particle physics laboratory near Geneva on which 19 European countries spend Pounds 400m a year, will have an undisputed world lead for at least a generation, following last year's cancellation of the US SuperConducting Supercollider (SCS). The next discoveries about the fundamental forces and particles that hold the Universe together are likely to be made in Europe - which may provide some intellectual consolation to Europeans if the coming decades bring economic decline.</p>

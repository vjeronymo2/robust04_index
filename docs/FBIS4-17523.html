			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Demidetskiy] </F>   [Text] Kishinev [Chisinau] 22 April TASS -- The majority of  Moldovan parliament deputies described as interference in  Moldovan internal affairs the statement of the Romanian  parliament's Chamber of Deputies denouncing the ratification of  documents on Moldovan joining of the Commonwealth of Independent  States and the Commonwealth economic union.    An appeal of the Moldovan parliament adopted here today  reminded that Moldova is an independent state recognized by over  100 nations, primarily Romania.    At the same time, efforts to consolidate Moldovan statehood,  accord and good-neighbourly atmosphere in the European region  encounter "fierce resistance of some nationalist-extremist  politicians, who do not even want to hear about sovereign and  independent Moldova," says the document.    The appeal stressed that the majority of Moldovan citizens  supported building of independent Moldovan state at the recent  parliamentary elections.</p>

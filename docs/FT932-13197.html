			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Studio apartment on south coast goes for Pounds 12,000 INTEREST in Brighton is not right across the board but confined mainly to the middle price ranges - flats of about Pounds 60,000 and houses below the Pounds 120,000 mark. Brighton has seen a strong surge of interest and viewing in the four months since Christmas, a modest increase in sales over the same period, but prices have yet to show any upturn. Mr Andrew Garth of Austin Gray estimates that 80 per cent of properties in central Brighton are flats. 'Prices at the peak for studio apartments started at Pounds 25,000. A lot of these and one-bedroom apartments came on the market. Many were bought with little equity. It is these that have crashed, and where recovery is slowest,' he said. 'We sold a studio apartment two weeks ago for Pounds 12,000. Forget what you may have read about prices dropping by 25 per cent. For cheaper properties the falls have been more like 40 per cent since the top in 1988.' His office is selling about five properties a week compared with two a year ago. Selling time has come down from months to weeks. At Fiveways, an out-of-town district of semis and terraced Victorian and Edwardian houses, Mr David Andrew of Raymond Beaument said: 'I believe that after London and Croydon, Brighton suffered the worst number of repossessions in the south-east. These seem to be petering out.' In Fiveways the state of the market does not seem as bad as that in the town centre. A three-bedroomed house which would have sold for Pounds 100,000 at the peak could now be bought for Pounds 75,000 to Pounds 85,000. Mr Glenn Mishon of Mishon &amp; Mackay has an office between the bedsit and apartment land of western Brighton and the leafy boulevards of Hove. He said: 'We are doing double the business in terms of sales and viewings that we were doing last year. There are three kinds of buyers. First-time buyers who are looking to avoid the bottom rung and going for two-bedroom flats while prices are cheap. People who went into rented accommodation when they were repossessed, or could not afford the mortgage and want to buy again now that mortgages are cheaper than renting. Finally, there are people who want to trade up a little but not massively in case interest rates go up again.' Mr Mishon said properties between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 200,00 were going within weeks, but anything more than Pounds 200,000 is not moving.</p>

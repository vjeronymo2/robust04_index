			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" from Larry Jagen -- from the "Current World </F> Affairs" program]    [Text] In Burma, eight members of the main opposition  party NLD -- National League for Democracy -- returned to the  legal fold. According to Burmese Government news agencies, five  elected representatives and three party organizers returned to  the legal fold in the capital of Kachin State, Myitkyina, in  northern Burma last week.    Two years ago, these gentlemen fled to the border area  controlled by the KIO [Kachin Independence Organization] and  formed the NLD Liberated Area-North. BBC correspondent Larry  Jagen dispatches the following report:    Dear Listeners: More than a week ago, eight members of the  National League for Democracy, who set up their office in the  armed group-controlled area of (Pagyawng) two years ago, brought  down the NLD flag, closed the office, and headed for Myitkyina.    According to Burmese Television news, these NLD members  returned to the legal fold after having gone into the jungle,  but observers believe that they returned to Burma legally on  their own volition because they were no longer permitted to  continue to carry out their political activities.    According to a reliable opposition source, these eight  people  returned to Myitkyina to continue to work for regaining  democratic rights in Burma. They returned to Myitkyina with the  help of the Kachin armed group, the KIO. Not long ago, the KIO  completed the singing of a cease-fire agreement with the  military government.    A source in Kachin State says that since a cease-fire  agreement has been signed, their return to mainland Burma is  natural because they did not act as an armed opposition group.  It says some of these politicians are from various parts of  Kachin State, while others belong to a Burmese group from  outside the KIO-controlled area. It also says that they were  sent back to Myitkyina on their request. This kind of  development will continue to be a problem because it has been  learned that there were some activities going on long before the  KIO signed the cease-fire agreement -- long before February.    According to the opposition source, these political leaders  have wanted to return home since last year. These elected  representatives planned to make the political transition  [returning to the legal fold] after holding discussions with  members of the exiled NCGUB, National Coalition Government of  the Union of Burma, and other NLD elected representatives at the  Manerplaw camp along the Thai-Burmese border last September. It  says the KIO explained and prohibited them from making a  political transition and arranged their journey back to  (Pagyawng) camp through areas controlled by Wa ethnic nationals  who have already reached a cease-fire agreement with the Burmese  Government. According to the opposition source, these eight  political leaders were disappointed by the influence of personal  struggles and factions within the NLD movement in the border  area. All of them are Kachin nationals and they were especially  unhappy when none of them were invited to participate in the  NCGUB, a move they perceived as racial discrimination within the  exiled NLD movement. This political transition will badly  affect the NCGUB and NLD groups based along the Burmese border.    After the NLD won 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in  the 1990 general election, about 20 of its members fled to the  border areas to continue the fight for democracy. However, this  number is gradually dwindling. About a year ago, two prominent  members of the NCGUB -- one in China and another in Thailand --  were killed. Moreover, another NCGUB minister returned to  Rangoon early this year. According to the opposition source,  after the return of five Kachin parliamentary representatives,  there are now less than 10 opposition parliamentary  representatives in the border area. But another two  representatives, including U Daniel Aung [of the Lahu National  Development Party], came to join the Manerplaw opposition  movement last month.</p>

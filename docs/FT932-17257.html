			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / International Company News: Honeywell in aircraft computer deal APPLE Macintosh personal computers will find their way into the cockpits of commercial aircraft as a result of an agreement reached between Apple and Honeywell's Commercial Flight Systems Group. Under the deal, Honeywell will develop an electronic library which will provide flight crews with multi-media versions of maintenance and operation manuals that incorporate video, graphics and sound as well as text. Honeywell will also make a 'ruggedised' version of Apple's recently-introduced Macintosh Quadra 800 high-performance PC for the cockpit information system. This is the first time Apple has licensed its Macintosh computer technology under such an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement and signals a new strategy to broaden the markets for its technology. Honeywell said it planned to provide its airline customers with an easy-to-use information system. The Honeywell deal is the first to be reached by New Media/New Markets, a new group formed at Apple to focus on opportunities created by publishing, entertainment, telecommunications, computing and consumer electronics.</p>

			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru re-awards oil field contract PETROTECH International Corporation has won the new contract to operate the Petromar oil field off the northern Peruvian coast. The concession, formerly held by Belco, was taken over by the state after a 1985 contractual dispute. Settlement of an insurance claim by American International Group is still outstanding. Petrotech, registered in Delaware, is part of the New York McAllister Brothers group. Its current operations focus on Venezuela and the Gulf of Mexico. Through a subsidiary, International Marine, it has maintained a presence in Peru for ten years, servicing the Petromar offshore field. Two other international companies - Hallwood Petroleum of the US and Compania Naviera Perez Companc of Argentina - pre-qualified to bid. Petrotech will take an average of almost 79 per cent of all crude produced, leaving 21 per cent for Petroperu, the state-run petroleum giant. The concession for the 400-hectare lot Z-2B will run for ten years with an option to renew for a further ten. Output from the field has slumped since the Belco days, from a peak of 30,000 barrels a day to an all-time low last year of less than half that. In recent months, despite a dearth of equipment and spare parts, output has risen to 17,000 b/d. The concession is an important step in the planned privatisation of Petroperu. According to Mr Jaime Quijandria, the company's president, 'the most attractive part of the field lies in the 50 per cent still unexplored. And while that exploration goes ahead, the new operating company will be earning cash from the half that's already working'. Contract terms require Petrotech to drill at least 40 development wells over the next three years and five exploration wells by the year 2000. Petrotech officials estimated drilling costs at Dollars 80m and Dollars 20m respectively. The operator will also pay Petroperu Dollars 10m a year for the lease of existing assets. Another Dollars 30m to Dollars 60m will have to be spent on repairs and modernisation. Meanwhile, other advances were made in the transformation Petroperu. Three weeks ago, New York-based Booz, Allen and Hamilton was contracted to advise the Peruvian government on an overall privatisation strategy for the oil sector. And ten days ago Great Western Resources, through its Peruvian affiliate, signed an exploration agreement with Petroperu for Block 65 in the Maranon basin. It is the company's first ever venture outside the US. The Belco insurance claim remains unresolved. While AIG tacitly agreed to the re-leasing of the ex-Belco field, sources said that the dispute, involving Dollars 185m in compensation and already recognised by the Fujimori government, had by no means been dropped.</p>

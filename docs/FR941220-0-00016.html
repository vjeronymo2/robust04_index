			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although we believe that the therapist  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should have input into the development of the physician's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orders for therapy services, this would not be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate revision to the coverage criteria contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section as monitoring and compliance efforts would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> create an additional paperwork burden. This issue is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already adequately addressed in the Medicare HHA conditions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of participation at 42 CFR 484.18, which requires that ``the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therapist and other agency personnel participate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing the plan of care.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the physician  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not be required to order a specific number of visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before care is actually furnished.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although the physician's order is generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to specify the number of visits ordered, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognize that this is not possible in all situations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, this section allows the physician to order a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific range in the frequency of visits or visits ``as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed'' or ``PRN'' when necessary. We believe that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy provides the needed flexibility in those cases where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a physician cannot anticipate the specific number of visits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that will be necessary to meet a patient's needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that, when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician orders a range of visits, the lower end of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> range should be used as the specific frequency when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree. If the lower end of a range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visits was used as the specific frequency, any services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the lower end, even though they may fall within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the range, would not be covered. We believe use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upper end of the range as the specific frequency affords an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHA the needed flexibility to provide covered services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anywhere within the ordered range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that it was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practical to require a description of the patient's medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signs and symptoms that would occasion a visit as needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (``PRN'') as well as a specific limit on the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowable PRN visits. Another commenter stated that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement did not provide HHAs with sufficient flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to respond to patient needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree with both comments. As we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated in the preamble of the proposed rule, we believe that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> removing these requirements would allow unreasonable ``open-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ended'' orders for care. The intent of this requirement is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to allow physicians and HHAs the flexibility needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively serve patients whose need for care cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> easily predicted, not to give HHAs ``carte blanche'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide an unlimited number of visits with no restrictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The requirement that a physician must describe the medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> signs and symptoms that would occasion a visit ensures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the PRN visits are provided only in specific circumstances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as a plugged urinary catheter or a leaking heparin lock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an IV antibiotic patient. The requirement that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician impose a specific limit on the number of PRN  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visits ensures that he or she will remain informed if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient's need for visits is greater than anticipated. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that, by establishing strict parameters in which PRN  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visits may be furnished, these requirements protect the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient's health and safety while also guarding against  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare coverage of unreasonable visits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that &sect;409.43(c) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to require the plan of care to be signed by ``a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician'' instead of ``the physician'' to allow for cases in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which multiple physicians are providing patient care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

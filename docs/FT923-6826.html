			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Willis Corroon profits fall 22% RECESSION, further reductions in insurance rates in the US and lower interest rates have combined to depress profitability at Willis Corroon, the UK's largest insurance broker, which yesterday announced a 22 per cent fall in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 54.1m. Although earnings per share fell to 8.3p compared with 10.9p last year, Willis announced a maintained dividend at 6.6p per share. The shares fell 16p to close at 170p. Mr Roger Elliott, executive chairman, said conditions in the US, which generates about 40 per cent of the group's revenue, were the 'worst for many years'. He said reductions in premium rates on policies renewed by Willis in the US averaged 14 per cent. He said the group had been surprised by a sharp fall in the volume of its business. Recession was leading Willis's clients to reduce their demand for insurance. Brokerage and fee revenue in the first half of 1992 grew 5 per cent to Pounds 319.6m, compared with Pounds 312.7m a year ago. However, the rise reflects the contribution of affiliates and subsidiaries acquired in the past 12 months. Willis said it had invested Pounds 32m in acquiring a network of brokers in Canada and western Europe. On an underlying basis revenue was unchanged. Expenses rose to Pounds 281.4m from Pounds 256.5m and by 3 per cent on an underlying basis. Mr Elliott said that as well as additional costs of new operations, expenses were incurred in making redundancy payments. When completed Willis's job reduction programme would yield 'substantial full-year savings'. The group has stepped up investment in its head office operations. Underwriting claims at the group's insurance subsidiaries fell to Pounds 11.5m from Pounds 22.4m. Interest payable rose to Pounds 2.6m from Pounds 2.3m. Share of profit of associated undertakings was up to Pounds 3.9m from Pounds 3m. The figures indicate that Willis, like its major international competitors, Sedgwick of the UK, and Alexander &amp; Alexander and Marsh McLennan of the US is struggling to increase revenues. On Tuesday Sedgwick announced a fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 51.7m compared with Pounds 65.3m at the half-way stage last year. Lex, Page 14</p>

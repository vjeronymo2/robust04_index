			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Houses: the myths and the reality: John Authers explains why the market has sagged. He says houses look good value against past trends, but buyers should forget about making big profits LIKE medieval quacks around an ailing body, British building societies are suggesting their cures for the sickly housing market. But why should anyone believe that the market needs special medicine to aid recovery? Since house prices have fallen on average by about a quarter in real terms since July 1989, some properties are beginning to seem good value. As the charts on this page show, if you strip out inflation, houses are no longer expensive judged against the trend of the past quarter-century. Moreover, house prices as a proportion of average earnings - a measure of what buyers can afford - are now close to their lowest for 25 years. As in any other market, activity can be expected to revive when demand and supply are brought into balance by a mutually convenient price; and present prices appear, by historical criteria, to be not far from this point. But the alarm is still easy to understand. Weakness in the housing market hits British consumers more forcibly than most other economic ills assailing the world - for example, exchange rate fluctuations. This is partly because of the large debts incurred to buy houses, and partly because of a deeply ingrained belief among the British public that house prices would surf comfortably ahead of inflation for ever. This 'bubble mentality' developed particularly strongly during the 1980s - the decade of Thatcherism which produced a property-owning democracy and bull markets in everything. House-buying was then endowed with an unjustified illusion of grandeur. Houses were not only somewhere to live. They became investments - and, with hindsight, unfortunately speculative ones. Now, although house prices may seem ready to recover, buyers and sellers must first attain a more realistic view of the market. It is no longer, as a generation came to believe, a perpetual motion machine which will carry every house owner effortlessly from debt to high prosperity. It is not surprising that people were gripped by this idea. The graph of actual prices shows that Pounds 10,000 invested in housing in 1955 was worth Pounds 300,000 25 years later. It is the kind of comparison which inspires feelings of pride and security among many householders, But these telephone number figures are partly an illusion. Most of the rise represents inflation. The line below shows that, in the real world, house prices outstripped the rise in the retail prices index by only 2.2 percentage points a year on average during the 1970s and 1980s. In that period, house prices grew hardly faster than average earnings (if both are adjusted for price inflation). Real earnings rose by an average of 1.7 per cent a year. These figures may inspire comfort, but nothing more. But the 'boom' periods of the early 1970s, late 1970s and late 1980s provided opportunities for big profits. These helped establish the myth that borrowing to buy a house would always be a good investment. Examined more closely, the figures tell a rather different story. Increases in average earnings usually cause an increase in house prices. Earnings have grown faster than inflation since the Second World War, helping housing prices to inflate more quickly than most other products. But the phenomenon is complex. The most important measure of whether it will be worthwhile to buy a house is 'affordability,' generally measured as the ratio of average house prices to average earnings. This ratio varies widely and reveals a lot about the present state of the housing market. Historically, the average house normally is worth about 3.5 times the average salary. If this ratio gets much above 4.0, prices come under pressure because houses are hard to afford. In 1973, the ratio hit 4.95. The next year it was 4.25, and the following year 3.65. But this was during an era when inflation topped 20 per cent. So affordability could improve without big reductions in nominal house prices. In the 1990s, with wages rising more slowly, affordability could be achieved only by price cuts. In 1988, the ratio was 4.25. This rose to 4.43 the following year, and moved to 4.34 in 1990. According to the Building Societies' Association (BSA), this fell to 3.90 last year and to 3.55 in the first quarter of this year. That ratio now is probably below 3.5. Judging by the Nationwide house price index figures recently released, and not shown in the lower graph, houses are roughly as affordable as they have been for two decades - a good sign. But it does not tell the whole story. Prices on their own do not reflect the true cost to a consumer of buying their house. Homes are usually bought with the help of a mortgage, on which interest rates vary. And while house prices have come down from the unrealistic peaks of 1989, real interest rates (compared with inflation) have risen. The last housing boom was propelled by interest rates which were lower than the inflation rate, so mortgage debts were being eroded by inflation while the value of the asset on which they were secured was rising steeply. In the 1990s, the opposite has been happening. The BSA's figures for average initial mortgage repayments as a percentage of average earnings and income show that 1990 was a truly excessive year. Then, repayments took up 26.3 per cent of average income. In 1989, this figure was 22.8 per cent. In 1988, it was 17.9 per cent. This ratio began to fall after the base rate cut in October 1990 which accompanied the decision to join the European exchange rate mechanism. It dropped to 25 per cent by the beginning of last year and had reached 19 per cent in the first quarter of '92. The BSA says this extended measure of affordability is almost exactly equal to its level in 1980, and a third lower than its peak only two years ago. But this measure still gives rise to concern because it never reached similar heights during the domestic property boom of the early 1970s - it stood at 15 per cent in 1973-74 having stood below 13 per cent from 1969 to 1972. To make houses truly cheap to buy, then, either prices must come down further or mortgage rates must fall. Thus, the building societies' clamour for lower base rates begins to look understandable. So, on a long-term perspective, houses look cheap but debt is expensive. In the short term, though, prices could well dip below their historic trend, just as three years ago they surged above it. Do any special features of supply and demand suggest a change to this trend? The market for housing is 'sticky,' with supply constricted by several factors which helped to produce the modest house price inflation of the past 50 years. Most obviously, homes take time to build (usually about 20 months), so supply will not always be able to keep up with a sudden increase in demand. This opens the prospect of periodic house price inflation 'bubbles.' Planning restrictions imposed by local authorities help further to constrict supply. Councils tend to be strictest in overcrowded areas where housing demand is highest. Then, as Barry Riley discusses in his column on this page, there are repossessions. A few years ago, nobody would have regarded them as a separate source of supply. Things are different now. Lenders repossessed 35,750 homes in the first half of this year, mainly because householders could not afford to keep up their repayments. Attempts usually are made to sell them quickly, increasing the downward pressure on prices. The market also is affected by the need of elderly people to sell their houses to pay for expensive medical care. In the longer term, this could help to increase supply and so to depress prices. The effect of demographic changes on demand is also likely to weaken prices. After the Second World War and up to 1964, the birth rate grew; then it fell considerably. People born in 1964 are only 28 this year. So demand from first-time buyers, who tend to be between 20 and 35, is likely to be maintained for a few years - but it will drop by the end of this decade. This often is described over-emotively as a 'time bomb'. But the figures do suggest that the market cannot pick up at the end of the 1990s in the way it did at the end of the 1980s. The post-war growth in owner-occupation suggests a further negative influence in the long term. The higher the proportion of the population which already owns a house, then, theoretically, the lower the potential for growth in demand. Roughly a quarter of Britain's housing stock was owner-occupied in 1945. This rose to 42.3 per cent in 1960, 50 per cent in 1970 and 55.5 per cent in 1980. It now stands at around 67.5 per cent. The BSA's research suggests that unmet demand for owner-occupation has remained fairly static over the past few years, but it is hard to see any scope for continued significant increases. So is this the time to buy? The question should not be imbued with a spirit of speculation. There is no reason to expect a take-off in property prices, or a return to the Thatcher era illusion of housing as a high-return investment. But all the fundamentals, with the arguable exception of the cost of buying houses, do point to the market offering fair value at present. Homes are no longer overpriced, if past trends are a guide, and there is little reason to fear a repeat of the horrors which hit those who bought at the peak in 1987 and 1988. Thus, the next two years should be a good time to buy - although not a good time to make a killing. Indeed, those buying now could see the value of their purchase decline somewhat for a year or two if prices fall under the trend line. The fundamentals do not seem to justify any attempted miracle cure along the lines suggested this week by the building societies. The ultimate cure, which depends on many external factors, will be lower interest rates. Dream homes - nightmare scenarios: Page III Mortgage lenders go for caution: Page IV</p>

			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Travel: A view from the river - Christian Tyler finds a lazy and satisfying way to soak up Europe THE NOSTALGIC traveller feels a sharp sense of loss when he retraces his steps. Treasured images of the past are irretrievably altered, like muzzy black-and-white photographs overlaid with modern colour transparencies. Old impressions are obliterated by new ones, leaving only the memory of a memory. Yet to follow one's own tracks is irresistible. The pleasure of a visit to a half-remembered past is as intense as the thrill of a new encounter. And sometimes the modern picture turns out to be an improvement on the old print. Or so I reflected as I stood on the rainy deck of a Danube cruise ship one evening last year, scanning the north bank for the tall, bare rock that marks the Austrian-Czech border. I had last crossed this border 25 years before in a wood-and-canvas canoe, drifting by the rock in the early morning, unobserved and undocumented. I recalled a watch-tower on its summit, a barrack block half way up its face and a wire fence running at right angles to the river. This time the rock loomed up in the last flicker of twilight. The watch-tower and the wire were gone and the barrack block was empty. The Iron Curtain had been rolled up and taken away. Behind me, in a glow of artificial candlelight, 180 passengers aboard the Danube Princess were raising their forks for the first stab of herring fillet, the overture to a gastronomic ordeal comprising consomme with goose liver dumplings, Indonesian noodles, mixed salad, roast suckling pig and Bavarian cabbage, sauteed slices of calves' liver, tiramisu fiorentina, cheese, fruit and coffee. The slab-sided cruise ships on the Danube are really motorised restaurants, German, Austrian or Russian-owned, in which you may eat your way the length of old Europe, from Passau to Vienna, to Bratislava, Budapest and down as far as the Black Sea. Outside the window the scenery - fields and forests for the most part - is slowly and silently unreeled like the studio backdrop to an old film. Tugs and motorised barges from the Russian port of Izmail in the delta struggle by; the captain's bicycle is on the roof of the bridge and his wife's underwear flaps from the the aerial. Herons stand in the shallows as motionless as table lamps. For the well-fed observer it is a lazy and satisfying way of soaking up some history. The river provides a romantic perspective on Europe. The first thing I saw in the Danube valley this time was a vintage Rolls-Royce lying on its side in the ditch. It looked as if it had been abandoned by one of those swashbuckling baronets in a Dornford Yates novel. Durnstein in the Wachau region of Austria brought Grimm's fairy tales to life: an old woman with an apple-doll's complexion sold us three bottles of local wine from her house on the river bank, a dwelling which last saw the builders in about 1400. At Grein, a village built in the fantasy-kitsch style of early Walt Disney, the elderly guide led us up the back stairs of the Rathaus to see a 60-seat theatre built in 1791. This time it was she, not the visitor, who suffered the flashback. She mentioned the name of a lady in Yorkshire who had employed her in 1937: it was my great-grandmother. When we docked outside Vienna, I took my wife in search of the heuriges weinhaus where years before, with co-canoeist Andro Linklater, I had stopped for a drink or three on the way to Belgrade. The place had evaporated; but we found a substitute on the edge of Nussdorf. We sat at a table with three witches, very friendly and very drunk. Our conversation was obscure. First Witch leaned forward and whispered: 'Cricklevood]'. Second Witch passed a jar of horseradish sauce and cackled: 'Take it easy]'. Third Witch had forgotten her lines, so First Witch started up again: 'Cricklevood Lane]' A day in Vienna is long enough - long enough in our case to hear Haydn's Mariazeller mass performed by choir and orchestra from the gallery of the Augustinian church, a sound more beautiful than any professional recording; to be treated to a gourmet lunch at the Bristol Hotel; to saunter through the holiday crowds with the shops mercifully shut; to race back to the boat to change and to re-emerge in the evening for a performance of Mozart's Idomeneo conducted by Harnoncourt at the Staatsoper. In Budapest we were able to take a rest from our fellow-passengers. All but nine of us on the boat were Germans from the north. They were docile, punctual and impassive. If you opened a door for them or smiled a good morning you were met with a blank stare. If you complained about the barking of the ship's tannoy - a device for murdering sleep as well as for imparting such vital statistics as the weight of the Vienna TV tower - they looked at you askance. Few responded as amiably as the one-legged man whom we met swinging down the steep path from the castle at Durnstein where Blondel is supposed to have found his master, Richard the Lionheart. When the clouds parted one day there was a stampede for the sundeck and I witnessed what others have testified to the world over: the jealous desperation of the middle-aged German tourist in possession of a sunbed. On the very last morning of the voyage my wife reported that one particularly aggressive pair of sunbed-snatchers had deigned finally to acknowledge her existence. 'But it's too late now,' she said. 'I cut them dead.' River cruising has this great advantage. You are never far from land, never too close to your shipmates, never more than a few hours from the next port of call. Away from the roads, the cities, the crowds, stuffing yourself like a Strasbourg goose or reclining in your cabin as the green-brown Danube foams along the hull, waking at night to watch the ship sink out of sight of the moon into the black depths of a lock, you wonder whether there is any other way to travel. Christian Tyler travelled from Passau to Budapest and back on the Danube Princess, run by Peter Deilmann Cruises and available in the UK through Fred Olsen Travel of Crown St, Ipswich, Suffolk. His return flight to Munich was c/o Lufthansa.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT SEEKS NEW DEADLINE ON LAND FOR SCHOOLS AT PORTER RANCH  </P> <P> The Los Angeles school board voted unanimously Thursday to ask the City Council  to ease conditions under which the district can buy land for schools from  developers of the proposed $2-billion Porter Ranch project.  </P> <P> The resolution asks that developers be required to reserve 22 acres of land,  which the district could buy for schools, until at least half of the 3,395  homes and townhouses proposed in the Chatsworth development are built and  occupied.  </P> <P> The 1,300-acre development -- the largest single project in Los Angeles history  -- must be approved by the City Council, which is expected to discuss the  matter later this month.  </P> <P> Under conditions approved by the council's Planning and Land Use Committee last  month, project developer Nathan Shapell must hold the land only until the end  of the year 2000. After that, it can be used for other purposes.  </P> <P> But board member Julie Korenstein, who introduced the motion, said unforeseen  delays in construction of the homes until past the deadline could make it  impossible for the district to exercise its option to purchase the land. Under  the current project conditions, several hundred families -- the exact number to  be determined by state education officials at the time -- with school-age  children must move into the new Porter Ranch homes before the district can  exercise the option to buy the school sites.  </P> <P> Porter Ranch project representative Paul Clarke said there are no plans to  change the council committee's recommendation. He said it is impossible to  predict the project's completion date.  </P> <P> Under conditions set by the council committee, the Los Angeles Unified School  District must also reopen one of two nearby elementary schools that were closed  in 1982 because of declining enrollment at the time. The board in its  resolution asked that condition be deleted because the closer of the two  schools is more than four miles away, too far for youngsters to walk.  </P></p>

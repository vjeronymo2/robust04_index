"We can use this meeting to  clarify what the United States is saying without actually negotiating with  them," which will save face for the Japanese, a trade official for that country  said. Tokyo protested vehemently when Washington charged Japan at the end of  May with unfair trading practices in supercomputers, wood products and  satellites.  </P></p>

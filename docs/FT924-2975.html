			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Ford defends car price rises MR Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, yesterday rounded on critics of the company's latest increases in car prices and claimed that many of the comments were 'ill-judged'. Earlier this week Ford announced average price rises from January 4 for its Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars of 4.5 per cent and for its Sierra and Granada cars of 7.5 per cent. Mr McAllister claimed that retail prices of the Fiesta small car range, excluding car tax, would be only 1.4 per cent to 2.6 per cent higher in January than at the beginning of this year. Ford had lowered list prices for the Fiesta twice this year as part of 'aggressive action to stimulate sales'. The price of the 1.4 litre Escort CAT LX after the increase would be 7.6 per cent higher than in January this year. During the year it had significantly improved the Escort range with the addition of new engines, catalytic converters as standard equipment and improved safety features. Mr McAllister claimed that no manufacturer could ignore the impact of the devaluation of the pound by around 16 per cent and inflation of 4 per cent, but said that Ford had 'increased prices over the past year by far less'. However, the Escort/Orion and Fiesta ranges are built in the UK and are largely shielded from the impact of devaluation. The prices of the German-built Granada and the Belgian-built Sierra will have risen by around 13 per cent in the 12 months to January. Mr McAllister said that it was 'absurd' to claim that Britain was a 'high price, high profit' market given the decline in the profitability of UK manufacturers and the severity of the recession.</p>

He said the first case of AIDS was reported in the United  States in 1981 and Thailand in 1985. The number of HIV infected  cases in mid-1992 throughout the world were 277,042 in American  region, 151,455 in African region and 426 in Southeast Asia  region.

Highlighting the methods of transmission of the virus  through  sexual intercourse, sharing of syringes and needles, transfusion  of infected blood and from mother to baby during pregnancy,  assistant professor, Dr. G.C.

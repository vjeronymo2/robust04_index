			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Elderly give approval to health reform Endorsements and rejections flew thick and fast yesterday, as the US Senate entered its second day of what was still mostly civilised debate on healthcare reform. Supporters of the bills proposed by the Democratic leaders in both chambers of Congress were grateful for the strong backing of the American Association of Retired People, representing 33m people. The AARP, though long sympathetic to the Clinton administration's broad approach, had not endorsed any bill. It warned: 'If either bill is defeated, healthcare reform will be dead for years.' The version sponsored by Senator George Mitchell, the Senate majority leader, also secured the qualified approval of the Congressional Budget Office. It found that the Mitchell bill would 'slightly reduce the federal budget deficit', but expanded insurance coverage would 'add to national health care expenditures' in the aggregate. The CBO calculated that Mr Mitchell's proposed subsidies to the poor and small businesses would cost Dollars 420bn (Pounds 272bn) by 2000 and Dollars 1,100bn by 2004, but that this could be more than offset by higher taxes on such as cigarettes and by savings on the Medicaid programme for the indigent. It thought his goal of 95 per cent insurance coverage could be achieved earlier than its target date of 2000, but it raised doubts about his subsidies. It said these would be vulnerable in the event of an increase in the budget deficit. On the other side, big and small businesses lined up to fight the Mitchell bill. But attempts on the Senate floor to delay debate, instigated by Senator Jesse Helms, the right-wing Republican from North Carolina, were voted down. For much of yesterday, senators tried to maintain the tone of debate established on Monday night by the two principal protagonists, Senator Mitchell and Senator Robert Dole, the Republican minority leader. his political toughness. He has, after all, threatened to keep the Senate sit ting throughout the summer, if necessary, to complete action on his bill. Mr Mitchell kept insisting that his proposals were there to be improved upon. Healthcare reform was 'a matter of simple justice', its purpose 'the wellbeing of American families', the approach of his bill essentially 'voluntary', with 'nothing political' in it. Mr Dole repeated three times the Republican mantra: 'America has the best healthcare system in the world'. But he, too, offered conciliation of a kind: 'We believe there is a lot in our bill, a lot in Senator Mitchell's bill, a lot in other bills. We could go in a back room and in two or three days get a bill that could pass 99 to one.'</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPARING BUSH TO EISENHOWER  </P> <P> I too notice similarities, but it does not give me the contented feeling that  Broder gets. Both men are caretaker Presidents bent on preserving the status  quo. Today, I don't believe we can afford a president who is not a problem  solver. We have the problems of budget and trade deficits, drugs, the failed  policy of trying to police the world by spending billions to maintain  servicemen overseas, the excessive debt by government, business and consumers,  the policy of paying millions to a fascist government in El Salvador to support  its death squads and paying the Contras to murder citizens of Nicaragua, to  name a few.  </P> <P> PAUL A. MALLARD  </P> <P> Woodland Hills  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Crossrail link wins pledge from PM THE GOVERNMENT last night bowed to mounting pressure to underline its commitment to the Pounds 2bn London Crossrail Project by confirming the legislation needed for it to go ahead will be presented to parliament next month. Mr John Major, prime minister, used a speech to the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry to make the announcement, saying the government was determined to ensure the project was carried out as cost effectively as possible. 'We want to see the private sector fully involved in London's Crossrail,' Mr Major said. He spoke in his address of a process of harnessing government and business together to build a new prosperity across Britain. The announcement - which followed Mr Major's chairing of a cabinet committee called to discuss the scheme's future - will allay fears that the biggest public transport project planned for central London was heading for deadlock. Before yesterday the impression had been building that the government might not be prepared to take the bill forward without private-sector participation, while the private sector was not prepared to join in until the bill had been passed. It also appears to represent a victory for the department of transport over the Treasury. The two departments had been in dispute over the spread of risk between the private and public sectors, with the Treasury insisting that commercial sponsors should not be allowed to make a return without risk. The agreed formula was expected to set the trend for other joint projects - including the extension of the Jubilee underground line - following a change of rules announced in the Autumn Statement. The Crossrail scheme involves building a pair of rail tunnels under central London connecting Paddington and Liverpool Street, which would allow trains from east or west to run through the City and West End.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Gencor confirms R2bn rights issue GENCOR, South Africa's second largest mining house, yesterday confirmed its intention to go ahead with a R2bn rights issue. Gencor's parent company, Genbeheer, will be raising R1.1bn in order to follow its rights in the Gencor offer. Mr Brian Gilbertson, Gencor's newly-appointed chairman, said yesterday: 'Our major group companies are adequately funded for the present, but we found in the past that having funds available at the centre when we needed them put us in a powerful bargaining position. It is well known the group is currently either engaged in or examining a number of large projects.' These include the Columbus stainless steel project, the Alusaf expansion, the development of the Oryx gold mine, and Phase 2 of the Genref refinery expansion by energy arm, Engen. Gencor's last rights issue was in July 1989, when the group raised R1.5bn. This left the group cash rich at a time of high interest rates.</p>

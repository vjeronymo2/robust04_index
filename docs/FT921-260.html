			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Production shift to overseas forecast - Minimum wage sparks scepticism - Job loss fears - Employers' concern over expense 'MIDDLE-SIZED companies tend to get ignored by politicians,' says Mr David Parker, chairman and chief executive of Sherwood Group with 3,000 employees. The company is one of the largest suppliers of lace in Europe and Britain's third biggest sock maker - too big to attract small-business grants but too small to qualify for special assistance for strategic industries. Life under Labour would, nevertheless, change the Nottingham business from shopfloor to boardroom, though in financial terms Mr Parker's team reckons it comes out more or less even. This does not prevent Mr Parker putting personal taxation at the top of his list of worries. 'Labour's plans would damage incentives for middle-to-senior management, rather than the most senior,' he says. He identifies about 70 of the 2,400 UK staff who would be hit by Labour's plan to lift the ceiling on National Insurance payments for earnings above about Pounds 21,000 a year. Less than 15 are even close to being affected by the 50 per cent tax band for incomes above Pounds 40,000. Mr Parker is concerned about the prospect of a minimum wage. The textile industry has a high proportion of women workers on low wages, many on piecework. Some of Britain's biggest textile companies such as Coats Viyella and William Baird have warned that heavy job losses would result. Sherwood is better placed than many. Lace and sock-making are highly automated. Across the company about 500 staff earn less than the Pounds 3.40 an hour Labour says will be its minimum wage. Although this includes some teenagers, trainees and unskilled staff, most of them are in garment-making and Mr Parker says he 'would probably accelerate our drive to assemble garments in the Pacific basin'. The proportion of Sherwood's clothes made in the far east should go up to 50 per cent fairly soon in any case but could go higher 'depending on circumstances'. Sherwood has experience of a minimum wage environment. It manufactures in France, the Netherlands and Germany. 'Wages are higher there,' says Mr Parker guardedly, and he acknowledges that this hurts margins. A minimum wage might not help employment, but should help productivity. Sherwood would spend more on automated machinery additionally encouraged by Labour's plan to give 40 per cent capital allowances in the first year, which would add Pounds 100,000 to the company's cashflow for this year, according to Mr Peter Newbold, the finance director.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Britain out of ERM due to poor preparation BRITAIN'S failure to stay in the European exchange rate mechanism was in large part due to poor preparation by Mr John Major, then chancellor, before entry in October 1990, Lord Lawson, the former Tory chancellor says in an article published today, Emma Tucker writes. In the London Business School's International Financial Outlook Lord Lawson says that the UK joined the ERM at too high a rate. He criticises the government for inadequately agreeing entry terms with the Bundesbank beforehand. 'Sterling joined at a rate which the Bundesbank regarded from the outset as too high and which it therefore felt no great moral obligation to support - a fact that was later to become all too apparent to the financial markets,' he says. Lord Lawson also says there is no conceivable gradual 'glide-path' to allow an exchange rate system to transform imperceptibly into a single currency.</p>

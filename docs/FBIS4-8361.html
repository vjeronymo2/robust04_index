			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Petre Roman, president of the Democratic </F> Party (National Salvation Front), by Roxana Badralexi; place and  date not given: "Can We Ignore the Danger to or Posed by the  President and his People?"]    [Text] [Badralexi] Mr. Roman, do you know President Ion  Iliescu well?    [Roman] I thought I knew him well, but I received a  surprise. Of course, the surprise was only as far as I was  concerned. I thought we had the same political beliefs and the  same human features. But I had to ascertain that my trust in  him was not justified.    [Badralexi] Do you think it possible that he once uttered  the words: "I cannot leave the political scene now, because the  others will put me in jail"?    [Roman] Anyone might say words like that at a time of  political discord. Maybe some people feared such a thing at a  certain point in time when the vindictive feature was very  strong in Romanian society. Now, I consider such a statement to  be pointless, if we think of the things that are known...    [Badralexi] What if there are some other things?    [Roman] In that case, everyone is also responsible for what  is not known, if he is guilty of anything. Everyone is also  responsible for what is not known at a given point.    [Badralexi] To conclude this topic, would you say that the  danger resides in the fact that President Iliescu does not  sincerely believe in giving land to the peasants and that he  considers that the only purpose of factories is to ensure food  for the workers?    [Roman] From a political viewpoint, this is definitely a  danger. I would like to be more concrete and recall the million  jobs promise he has made during the electoral campaign,  something that was obviously impossible to achieve. Therefore,  there is a danger here, because the peasants' work has always  been the main source of economic growth in Romania. Second, the  Romanian factories can only survive if they adjust to the  generally recognized principles of management. They have  markets, technology, and everything else they need so that,  briefly put, they can obtain 1,001 lei-worth of production for  1,000 lei-worth of costs. This was not the case in Ceausescu's  [former communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu] time, when many  industries were operating at a loss despite the fact that the  raw materials were cheaper than in other countries. To continue  this state of affairs today, through such a political attitude,  is a dangerous thing.  <H5>  If the President Is Not Able To Adjust to Reality, the </H5> Citizens Will Draw Appropriate Conclusions    [Badralexi] Can anything be done to convince the president  that his approach is dangerous?    [Roman] The influence of such an approach is obviously  nefarious. However, since he keeps coming in contact with the  economic reality of the developed world, I believe that the  president will realize that this is the only way for us, too.  Moreover, I subscribe to the idea of maintaining the social  structure -- this is a dominant feature of our party -- only  that this effort becomes meaningless, if it does not rely on a  solid economic reality. This is all. This is the simple  difference between demagoguery and pragmatism.    [Badralexi] Do you believe that we can simply ignore the  danger to or posed by President Iliescu?    [Roman] One can never ignore what a president says,  particularly in a semi-parliamentary republic like ours.  However, the reality obliges the president to realize what the  situation is really like and if he is not able to adjust to that  reality, the citizens will draw appropriate conclusion.    [Badralexi] Let us hope so. Mr. Roman, many share your fear  that Romania might lose the race with the other Eastern European  countries. Do you think that the current holders of the power  do not share these fears?    [Roman] I am afraid they do not. The majority of those  currently occupying important positions in the administration  are people used to the methods and mentalities of the  centralized regime. Somewhere, at the back of their minds, they  do not believe in the need for Romania to reach the standards of  the civilized world.  <H5>  It Would Be a Crime for Romania To Now Miss Its Greatest </H5> Chance    [Badralexi] Are we talking here about irresponsibility,  ignorance, or stupidity?    [Roman] We are faced here with an entire mental system that  shaped the people who grew within that system. Consequently,  they are unable to think differently. I noted this in many  ruling acts and recovery plans of the current government. I am  really concerned about this aspect. Romania has missed a lot of  chances in its history, and it would be a crime to also miss a  chance now that is probably greater than ever before.    [Badralexi] Why is it greater than ever before?    [Roman] For an external and internal reason. In the modern  world, the desire to see as many nations as possible entering  the democratic space is very big. I am firmly convinced of  that. On the other hand, from an internal viewpoint, the great  majority of the people are capable of getting hold of  information in various ways. They have access to information.  To all this one should add the everlasting desire of the  Romanians to see their country make as much progress as possible.    [Badralexi] In your opinion, what are Romania's chances that  the great powers will not sacrifice it again to the omnipresent  Russians?    [Roman] I do not believe in this desire to sacrifice  Romania. I am qualified to state this, in the wake of my  contacts with responsible representatives of the great powers.  I repeat, today there is a desire to see Romania in the  front-ranking group.    [Badralexi] I hope to God you are right...    [Roman] God will see to it, while we will actually do it.    [Badralexi] May this come true. Is this desire shared by  other quarters, too, outside Western Europe?    [Roman] It is also shared by the United States. I have  enough proof of that. But let us go back to our being  sacrificed to Russia's omnipresence and omnipotence -- so as to  return to your question. In this respect, everything depends on  our choice. Until now, our choice has categorically been in  favor of NATO integration, with the exception of the extremist  hysteria, which, however, is not decisive. Well, this  commitment should remain categorical and should be implemented.  Then, we will be able to eliminate the Russian insistence on  maintaining a certain sphere of influence. Let us remember that  Romania has already managed to do that in the period between the  two world wars.  <H5>  We Are Not Calling Upon the People To Make New Sacrifices </H5>   [Badralexi] Would an eventual victory of the opposition in  the case of early elections further the cause of Romania's  integration into NATO?    [Roman] This is a very good question. Regarding our  progress toward the Western structures, the answer is definitely  yes. The opinion-shaping leaders of the majority would no  longer be people who are definitely indebted to, if not even the  slaves of, the Ceausescu mentality. However, there is still the  problem of overcoming the economic blockage. In this respect,  it is not sure that an opposition majority would be able to do  much about it. The reason for that is that we need a solid  consensus in these times of transition. However, I believe that  such a majority should be endorsed by a broader political  spectrum, since contestations are extremely damaging to the  implementation of reform. It is obvious that we must take  unpopular steps in the short run; but if voices come up  promising to ease the people's lot, then everything is going to  be spoiled... However, reform does not require new sacrifices.  We are not calling upon the people to make new sacrifices, but  to work. However, if the people are to do that, they must first  realize that there is no alternative to it.    [Badralexi] Therefore, in case the current opposition  emerges victorious in the elections, will it engage into  negotiations with the future opposition?    [Roman] Yes, I believe it will be necessary to engage in a  very serious dialogue with it.    [Badralexi] What makes you think that that dialogue would be  more successful than the recent negotiations? The dialogue  partners will be practically the same...    [Roman] This does not matter, since the other side will no  longer negotiate from its current position. At this moment,  they are putting their own interests above the country's  interests.    [Badralexi] Do you think that they will keep believing that  their power is everlasting?    [Roman] This is quite possible, if we think of the  mentalities I referred to before. This is how they used to  think and this is how they are going to think in the future,  too. Not all of them, of course, but anyhow, those who are now  represented in the government.    [Badralexi] Nevertheless, do you believe that a man like Mr.  Adrian Nastase [Party of Social Democracy, PDSR, executive  president] can be so naive?    [Roman] No. I suspect that Adrian Nastase -- a man who has  been around the world -- does not believe in that, but I see  that he is playing that game. Therefore, he probably has no  independence in the matter.    [Badralexi] Does Mr. Gherman [Oliviu Gherman, PDSR  president] have such independence?    [Roman] I do not think he has it either. However, Mr.  Gherman is a man without strong personal ambitions.  Consequently, he is sometimes able to give a better and more  positive nuance to his stands.    [Badralexi] Could Mr. Gherman's attitude have a positive  role within the PDSR?    [Roman] I hope so.  <H5>  17 June 1990 Was a Great Trial for Me... </H5>   [Badralexi] If the Democratic Convention [CDR] wins the next  elections, would you want or be able to participate in a  government?    [Roman] I do not think we would really want to do that.  However, we would like to reach an agreement with the CDR on the  package of necessary measures, after which we can give them our  endorsement.    [Badralexi] Would such an alliance be viable?    [Roman] Yes.    [Badralexi] Mr. Roman, do you not regret now that you agreed  to become prime minister at the beginning?    [Roman] When, on 26 December [1989] or 28 June [1990]?    [Badralexi] On 28 June.    [Roman] If I think about it, I do not regret it, since what  was done at the time -- to the extent of eliminating certain old  structures or filling up certain gaps in the process of the  country's modernization -- is a positive thing.    [Badralexi] This may be so, but I was addressing myself to  the politician Petre Roman of today.    [Roman] On 17 June I was thinking of resigning. That was my  great trial. If I were to think about it as a politician,  therefore with a certain degree of egotism, the answer is yes.  After all, such a gesture would have probably solved a lot for  the following year. I am not the man to think egoistically...</p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE;  </P> <P> CHANGE PLANNED FOR TOWN &amp; COUNTRY SITE  </P> <P> A consultant for Orange Town Ltd., owners of the Town &amp; Country shopping  center, announced plans to redevelop the 15-acre property into one of the  county's major commercial centers.  </P> <P> Jim Beam, a former mayor of Orange, said Orange Town, a Burlingame-based  partnership, intends to file an application for the $500-million project next  week.  </P> <P> Preliminary plans, Beam said, include a 500-room hotel, a high-rise condominium  tower and four office buildings with lower levels that could accommodate  400,000 square feet of retail space. The plans also include two six-level  garages, he said.  </P> <P> "We're still fine-tuning the plan, and there could be changes," Beam said.  </P> <P> John Godlewski, a city planner, said that Orange Town Ltd. would have to apply  for a site permit. It also must seek a revision to the city's General Plan,  because the developer's plans may exceed a city limitation for square footage.  </P> <P> One of the major concerns, in addition to commercial office space, was the  traffic that such a shopping and business center would create.  </P> <P> Just across the street is Santa Ana's Main Place shopping mall, and nearby is  the site for a proposed hotel, retail center and high-rise buildings, that has  been proposed by Orient Finance Co., a Japanese credit firm.  </P> <P> Orange Mayor Don E. Smith noted that Santa Ana and Orange have an agreement  enabling both cities to work together on such issues as potential traffic  problems.  </P> <P> Smith, who did not say he favored the high-rise idea, acknowledged that the  county is becoming "more urban," with a tendency to put high-rise structures in  its central core.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying you can put up high-rise buildings anywhere in the city, but  there is a tendency now to allow them in certain areas like the central area,"  he said.

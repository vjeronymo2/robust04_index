			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft falls to DM98m PRE-TAX profits at Metallgesellschaft fell 39 per cent to DM98.3m (Dollars 60.3m) in the six months ended March, in spite of a 17 per cent surge in sales. In the light of 'negative' economic conditions, any improvement in the second half would have to come from continuing cost-cutting programme, the metals-based conglomerate said yesterday. The group planned to press ahead with a disposal programme, announced earlier this year by Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, who said he aimed to raise DM1bn from such sales by the end of 1993-94. Although the overall half-year result was unsatisfactory, some sectors, such as engineering services subsidiaries Lurgi and Lentjes, produced markedly better earnings. On the other hand, the BUS environmental services business was hit when one of its important customers was driven into bankruptcy. Turnover in the services businesses, which account for the bulk of group sales, rose 12 per cent to DM9.3bn. Together with a 48 per cent improvement in the industrial division's sales to DM3.3bn, this advance wiped out reductions in raw materials and other sectors, and pushed the group total up to DM13.9bn. Performance at Buderus, which specialises in heating, construction products and special steel, and forms the mainstay of the industrial division, matched expectations with profits from all businesses except steel. Dynamit Nobel, acquired along with Buderus early last year when Metallgesellschaft bought the non-paper divisions of Feldmuhle Nobel from Sweden's Stora, suffered especially from weak demand for plastic products and high-performance ceramics. Vehicle components maker Kolbenschmidt made a loss in the first half as rationalisation measures failed to compensate for the downturn in automotive markets. Raw materials turned in an unsatisfactory result. Although productivity improved in German smelting plants, they made significant losses as a result of weak non-ferrous metals prices and disadvantageous exchange rates. Investment, which was inflated by acquisitions in the first half of 1992-93 and down 54 per cent to DM1.7bn in the period under review, was focused mainly on Kolbenschmidt, Dynamit Nobel and above all in the Buderus heating business.</p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading THE LAST day of the equity account saw stock index futures trade in a volatile manner with little in the way of economic or political features to boost trading, writes Joel Kibazo. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened strongly at 2,888, and moved forward on good buying. By 9.30am it was trading at 2,893. However, futures dealers had their eyes on the equity market and the turnround there saw futures buying begin to dry up, causing a mid-morning retreat. The lunch-time period brought a rally in the contract which saw it return to the day's opening level but this petered out with the tentative opening on Wall Street once again leading to a fall in June. It closed at 2,865, around 2 points above estimated fair value of about 9 points. Turnover was 10,015. The traded options sector was dull with volume of only 21,855 lots. Some 6,243 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option, and the Euro-FT-SE was particularly busy, trading 5,264, after a big trade by James Capel.</p>

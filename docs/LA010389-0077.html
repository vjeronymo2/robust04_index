STATE STRUGGLES BUT BEATS TOWSON ST.  </P> <P> North Carolina State was expected to extend its winning streak to 5 games  Monday night. After all, the No. 16 Wolfpack was playing at home in Raleigh,  N.C., and the opponent was lightly regarded Towson State.  </P> <P> Well, North Carolina State won, 83-77, but it wasn't easy. The Wolfpack  struggled for most of the game. In fact, they trailed, 32-25, with 6:08 left in  the first half before going ahead at halftime, 46-38.  </P> <P> The Wolfpack built the lead to 75-63 with 7:30 left, and managed to maintain a  double-figure advantage until the Tigers scored 6 straight points to cut the  margin to 77-73 with 3:44 left.  </P> <P> North Carolina State (7-1) could not increase the lead to more than 6 points  down the stretch, and 2 free throws by John Bays with 17 seconds left cut the  Wolfpack lead to 81-77. Chris Corchianni's 2 free throws with 6 seconds left  accounted for the final margin.  </P> <P> Rodney Monroe and Chucky Brown each scored 23 points for the Wolfpack. Bays  finished with 16 points to lead 6 players in double figures for Towson State  (5-4).  </P> <P> Louisiana State 79, Maryland 77 -- Chris Jackson scored 15 of LSU's final 17  points, including an 18-foot jumper with 8 seconds left, to give the Tigers the  victory at College Park, Md.  </P> <P> Jackson, who finished with 30 points, had only 2 free throws in the first 12:24  of the second half, but he took control down the stretch to lead LSU (8-3) to  its fourth straight victory.  </P> <P> Maryland (6-5) didn't make a field goal in the final 6:33 of the first half.  </P> <P> California 70, Colorado 54 -- The Bears, 9-20 last season, won for the ninth  time in their last 10 games and also improved their record at Berkeley to 7-0  by routing the Buffaloes.  </P> <P> Center Leonard Taylor scored 21 points to lead Cal (10-3), which took a 19-5  lead 9 minutes into the game and never trailed. Colorado, which got no closer  than 8 points in the second half, is 5-8.  </P> <P> Utah 75, U. San Diego 57 -- Mitch Smith scored 14 of his 20 points in the  second half to lead the Utes past the Toreros at Salt Lake City.  </P> <P> Smith also had 11 rebounds and 7 assists for Utah (9-6), which has won 8 of its  last 9 games, is 9-6. San Diego is 5-6.  </P> <P> Wyoming 97, Drake 85 -- Reggie Fox scored 30 points, including 13 on free  throws, to lead the Cowboys past the Bulldogs at Laramie, Wyo.  </P> <P> The win, which improved Wyoming's record to 7-5, gave Coach Benny Dees his  100th career victory. Drake is 5-7.  </P> <P> Louisiana Tech 96, North Texas 57 -- Randy White had 18 points and 14 rebounds  to lead Tech at Ruston, La., in a game in which 9 players were ejected after a  bench-clearing brawl with 3:42 remaining to play.  </P> <P> White was one of the players ejected after officials used a television crew's  videotape, causing an 18-minute delay, to review a flagrant foul by Tech's  Vernon Norris and the pushing, shoving, punching and fighting that followed.  </P> <P> Tech is 7-4, North Texas 3-7.  </P></p>

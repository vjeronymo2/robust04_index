Sources within  the Government Ministry, the Army, the OAS, and the Catholic  Church confirmed the start of the talks in village of Caulatu  near the Honduran border. The OAS and the church are acting as  mediators.    The delegation of recontras from the so-called 3-80 Northern  Front is led by its leader, Jose Angel Talavera, alias El  Chacal. The government is represented by Government Minister  Alfredo Mendieta and Colonel Javier Carrion, the Army's deputy  chief of staff.

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Fidel Ramos strongly indicated on Sunday  the Philippine Government will support the initiative of U.S.  President Bill Clinton to seek United Nations economic sanctions  against North Korea to force it to allow inspections of its  clandestine nuclear program.    In a statement released by Malacanang [presidential office],  Mr. Ramos said Manila may have to reverse its position on the  Korean nuclear standoff as a result of the inability of  international inspectors to gain access to Pyongyang's suspect  nuclear site.    Under a Cabinet Cluster E position approved by Ramos last  February, the government said it must not support at this time  the imposition of economic sanctions against Democratic People's  Republic of Korea since it would only provoke Pyongyang to  resort to military confrontation.    The president said the Philippine Government may have to  review its position on the nuclear issue in the Korean  peninsula. Such a review may be rendered necessary by the  announcement of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] on  2 June of the inability of its inspectors to determine whether  there has been any diversion of fuel from North Korea's five MWA  experimental nuclear power reactors.    The government's announcement of a review of its position on  the nuclear standoff in the Korean peninsula indicates a  possible reversal of its diplomatic agenda and may even mean  support for the Clinton administration's confrontational stance  in dealing with the reclusive North Korean military regime.    With the IAEA's latest failure to gain access to Pyongyang's  nuclear sites, particularly its top secret plant in Yongbyon,  members of the UN Security Council lead by the United States and  France are pressing for the imposition of sanctions with North  Korea.    According to President Ramos, it is in the light of this new  situation the Philippines state in the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons and its responsibility as a member of the IAEA  board of governors that we are now undertaking a serious review  of our policy of this matter.    Earlier, the U.S. Defense Department gave North Korea till  this month to comply with international nuclear inspections, an  ultimatum that is likely to result in a possible military  confrontation in the Korean peninsula.    Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo has expressed fears  that the eruption of military hostilities in the divided Korean  peninsula would deal a serious blow to Asia-Pacific economies,  particularly the Philippines which is gearing for economic  takeoff.</p>

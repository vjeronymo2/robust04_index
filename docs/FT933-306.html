			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo declines Shares in oil group Lasmo came under pressure after a broker turned negative on the stock. The shares slipped 4 to 143p in volume of 6.4m after Strauss Turnbull returned the stock to its sell list after a six-month reprieve during which it had advised investors to hold the stock. Mr Howard Cattermole at Strauss said the company 'will come under financial strain because it is barely profitable at current oil prices'. He also suggested that the dividend might be vulnerable. The sector was a strong performer on Monday after oil ministers meeting in Geneva had agreed to set the ceiling on their total output for the fourth quarter at 24.5m barrels a day. However, researchers at Strauss were negative, pointing out that quotas had not yet been determined. Thus they were sellers of BP shares, which retreated from the day's high to close just a penny firmer at 314p. Shell Transport also receded from the day's peak to finish a net 3 ahead at 663p.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Calderon wins El Salvador run-off: President-elect reaffirms his commitment to liberalisation Mr Armando Calderon Sol, the candidate of the governing right-wing Arena party in El Salvador, won a sweeping victory in a run-off presidential election on Sunday. Mr Calderon secured almost 70 per cent of the vote, more than double the support for his rival, Mr Ruben Zamora, heading a centre-left alliance mainly of former guerrillas of the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN). The election was the first since a peace pact by the Salvadorean government and the FMLN in January 1992, which ended 12 years of civil war. The Arena victory had been widely expected after Mr Calderon had narrowly failed to secure an outright majority in the first round of the election on March 20. However, that round was flawed by allegations of irregularities. Officials expressed concern that this could damage hopes of a smooth administrative transition. The president-elect, who will take office on June 1, said he would continue the economic programme and liberalisation of the incumbent, President Alfredo Cristiani, and reaffirmed his commitment to the UN-brokered peace agreement. Mr Calderon offered conciliatory words for a country polarised by the war in which 75,000 people died: 'We are going to govern for all Salvadoreans,' he said. 'Our task and great mission will be to consolidate peace, political stability and the ability to govern the country.' The 46-year-old lawyer, who has served one term in Congress and two as a popular mayor of San Salvador, is not easily identified with any wing of his party. Mr Calderon remains something of an unknown quantity and his advisers maintained a protective cordon around him during the campaign. Aides manoeuvred him out of debates with other presidential candidates for fear that he would make a fool of himself, particularly against the intellectually able and politically astute Mr Zamora. As a founder of Arena in 1981 and a close associate of the late Roberto D'Aubuisson, the party's venerated former leader and a notorious sponsor of right-wing death squads, Mr Calderon has been linked to the ultra-conservative wing of the party. Observers say, though, that Mr Calderon has shifted more recently to a more moderate view, in tune with the present political climate. He used to be a firm opponent of peace negotiations with the guerrillas but he jumped onto the peace bandwagon once an agreement appeared inevitable. Arena, as an authoritarian right-wing party, is now under challenge to make good its commitment to democracy as it faces a legal left-wing opposition, according to Mr Roberto Turcos, editor of Tendencias, a Salvadorean political monthly. The president-elect's opponents accuse him of being an intellectual light-weight with no firm view of how best to oversee the delicate transition from war to peace. 'We are facing a decisive period, with a president who lacks leadership,' says Mr Hector Dada, a Salvadorean political analyst. Opponents of the government contend that agreements on land transfers to former combatants, the deployment of a civilian police force, and judicial reform have fallen seriously behind schedule because of the government has dragged its feet. For the FMLN, which papered over deep divisions in order to project a united front for the elections, its future carries the challenge of offering constructive opposition. Mr Salvador Samayoa, a senior FMLN official, says the party is undergoing a 'reformulation of policies', and maintains it will not split. He expressed optimism that the ex-guerrillas would be a dynamic opposition to Arena in Congress.</p>

			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: AB Electronic sells Page offshoots to reduce gearing AB ELECTRONIC Products, the Welsh electronic components manufacturer, has sold its aerospace and defence subsidiaries, Page Engineering (Holdings) and Page Aerospace, to reduce gearing and concentrate on its core business. Both Page companies, based at Sunbury-on-Thames, have been bought for Pounds 6.25m by a consortium led by Lloyds Development Capital which includes the existing management. Earlier this month AB passed its interim dividend after announcing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.02m for the six months to December, compared with profits of Pounds 5.35m last time. It also said group debt had increased to Pounds 39m, representing 90 per cent of shareholders' funds. Page, which employs about 260 people, made pre-taxprofits of Pounds 1.7m in the year to June 30 1990 on turnover of Pounds 12.1m. Pro-formanet assets at that date were Pounds 6.35m. Sir Peter Phillips, AB chairman, said: 'Page's markets have little overlap with the rest of the group. The board believed that the business should be sold and the proceeds redeployed to assist the redevelopment of AB's core business.' Mr Peter Brooks, investment director of Lloyds Development Capital, said: 'Despite the current risks in the aerospace sector, we believe, in the long term, Page offers an attractive investment. It has prudent sales forecasts, positive cash flow, solid forward order books and a strong experienced management team.'</p>

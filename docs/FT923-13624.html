			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (7): Training needed with credit cards - Debt IN explaining the real or feigned credit inexperience of Japanese consumers, a telephonist at a Tokyo debt collection agency told of the householder apparently surprised to find that the goods she ordered and received from a mail order house were not part of a free gift offer. Having spent much of the 1980s convincing Japanese to increase their use of consumer loans and credit cards, consumer credit companies and department stores have realised that along with the cards should have come education about how to use them. Personal bankruptcies rose from 11,273 in 1990 to 23,287 last year, prompting large Japanese companies, which have traditionally relied on in-house collection departments, to turn to credit research agencies and lawyers in an attempt to improve their debt recovery rates. Mr Eiji Tamaki, chief executive of Consumer Credit Clearance (CCC), a credit information and collection agency, has noticed the difference. His client base has grown by more than 20 per cent over the past six months and he has been surprised by the renown of some companies that have sought help. 'People need education about credit. They have been given credit but they don't understand how to use it,' said Mr Tamaki, who expects that his business will continue to grow rapidly over the next few months. 'This is the winter after the bubble era.' The image of the debt collector in Japan had been tainted by the popular perception that only gangsters are in the business. But the success of Mr Tamaki and of his Credit Assurance Co-operative (CAC), described as a 'voluntary membership union' to which companies subscribe, has made collection more respectable. As a voluntary membership union, CAC is able to send letters requesting that consumers pay outstanding debts to member companies, whereas debt collection, per se, is limited to Japanese lawyers. Fear of gang loan-sharking inspired the restrictions, but the value of CCC and CAC is now becoming painfully obvious to leading companies. CAC can encourage consumers to pay their debts or risk a black-listing on its credit files. The union will send a card politely requesting the payment of a debt and follow up with a card that is still polite, but hints that the black list awaits a defaulter. Meanwhile, the broader the client base of CCC and CAC, the more effective a black-listing becomes. Mr Tamaki is also prospering from the realisation that retailers and credit companies need to be better informed about the credit background of consumers and small companies. A credit industry survey of card penetration earlier this year found that the average adult holds 1.54 cards, up 0.24 from two years ago, and companies have realised that some of these cards should never have been issued. One response has been for credit card companies to introduce tougher limits for new card-holders and improve collection procedures. But, for some bankrupts, the limits have come too late because they were able to accumulate substantial debt from companies more keen on building a customer base than on verifying credit worthiness. A lawyer who specialises in debt collecting explained that an increasing amount of consumer and small company debt is backed by property or security assets greatly eroded by the collapse in the stock and property markets: 'The only thing that will save some people is a rekindling of asset price inflation.'  ---------------------------- BUSINESS FAILURES  ----------------------------           Number       Amount  ---------------------------- 1990  ---------------------------- 1st Q     1,405        Y232bn 2nd Q     1,543        Y496bn 3rd Q     1,528        Y297bn 4th Q     1,993        Y972bn  ---------------------------- 1991  ---------------------------- 1st Q     2,094      Y1,511bn 2nd Q     2,629      Y1,752bn 3rd Q     2,615      Y2,284bn 4th Q     3,385      Y2,601bn  ---------------------------- Source: Tokyo Shoko Research  ----------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Defense Minister General Reynaldo Andino Flores has  clearly stated tonight that the Armed Forces accept President  Carlos Roberto Reina's proposal to change the compulsory  military service to one that is voluntary, educational, social,  humanistic, and democratic only because the Armed Forces remain  subordinate to the president. Nevertheless, the defense  minister added, the Armed Forces do not agree with this change.    Andino Flores said that if this is being done only to  satisfy  the whims of specific individuals, it will be dangerous and  problematic, and he added that people within the military pray  to God that all will go according to plan. The defense minister  emphatically stated his position: We are only accepting this  because we are subordinate, but not because we agree with a  constitutional reform geared to turn the compulsory military  service into a military service that is temporary, educational,  social, and all the other alterations made in this  constitutional reform bill.    In last-minute, exclusive information made available to Voz  de Honduras, we are providing you with the following statements  by Defense Minister Reynaldo Andino Flores:    [Begin Andino Flores recording] Well [words indistinct] we  have faith, hope, and trust that everything will turn out well.  The president is a man of experience. He is a national leader.  He is our president and the top authority in the country. He  knows what he is doing. We hope God will enlighten him in  everything he does and decides. We, I repeat, are an  institution that is at the service of the nation. The president  has been elected by a system established by our laws, and we can  do nothing but obey him.    I only want to reiterate, once again, that we, the Armed  Forces, do not believe voluntary military service is a good  idea. We do not agree, not because we are conservative or  reactionaries, but because we, as professional military men,  know a bit more about military issues and believe there are more  disadvantages than advantages in this idea. If this measure is  going to be implemented only to satisfy personal interests and  not national interests, we are doing the wrong thing. It is, of  course, easier to do what we want and what interests us than to  do what the country needs. If we are truly going to take this  path, I cannot say how appropriate it will be to have a  voluntary military service.    I repeat, I hope we are wrong and that God has enlightened  the [words indistinct] of the president and is enlightening all  of the Honduran people. We hope this new measure will help  Honduras to increasingly become a better and more prosperous  country with better chances for an auspicious future. [end  recording]</p>

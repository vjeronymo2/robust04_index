			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Nato seeks tougher stance on air strikes Nato ambassadors, irritated by the caution of the UN commanders in Bosnia, agreed yesterday to appeal above their heads to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, for a tougher approach to policing the Bosnian skies, write Bruce Clark and Frances Williams. The ambassadors, meeting in Brussels, resolved to write to Mr Boutros Ghali with a list of proposals for faster and more effective air strikes in response to Bosnian Serb provocations. They will call on him to accept the principle of air strikes without warning, and against multiple targets. Under the new proposals, UN commanders would retain their ultimate veto over air raids, but there would be an agreed set of procedures for responding swiftly to provocations and a 'presumption' that they would be followed. Diplomats said Canada was the only Nato country with reservations about this. Differences between the UN and Nato over air tactics in Bosnia were left unbridged by a three-hour meeting on Monday between Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, and senior UN officials in Croatia. Relations deteriorated last weekend when a French Mirage was almost shot down by an anti-aircraft missile over northern Bosnia. Nato proposed retaliating with air raids but UN commanders vetoed this as it was impossible to tell who had fired the missile. In Geneva, Britain's Lord Owen called for an end to the bizarre forms of cross-border trade which stoke the Yugoslav war. French officials alleged recently that Croatian sources were supplying Serbia with oil in return for weapons.</p>

"Guido di Tella's visit to Moscow is a big event, a landmark not  only in bilateral, but also Russian-Latin American relations,"  Kozyrev said.    The talks focused on a wide range of issues and were held in  a business-like and friendly atmosphere.    The Argentinian minister said that the talks in Moscow have  brought relations between the two countries to a new level and  revealed the proximity in the positions of the two countries.  This is a sign that Russia and Argentina are moving together to  a new world order based on peace, cooperation and mutual  respect, he said.</p>

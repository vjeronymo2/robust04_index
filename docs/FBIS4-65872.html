			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by Klaus-Peter </F> Siegloch and Klaus Bresser on 24 May; in the last 15 minutes,  Kinkel is confronted with a "surprise guest," SPD Federal  Manager Guenther Verheugen; place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, you are the kingmaker.  Yesterday, your Free Democratic Party [FDP] made sure that the  Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]  candidate was elected president. Was it only a question of  Herzog, or were Kohl and the coalition in Bonn also at stake.    [Kinkel] The presidential election is a political decision,  and, having this in mind, we made our decision yesterday. After  the second ballot, I recommended that my group vote for Roman  Herzog. First, because we think he is the appropriate candidate,  and, second -- and I said that clearly before -- we made a  coalition statement for the CDU/CSU that is to be confirmed at  the party congress in Rostock. We must pursue a  straightforward, reliable course, which is why our decision was  right. [passage omitted]    [Siegloch] Mr. Kinkel, the FDP seems to be envisaging a  completely different republic. Let me quote some keywords from  your election program: social benefits should be further cut;  those who employ unemployed people should be permitted to pay  lower wages in the future; at the same time, high-income earners  should pay less tax and the highest tax rate should be cut to  below 45 percent. Is yours not a different society than our  current social market economy; would your plans not create a  society in which the poorer will get poorer still and the rich  even richer?    [Kinkel] We do not want the poor to get poorer. The FDP has  demonstrated that is has the necessary social sensitivity, and I  have done so personally in the past in my time as justice  minister and even before that. Still, as an economics party, if  I may put it this way, we must first make sure that the baskets  are full. After all, we can distribute things from this basket  only when they are full. Sometimes one gets the impression in  this country that people do not always see it that way and that  they would like to hand out what they have not yet earned.  [passage omitted]    [Bresser] Let us assume that you again manage to get into  the Bundestag with your elitist program. Nevertheless, you are  no longer the third most important force in the Bundestag, and  thus no longer the party that could create the majority or tip  the scales.    [Kinkel] Who has said that?    [Bresser] All recent opinion polls say that a coalition  between the CDU/CSU and the FDP will not achieve a majority in  the next Bundestag election?    [Kinkel] Just wait and see.    [Bresser] Anyway, do you not sometimes think that you might  be in opposition as of October?    [Kinkel] First of all, in the upcoming elections, and the  Bundestag election in particular, we are campaigning for  ourselves. We want to achieve good results for ourselves, for  the FDP, because we think that we have a right to exist as a  party, regardless of considerations concerning our function.  Let me seize the opportunity and say something. A small though  fine party, since 1949 this FDP has proved at the local,  laender, and federal level that it can make practical policy.  At the federal level, in particular, the FDP has made a  decisive contribution to the reconstruction of the country after  1945 and 1949, and, most notably, it has also made its  contribution to unification. Contrary to others that are now  proclaiming all kinds of vision, such as the Instead Party or  other short-lived groups, we have proved our ability in  practical policies. The functional element, which some people  recently claimed we no longer had, has not disappeared. On the  contrary, it looks as if the CDU/CSU were anxious to continue  the coalition with us, thus hoping and thinking that we will  succeed. As far as Mr. Scharping is concerned, I am also  waiting for coalition statements. He has said that he cannot  imagine cooperation with the Greens because of their program,  which calls for resigning from NATO, giving up the Bundeswehr,  etc.    [Bresser] Would you enter into a coalition with the SPD  [Social Democratic Party of Germany] if Scharping were to be  ahead of the CDU/CSU after the Bundestag election and a  coalition between the SPD and the FDP had a majority?    [Kinkel] Mr. Bresser, I have just made a coalition statement  in favor of the CDU/CSU, and we had a difficult poll yesterday  in the federal convention. You cannot expect me to answer the  question you have just asked me on your television show.    [Siegloch] Still, the fact is that according to all recent  surveys you only come in fourth place. You simply have to  acknowledge that you can no longer play the crucial role the FDP  has in the past 30 or 40 years as you have just described,  because you are only the fourth strongest party.    [Kinkel] Of course [pauses]...what do you mean place four?  This is where we are at the moment. I am not denying that the  Greens -- of whom you are thinking when you speak of place  number three -- have made considerable gains, and that they have  benefited significantly from the fact that they do not bear any  responsibility at the federal level. In some of the laender  they do, and there the governments that were set up together  with the Greens are not that fantastic in practice. Regarding  the federal level, I can see how the republic is waiting for an  SPD/Greens government. I have noticed that in Mr. Scharping,  how much he would be looking forward to that. But, just wait.  Mr. Scharping has said that he would like to have the choice  after the Bundestag election. Fine. As far as I am concerned,  I do not worry too much about my FDP and I repeat what I said  before -- namely, that support for us is growing. I bet that we  will do well in the Bundestag election. [passage omitted]    [Bresser] After the UN debacle in Somalia, you were once  again prepared to send German soldiers to Africa, this time to  Rwanda. Did the Defense Ministry have to stop you from doing  this?    [Kinkel] You have been misinformed. There was a telephone  conversation between Volker Ruehe and me on the subject of  possible deployment in Rwanda. There was talk of two UN tasks  -- namely, setting up field hospitals and making aerial  deliveries of supplies from Nairobi to Kigali.    [Bresser] Is that what you were in favor of?    [Kinkel] We both supported the latter task, but on two  conditions. First, the security situation in Kigali had to be  in order, and the warring parties had to agree.    [Bresser] But Mr. Ruehe had a different opinion. He said  the military situation was confusing. According to him, the  military situation was dangerous, so one should not go to Rwanda  at all, regardless of with whom one goes.    [Kinkel] That is incorrect. Either Mr. Ruehe or you have  misunderstood something. Just as I had in my telephone  conversation with Mr. Ruehe, the cabinet discussed this issue at  length, and Mr. Ruehe of course subscribed to the decision that  we should fly to Rwanda subject to these conditions.    [Bresser] He said German interests are not recognizable.    [Kinkel] I do not know to whom he told this. In any case,  he never said it in the cabinet.    [Siegloch] Bosnia is much closer than Africa. What can the  Germans do for war-ravaged Bosnia? How can they help the  Bosnians? And in one of the "What Now, Mr...?" series of  programs, Chancellor Kohl announced that the Germans want to go  to the limits of their abilities. Are you in favor of the  deployment of German medical personnel in Bosnia?    [Kinkel] First of all, I would not accept what you have just  said about Rwanda. I must protest. What is happening in Rwanda  is the worst kind of genocide; 500,000 people have probably been  killed there in a brutal fashion. If the world is to apply  equal standards, it cannot and must not sit and watch. We cannot  send any soldiers there on account of our constitutional  situation, but the cabinet agreed that we can extend our help in  the humanitarian sphere. As for Bosnia, we also cannot perform  specific missions there on account of our constitutional  situation. But even if we could, the situation is different  because for historical reasons we would never reach a Bundestag  majority decision in favor of such a mission.    [Siegloch] Sooner Rwanda than Bosnia. Is that right?    [Kinkel] It would probably be easier for the Bundestag to  reach a decision concerning a mission to Rwanda because we bear  no historical burden in that country. As I said, constitutional  reasons prevent us from acting in both countries, but I hope the  Constitutional Court will help us in June-July.    [Siegloch] Do you favor the deployment of German troops  within the UN framework, because only in that way could you  fulfill -- or at least come close to -- your ambition of a  permanent seat on the UN Security Council in New York?    [Kinkel] That is what people suspect. There is no direct  connection with such an ambition, but I must of course consider  how we should shape our future relations with the United  Nations. As for my wish to become a permanent member of the UN  Security Council, I happen to have the support of 75-80 percent  of the population. I would like to make it clear that this idea  did not originate with me, but with the SPD, something that is  also interesting to know.    [Bresser] But on the other hand, we are dealing with joint  activity on a European level. Is it therefore necessary for us  to be represented in New York as a nation?    [Kinkel] If it were possible for the European Union [EU] to  be represented in New York, I have always said that we would  agree. But this will not be possible; this is a utopian idea.  France and Great Britain will, of course, wish to remain  permanent members of the Security Council. I checked this  beforehand. We would of course immediately agree to a Security  Council seat for the EU, but this is out of the question.    [Siegloch] What do you tell your foreign interlocutors about  Germany's image in the world and about Solingen, Luebeck, and  Magdeburg? Are these merely regrettable individual incidents,  or do you think something is once again brewing in Germany?    [Kinkel] In any case, I find it difficult to discuss these  things with my foreign colleagues, because this topic plays a  much stronger role than people in Germany think. On the one  hand, I try to explain that these are regrettable individual  incidents, at least in my opinion, and that we are trying to  resolve these issues and this terrible problem at the initial  stage and in terms of sanctions, and of course I also say that I  am ashamed that these things are happening. But, on the other  hand, I also say: Please be fair in judging the FRG on these  issues. We have learned a lesson from what has happened; we  have provided an enormous amount of humanitarian aid and effort  to make good the damage; we have taken 400,000 refugees from the  former Yugoslavia, more than double the number that the other  European countries have taken; and we have exceptionally liberal  legislation, including Article 16 of the Basic Law. Please be  fair in judging Germany, I tell my colleagues. Above all, I tell  them that it is one thing when the state condones or tolerates  violations of human rights, and quite another thing when a  liberal law-governed country like ours is not in a position to  prevent individual occurrences of such an evil nature. We are  doing all that we can to overcome the problem, but unfortunately  we have not succeeded, I say.    [Siegloch] Another two questions before our surprise guest.  What is your greatest foreign policy concern? That the  situation in Russia becomes uncontrollable?    [Kinkel] I will reply from a somewhat broader angle. I  think the central task of German foreign policy in the coming  years will be to lead the transforming countries of Central and  East Europe to our Europe on a political, economic, and security  level.    [Bresser] That will isolate Russia even more.    [Kinkel] Naturally, in this context, the Russian question  plays quite a decisive role. We must not dig new trenches.  This enormous area, 50 times the size of Germany, with a  population of 150 million, and still the second largest nuclear  power, must not be neglected. It must be included in all the  new structural planning. That is the great task facing German  foreign policy since unification and since the end of the  East-West confrontation. [passage omitted]    [Bresser] The last quarter hour of our program is dedicated  to the surprise guest. Mr. Kinkel does not know who is going to  come, but he knows him very well. Both men were proteges of  Hans-Dietrich Genscher, but the man who is now joining us left  the FDP in 1982, subsequently joined the SPD, and has meanwhile  even become federal party manager, thus being Rudolf Scharping's  first campaign manager. Welcome, Mr. Guenther Verheugen. You  were in the FDP for 22 years, and have now been a member of the  SPD for 12 years. Please ask questions of your former  colleague, who is now a political opponent of yours. [passage  omitted]    [Verheugen] After the attacks in Luebeck [against the  synagogue] and what happened afterward, you pointed to the  effects this spreading violent radicalism was having abroad. I  think you used the word devastating.    [Kinkel] Yes.    [Verheugen] I share your view, and I think it was right of  you to have said that. I think you were criticized for it by  others. The question now is whether you think there is something  the democratic parties could do together to stop these radical  right-wing activities from spreading. You probably know I  proposed that the democratic parties should take joint action  against rallies of right-wing radicals. I have not yet received  an answer from you and, unfortunately, received a negative one  from the CDU/CSU.    [Kinkel] Wait a second. I fully agree with you. When we  discussed the issue in the Executive Committee -- I am surprised  that you did not get our answer -- I immediately said that I  fully support your proposal. Absolutely and fully.    [Verheugen] This is an important point for me. I would like  to explain to our viewers what we are talking about. We are  talking about the fact that, whenever the Republikaner stage a  major rally, the FDP, the Greens, and the SPD are ready to hold  democratic rallies at the same time but in a different place to  prevent violent scenes at the location of the Republikaner  rallies, scenes that are familiar to us and that led to your  judgment that such outrages had a devastating effect abroad.    [Kinkel] The FDP is ready to support your proposal without  reservation.    [Siegloch] Gentlemen, you have now found one issue on which  you agree. Still, this was not yet the beginning of coalition  talks. It was a conversation with a moderate tone, not exactly  a dispute, but I think the exchange of arguments has been  informative. Thank you very much, and good night.</p>

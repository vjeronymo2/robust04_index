			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Northern Foods Northern demonstrated yesterday why its shares have outperformed the food manufacturing sector by 27 per cent over the last 12 months. A 20 per cent jump in profits and 17 per cent earnings advance in tough market conditions  -albeit helped by a two-month contribution from Express and Eden Vale and Pounds 36m of balance sheet provisions - fully vindicates its strategy of sticking to dairies, fresh products, and quality supermarket outlets. A measure of the company's class is last year's ability to finance internal investment from operating cash flows. The hectic pace of capital spending will continue in the current period, which should see further double digit earnings growth on the enlarged capital despite a higher depreciation charge and interest bill. Express and Eden Vale are likely to yield Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m of savings by the end of the year, though it will be 1993 and 1994 before the benefits of the current rationalisation programme really show through. Notwithstanding the company's insistence that the Milk Marketing Board shake-up will be good news longer term, the transition to a more liberal market for milk supply could be tricky for the whole sector. That said, one would back Northern's management over others to rise to the challenge, which is one good reason why its prospective earnings multiple is 2.5 points higher than Unigate's.</p>

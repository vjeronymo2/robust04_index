			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Westland's rise to Pounds 13m better than expected - Improved productivity from all divisions WESTLAND Group, the helicopter manufacturer, produced higher-than-expected half-year profits of Pounds 12.8m even though it did not deliver a single new helicopter during the period. The pre-tax figure for the six months to April 2 was 23 per cent up on the previous first half's Pounds 10.4m. 'This was a bit better than our plans,' Mr Alan Jones, chief executive, said. Earnings per share were 5.7p (4.8p) but the interim dividend is unchanged at 1.25p. Its shares closed 14p up at 187p. The profit increase came despite higher costs of Pounds 2.6m for restructuring businesses supplying the depressed civil aircraft market. That compared with exceptional charges of Pounds 900,000. Mr Jones said the result reflected improved productivity across the whole group. Operating profits before restructuring costs were up in all divisions. This included the Normalair-Garrett equipment subsidiary, which Mr Jones said had 'returned to normal margins'. Half-year sales increased from Pounds 198m to Pounds 220m, with the gap in helicopter production compensated by support and upgrade work. Westland expects to supply about four Lynx helicopters to Portugal in the second half. But deliveries are not scheduled to pick up significantly until 1996-97 with the new EH101 naval and utility helicopter, a joint venture between Westland and Agusta of Italy. Mr Jones was optimistic that Canada would stick by its plan to purchase the EH101 although the contract had been called into question by the country's Liberal opposition. Canada's order of 50 helicopters is the largest to have been placed, exceeding the 44 ordered for the Royal Navy. Italy has been negotiating a contract for 16 EH101s with options on eight more. Westland still had 'a good chance' of selling Sikorsky-licensed Black Hawk helicopters to Saudi Arabia, Mr Jones said. This might involve a direct contract with Westland rather than through British Aerospace, the lead company in the UK's Al Yamamah defence supply package for the Saudis. COMMENT Westland is a lesson in patience. It would be hard to expect much more of the company, given the gap in helicopter orders and the downturn in civil aerospace. The lull is due to last another two years or so, during which it will have to concentrate on cutting costs further. Before then, GKN could sell the 21 per cent stake it bought in 1988, when it had ambitious plans for its defence interests. On the other hand, with a Pounds 1.91bn order backlog Westland promises subsequently to become a significant cash generator, irrespective of whether its long-awaited Saudi contract ever materialises. As in the past three years, the company is obviously reserving dividend growth for the final payment when it is expected to nudge the total up from last year's 4.25p. The City is expecting full year pre-tax profits of about Pounds 30m (Pounds 26.3m)for a p/e of 16 to 17.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Why Does Ukraine Need a Prime </F> Minister As Early As June?"]    [Text] The issue concerning the formation of a new cabinet  before the presidential elections surfaced rather suddenly. The  practically simultaneous announcements made by the president and  the speaker on the need for such a step makes one think of the  classic question--"To whose advantage is that"?    From the viewpoint of common sense, the need to form a  cabinet with the unclear chances of the current president in the  elections appears sufficiently doubtful. It is understandable  that Leonid Kravchuk is specifically the one standing to lose  the least of all from the possible consequences of such a step.  His actions fit ideally within the scheme of the pre-election  struggle--the president is so certain of himself that he is  already forming a government with which he will work in the  future. In case of victory this will serve to enhance his  popularity, while if he comes in last there is nothing to lose.  The only miscalculation by the president is his recognition of  the Supreme Council. Up to now Leonid Makarovich has practically  ignored the parliament. Kravchuk's answer to a question from a  deputy--"Why didn't you congratulate us on our election?" is  quite indicative. The president allowed himself a joke in the  Odessa style: "If that would help you with your work I would be  congratulating you three times every day." Since Leonid Kravchuk  is proposing a candidate for premier to the Supreme Council, he  consequently recognizes the fact of its existence and the role  it is called upon to play. That is an insignificant  miscalculation--should Leonid Kravchuk become president once  again he will have to deal with parliament in one way or another  anyway.    The advantages that will be gained by the Supreme Council  and  concretely by Aleksandr Moroz are quite doubtful. Moroz, of  course, could have made such announcements on purely  propagandistic grounds--you see, despite everything, we are  insisting on decisive actions, the first of which is replacement  of the government. By the way, it is possible to delay such  activity, since two weeks in "big politics" mean nothing. If the  government is selected before the presidential elections, the  Supreme Council will find itself in a difficult situation--it  bears responsibility for the government. All the presidential  candidates, including Leonid Makarovich, would be very happy  with such a turn of events. The fact that a government exists  affords the possibility of getting a rest from pre-election  battles and marshalling strength for the coming struggle. At the  same time everything that is taking place in the country can be  calmly written off to the government and the parliament that has  joined it. Moreover, the existence of a "people's" government  simply condemns the future president to a struggle with  parliament (with the exception of the case when Moroz himself  becomes president, which is unlikely). The result of that  struggle is known beforehand--executive power always wins in the  struggle between authorities inasmuch as it has greater  mobility. It is also necessary to take into account our own  specifics, which are that it is practically impossible to have  the president resign.    It is possible to allow that Aleksandr Aleksandrovich's goal  is to discredit Leonid Makarovich yet again, rejecting all his  nominees for the post of premier. But in reality Kravchuk only  stands to gain from such a biathlon--everyone already knows of  his "decisiveness" and "desire to work," while those who doubt  this will also take the side of the president inasmuch as  psychologically the position of the proposing side is the  winning one. In addition to that, the speaker must be interested  in such an active struggle with the president, that is, he must  have a certain understanding with the other proposed  candidate--Leonid Kuchma. For Kuchma, in turn, the stake in such  a game may be nothing less than his loyalty to the Supreme  Council, while any gain is quite insignificant, if it exists at  all.</p>

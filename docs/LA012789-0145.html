			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST : LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> FIRST INFRARED, THEN FANGS, THEN CAPTURE  </P> <P> A fleeing suspect bit off more than he could chew -- or perhaps it was the  other way around -- when he tried to fight off a police dog working with  California Highway Patrol officers Thursday night.  </P> <P> The 26-year-old suspect was taken to San Clemente General Hospital for  treatment of dog bites on both thighs.  </P> <P> The incident began at 6:47 p.m. when the CHP pursued a suspected drunk driver  south on Interstate 5 in the Mission Viejo area, CHP Sgt. Dennis Dyer said. A  check of the license plate indicated that the car was stolen.  </P> <P> The suspect suddenly stopped in the freeway's center divider near Cristianitos  Road and ran across the freeway lanes, almost getting hit, and into a large  field near Camp Pendleton, he said.  </P> <P> The CHP searched the field, assisted by helicopters from the Orange County  Sheriff's Department. A second helicopter from the Costa Mesa Police Department  located the suspect by using infrared sensors that detected the suspect's body  heat in the tall, dense brush, Dyer said.  </P> <P> That's when Nick, a German shepherd police dog with the Sheriff's Department,  was sent in. The suspect, identified as Fernandez Hernandez of Modesto, tried  to fight off the dog. "He lost," Dyer said.  </P> <P> Hernandez was arrested on suspicion of car theft and driving while intoxicated,  Dyer said.  </P></p>

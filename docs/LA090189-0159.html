			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EUROPE SOLEMNLY MARKS WAR'S 1939 ONSET;  </P> <P> POLES LOOK 'INTO PAST AND FUTURE' AS GERMANS RELIVE SHAME OF INVASION  </P> <P> Belgian radio listeners awoke to the chilling sound of Adolf Hitler declaring  war on Poland, and Germans mourned their grim legacy to the world as Europeans  today marked the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II.  </P> <P> Jews, Poles, Russians, Germans and others gathered for memorials across the  continent to remember the great conflict that began with the Nazi invasion of  Poland. The events conjured somber memories of bomb shelters and concentration  camps, of scrambled boundaries and splintered families.  </P> <P> West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, expressed sorrow  and regret for the "unspeakable suffering" wrought by the Nazis. He also tried  to assuage lingering German guilt.  </P> <P> "It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were blinded and  deceived by that tyrant," Kohl said of Hitler.  </P> <P> "Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted with such evil,  they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs? And who among us can judge  what it meant at that time to risk not only one's own life but the lives of  one's family as well?" he asked.  </P> <P> In Communist East Berlin, ailing leader Erich Honecker missed the memorial  ceremony in the 500-member People's Chamber, where Foreign Minister Oskar  Fischer delivered the main address.  </P> <P> Fischer called for a day of "recollection and sorrow" and said the East German  leaders pledge "to do everything in our power to ensure that war and fascism  never again threaten our lives and the lives of our children."  </P> <P> Poland's leaders marked the occasion with a symbolic show of unity by the  Communists and the Solidarity labor movement they once crushed.  </P> <P> Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and  former Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, now the prime minister, appeared  together at a small Polish garrison in Gdansk that bore the first Nazi  onslaught on Sept. 1, 1939.  </P> <P> "On this day of great national memories we look not only into the past but also  into the future," said Jaruzelski, flanked by two men he once jailed.  </P> <P> "Let this be an oath in this sacred place," Jaruzelski said, his voice  trembling. "Poland stood the toughest trial of war with honor. On this  exceptional day we have the moral right to address all nations and governments  of Europe. We want to have friends close to us, and far away" -- an obvious  reference to the Warsaw Pact nation's efforts to reach out to the West.  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, eager to keep Poland in the Soviet sphere  as that nation flirts with reform, said in a message to Jaruzelski: "The Polish  people and their army were the first to bear the brunt of Germany's powerful  military machine.  </P> <P> "These tragic events were actually prompted by the inability of the states  threatened by fascism and militarism to rally together and set up a collective  security system."  </P> <P> In Belgium, BRT state radio woke up listeners with a spine-tingling flash from  the past: a tape of Hitler declaring war on Poland on the same day he had  launched the first attacks. The frenzied fuehrer's incitements were followed by  the cheers of adoring Germans.  </P> <P> In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway station to  remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape Hitler's "blitzkrieg"  bombings.  </P></p>

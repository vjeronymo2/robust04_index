In a political statement issued on March 7, the  twelve EU Member States welcomed the measures recently adopted  by the Israeli Government to ensure the safety of Palestinians,  and pointed out that Israel is responsible for the safety and  protection of all inhabitants in the Occupied Territories. They  appealed to the parties to the Middle East conflict for talks on  the question of "the safety of Palestinians, including the issue  of certain settlements, and to agree on appropriate measures."  They called on the UN Security Council to adopt "an appropriate  Resolution" as swiftly as possible and advocated the  establishment in the Occupied Territories of "an international  presence in which the European Union declares its willingness to  participate."    The Greek Foreign Minister and current President of the EU  Council of Ministers, Carolos Papoulias, said after the debate  on the Middle East that all his colleagues agreed on the need to  support the case of the PLO leader, Yasir 'Arafat, who is viewed  as a vital element in the peace process.</p>

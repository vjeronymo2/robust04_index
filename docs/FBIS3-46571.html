Later, a Foreign Office spokesman  told reporters that the talks, which lasted for about two hours,  were held in a cordial atmosphere.    President Kim Il-song said that his country supports the  inalienable right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people  in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security  Council. He said we still adhere to the stand we had taken on  the Kashmir issue during the visit of the late Zulfiqar Ali  Bhutto to the DPRK in 1976.    Benazir Bhutto apprised the DPRK president of the Indian  policy of brutal repression in Kashmir and occupied Kashmir.  She also informed him of the background of the foreign  secretary-level talks between India and Pakistan due to be held  on Sunday. She emphasized that India should give categorical  assurance that state terrorism will be stopped in occupied  Kashmir, the siege of the Hazratbal Shrine will be lifted, the  number of Indian troops in the occupied valley will be reduced,  and the political prisoners in occupied Kashmir will be  released. She expressed the hope that India will forsake  intransigence and adopt a reasonable attitude.    The prime minister also apprised the DPRK leader of  Pakistan's stand on nuclear nonproliferation and said that  Pakistan is ready to accept restrictions on the proliferation of  nuclear weapons at the international and regional levels. In  this context, she referred to Pakistan's proposal for a  five-nation conference on nuclear nonproliferation, which has  been supported by the Chinese Government. She said Pakistan  supports the DPRK president's view that after the end of the  Cold War, all countries should observe the UN Charter. Bhutto  added that Pakistan opposes any country's hegemony or domination  over another. In the past, Pakistan and the DPRK have resisted  political and economic hegemony and the two countries should  hold mutual consultations in this regard in the future as well.    Concerning the reunification of the two Koreas, Benazir  Bhutto said the people of Korea should settle this issue  themselves without any outside interference.    The prime minister assured President Kim Il-song that  Pakistan is ready to assist in removing differences between the  DPRK and the United States on the nuclear issue.    President Kim Il-song endorsed the Pakistani prime  minister's  view that a new global economic system should be evolved through  negotiations among the poor countries. He also underscored the  need for an exchange of visits of delegations from the two  countries to promote cooperation in various fields. The prime  minister said Pakistan can benefit from the experience of the  DPRK in the social sector because the DPRK has succeeded in  alleviating poverty and solving housing problem. She said the  two countries will further increase cooperation in the fields of  irrigation and hydroelectric schemes. The prime minister  invited President Kim Il-song and the DPRK prime minister to  visit Pakistan, which was accepted. [passage omitted on Bhutto  engagements in Pyongyang and her departure]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Sidelines" column by Sabri Hammadi: "Intimate, Solid, and </F> Strong Relationship"]    [Text] The relationship we mean is the intimate link  between the great Iraqi people and their struggler leader Saddam  Husayn. This relationship, which began 35 years ago, has  continued to acquire substance and solidity in the cauldron of  the battles of struggle and reconstruction through all the  trials until it has, today, become a rare fabric, which no enemy  can penetrate or undermine.    Needless to say, this special relationship has not come out  of vacuum, nor has it been formed in one battle or occasion. It  is also, certainly, not a lop-sided relationship such as some  leaders and rulers have with their peoples, but is an intimate,  solid, and strong human relationship based on the strong pillars  of affection, confidence, respect and the truest meanings of  affiliation and loyalty.    The first time Iraqis heard the name Saddam Husayn was in  1959 when people spoke admirably and appreciatively of the great  deed by the loyal and courageous Ba'thist youth who, along with  fellow Ba'thists, liquidated the dictator 'Abd-al-Karim Qasim on  al-Rashid Street. And, in 1964 Ba'thist strugglers began to  understand and feel through practical experience that the  leadership of their young comrade Saddam Husayn was of a  historic, invasive, and daring type that played a basic role in  rebuilding the party and unifying it on the organizational and  intellectual levels, and that it was pursuing the party's  national and pan-Arab struggle despite all the challenges and  hardships placed in its way by the renegades.    Following the glorious 17-30 July Revolution, Iraqis  understood that leader President Saddam Husayn, who devoted his  life to the service of the Iraqi people and the Arab nation and  the achievement of the historical national and pan-Arab aims and  ambitions, was in fact the engineer, planner, and brain behind  all the great achievements and victories the revolution had  achieved since 1968.    It must be said here that the evil enemies have also  realized  at an early stage that one of the sources of Iraq's strength is  this intimate relationship and rare unity between the people and  their leader. So, it is natural for the evil forces to target  the symbol and leader of Iraq and his intimate relationship with  the people by trying hard to drive a wedge between them.    At a time when the enemies are wagering and concentrating  their efforts on penetrating and undermining this unique  relationship, the glorious Iraqis, who are certain that Saddam  Husayn is the guarantor of their continuous victories, the  captain who will sail their ship to safety, and the leader of  their march on the path of progress and advancement, got even  more attached to his historic leadership, expressed their  determination to adhere more and more to the symbol of their  struggle and dignity, and affirmed their resolve to march  forward under his flag; the flag of Allahu Akbar.    It was also clear during the immortal Mother of Battles that  the U.S.-NATO coalition was wagering on splitting this humane  relationship between the people and their leader. The best  proof of this wager is the U.S. Administration's insistence on  continuing the unfair blockade on the Iraqi people without any  legal or political justifications as indicated by the openly  hostile U.S. acts and statements. But what has happened and is  happening now clearly shows that the evil forces are discovering  with time that their wager has failed miserably and that they  have failed and will continue to fail to undermine this  relationship which they have been targeting for four years to no  avail. In fact, the evil forces are now certain that this  relationship that they are trying to undermine is getting  stronger and has become one impenetrable unit despite all their  conspiratorial plans, political and economic pressure, and cheap  propaganda campaigns.    Indeed, this noble relationship has resisted all the mean  imperialist-Zionist wagers and plans. The evil and aggressive  forces are convinced that they cannot penetrate it and that what  they have done and are doing to this end is of no avail and will  absolutely not change the loyal Iraqi people's stand toward  their historic leader and righteous son, Saddam Husayn.  Therefore, the evil forces have no choice but to give up their  mean endeavor and to seriously reconsider all their hostile  policies toward steadfast Iraq, which is what they are doing now.</p>

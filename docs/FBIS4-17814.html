The statement recalls that Georgian armed units had crossed  the Inguri River on the left-hand flank of the confrontation  line in the afternoon of April 24. Three Georgians were killed  during the ensuing battle. "The Abkhazian Defence Ministry  assesses these actions as yet another attempt to torpedo the  talks on the peaceful settlement of the Georgian-Abkhazian  conflict," the statement says.</p>

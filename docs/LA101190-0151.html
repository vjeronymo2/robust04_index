			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> BEST BETS: GRAND DAME OF MUSICALS  </P> <P> One of this area's best entertainment bets is the Santa Barbara Civic Light  Opera's 1990-1991 season, which just kicked off with the classic American  musical "Mame" at the Lobero Theater in Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> And 51% of the light opera's season subscribers are residents of Ventura  County.  </P> <P> "The 51% represents advanced paid subscriptions, but total annual ticket buyers  last year included more than 33,000 from Ventura County, out of more than  64,000 total tickets sold," the group's spokesman said.  </P> <P> The troupe received national attention this year when it was named a finalist  in the 1989 Regional Tony Awards. It was the only musical theater company among  the nine nominees.  </P> <P> "Mame" plays at 8 p.m. Wednesday through Friday, 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday and 7  p.m. Sunday, through Oct. 28. Tickets cost $21 to $22.50. Season subscriptions  are still available at greatly reduced prices.  </P> <P> The rest of the light opera's 1990-91 season includes the musicals "Annie,"  "Singin' in the Rain" and "A Chorus Line."  </P> <P> This year, a three-show subscription for children is being offered at $33.75  for "Mame," "Annie" and "Singin' in the Rain."  </P> <P> "Mame" stars Toni Kaye, who performed for six years on "The Carol Burnett  Show." Her film credits include "Funny Lady" and "Pennies From Heaven." She  choreographed and starred opposite Mickey Rooney in the stage hit "Sugar  Babies."  </P> <P> Lobero Theater is at 33 E. Canon Perdido. For more information, call 963-0761.  </P></p>

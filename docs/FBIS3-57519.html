Mr. Landyk also gave a negative assessment of the role  of the former government of Russia, blaming Gaydar and Fedorov  for attempts to crush Ukraine economically. "Possibly, the new  appointments will benefit Ukraine," he said. He also said that  the government will continue to provide credit for agriculture,  "because one can live if there is something to eat." In the  opinion of Valentyn Landyk, the crediting of agriculture will  not lead to a new emission of currency; the government will not  allow that to happen. The money owed by commercial banks to the  National Bank of Ukraine could become a source of credit. The  problems of credit do not only depend on the government. We are  holding talks toward that end with the National Bank of Ukraine,  Landyk stated. For example, in the first quarter alone the Bank  "Ukrayina" has to return 2.5 trillion coupons. The overall debt  for the credits granted by the National Bank is [words  indistinct]. The debtors are mostly banks and enterprises and,  of course, the debts of the countryside which, in the opinion of  Landyk, could be paid off with grain. The deputy prime minister  said: "We are in favor of reform and liberalization; however,  not everything should be `let go'. Regulation is still  necessary."</p>

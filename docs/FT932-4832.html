			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Belgium apology in Gulf war row BELGIUM has formally apologised to the UK for refusing to supply it with ammunition in the build-up to the Gulf war two years ago. Mr Leo Delcroix, the Belgian defence minister, apologised to his British counterpart, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, when they met in London last month - the first official opportunity since the Belgian minister took over the portfolio in March last year. 'If Mr Delcroix had been minister of defence then (in 1991), he would have said yes, and if the British asked now for similar things, he would say yes,' a spokesman for the minister said yesterday. The January 1991 decision was seized upon at the time by British politicians as a prime example of EC members' failure to co-operate on foreign and defence policy in the Gulf. Belgium said it refused because it did not want to undermine a diplomatic solution to the crisis, but the decision soured relations with the UK within Nato. Belgium claims it was one of the reasons why Britain decided not to back a bid by its chief-of-staff to take over one of the top Nato positions last year.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The chairman of the House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control said  he will urge President Bush to promptly call a western hemispheric drug summit.  Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) rejected as unacceptable federal drug czar  William J. Bennett's suggestion that the summit not be held until Bennett first  draws up a national drug strategy. That plan, due in September, is to address  education, treatment, law enforcement and interdiction. Rangel has long  complained that the United States has no coordinated foreign policy on drugs.  "We should hold the summit now. Leaders of South America are pleading for one,"  Rangel said.  </P></p>

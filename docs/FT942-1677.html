			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Accountancy: Independence not a suitable case for treatment  -Walter Schuetze discusses the tensions he sees between companies and their auditors on this issue As chief accountant of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, I want to raise a matter that I have found personally very troubling: the issue of auditor independence. The commission has stated repeatedly that the independence of auditors, both in appearance and in fact, is crucial to the credibility of financial reporting and to the capital formation process. Independence is an abstract concept, and it is difficult to define either generally or in its peculiar application to the certified public accountant. Essentially it is a state of mind. It is partly synonymous with honesty, integrity, courage and character. Objective standards of independence have been introduced into the accountancy profession's ethical codes. It is not enough for members to do what they think is right. They must also avoid behaviour which could lead to an inference that they might be subject to improper influences. The profession must be like Caesar's wife. To be suspected is almost as bad as to be convicted. One issue that has vexed and bewildered me since I came to the commission two years ago is that of auditors not standing up to their clients on financial accounting and reporting issues when their clients take a position that is, at best, not supported in the accounting literature or, at worst, directly contrary to existing accounting pronouncements. To me, auditors giving way to their clients or subordinating their views to their clients', raises a nasty issue about independence, both in appearance and in fact. In my opinion, an auditor's independence is jeopardised as much by his or her subordinating judgment about a financial accounting and reporting issue as it is by investing in securities issued by a client, loaning money to a client, or borrowing money from a client - perhaps even more so. At least insofar as money matters are concerned, if there were disclosure to the investor about that fact, then the investor would be on notice and could be guided by the facts, although I would definitely not advocate such an approach. Not so with the subordinated judgment, which is insidious. There is no way to communicate impaired or coloured judgment. No disclosure about it ever could be complete, or be trusted. Nor is there any way for an investor to make judgments about the effect of impaired judgment on the part of the auditor. It is true that many new and complex issues reach my desk because there is an honest difference of opinion based on well-reasoned positions on all sides. In these cases, the staff works with the registrants and their auditors to resolve those issues through discussion, analysis of analogous literature, and compromise in many cases. Addressing those kinds of issues is a challenging and interesting part of my job, and I encourage registrants and their auditors to continue to bring these issues to the staff. I also am aware (because I worked in public practice for many years) of the thousands of decisions that are made by auditors in their work where they insist on adjustments to financial statements that reduce net assets and income, or otherwise insist on financial statement reporting and disclosures that managements of their clients would rather not make - none of which is ever publicised. However, there have been too many times when accounting arguments made by registrants lack any reasonable foundation and, without being able to cite any authoritative support for the registrant's position, the auditor has acquiesced. In the last two years, many such proposals have reached us from registrants and their auditors. And they are not supported by just an engagement partner in a firm without consultation within the firm, but by partners from the national offices of the firms as well. Take the airline company which, with the support of its current and replacement auditors, proposed to classify as a current asset at the most recent balance sheet date the portion of the deferred costs on aircraft overhaul that were to be amortised to expense in the next year. Or the company that proposed to report an adjustment to tax liabilities that it discovered had been understated in a business it bought; not in its income statement in periods prior to the business combination, but in the adjustments arising in purchase accounting. It also appears to me that accountants may have become cheerleaders for their clients on the issue of accounting for stock options issued to employees. In 1978, six of the then Big Eight accounting firms wrote to the Financial Accounting Standards Board suggesting that it should reconsider the accounting rules for stock options granted to employees. In 1984 and 1985, when the FASB began reconsidering the issue, all but one of the Big Eight wrote supporting both a reconsideration of the accounting rules and a charge to compensation cost/expense for all options granted to employees. But, in February 1993, even before the FASB issued its exposure draft on the subject on June 30 1993, all of the Big Six accounting firms joined forces with certain members of industry and a group of users to recommend to the FASB that there be no formal recognition for the cost of stock options. The firms did not offer an explanation for their change of mind. Anyone could change their mind; I have done so on several accounting issues over the years. But I think the public deserves an acknowledgement by the firms and the reason why. Such a change in position, without a corresponding change in the underlying concepts and issues that led the firms and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants initially to support the board's project, has left some members of the public with the impression that the switch was in response to the fear of losing clients or other forms of retaliation. Could continuation of these trends be anything other than an invitation to Congress, the SEC and other regulators to regulate more heavily, and directly, the auditing profession in particular and financial accounting and reporting in general? Could it lead investors, particularly institutional investors, to find alternative ways to corroborate issuers' representations in their financial statements? The examples cited represent a small - some might even argue insignificant - number of exceptions to the generally outstanding manner in which the profession carries out its duties as public watchdog. But individual practitioners and firms need to be mindful that the number of such instances that may poison the well with regulators, legislators, investors, and the public is small indeed. These comments do not come from an ivory tower. I have lived and worked in the accounting profession for more than 30 years. I know the realities of saying 'no' to a client. I know the disappointment some clients express when the auditor makes a decision to support an accounting proposal that may reduce those clients' reported earnings. I know the long and often heated phone calls and client visits, the strain, and the financial cost that follow such decisions. But I also know the rewards: a clean conscience and not having to worry about losing law suits based on the merits, and pride in the profession and the credibility of financial accounting and reporting. I hope that the profession and registrants will, through self-restraint, take a fresh look at these independence issues and let nothing stand in the auditor's way of telling the truth as he or she sees it. The views expressed by Mr Schuetze are a condensation of a speech given by him in January in his personal capacity and are not necessarily those of the SEC.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / Cadbury auditing proposal attacked The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales yesterday attacked a central recommendation of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance that companies should report publicly on internal controls. The institute's financial reporting and auditing group called instead for a much reduced statement in companies' annual reports and a separate private report from auditors to audit committees. A Cadbury committee working group, which includes institute representatives, is developing revised proposals on reporting on internal controls. An earlier draft of its recommended guidance was widely criticised for being too lengthy and impractical to implement, and the institute's statement could prove another setback to the group's work. Yesterday's report called for company accounts to include an internal control statement by directors and a declaration that their responsibilities have been met. In a previous provocative statement last week, which put it at loggerheads with the Auditing Practices Board, the institute's auditing committee argued that guidance by the board on whether a company was a 'going concern' raised a number of problems with which it could not agree. These included the need for an accounting standard and the time into the future over which auditors could provide reassurance.</p>

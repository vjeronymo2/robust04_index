			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / The Malaysian Trade Ban: Like Australia, Britain may be forced to concede an apology - Previous rows Malaysia's ban on state contracts for British companies in protest at reports of corruption by the UK media has taken John Major's government by surprise and doubled its embarrassment over the Pergau dam affair. FT writers explain the background to the conflict and the depth of the troubles now facing UK companies British officials displayed a stiff upper lip in response to Malaysia's action yesterday. Aides to Mr John Major, the prime minister, dismissed talk of retaliatory sanctions, insisting it was 'far too early' to say how Britain might respond. 'The British government does not tell the British press what to write, and our trade relations with Malaysia really have nothing to do with what the British press decides to print,' said a senior official. However, Downing Street is uncomfortably aware that Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, has placed successful bets on this course before. Attention in Britain has focused on the 'Buy British Last' row in the early 1980s, when Malaysia instituted a near-boycott of UK goods in retaliation for London's decision to end subsidies for foreign students. The dispute was eventually ended after a long campaign for better relations by Mrs Margaret Thatcher (now Baroness Thatcher), who was then the British prime minister. Lady Thatcher later described her close relationship with Dr Mahathir: 'I hope that I am not presuming in describing him as a friend, whose counsel I have found invaluable, as well as a very skilful and tough negotiator for Malaysia's interests.' But that row was over an issue of substance - the cost of sending Malaysian students to London. The new row, triggered by Malaysian dislike of British press reports, has more in common with two other disputes. which had different endings. The first blew up in 1990, when Dr Mahathir took offence over a fictional drama series, called Embassy, broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). The series, set in an Australian embassy in a fictional south-east Asian country called Ragaan, was filmed in Fiji and did not mention Malaysia. Nevertheless, Dr Mahathir interpreted the programme as an insult to Malaysians, and threatened to retaliate with a trade boycott against Australia. Initially, Mr Bob Hawke, then Australian prime minister, took a similar line to Downing Street - that the government was not responsible for what the ABC chose to broadcast. But the row escalated until Mr Hawke went to Kuala Lumpur in 1991 to deliver what was seen in Australia as a demeaning apology. Last year Malaysia made life equally uncomfortable for Mr Hawke's successor, Mr Paul Keating, who was unwise enough to describe Dr Mahathir as 'recalcitrant' for refusing to attend a Pacific Rim summit in Seattle. Dr Mahathir imposed restrictions on contacts with Australia and hinted that he might downgrade diplomatic relations. Again, the row was ended by an Australian apology, reluctantly delivered by Mr Keating. Then, as now, Dr Mahathir, chose to lay most of the blame on the media: 'Some newspapers made me out to be a difficult person and very unpopular and that Malaysia was about to burst into racial violence,' he said. 'How can Australia claim to be part of Asia when Australian journalists lack manners?' But Mr Keating eventually wrote a personal letter to Dr Mahathir and twice publicly expressed regret for his remark. Nonetheless, it was felt in Australia at the time that damage had been done to business confidence in the relationship. Aides to Mr John Major know that there would be great political dangers for the British prime minister if he was forced to deliver anything approaching an apology to end the row. Whether Dr Mahathir will push the dispute that far is not clear. But his brinkmanship with Australia shows his determination to avenge anything seen as a slur. 'Sometimes you have to be a bit notorious to be a bit famous,' he said last year. 'In order to be known, you have to be nasty.'</p>

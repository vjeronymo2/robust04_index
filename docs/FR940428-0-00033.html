Schaeffer (225), Assistant Director for Policy and Program Administration, Education Service, Veterans Benefits Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20420, 202&hyph;233&hyph;2092.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On pages 49196 through 49199 of the <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 -->  Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> of September 22, 1993, there were published interim final regulations with a request for public comment. These regulations amended 38 CFR part 21 in order to implement provisions of the Veterans Benefits Act of 1992 which affect flight training and to provide for approval of flight training in flight simulators for VA educational benefit purposes. Interested people were given 30 days to submit comments, suggestions or objections. VA received no comments, suggestions or objections. Accordingly, these regulations are now final.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To ensure that flight training would achieve the end of qualifying the individual for employment in the aviation industry, VA regulation &sect;21.4263 has long restricted approvable training in two ways: (1) The entity providing the training must have a pilot school or provisional pilot school certificate issued by the FAA under part 141, 14 CFR (&sect;21.4263(g)); and (2) the training being offered must meet the FAA requirements of either Part 141, in the case of pilots, or part 63, in the case of flight crew members other than pilots (&sect;21.4263(g)(3)(ii)). Thus, the individual is assured of the quality of the training and its ability to enable him or her to meet FAA standards for an appropriate certificate or rating in areas relevant to commercial aviation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 22, 1993, these amended regulations now also permit pilot flight training pursuant to 14 CFR part 61, conducted in flight simulators to be approved for purposes of VA (Department of Veterans Affairs) administered education benefits when such training is authorized by the FAA (Federal Aviation Administration).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

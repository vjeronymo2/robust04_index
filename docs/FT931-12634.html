			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse chief resigns after two and a half years MR PAUL Lego yesterday announced he was quitting Westinghouse Electric after only two and a half years as chairman and chief executive of the troubled conglomerate, but insisted he had not faced boardroom pressure to leave. His retirement follows criticism of Westinghouse's management over the past year by shareholder activists. Westinghouse has elected Mr Richard Morrow, former chairman of the oil company Amoco, as chairman while Mr Gary Clark, president of special operations, will become president and acting chief executive officer. Mr Morrow has been on the Westinghouse board since 1986. The board is to look for a new permanent chief executive, and said it would consider candidates from both inside and outside the company. Mr Lego he had decided that this was an appropriate time to leave because last November he had put into place a recovery plan for the group, which has been struggling for two years with serious property losses in its financial services business. The recovery plan, which was welcomed by shareholder activists as a big step in the right direction, involves Westinghouse getting out of financial services, cutting its dividend, taking a Dollars 1.13bn after-tax charge and selling off several businesses to bolster its balance sheet. Westinghouse shares were little changed on the news.</p>

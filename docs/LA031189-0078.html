			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET'S KEEP FIGHTING IN RING, NOT RINK  </P> <P> In Tracy Dodds' NHL notes (Feb. 23), Islander Coach Al Arbour apparently thinks  hockey needs fights to prove something about standing up to another team.  </P> <P> Arbour's words make me angry.  </P> <P> If hockey's rules and suspension would be strictly enforced, it might become a  much more widely accepted and respected sport.  </P> <P> Hockey takes years of training, dedication and great athletic skill. I think  fighting should be kept in the ring, not the rink.  </P> <P> TORI BARNAO  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Spanish financier detained on fraud charges Mr Javier de la Rosa, one of Spain's richest and best known businessmen, was yesterday detained pending formal charges in Barcelona, prompting speculation that his arrest on charges of fraud could prompt an Italian-style political fallout. Earlier Mr de la Rosa, who was at the centre of major deals during the booming late 1980s in Spain, had defiantly threatened those seeking his downfall. 'Everyone had better be prepared to take their share of responsibility,' the financier told a radio interviewer, 'Those who have put this process in motion haven't a clue what the consequences could be.' Meanwhile in Madrid, Mr Mario Conde, removed as chairman of Banesto, the big domestic retail bank, by the Bank of Spain at the end of last year, was questioned yesterday by the chief investigative judge dealing with fiscal offences over alleged bribes paid by the bank in order to obtain tax breaks. Mr Conde faces several investigations following the move by the Bank of Spain, which believed he had brought Banesto close to collapse. Mr de la Rosa is accused of misappropriation of public funds in connection with credits, guaranteed by Catalonia's Generalitat government, that were granted to his loss-making holding company Gran Tibidabo. He is best known for spearheading large investments in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office and is being separately sued by the office over losses that forced the Spanish companies it controlled into receivership two years ago. His arrest has already prompted opposition calls for the resignation of senior members of the Generalitat which had recently blocked an investigation by Catalonia's regional parliament into Mr de la Rosa's affairs. The development is very embarrassing for Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan nationalist leader and President of the Generalitat, who has consistently backed Mr de la Rosa. The political consequences could extend also to Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in Madrid which depends on the support of Mr Pujol and the Catalan nationalists to stay in power. Mr Gonzalez yesterday distanced himself from the events saying he did not intend to 'lose any sleep' over Mr de la Rosa's arrest. Referring to the fortunes that were made in Spain in the late 1980s, the prime minister said the times of a 'speculative' economy were over. Mr de la Rosa and former Banesto chairman Mr Conde were the emblematic winners of Spain's recent economic boom and both were close to the political establishment in Madrid and Barcelona. Conservative opposition leader Mr Jose Maria Aznar said that Mr Gonzalez, who has been in power since 1982, had 'sown the seeds of corruption' and that the prime minister would be forced to 'reap the harvest'.</p>

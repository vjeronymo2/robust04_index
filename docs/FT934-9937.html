			<p>931108 FT  08 NOV 93 / Survey of Portugal (3): From militant Maoist to democrat - Profile, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso MR Jose Manuel Durao Barroso has enjoyed a meteoric rise in Portuguese politics to become number three in the government. Beginning as a militant Maoist, he rose to become foreign minister, and brokered the 1991 Angolan peace accords, perhaps Portugal's biggest diplomatic victory in recent times. At 37, Mr Durao Barroso is now the youngest foreign minister in the European Community and, just a year after he took office, he is already one of the most highly respected members of Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva's cabinet. With a mixture of hauteur and natural timidity, he says the key factor to success was being in the right place at the right time - and facing challenges head on. 'Up until now, opportunities just came to me - and I took them,' he says. When the Social Democrats swept to power with an absolute majority in 1987, Mr Cavaco Silva invited him to become secretary of state for African affairs and foreign cooperation, even though he had never set foot in Africa, a key area for Portuguese foreign policy. 'The prime minister wanted somebody without prejudices,' he explains, alluding to Portugal's numerous Africa veterans whose feelings often colour their politics. But it was more than that. His tact and ability to listen had already caught the premier's attention. Later these qualities earned him the confidence of Angola's two warring factions. Mr Durao Barroso worked tirelessly to break the deadlock and bring the foes together after 16 years of war. President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and rebel leader Jonas Savimbi signed the peace accords in May 1991. All excellent training for his current post. 'My experience made up for my youth,' he says. Ironically, though, he became foreign minister last November at the very moment that his carefully-orchestrated peace accords were unravelling and the Angolan civil war re-erupted more ferociously than ever. With his youthful interest in politics, he was a law student when, in the revolutionary fever of 1974, he began rallying Maoist rivals of the orthodox Portuguese Communist Party. He now claims he was simply reflecting the climate of the times rather than espousing any true leftist conviction. 'I was 18 years old and engaged in the first thing I liked,' he says. 'There were only two political forces then. It was strange because I joined the more radical.' A stay in London in 1976 modified his views. He went to Geneva university to take a post-graduate course in political science and European studies. The sudden death of then Prime Minister, Francisco Sa Carneiro, in 1980 drove Mr Durao Barroso back to Portugal and into the Social Democratic Party. 'The day after his funeral I joined the party. I never knew him, but greatly admired him - he symbolised Portugal's struggle to become a Western-style democracy.' It was not until 1985 when Mr Cavaco Silva first became prime minister that Mr Durao Barroso turned to the shaky politics of post-revolutionary Portugal. 'But I felt the timing was right, and that Mr Cavaco Silva deserved all our support.' Somewhat philosophical about his present position now, he says: 'in politics, even the best politician is never sure of controlling the circumstances.'</p>

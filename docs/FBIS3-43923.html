Diplomats said disagreement over the future of the police,  especially the riot unit, had proved a stumbling block in the  latest round of talks, which began in the Zambian capital in  November. UNITA wanted the riot wing disbanded, arguing that it  operated more like a military than a normal police force, and  was serving to terrorize peole rather than keep the peace.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] La Rioja, 18 Mar (NA) -- The Provinces of Santa Fe  and Entre Rios today reached agreement and settled their veiled  disputes over the functioning of the Constituent Assembly.  Governors Carlos Reutemann and Mario Moine signed a document  outlining the guidelines for the assembly which will modify the  Constitution.    The ceremony for signing of the document -- initially  scheduled for yesterday, but postponed because it was impossible  for Reutemann and Moine to travel to this city -- was held at  the provincial Government House. The ceremony was also attended  by La Rioja Governor Bernabe Arnaudo and Acting Senate President  Eduardo Menem.    Also present were Parana Mayor Julio Solanas, Santa Fe Mayor  Jorge Obeid, and Domingo Carlos Trulla, the chairman of the  Supreme Court of La Rioja.    The text signed by Reutemann and Moine has eight points, the  first of which states that the agreement seeks to "formulate a  proposal for the distribution of the functions of the  Constituent Assembly between the two cities."    The agreement states that Parana will handle the  inauguration  of the Assembly, the special sessions, and the closing session  -- for which the Entre Rios provincial Government will provide  the Tres de Febrero Municipal Theater.    Meanwhile, Santa Fe will host the Constituent Assembly  plenary sessions and the board of Assembly authorities and  secreariats, for which the Reutemann's Santa Fe administration  will provide "the esplanade of the Litoral University and the  facilities which may be needed for authorities, secretariats,  and assistants."    The document also establishes that advisory committees will  be housed "in places established by the Constituent Assembly,  seeking an equitable distribution between the cities of Santa Fe  and Parana." The new Constitution will be approved and sworn-in  at San Jose Palace, in Concepcion del Uruguay, as previously  announced.    Arnaudo said that because the agreement was signed in this  capital "it will be recorded in La Rioja's history," adding that  "the province is once again the stage for major national events."    "We are committed to this process of change, promoting a  national consensus for recreating the Constitution to match the  new model of Argentina," Arnaudo said, emphasizing the  importance of "introducing needed changes at this time of  economic and social transformation."    Moine highlighted the significance of the agreement "at this  historic moment." He said: "Never before have the majority  parties -- which represent the will of 80 or 85 percent of  Argentines -- reached a consensus for this reform that is so  necessary."    Moine emphasized that the reform "does not relate to the  present, but with the future," adding that reforming the  Constitution is a "contribution to the common good." He  promised to "do his best to fulfill the objectives outlined in  this document."    Reutemann thanked Senator Eduardo Menem "for everything he  did toward a successful outcome," noting that "when Sante Fe and  Entre Rios were chosen to house the event, everyone began to  speculate about the difficulties that would arise between the  governors."    Finally, Senator Menem -- the first cadidate for Constituent  Assembly member for the Justicialist Party of La Rioja -- said:  "Many times, those who play a role do not realize they are  making history," adding that "many events in Argentina and in  the world were achieved by men who were unaware they were making  history."    "We know that, with the constitutional reform, we are  rewriting history, a history that stems from the past and  projects itself into the future," Menem said, noting that the  election of Santa Fe and Parana as the seats of the Constituent  Assembly "acknowledges their major role in organizing the  country."</p>

Section 1828.001 is removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 1828.371 is revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> 1828.371  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Clauses for cross-waivers of liability for Space Shuttle services, Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) launches, and Space Station activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In agreements covering Space Shuttle services, certain ELV launches, Space Station activities, NASA and other signatories (the Parties) agree not to bring claims against each other for any damage to property or for injury or death of employees that occurs during the time such a cross-waiver is in effect. These agreements involving NASA and other Parties include, but are not limited to, Memoranda of Understanding with foreign governments, Launch Services Agreements, and other agreements for the use of NASA facilities. These agreements require the Parties to flow down the cross-waiver provisions to their related entities so that contractors, subcontractors, customers, and other users of each Party also waive their right to bring claims against other Parties and their similarly related entities for damages arising out of activities conducted under the agreements. The purpose of the clauses prescribed in this section is to flow down the cross-waivers to NASA contractors and subcontractors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The contracting officer shall insert the clause 1852.228&hyph;72, Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Shuttle Services, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work to be performed involves ``Protected Space Operations'' (applicable to the Space Shuttle) as that term is defined in the clause. If Space Shuttle services under the contract are being conducted in support of the Space Station program, the contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section and designate application of that clause to those particular activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228&hyph;78, Cross-Waiver of Liability for NASA Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) Launches, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more for the acquisition of ELV launch services when the service is being acquired by NASA pursuant to an agreement described in paragraph (a) of this section. If, under a contract that covers multiple launches, only some of the launches are for payloads provided pursuant to agreements, an additional clause shall be inserted in the contract to designate the particular launches to which this clause applies. If a payload is being launched by use of an ELV in support of the Space Station program, the contracting officer shall insert the clause prescribed by paragraph (d) of this section and designate application of that particular launch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The contracting officer shall insert the clause at 1852.228&hyph;76, Cross-Waiver of Liability for Space Station Activities, in solicitations and contracts of $100,000 or more when the work is to be performed involves ``Protected Space Operations'' (relating to the Space Station) as that term is defined in the clause. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) At the contracting officer's discretion, the clauses prescribed by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section may be used in solicitations, contracts, new work modifications, or extensions, to existing contracts under $100,000 involving Space Shuttle activities, ELV launch services, or Space Station activities, respectively, in appropriate circumstances. Examples of such circumstances are when the value of contractor property on a Government installation used in performance of the contract is significant, or when it is likely that the contractor or subcontractor will have its valuable property exposed to risk or damage caused by other participants in the Space Shuttle services, ELV launches, or Space Station activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 1852_SOLICITATION PROVISIONS AND CONTRACT CLAUSES <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4.

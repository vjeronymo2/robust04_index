			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS LOTTO REACHES $62 MILLION, TOPPING CALIFORNIA'S BIGGEST POT  </P> <P> Lottery officials upped the state Lotto jackpot to $62 million today -- a  national record -- as gamblers and dreamers from as far away as Europe clamored  to play.  </P> <P> The geographical range is "something we've never seen before," Illinois Lottery  Director Sharon Sharp said.  </P> <P> Travelers passing through O'Hare International Airport jammed Lotto booths,  where sales for Saturday's drawing have been just about double the average.  </P> <P> Ticket sales were also particularly brisk at lottery outlets near Illinois'  borders with Indiana, Wisconsin and Missouri, as residents from those states  flocked to get in on the action.  </P> <P> "They're ordering them by the hundreds. One runner from Indiana just bought  $3,200 worth," sat Pat Poulos of the Deluxe Restaurant in Danville.  </P> <P> The previous top Lotto record was $61.98 million, set last October in  California.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIKUD BLAMES U.S. FOR SHAMIR'S DOWNFALL;  </P> <P> ISRAEL: PARTY LEADERS CHARGE THAT PRESSURE FROM WASHINGTON UNDERMINED THE PRIME  MINISTER.  </P> <P> In offices of Likud Party leaders, the losers' locker rooms of this week's  political contest, there was plenty of blame being spread around for the  apparent loss of the prime minister's post to the Labor Party, and not a little  of it Wednesday was placed on the Bush Administration.  </P> <P> In the view of the Likud faithful, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was undermined  by unrelenting U.S. pressure not only to promote peace talks beyond the range  of his own policies but also on a number of other touchy subjects. If President  Bush was not trying to push Shamir out, he was a major contributor to his  downfall, Likud officials charged.  </P> <P> "The criticism from Washington kept piling up. No matter what we did, it was  wrong," said government spokesman Yossi Olmert. "There was an air of constant  displeasure in Washington that hurt Shamir at home."  </P> <P> There has long been suspicion among Likudniks that the Bush Administration  favors the center-left Labor Party, headed by Prime Minister-designate Shimon  Peres, over Shamir's rightist Likud.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the day after being tapped to succeed Shamir, Peres was busily  trying to pull together enough parliamentary support to set up a government. He  wooed two religious parties with promises of ministries and money for their pet  projects, schools and housing. Labor officials predicted that he would announce  a new Cabinet by next week.  </P> <P> Shamir rejected a cursory invitation from Peres to join him as a junior partner  in a new unity government because Peres has promised to move ahead with  American-brokered peace talks.  </P> <P> "We will act with all our ability so that a government headed by Mr. Peres is  not set up," said Arab Affairs Minister Ehud Olmert of Likud. "We think that a  government headed by Mr. Peres is not good."  </P> <P> Industry Minister Moshe Nissim, also a Likudnik, said that a Labor-led  government would cause "severe political damage to Israel."  </P> <P> Spokesman Yossi Olmert produced a list of conflicts with Washington that seemed  designed to upset the Shamir regime: Israel's military contacts with South  Africa and Ethiopia; the criticism from Bush over Israel's abduction of a  Muslim cleric in southern Lebanon last year; the issue of aid to Soviet Jewish  immigrants who settle in East Jerusalem, and Washington's continued dialogue  with the Palestine Liberation Organization.  </P> <P> The latest irritant to Shamir's government came in the form of a State  Department report that essentially absolved the PLO of authorizing terror  attacks on Israel.  </P> <P> The report listed nearly 30 border and rocket attacks by Palestinian groups  against Israel since PLO Chairman Yassir Arafat renounced the use of terrorism  in December, 1988. But it added: "We have no evidence in those cases or any  others that the actions were authorized and approved by the PLO Executive  Committee or by Arafat personally."  </P> <P> Spokesman Olmert said the report "is not relevant to reality."  </P> <P> "The PLO continues to be deeply involved in terrorist activity against Israel,  both in Israel proper and in the occupied areas," he said.  </P> <P> Olmert's argument was partially undercut by Israel's army chief of staff, Lt.  Gen. Dan Shomron, who told a Parliament committee that there is no proof that  Arafat's faction in the PLO, Fatah, is carrying out attacks against Israel.  </P> <P> Besides looking to Washington, some senior Likud officials found cause for  blame within the party. Intra-party rivalries reached a high pitch in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> "We were giving not the impression of ruling, but of trying to hold onto  power," said top aide Yosef Ben-Aharon. "If the battle for succession begins,  Likud could disappear for some time."  </P> <P> Likud rivalries are set to reignite, however.  </P> <P> "If Peres nears forming a government, everyone will be smelling blood,"  spokesman Olmert said.  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / The Lex Column: News Corporation Still hemmed in on all side by the banks, Mr Rupert Murdoch is clearly determined to make the best of what he has got. Squeezing a 35 per cent increase in first-quarter profits from UK newspapers during an advertising recession is impressive work, even allowing for the benefit of lower newsprint costs. The lack of an obvious buyer for the group's remaining weak performers - such as Ansett - must be all the more frustrating for that. Equally, Fox films remains a wild card, since its contribution turns on its ability to produce blockbuster movies on the scale of last year's Home Alone. With no clear sign of recovery and some drag on earnings, News Corp will find the heady pace of earnings growth difficult to maintain. By raising Dollars 1.5bn in equity and long-term debt since the year end, though, Mr Murdoch has tilted the balance of power away from the banks. His eagerness to gain an investment grade credit rating suggests more bond issues to pay off bank debt. High interest costs will rule out anything ambitious for the time being, but News Corp will at least have a free hand to invest in its main businesses without the bankers' rubber-stamp. On the evidence of yesterday's figures this will be freedom enough to keep shareholders sweet.</p>

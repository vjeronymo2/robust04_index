			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> VAN DRIVER HELD IN ALLEGED KIDNAPING  </P> <P> A Mexican national was arrested early Thursday on suspicion of kidnaping and  robbing three fellow Mexican nationals whom he allegedly had agreed to smuggle  into the United States.  </P> <P> Rafael Llanos, 28, of Los Mochis, Mexico, was placed in Orange County Jail with  bail set at $50,000 after a California Highway Patrol officer stopped Llanos'  van and discovered three men trapped inside in a hidden compartment.  </P> <P> After stopping the van at 1:16 a.m. for speeding on the southbound San Diego  Freeway at Magnolia Street, CHP Officer R. Gonzales heard screams from the  back. Upon checking further, he found the three victims stuffed in a  compartment beneath a plywood platform covered by boxes, Fountain Valley Police  Sgt. Larry Griswold said.  </P> <P> In questioning the men, Griswold said, Gonzales found that they had agreed to  pay $450 each for Llanos to smuggle them from Tijuana to Los Angeles last  Sunday.  </P> <P> But when they arrived in Los Angeles only one of the three had enough money to  pay Llanos, Griswold said. So all three were allegedly beaten and kept locked  in a garage until Wednesday night, when Llanos loaded them in the van to drive  them back to Mexico, Griswold said.  </P> <P> The victims, ranging in ages from 21 to 27, were detained by Fountain Valley  police until later Thursday morning when they were bound over to the U.S.  Immigration and Naturalization Service for immigration proceedings.

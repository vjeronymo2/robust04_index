			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oana Stanciulescu: "A Secret Document of the </F> National Defense Minister -- Pavel Grachev `Defends' Dniester  Region; The Russians Wish To Cross Over Romania With Their  Troops"]    [Text] The political events of the last week were marked  by the visit to Bucharest of the Russian Federation's defense  minister, Army General Pavel Grachev.    In accordance with a secret report compiled on this occasion  by the Romanian Ministry of National Defense, General Grachev's  visit was a complete failure. Not pleased with the way in which  the negotiations with the Romanian side were unfolding, at the  end of the meeting the Russian defense minister directly  approached the Dniester issue. According to General Grachev,  the local Russian leaders, mostly maneuvered by the former KGB,  are making difficulties for the Russian military buffer forces.  Therefore, the Russian Army intends to occupy the Dniester  region with its military troops. The reason invoked for this  action is to prevent the worsening of the current situation in  the region, which is characterized by "passing the control over  the republic into the hands of certain groups of gangsters," and  also to prevent the reopening of the conflict with Moldova.  Romania's leadership was informed about this intention both by  Ukraine and Turkey.    The position adopted by the Bucharest authorities toward  this  problem was evasive. The Dniester region, from a legal point of  view, does not even exist, thus, this means deploying troops on  the territory of Moldova. Therefore, one should ask for  Moldova's and not Romania's consent, although Bucharest doubts  that the Chisinau authorities would agree to turn the Dniester  region into a military base. The Romanian National Defense  Ministry document also stressed that Romania is firmly against  the increase in the number of military personnel and combat  technology in East Europe because, first of all, those would be  at variance with the spirit of the treaty on reduction of  conventional weapons.    As far as solutions to the crisis in Yugoslavia are  concerned, Russia asked Romania to permit the passage of its  troops, logistics, and military equipment through Romania's  territory to Bosnia.    Romania's leadership was informed about such demands by  Ukraine's defense minister, Vitaliy Radetsky. Just like  Ukraine, Romania showed willingness to submit only the necessary  air corridors, but only upon special request by the United  Nations, when the world organization will consider it necessary.  Although the Russian general insisted on obtaining a favorable  answer on the issue of using Romania's territory for the passage  of heavy weapons, he was politely refused, on the pretext of  negative reaction from the Romanian people.    According to Romanian experts, the aforementioned document  shows that Russia's intention for the future is to install a  solid expeditionary corps in Bosnia, which should also  participate in all NATO and West European maneuvers.</p>

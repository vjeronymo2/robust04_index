			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special to THE STAR" by Ahmad Shakir and Ra'id al-'Abid] </F>   [Text] For the third time in as many months, the Government  of Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali went into the Lower House  Wednesday [2 February] to fight for its life, this time over the  explosive issue of food and medicine in Jordan.    Dr. al-Majali was out of the country when his Health  Minister  Dr. 'Abd al-Rahim Malhas went on record to expose his own  ministry and food and medicine wholesalers, and to point a  finger at Dr. al-Majali himself two weeks ago. Dubbed as the  "Malhasgate scandal," it created national hysteria, and deputies  demanded a special session to hear the Government's reply to  accusations made by a cabinet minister.    On Wednesday, Dr. Malhas marched into the House carrying an  800-page file said to contain names and figures documenting  serious violations concerning food and drug imports. The file  also implicates former officials, who had allowed the import and  distribution of certain food products when Government  laboratories had indicated that they were not fit for human  consumption.    Dr. Malhas, who delivered the Government's reply, defended  his press statements and said that Jordanians are victims of  greedy food and medicine merchants. In his 70-minute speech,  Dr. Malhas attacked the "whales" who imported food not fit for  human consumption, and medicines that do not meet international  standards. He said he had documents that prove some medicine  importers are making over 300 percent in profits, and some as  high as a 1000 percent profit on certain medicine shipments. He  added that these companies had threatened to stop medicine  imports if the Government did not agree to price increases. He  went on to say that certain medicines that are available in  Jordan do not meet international standards, while others do not  even meet the standards of the countries where they are  manufactured.    Dr. Malhas added that most of the imported meat, foodstuff  and cheese is transported into Jordan in unrefrigerated trucks  in temperatures reaching 35 degrees, and that the ministry had  destroyed some of these because it was not fit for human  consumption.    After Dr. Malhas' speech, deputies asked for copies of his  file, while the Speaker of the Lower House asked the deputies  not to pass the documents to the press so as not to interfere  with the legal measures that are expected to be taken against  those implicated.    The file is kept under police guard and its distribution is  restricted to deputies until the House decides what to do with  the case. The House will start to deliberate on it in the next  session on Saturday.    In an attempt to take Dr. al-Majali off the hook, Dr. Malhas  told the deputies that the ministry of health, with the support  of the Prime Minister, took immediate measures to enforce health  regulations and to fight what Dr. Malhas described as  international food gangsters that sell bad foodstuff.    Dr. Malhas said there were gaps in regulations that allow  medicine importers to import medicine into Jordan without  getting approval from the ministry. He said the US Congress had  passed legislation permitting US drug companies to export  products which are otherwise banned in the United States. He  added that a number of drugs available in the local market are  not registered with the ministry and called for establishing an  authority to monitor foodstuffs and medical products.    Dr. Malhas again warned of the greed of the so-called  "whales", a few wholesalers who make their fortune by importing  expired foodstuff into the country.    Dr. Malhas also mentioned cases where expiry dates have been  changed and health certificates forged so that food could be  allowed into the country. He said his file documents names and  incidents of many of these cases.    He said the ministry had shut down over 16,000 factories,  shops, bakeries and restaurants for health violations.    Al-Ramtha deputy 'Abd-al-Karim al-Doughmi supported Dr.  Malhas's position, while Irbid deputy 'Abd-al-Ra'uf al-Rawabidah  accused him of negligence. The Islamists did not take a  position, but sources said they might oppose the minister after  they received counter information from the president of the  Pharmacists Association and IAF member Husam Musmar and a number  of wholesalers who are also IAF members.    The fact that Dr. Malhas has provided evidence documenting  serious health violations will undoubtedly shift attention from  the Government to the so-called corruption cases.    Meanwhile, innocent traders and local pharmaceutical  companies continue to suffer as a result of Dr. Malhas' initial  statements. So far, Sudan and Tunis have suspended drug  shipments until more information on the status of Jordan-made  food and drugs become available. Dr. Malhas last last week said  that Jordanian medicines are of high quality and that they were  not included in his list of violators.</p>

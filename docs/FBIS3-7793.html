			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Z.L.: "There Is Agreement Concerning Defense"] </F>   [Text] The future "coalition" deputy minister of national  defense will be responsible for contacts with the Sejm. The  decision on establishing the post of "the parliamentary  undersecretary of state" in the Ministry of National Defense  [MON] was made during the talks with the participation of  Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. Jerzy Milewski, National Security  Office head and secretary of state in MON, did not take part in  the last stage of the negotiations. The first deputy of the  national defense minister has been in the hospital for a week  now. "The possibility cannot be ruled out that the personnel  decisions will be made as early as next Monday [28 February),"  Colonel Wieslaw Rozbicki, MON spokesman, informed on 25  February. Jerzy Szmajdzinski, general secretary of the Social  Democracy of the Polish Republic, Sejm deputy of the Democratic  Left Alliance, and chairman of the Sejm Defense Committee,  confirmed on 25 February that the agreement on the filling of  the post of the "political" deputy minister had been reached  with the MON leadership. In line with the procedures, the  candidate for the deputy minister should be proposed to the  prime minister by the minister. "There already exists a list of  candidates for the portfolio of the deputy minister," said  Szmajdzinski; he firmly denied that his name is on that list.  "The Government Press Office is not in the habit of acting  before things actually happen. We issue information about  recalls and appointments that have actually been made in the  government," we heard on 25 February in the Office of the  Council of Ministers.</p>

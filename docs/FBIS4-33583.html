			<p>BFN     [Text] Antonio Mota Graca, aka Curica, who was responsible  for the transportation of the 7 metric tons of cocaine seized in  Tocantins State, is the most important man from the Colombian  cartels in Brazil.    Although 13 drug traffickers have been arrested, Curica  again  escaped Federal Police.    In 1991, he was freed from inside a Military Police patrol  car when he was leaving jail to testify before the court in  Itapecirica da Serra, Sao Paulo State.</p>

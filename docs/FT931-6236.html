			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Hoechst is accused over chemical spray HOECHST, one of the three giant German chemical companies, has been accused of reacting too slowly after it sprayed about 10 tonnes of chemicals  - some potentially toxic  - over a Frankfurt suburb, writes Clive Cookson in Frankfurt. Hoechst insists there is no danger to residents from exposure they have received. Company officals say the direct costs of the accident, which happened a week ago, will be at least DM10m (Dollars 6.14m) and perhaps several times more. At least 10 different chemicals were discharged in the accident at its Griesheim plant, the company said yesterday after analysing soil samples. Some of the chemicals are potentially toxic or caustic. They include two tonnes of ortho-nitroanisole, a smelly, yellow chemical used to make dyes, which the company says is 'potentially carcinogenic.' State government officials say Hoechst responded too slowly to the accident and failed to disclose details on what the chemicals are and their potential toxicity.</p>

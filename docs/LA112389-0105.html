			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NO BREACH IN TERRORISM POLICY, U.S. ASSERTS  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials insisted Wednesday that the U.S. role in helping  free Americans trapped in El Salvador did not breach a longstanding U.S. policy  of refusing to negotiate with terrorists.  </P> <P> They would not confirm whether there had been a deal allowing the Salvadoran  rebels to go free along with the Americans and other foreigners caught in the  Sheraton Hotel on Tuesday after a pre-dawn assault by Salvadoran guerrillas.  </P> <P> "I don't know that there was an agreement to let them go," Assistant Secretary  of State Bernard Aronson told reporters at a State Department briefing. He said  that during negotiations, the Salvadoran forces withdrew from around the  Sheraton Hotel. "The terrorists probably took advantage of that opportunity and  other opportunities to get out," he said.  </P> <P> He and other State Department officials confirmed that a U.S. Embassy official  arranged for the open phone line over which the Salvadoran government conducted  negotiations with the rebels. However, the officials sought to avoid giving the  impression that the successful outcome had been the result of a deal between  the United States and the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN).  </P> <P> President Bush acknowledged that he had dispatched special U.S. troops to El  Salvador on his own Tuesday, before either obtaining a request from Salvadoran  President Alfredo Cristiani or seeking his approval.  </P> <P> "I told him (Cristiani) what we were going to do, and he acquiesced," Bush  said.  </P> <P> Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One on a trip to Memphis, Tenn., Bush  said: "When you see Americans held hostage like this, there's a message in all  of this: the President, backed by our defense secretary, is going to protect  the lives of Americans however we can and go to any ends to protect the lives  of American citizens."  </P> <P> U.S. aides attempted to portray the rebels' seizure of the Sheraton Hotel as an  attempt to divert public attention from the "military shellacking" they have  taken during their offensive in San Salvador.  </P> <P> "The FMLN failed totally in this offensive," Aronson said. "They probably lost,  in terms of wounded or killed, somewhere between 15% or 20% of their forces --  maybe more." He estimated that more than 1,000 of the leftist guerrillas were  killed.  </P> <P> "So now, what they're going to do and what they are doing, is simply trying to  do something that's unexpected (so they can) get on television. . .," he said.  "They will do something else in the next few days if they can. They will grab  some embassy, they will grab some individual, if they can get away with it."  </P> <P> State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler gave the following official U.S.  account of the hotel incident:  </P> <P> At least a dozen rebels sneaked into the Sheraton Hotel before dawn Tuesday, at  a time when at least 15 U.S. officials and some private American citizens were  inside. The guerrillas did not occupy the entire hotel but succeeded in taking  custody of 17 people, including "several" contract employees of the U.S. Agency  for International Development and an American spouse.  </P> <P> At the same time, an armed U.S. military contingent of 12 "trainer-evaluators,"  said to be on temporary duty in El Salvador, barricaded themselves inside the  hotel.  </P> <P> "They warned the guerrillas that they would use their weapons only if forced to  do so in their own defense," Tutwiler said. "The guerrillas did not try to  break into their area."  </P> <P> During the telephone talks, the government arranged to have the FMLN turn over  the foreigners to a team of Red Cross and Roman Catholic Church aides. The  civilians were released Tuesday night. The rebels also disappeared from the  hotel Tuesday night, and the U.S. military contingent walked out Wednesday  morning.  </P> <P> Times staff writer David G. Savage contributed to this report.  </P></p>

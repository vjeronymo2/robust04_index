			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / High-stakes power play in the homelands: Monday's massacre in Ciskei has damaged the prospects for compromise in South Africa South African politicians spend a remarkable amount of time vowing not to speak to one another, and Monday's massacre in the Ciskei black homeland has prompted yet another round of dark threats from both sides about the future of constitutional negotiations. Indeed, for most of the two and a half years since Mr Nelson Mandela was released from prison in February 1990, the official position has been that the African National Congress (ANC) and the government are not negotiating. Meanwhile, there has been almost continuous contact between officials from both sides, discussing everything from political prisoners to constitutions. But those contacts are described as talks about talks, or talks about why there are no talks. Officially, the ANC and the government are not speaking. That is the situation now: the ANC says it cannot talk to the 'regime' because it holds Pretoria responsible for the Monday killings, carried out by the security forces of Ciskei, one of the black homeland governments which survive only through South African support. The government says it is 'reassessing' talks with the ANC because the organisation seeks to impose its will by violence, through the kind of provocative mass action which left 23 dead in Ciskei. There is fault to be found on both sides, and each is now busy finding it. But independent politicians believe the real fault lies in the fact that neither side is serious about negotiation - not serious enough to face real political compromises over power sharing; not serious enough to agree on an interim government which alone can restore stability; and not serious enough to settle the future of the homelands. Put simply, neither side yet feels enough pain to make compromises aimed at stopping it. Monday's march in Ciskei, organised by the ANC with the aim of overthrowing the government of military dictator Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, was meant to step up the government's pain. ANC officials disagreed over whether such a strategy was worth the risk, but the strategic gain for the ANC is now obvious. For Ciskei is rightly seen, internationally and domestically, as South Africa's responsibility. Pretoria created the homelands, and Pretoria sustains them with financial security and political support. With Monday's deaths the government of Mr F W de Klerk can no longer delay dealing with the homeland problem. In reality, of course, the homelands are not one problem but many. For the 10 'homelands' created as segregated tribal states under apartheid each have their own political identity and their own aspirations to power in the new South Africa. Transkei, the second-largest homeland with 3.5m inhabitants, has proved fertile ground for ANC mobilisation. Its residents are Xhosas - the tribe of Mr Mandela and other top ANC leaders - and its leader, General Bantu Holomisa, is the staunchest ANC supporter among homeland leaders. Gen Holomisa seems to have chosen his ally wisely, for he has escaped the ANC's campaign against the repressive practices of homeland leaders. Instead, the ANC has chosen to target Ciskei, the much smaller Xhosa homeland in the eastern Cape, with a population of 800,000. Ciskei has suffered increasing repression since Brig Gqozo took power in a March 1990 coup. Undoubtedly, the ANC has been hampered in its attempts to organise politically in Ciskei, so it is hardly surprising that the organisation should target Brig Gqozo for protest. But as the Johannesburg daily Business Day pointed out yesterday: 'Gqozo's sin . . . is not that he heads an unrepresentative homeland regime spawned by apartheid, but that he does not agree with the ANC.' The problem for the ANC is that the two other most powerful homeland leaders  -Lucas Mangope of Bophuthatswana and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of KwaZulu  -also disagree with the ANC. Official ANC strategy is to seek their overthrow by force. Neither is a negligible foe. President Mangope's government has been accused of widespread corruption and repression against members of the ANC. But as host to the second largest platinum mine in the world and with the strongest economy among the homelands, any move to overthrow him would be resisted by business and government leaders in South Africa. The risks of taking on Chief Buthelezi are even greater. The KwaZulu homeland which he heads is 5m strong, with the most powerful security forces of any homeland government. Furthermore, Pretoria is counting on Chief Buthelezi as a crucial ally in the first multi-racial elections (officials of the ruling National party believe he could deliver 1m votes to a moderate alliance). The government cannot afford to do without him. So the risk is great that the ANC's plan to overthrow the governments of Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and KwaZulu could lead to violence. ANC leaders knows this, and are using it to pressure Pretoria for a solution which would bring the homelands back into a multi-racial South Africa and destroy them as ethnically-based centres of power. The outline of such a solution was agreed four months ago at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). There, the 10 homeland governments (except Bophuthatswana, which reserved its position) agreed to separate referenda on the issue of reincorporation into South Africa. Church leaders spent much of yesterday trying to persuade Brig Gqozo to agree to such a referendum for Ciskei but he later rejected their proposal. Still, Pretoria could regain strategic ground lost to the ANC by persuading homeland leaders to agree to such a test of popular will. By so doing, the government would risk losing some important allies for its planned electoral coalition of whites, coloureds, Indians and moderate homeland blacks. But after Monday's events, Pretoria will find it increasingly difficult to resist calls to determine the homelands' future democratically, through referendums. But if negotiations cannot resume without an act of statesmanship of this sort from Mr FW de Klerk, the same demand must be made of Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader. For whatever the successes of the ANC's recent campaign of mass action against the government, it remains very unlikely that Pretoria can be overthrown by the ANC. The ANC can raise the temperature of negotiations, but not to a level which would force substantial concessions on the central issue of distributing power in the post-apartheid South Africa. Both men will be called upon to rise above the fray and act as statesmen rather than political streetfighters. The risk is that if they fail to do so soon there will be nothing of value left to inherit.</p>

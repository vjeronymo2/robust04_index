			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Havel plea for west to be generous: Former Communist states need help to return to European fold, says president CZECHOSLOVAKIA'S president, Mr Vaclav Havel, yesterday called on richer countries for 'generous help' to enable the former Communist states of eastern Europe to rejoin the path of western 'civilisation, culture and values'. Speaking in Aachen, where he received the city's annual Charlemagne prize for international relations, he said Europe was nearer than ever to realising 'the age-old hope of becoming an area of friendship and co-operation for all its inhabitants.' Now, despite the tearing down of the Iron Curtain, Europe needed to find 'the courage for speedy, unconventional and sometimes risky steps' to overcome remaining divisions. Backing the idea of a European Confederation first suggested by President Francois Mitterrand, Mr Havel said European integration had to take place through an overlapping network of institutional links across the continent. He said western aid for the post-Communist countries, comparable with that provided for western Europe under the post-war Marshall Plan, was necessary, and was also in the 'existential interest' of the west itself. The one-time dissident playwright reminded his audience in the historic coronation chamber of the Aachen city hall of the basic reasons why the former Communist states were seeking rapprochement with the west. 'This is not because, as countries which today stand poor and destroyed, they believe that their rich and prospering western friends can solve all their problems for them.' Rather, he said, countries such as Czechoslovakia identified with and were seeking a return to 'a certain civilisation, a certain political culture' which they themselves in previous centuries had helped to form. 'This is not a question of (eastern Europe) being fascinated by another world. It is just the opposite. After decades of unnaturally following the wrong track, we are yearning to rejoin the road which was once ours too.' Mr Havel said that the goal of European integration could not be fulfilled without maintaining the 'Atlantic dimension' of association with the US and Canada. Additionally, 'no future European order is conceivable without the European peoples of the Soviet Union, who are an indivisible component of Europe, and without the great community of peoples, into which the present-day Soviet Union is being transformed.'</p>

			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Democracy in Haiti - will the rich buy it?: As Haiti's President Aristide returns from exile, James Harding considers the ruling elite's role Water. One word can stand for all the difficulties and dangers which beset Jean Bertrand Aristide, the president of Haiti, on his return from exile today, under the protection of American guns. The first thing that strikes a visitor to the slums of Port au Prince is the ceaseless procession of people with 10-gallon buckets on their heads, to and from the well. The second thing that a privileged visitor might notice is the elegance of the villas on the surrounding hills. The rich people who prospered under a succession of dictators, made their homes up there; and they are unhappy. Water is abundant among the shady patios, the bougainvillaea, and the landscaped gardens. But the swimming pools are green with algae. During the turmoil, electricity supplies have been so unreliable that it has been impossible to keep the pools properly filtered. Thousands of poor Haitians, who lack the simplest necessities, are expected to throng the streets today, to welcome back their champion, the first president ever to be elected by popular vote. But if Aristide wants to keep the crowds cheering, and to show that democratic freedom can also bring them running water, he may be forced to look first to the needs of the bathing classes. The most prominent of these are are six mainly mulatto families, who dominate the Haitian economy and have subtly exerted power over even the most vicious of recent rulers. Some, at least, appear to have been deeply implicated in the ousting of Aristide in favour of the most recent military dictator. Through the years of 'murderous kleptocracy' in Haiti, as Duvalier rule from 1957 to 1986 has been called, and the short-lived dictators who have followed (apart from seven months of democratic rule in 1991), the families which own the commercial monopolies have all but run the Haitian economy and acted as the puppeteers for the country's leaders. The US government has won at least a superficial blow for democracy by paying its dues to Haiti's economic elite. Aristide, who was elected as a radical reformer, will have to overcome a hostile legacy and do the same if anything like a free country with a stabilising middle class is to be developed. In the 1980s, the US circulated papers linking five of the leading families to the dictators and their murderous paramilitaries. Now the US government has come to terms with the oligarchs. It knows that if you want democracy in Haiti, you have to do business with the families which own it. When former President Jimmy Carter came to Port-au-Prince to negotiate the US and Haiti out of war and into a co-operative restoration of Aristide, he made a point of feting the local barons with grand dinners and intimate talks. General Henry Hugh Shelton, US Commander of the Joint Task Force in Haiti, has gone one stage further and entered into leasing agreements on their properties. Despite the US courtship, the grandees will not be on the streets cheering Aristide home. Although most paint themselves as champions of democracy few have fond memories of the liberation theologist's brief spell in the presidential palace. 'We didn't have democracy under Aristide,' says Olivier Nadal, secretary general of the Haitian Chamber of Commerce. 'He was constantly attacking the bourgeoisie . . . his mob was in the streets, he sent people on to my land, to take away my land. We could still work, but it was very scary.' Most business leaders hope, but are not convinced, that three years in Washington will have tempered the anti-bourgeois rhetoric of the populist preacher swept into power in 1990 by the mass coalition, Lavalas - the flood meant to wash away corruption and emancipate the Haitian poor. Nadal finds it hard to believe that Aristide has changed and refers to sermons such as the one in which he talks of ' . . . the class of landowners and the bourgeoisie who live off the corrupt system we have in Haiti, who do nothing, who give nothing back to the country, who steal what little wealth we have and put it into banks in foreign countries, their private property is . . . Haitian property, it does not belong to them.' The wealthy should be accustomed to the people's struggle. Haiti, the only country in the world to have witnessed a successful black slave revolt, has a strong history of popular uprisings and movements for street justice or dechoukaj. But such hostility is not what the business families had come to expect of Haiti's rulers. Quite the opposite, relations had historically been cosy. The half dozen clans are not the inheritors of French colonial wealth dating back two centuries. They multiplied their capital over the last 50 years thanks to a deft handling of governments which granted them monopolies in exchange for support and financial favours. The Behrmanns made their money on concessions to import cars and trucks. The Madsens control beer and much of the coffee. The Bigios are sole producers of iron, steel and construction materials. The Accras, the textile magnates, have benefited from government contracts for school and army uniforms. The most prominent business families, the Mevs and the Brandts, have diversified considerably since the days of Francois 'Papa Doc' Duvalier, but their empires are also built on exclusive rights to trade and produce. The Mevs family has invested in port terminals and energy facilities based on capital from their manufacturing and sugar production monopolies. The Brandts have diversified similarly on the back of their original detergents and edible oils origins. The proximity of businessmen and the military is barely disguised. When Gregory Mevs, president of the infrastructure interests of his family's multi-faceted business, fumbled to find his business card on introduction, he joked: 'I have so many generals and colonels walking through my office every day, I don't need business cards.' They mix socially and have a history of what one Haitian called 'financial friendship'. Some business families are thought to have supported Gen Raoul Cedras, the Haitian army chief who led the military government until last week. Originally, he was appointed by Aristide. Now the preacher-president will be hoping his latest offering to the army, General Jean-Claude Duperval, will be more loyal to the Haitian executive than the board of directors. The Brandts are understood to have funded an anti-Aristide lobby in Washington DC. The Mevs have been accused of compliance with the military regime which usurped power in a bloody coup in 1991 and, at worst, protecting some of its members to ensure the survival of their business. However, the Mevs insist they are ultimately pro-Aristide and seek 'political stability and good democratic institutions'. But then, in gatherings of the elite, polished rhetoric, like lobster and French wine, is abundant. The vogue is vocal enthusiasm for elected government and every family member paints his clan as champions of the democratic process. But, slowly. 'Democracy is the ultimate goal,' Gregory Mevs explained. 'It is a process to work at. No one gets there in under 24 hours . . . if you take the history of France, democracy is a new animal for them; it took them hundreds of years to get there.' If the international touch to the Haitian problem is alien to most Port-au-Prince residents, that is in keeping with the elite's image. The most distinctive quality common to nearly all the business families, beyond their uncommon ownership of German sports cars, country homes and functioning international telephone lines, is their colour. Most are non-black. They are mulatto, many with French, German, Syrian, Lebanese or Jamaican backgrounds. The anomaly has spawned a Haitian proverb: 'A poor mulatto is black, but a rich black man is a mulatto.' Distance from the poor is not only a question of colour. It is also one of altitude. In Port-au-Prince, the rich demonstrate the resilience of luxury in the hills of Petionville suburb. The middle classes are getting by halfway down in Delmas. And most of the people, with next to nothing, are in shanties on reclaimed land below sea level at Cite Soleil. From behind the white-washed perimeter walls, iced with barbed wire and bougainvillaea, it is easy to take a patrician view of democracy. As Aristide returns and the embargo is lifted, Petionville, should spring back to luxurious life, but Delmas is the area to watch. It has skilled and educated workers without jobs. The population of Delmas would staff the 'democratic institutions' Mevs is seeking. The people of Delmas would also appreciate the 'democratisation of capital' advocated by men such as Johnny Brandt, a member of the less prodigious wing of the Brandt empire. But for Delmas to witness real changes, the business families will have to overcome one further obstacle: their incessant bickering. The Brandts and the Mevs have been feuding since 1949. According to one Haitian socialite, the Mevs are still sore that the Brandts were able to build a detergent factory on land formerly owned by the Mevs, allegedly by manipulating President Magloire into appropriating the property from the sugar grandees. As US troops have spread throughout Haiti over the last four weeks, a sense of shame, a call for self-sacrifice and patriotic rhetoric have become common among the Haitian oligarchy. They strike a note of mea culpa and claim responsibility for endowing the bulk of the population with education, political rights and economic development. Brandt, his white shirt open and showing a gold chain tangled in chest-hair, is one of their number. Sipping on a rum coffee, he says: 'Some of us are going to have to play the Jean d'Arc here.' President Aristide, often referred to as Haiti's foremost biblical scholar, will appreciate the saintly tone of self-sacrifice. Nevertheless, he may need to get the swimming pools clean before he finds the Haitian oligarchs ready to help him put his house in order.</p>

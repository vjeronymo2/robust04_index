			<p>BFN     [Text] President Farooq Ahmad Khan Leghari has said that  Pakistan's relations with the United States are not confined to  one direction, but covered a large area and must be viewed in  their full complexity. Talking to APP [Associated Press of  Pakistan] in London before his departure for the United States,  he denied that relations between Pakistan and America have  suffered any setback. He said some people viewed relations only  in the context of nuclear nonproliferation. Pakistan, in this  context, has made it clear that it supported the principle of  ban on nuclear proliferation in the entire world, including the  South Asian region. To say that only Pakistan should do it and  India should not do it, is not acceptable to Pakistan.    Referring to his visit to the United States, he said he  would  hold talks at various levels covering foreign affairs, economy,  and national security. He said he would also hold talks with  officials of the IMF, exchange views with Congress House and  Senate Committees, and a think tank on foreign affairs, besides  meeting media organizations.    The president was seen off at the Heathrow Airport by a  representative of the queen; the acting Pakistan high  commissioner, Mr. Moeen Jan Nayim; officials at the High  Commission; and members of Pakistan community.</p>

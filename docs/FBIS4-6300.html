			<p>BFN     [Text] Delivering a lecture at a Tokyo hotel on 18 April,  Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Dunxin referred to China's role  concerning the issue of North Korea's suspected development of  nuclear weapons. He stressed: "The issue should be settled  between the parties concerned. The international community  should not expect too much from China." In this way he  indicated that there is certain limitation to China's role.    The ambassador made it clear that China's basic position  that  the Korean peninsula should be denuclearized and nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  should be carried out remains unchanged. But he added: "The  issue should be settled through patient dialogue, and we do not  agree to the idea of applying pressure, such as economic  sanctions," thus holding a move toward imposing economic  sanctions against North Korea in check.</p>

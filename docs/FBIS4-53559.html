			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 20 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu  Hata's Cabinet on Friday [20 May] gave the official go-ahead to  the premier's proposed freeze of public service charges until  the end of the year.    The cabinet endorsed Hata's call for halting all planned  hikes on domestic phone charges, public housing rents, taxi  fares, expressway tolls and fire insurance premiums.    The government also requested local governments to follow  suit, asking them not to raise charges on their services such as  public- sector buses and subways, and water supply.    It is the first freeze of public charges since 1974, and the  first such sweeping one since 1964.    Hata's "political decision" came on Wednesday in response to  a torrent of criticism from the public and business circles that  governmental organizations are too willing to raise charges  while the private sector is forced to make cuts to cope with the  worst recession in the postwar period.    The step, generally welcomed by businesses and consumers,  was  described by political analysts as an attempt to win public  support for his precariously positioned minority government.    Hata's announcement also came as "a bolt out of the blue"  for  most bureaucrats who supervise public-sector organizations'  charges.    Some top government officials made clear they are irked by  the decision, which was taken without consulting them.    One such official said, "ministries are all opposed to the  measure. That's why it was a political decision. But they will  follow their bosses' decision."    Cabinet members lauded the move and insisted that the margin  of increases will not be raised when the freeze ends.    "The significance of the step lies in its being a sweeping  one. It is our political decision," said Economic Planning  Agency Director General Yoshio Terasawa.    "We need to boost consumer confidence to lift the economy,"  he told a press conference.    Transport Minister Nobuaki Futami said at a separate press  conference that his ministry will not allow larger hikes in  expressway tolls or taxi fares because of the freeze than those  already applied for.    Futami also said he will take account of the economic  conditions in considering the timing of lifting the cap on  charges, suggesting a possibility of extending the freeze beyond  the end of the year.    Construction Minister Koji Morimoto, however, said he  regards  the measure as applying only for this year.    "I am not thinking about (a freeze) of one or two years  beyond the year-end," he said.    Some cabinet members called for a review of the way  expressway tolls are determined.    During unofficial talks after the cabinet meeting, Futami  said the basic problems concerning the method of calculating  highway tolls should be reconsidered by the year-end.    He reportedly argued that the principal problem is that the  depreciation costs for the land are reflected in the tolls.    Morimoto admitted at the press conference the need for  reviewing the calculation method, while emphasizing the  importance of maintaining the construction plans for expressways.    Highways are built by public corporations with borrowed  money  which they pay back with the revenue from tolls.</p>

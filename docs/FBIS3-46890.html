The joint team will go to Sakhalin for three days from  Monday  in line with an agreement reached in November between South  Korean President Kim Yong-sam and Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa in Kyongju, South Korea.    During the talks, Kim asked Japan to help in arranging the  temporary or permanent return of Koreans who were forcibly taken  by the Japanese authorities to Sakhalin before and during World  War II and were left behind when Japan evacuated the island as  Soviet troops advanced.    An estimated 150,000 Koreans were forcibly moved to  Sakhalin,  the southern half of which was ruled by Japan from 1905 until  the end of the war. More than 40,000 still live on the island.    The Japanese team will be made up of officials from the  Foreign Ministry and the Japanese Red Cross Society, the  ministry said.    The members of the joint survey team will hold talks with  officials of the Sakhalin government and concerned organizations  to determine the number of South Koreans wishing to return to  South Korea, it said.</p>

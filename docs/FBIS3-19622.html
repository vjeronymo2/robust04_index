			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greek National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis  stressed that the defense cooperation between Greece and Cyprus  has a clearly defensive, preventive character. In a news  conference at the conclusion of his visit, Arsenis said that  Hellenism's defense area from Thrace to the Aegean and over to  Cyprus is unified and any defense plans that are separate are  destined to fail. He added that a unified plan of this area  increases the effectiveness of defense capabilities.    The Greek national defense minister said that for Cyprus,  specific decisions were made for cooperation covering all fields  -- land, sea and air. In Cyprus, he added, there is an illegal  occupation and presence of 35,000 Turkish troops, and within the  framework of the defense cooperation a balance should be  reestablished, since the occupation troops are not withdrawing,  in order to safeguard the defense of the Republic of Cyprus. In  this framework, he said, it has been agreed that the Cypriot  National Guard needs substantial quantitative and qualitative  upgrading in order to promote its capabilities. This relates to  specific arms programs and the qualitative upgrade of personnel,  he said. Arsenis stressed that what is important is that a  program for work and a timeframe have been set, so that future  meetings will deal with which specific measures have been  implemented and not what is the meaning of the unified defense  area.    Replying to questions, Arsenis said that when there is an  imbalance of forces, there can be no successful diplomatic  negotiation. The deterioration of Hellenism's positions,  Arsenis said, is largely the result of the military imbalance.    Cypriot Defense Minister Konstandinos Iliadhis said in the  news conference that the direction started a few months ago is  evident, and he expressed the hope that what has been jointly  decided will be implemented even faster in the future.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / New tune for Irish reel: Political change has trailed social shifts Ireland's Fianna Fail, so long seen as the natural party of government, appears to be losing its grip on power. A political scandal involving the party has triggered the break-up of the government that it led, and efforts to rebuild the coalition with the Labour party have foundered. Last night, Fine Gael, the opposition party, was locked in discussions with Labour over a new administration. But in the absence of a strong alternative to Fianna Fail, the chance of stable government in Dublin looks remote. The political crisis in Ireland has been aggravated by the painful adjustment of a conservative, rural country to the new reality of an urbanised existence, underpinned by the sudden advent of prosperity from membership of the European Union. While Irish society has been transformed, the political system has been agonisingly slow to change. The two main political parties, Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, are almost equally conservative - their only serious distinguishing factor is that they were on opposite sides during the Irish civil war. Fianna Fail tends to be more rural and republican in its support and instincts, while the traditional Fine Gael 'blue shirts' are the small tradesmen and middle classes of the little market towns of the Irish countryside. The Labour party, condemned for years to a minority role on the opposition benches, was the only representative of secular European left-right politics. Today Dublin and its suburbs contain more than a third of the country's 3.5m population, after rapid urbanisation that has also caused an upheaval in the traditional political divide. It is an upheaval that could see Fianna Fail and Fine Gael forced into a conservative coalition, a prospect that causes horror to party traditionalists. Above all, it amounts to a seismic shock for Fianna Fail, which has regarded itself as the natural party of government since it was founded by Eamonn de Valera in the 1920s. The party is unashamedly populist, with an extensive grass-roots organisation. During its decades in power, it has used political patronage to reward supporters with civil service appointments. The most recent crisis was triggered when Mr Albert Reynolds, the Taoiseach or prime minister, overruled the objections of his Labour coalition partners to appoint Mr Harry Whelehan, the attorney general, as the Irish High Court president. Labour withdrew from the government and Mr Reynolds resigned as leader of Fianna Fail. But efforts by Mr Bertie Ahern, his successor, to re-establish the coalition foundered this week when new revelations emerged about the extent to which parliament had been misled over the appointment. The political turmoil that has resulted has launched an impassioned debate about official impropriety, and croneyism in public appointments. 'They've always controlled all the jobs,' says one Labour member of parliament, who compares Ireland to the corruption of Latin America. The cause of Mr Whelehan's downfall - his failure to act on a UK extradition warrant for a paedophile Catholic priest - has also raised questions about the role of the church which still exerts an influence over moral and social questions such as education, divorce and abortion. With new charges against the clergy revealed by newspapers almost every day, the church's failure to deal with errant priests has shocked public opinion in the Republic. An alternative coalition may be hard to construct. Fine Gael, the main opposition party, could form a government if it were able to persuade the Labour party and one or both of the minor parties to join it. But while Labour has entered coalitions with Fine Gael before, the latter has adopted a much more free market approach to economic policy that may prove hard for Labour to endorse. There is also bad feeling between the leaders of the two parties: relations between Mr John Bruton of Fine Gael and Labour's Mr Dick Spring were soured when Labour entered government with Fianna Fail following the 1992 election. Last night, a three-party coalition seemed the most likely arrangement, linking Fine Gael and Labour and one of the two smaller parties, Democratic Left and Progressive Democrats. The smaller parties are resisting pressure to enter a four-party coalition, that would reduce their ability to demand concessions. Democratic Left is understood to be the favoured choice of Labour. This left-leaning party is the successor to the Official IRA, from which Provisional IRA split to pursue the armed struggle in 1970. The party would have natural affinities with Labour on welfare questions, and would be more in tune on labour issues. The alternative is the right-wing Progressive Democrats, now led by Ms Mary Harney. A breakaway from Fianna Fail, the PDs would prove more difficult partners for Labour because they are more right-wing than Fine Gael. If a new coalition cannot be formed, the only alternative is a general election, which Labour in particular is concerned to avoid. The party's strategists believe the party would be hard-pressed to repeat its 1992 success, when the party won 32 seats. An election would also bring a protracted period of political uncertainty to the peace process in Northern Ireland. As UK officials began exploratory talks in Belfast yesterday with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, the absence of a stable government in Dublin could hold up progress. Even if there is an election, there is no guarantee that this will resolve the impasse. The opinion polls suggest that no party is likely to emerge with an overall parliamentary majority. Ireland would be facing exactly the same difficulties over the formation of a coalition in a month's time. Whatever the outcome of the current negotiations, Ireland is moving slowly and painfully towards a more traditional left-right political divide. Strategic thinkers within the parties, like Mr Maurice Manning of Fine Gael, are beginning to think the previously unthinkable: that a conservative coalition may be inevitable. It would mean both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail abandoning their old civil war prejudices. It would also require Fianna Fail, above all, undergoing a thorough cleansing of its secretive, anti-democratic ways. But a transformation of southern Irish politics from sterile old republican rivalries is as much a part of the peace process as negotiations between unionists and republicans in the north.</p>

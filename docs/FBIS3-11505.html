			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 22 Mar (EFE) -- Brazilian Foreign Minister  Celso Amorim stated today that his country endorses a consensus  candidate for the election of the OAS secretary general to be  held in Washington on 27 March.    Amorim said that neither formal nor informal consultations  were made on the OAS vote during the two-day meeting of the 13  Rio Group foreign ministers that ended today.    Brazil has promised to vote for Colombian President Cesar  Gaviria, contending that he would bring prestige to the OAS  because of his successful record as president of his country for  the four-year term that will end on 7 August.    The foreign ministers and other government officials who  represented their countries at the Brasilia meeting, which  focused on the search for formulas to eradicate poverty and  unemployment and on reconciling positions for the continental  summit scheduled for December in Miami, sounded their  preferences for the 27 March vote.    Ambassadors from the 35 OAS member countries will elect the  candidate to replace former Brazilian Deputy Foreign Minister  Joao Baena Soares, who has served as OAS secretary general for  two consecutive five-year terms since 1984.    In addition to Gaviria, the other two candidates are Costa  Rican Foreign Minister Bernd Niehaus and Venezuelan Foreign  Minister Miguel Angel Burelli.    Five positions have been identified within the Rio Group,  the  main forum for joint political and economic actions in Latin  America. They are the positions of the three groups supporting  each of the three candidates, the one advocating a formula for a  consensus candidate, and Ecuador's undecided position.    Seven Rio Group member countries -- Mexico, Argentina,  Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Colombia, and Peru -- support  Gaviria; Chile, Guatemala, and Trinidad-Tobago support Niehaus;  and Venezuela supports its foreign minister, Burelli.    Uruguayan Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu today reaffirmed to  EFE his 21 March proposal of seeking a consensus candidate, who  could be any of the three candidates or someone else.    The initiative to seek a consensus candidate, Abreu said,  "may appear to be vague, but it is a responsible one" in light  of the atmosphere of confrontation between the candidacies of  Gaviria and Niehaus. Abreu did not give further details of his  proposal.    Abreu added: "An OAS election cannot be held in an  atmosphere  of confrontation. If we let matters take their course, we would  be starting a new term of the secretary general with divisions  already among its members."</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / Regalian accounts qualified as property market flounders THE ACCOUNTS of Regalian Properties, one of the best known UK quoted property companies, have been qualified by auditors Ernst &amp; Young because of the uncertainty future of the property market. The auditors acted because of 'the very considerable uncertainty that continues to affect the property markets and the difficulty of placing valuations on potential development sites,' together with the uncertain timing of property sales and the risk of a breach of bank covenants. Regalian's fate is likely to be shared by many other property developers this year, in the view of Mr Eugene Bannon, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young. 'It will not be unusual to find qualification on uncertainty of value,' he warned. 'We are required to get supporting evidence (for valuations). In a stagnant or bombed-out market it is very difficult to get that evidence,' he said. Mr David Goldstone, chairman of Regalian, said he believed that auditors' caution concerning property accounts had been heightened by the recent difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, Speyhawk, Mountleigh and Heron. The problems in valuing property were highlighted last week when Heron's portfolio was valued at Pounds 1bn, Pounds 300m less than a valuation a month earlier. Regalian, which announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26.8m for the year to March 31 and passed its final dividend, made provisions of Pounds 32.9m against its portfolio. Its share price fell yesterday from 22p to 15p. A block of luxury flats in Kensington Palace Gardens and a development site at Paddington are the chief sources of uncertainty in Regalian's figures. Although Kensington Palace Gardens is now valued at about half the asking price of Pounds 120m a year ago, it is a difficult building to value. The auditors queried the timing of Regalian's planned development on its Paddington site, which is still valued at Pounds 23m. A provision of Pounds 5m was taken against a Pounds 10m development site at Heron Quay in London's Docklands, which has been mothballed because of the insolvency of Olympia &amp; York, its venture partner. A three-month review of Regalian's banking facilities ended last night when the company's six banks, led by Barclays, agreed a Pounds 110m facility until February 1994, with new covenants that included a target for residential sales. Mr Goldstone's son Lee, who has worked at Regalian for 12 years, has left the company because of the constraints on new development over the next four years. By its year end, Regalian's net asset per share had fallen from 146.8p to 104.8p. It had gross debt of Pounds 130.1m and net assets of Pounds 122.7m. The loss per share was 19.74p, compared with last year's earnings of 8.02p. Lex Page 22 London stocks Page 46</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.F. Yeremin, I.I. Kucherov, S.A. Popov, N.S. </F> Pyzhova, P.G. Rytik, Belarussian Scientific Research Institute  of Epidemiology and Microbiology; UDC 616.981:612.017.1]    [Abstract] WHO's HIV diagnostic recommendations whereby the  incidence of infection is established using two-stage screening  for detecting antibodies to the virus in the blood serum based  on the outcome of an ELISA (enzyme immuno assay) test are  discussed and it is noted that HIV have been detected in  cultivated lymphocytes isolated from seronegative patients. This  factor calls for direct detection of the virus components in the  lymphocyte cultures of the patients. The findings of such  attempts are presented. The blood of married couple S was  examined for three years whereby enzyme immuno assay study to  determine HIV antibodies was carried out using Antigen, Vektor,  and Epitop commercial test systems. The study confirms the need  for an extremely cautious approach to the false-positive results  of serological tests, especially in the cases where antibodies  to the p24 and p55 HIV-1 proteins are determined in the  immunoblot assay since they indicate fresh infection. Moreover,  the case of patient Sf from whose blood antibodies to HIV-1  proteins disappeared with time confirms known data on the  possibility of silent HIV infection when only the polymerase  chain reaction and/or virus isolation are capable of correctly  to diagnosing HIV infection. Thus, an uncertain outcome of  serological analysis calls for a comprehensive virological and  molecular biological study so as to avoid misidentifying  infected persons with false-negative serological test results.

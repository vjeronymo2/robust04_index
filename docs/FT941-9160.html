			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Still a threat of action on power competition Sir, It is refreshing to see your robust acknowledgement that privatising electricity as a duopoly has proved a costly error ('Littlechild's power gamble', February 14). As the energy select committee warned at the time, the resulting uncompetitive market has stimulated an excessive and premature 'dash for gas', marginalised coal production and raised electricity prices for large users. However, you come down too hard on the efforts of Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, to correct structural flaws. He was handed a framework for which politicians were responsible, not he. Nor was he given statutory powers to restructure the generators. Consequently, his success in obtaining undertakings that 6,000MW of capacity will be divested, is a significant arm-twisting achievement. As you suggest, it may not be enough to develop genuine competition at the margin where it matters. But Professor Littlechild has insisted on progress reports at six monthly intervals on the disposal of plant and, significantly, he intends to review the situation towards the end of the two-year transition period. The implied threat that, if real competition has not developed by then, further action can be expected, should not therefore be underestimated.

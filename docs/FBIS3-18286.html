			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tension is rising in the ongoing EU [European Union]  membership talks in Brussels as only a few hours remain until  the deadline of the talks, i.e., 2400. Foreign Trade Minister  Pertti Salolainen and Foreign Minister Heikki Haavisto,  Finland's negotiators, are to sit at the negotiation table with  ministers from the European Union. The Finns will officially  receive the EU's new offer on agricultural subsidies and  regional policies. The ministers did not wish to make much  comment on the offer before the negotiations. According to  them, it is a starting paper for negotiations.    Early this evening, the EU ministers completed a new offer  to  Finland. In that offer, agricultural subsidies and regional  subsidies were gathered together in a package. According to the  new offer, the EU permits a widening of subsidies to unfavorable  farming areas in such a way that the subsidies will cover 85  percent of Finland's arable area. Regional structural subsidies  are offered particularly to those regions that remain outside  farming subsidies. In the EU's view, its offer of farming  subsidies and regional policies creates the basis for a soft  adaptation of Finnish farming to the Union's farming.    The EU offer mentions that in serious situations of  difficulty, direct national subsidies may be considered. A  subsidy for a northern region may be offered in the same way as  the previous subsidy north of the 62d parallel. The EU does,  however, permit some small additional regions nearby to be  included within this subsidy. The northern subsidy would be a  part of the national subsidies. The EU still requires a direct  transition to the EU's producer prices.    The Finnish Government met this afternoon to study the  situation in the EU negotiations. The government will convene  anew at 1000, i.e., a few hours before the deadline set for the  negotiations. According to reports from Brussels, the European  Union has come somewhat closer to Finland. More information is  expected in the course of this evening of the European Union's  latest offers.</p>

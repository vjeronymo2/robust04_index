			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Lang seeks to head off dispute over devolution - Scottish Conservatives' Conference MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, yesterday sought to quash speculation that the party leadership in Scotland was softening its opposition to devolution. In a speech to the party's annual conference in Perth, however, he concentrated his fire on the assembly with tax-raising powers proposed by the other Scottish parties in the Constitutional Convention. He acknowledged that the government would listen, if sceptically, to suggestions for a deliberative assembly as part of its plans to restructure local government in Scotland. Mr Lang's speech, marking the start of the three-day conference, was designed to head off a damaging row in the party over devolution in the run up to the general election. Recent comments by party officials suggesting a more responsive approach to the issue have provoked a fierce response from the Thatcherite wing of the party. In yesterday's conference debate, a number of speakers suggested that the planned move to single-tier local authorities in Scotland would leave a gap that could be filled by some form of national representation in Edinburgh. Mr Michael Hirst, the president of the Scottish associations, made a coded appeal for a wider debate by opening the conference with the comment that: 'It is through examining, debating and justifying our policy positions that we can be sure that our policies are right for Scotland.' Mr Lang, however, insisted that the review of local government structure would not become 'the Trojan horse of a tax-raising Scottish assembly'. Devolved powers for Scotland, he added, could only be accepted in the context of a similar trend across the whole of the UK. The divisive potential of the issue was underlined by repeated statements by Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative party chairman, denying recent press speculation that he is in favour of a move towards Scottish devolution. Mr Patten denied that he had even 'thought, let alone said anything', on the subject. The conference opened with the latest opinion polls showing the Conservatives holding some 24 per cent of the vote. That remains well above the level last year when Mrs Margaret Thatcher's unpopularity pushed it down to about 17 per cent, but it has dropped back from the 26 per cent the Tories achieved in the wake of Mr John Major's succession to Downing Street.</p>

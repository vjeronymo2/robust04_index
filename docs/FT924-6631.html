			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Manchester hunt for runway site MANCHESTER Airport has widened the search for a site for a second runway after protests from residents' groups about the environmental impact of nearly doubling the airport's size by the end of the century. Instead of sticking to the idea of two parallel runways, the airport's board yesterday approved fresh studies on an east-west take-off runway, starting at the southern end of the present runway, which is aligned to the north-east.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / People: Chairman of S G Warburg to join BBC board British Telecom, the Bank of England and now the British Broadcasting Corporation. Sir David Scholey, chairman of S G Warburg, is joining the board of yet another pillar of the establishment. Sir David is one of two new part-time governors of the BBC. Along with Janet Cohen, a novelist and director of Charterhouse Bank, he joins the BBC on March 1 for a five-year term. The two merchant bankers fill the gaps left by Baroness James of Holland Park, the well known crime novelist, and Keith Oates, a managing director of Marks and Spencer who stepped down last July. The new appointments complete the complement of BBC governors.</p>

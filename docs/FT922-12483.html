			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / UK Company News: Friendly Hotels falls to Pounds 3.89m THE GULF war and the continuing recession left Friendly Hotels with pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.89m for the 12 months to December 29, down 35 per cent on the comparable Pounds 6.01m. Turnover fell from Pounds 31.2m to Pounds 28.7m. The company said it was the first time that profits had not grown since the present board took over in 1986. Adverse effects of the recession could not be overcome and the company said that it was therefore gratifying that reasonable profitability was maintained in the second half with a pre-tax figure of Pounds 2.54m (Pounds 3.48m). Earnings per share were 16.3p (34.9p) basic or 15.5p (25.3p) fully diluted. An increased final dividend of 3.3p is proposed for a total of 5.5p (5p). An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.95m (Pounds 264,000) relating to the decision to dispose of the fast service restaurants and the nursing and care homes, left a loss for the year of Pounds 701,000 (Pounds 3.08m profit).</p>

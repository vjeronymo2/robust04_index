			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Nagayo Taniguchi] </F>   [Text] Brussels, 6 May -- According to an European  diplomatic source, Japan and the European Union (EU) appear to  have basically reached a compromise on the Japan-Europe  semiconductor accord during an unofficial meeting held before  summit talks by Japanese and EU leaders. They will not set a  quota for semiconductor imports to Japan as Japan and the United  States did. A Japanese representative said that Japan took the  stance of accepting, as much as possible, the EU's wish to join  the Japan-U.S. framework on research, development, and designing  new-generation semiconductor products.</p>

			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Mixed start to pollution permit sale THE US Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday it had taken in Dollars 21.4m (Pounds 15m) from the landmark auction of air pollution allowances, its market-based scheme to reduce acid rain. However, most of the allowances offered by private companies failed to fetch their minimum prices and were not sold. Allowances allocated to the auction by the EPA had no minimum bid, and all found buyers. It received 171 bids. The pollution emission permits are granted to 110 of the largest sulphur dioxide (SO) polluters, all of them coal-burning electricity utilities, in the first phases of the EPA's clean-air programme. Companies may trade allowances that are surplus to their own needs. Bids came from power companies, coal producers, environmentalists and smokestack industries for the rights to emit 275,510 tons of SO into the air after 1995. In the end only 150,010 tons of emission permits were sold. The average price per tonne of SO emissions was Dollars 439 for permits up to 1999, the first phase of the two-phase programme, with the lowest successful bid Dollars 122 and the highest Dollars 450. Brokers bidding for industry took about 5 per cent of the total. A few public interest groups, including environmentalists, made token purchases of the allowance. Utilities, predictably, were the biggest buyers, with Carolina Power and Light the largest. The auction, finalised on Monday, was conducted by the Chicago Board of Trade. The fact that virtually no allowances offered by utilities were sold bodes poorly for the CBOT's plans to sponsor a series of similar auctions starting in June, as a precursor to its planned SO futures and options markets. All of its allowances will be privately offered and presumably will have minimum prices. The prices reached at auction were substantially below the cost of installing air-cleaning scrubbers or switching to low-sulphur fuel, and were also below rates established in private transactions for the allowances. Mr Richard Sandor, an architect of the CBOT's planned emissions futures market, said price competition from the allowance programme had already forced the costs of clean air compliance lower. The EPA said its economic models demonstrated that the allowance programme had cut the cost of emissions compliance in half for electricity utility rate payers. Mr Andrew Weissman, of Clean Air Capital Markets, a Washington-based investment banking firm, believes the auction format is inappropriate for pricing the allowances, and fears the low prices will deliver the wrong message to the market. He said the sale's timing hurt prices. 'The nature of compliance planning is you need a long lead time. The auction came too late for phase one compliance plans, and was a little too early for companies planning for the second phase of emission standards.' Illinois Power, a mid-west electricity utility, recently elected to buy SO allowances from other utilities and delay installing scrubbing technology. It is hoping the delay will allow it to purchase more advanced technology when scrubbers are finally installed in its smokestacks in 1999.</p>

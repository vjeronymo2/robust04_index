			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, March 15 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU]  will not renew its minimum prices on imports of seven fish  species in the immediate future, a spokesman for the European  Commission announced on Tuesday [15 March].    The prices had been decided on last February 4 and expire  March 15. They are aimed at protecting EU fishermen against  excessively cheap imports. Minimum import prices had been set  for fish last year as well, from February to December.    The spokesman said there were no data showing that the  market  is destabilized at present by cheap fish imports. But if it is,  the Commission "is prepared to re-establish the minimum prices".    Last week, France asked the Commission to extend the minimum  prices. French fishermen have staged demonstrations, sometimes  violent, to protest against low-cost imports from non-EU  countries that drive down prices of French fish.    The Commission spokesman said that the general situation on  the market for fish products and its "structural weaknesses,"  especially in France, will be studied on the basis of a report  at a fishing ministers' meeting in Luxembourg on April 12.</p>

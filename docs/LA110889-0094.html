			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAGLETON QUITS MERC, SAYS IT FAVORS INSIDERS  </P> <P> Former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton resigned from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's  board Tuesday with a vitriolic letter that denounced the Merc's self-regulatory  program and what he said were official efforts to protect a former Merc  chairman from punishment.  </P> <P> Eagleton attacked top Merc officials' efforts on behalf of prominent trader  Brian Monieson, 53, who is accused of failing to stop traders at a firm he  heads after he was warned that they were cheating customers. When the Commodity  Futures Trading Commission scheduled a hearing on its plan to ban Monieson from  trading, several senior Merc and futures industry officials asked to testify as  character witnesses.  </P> <P> Eagleton said that, from this year's futures trading scandal to the recent  Monieson case, "I have grown increasingly dissatisfied with the way the Chicago  Mercantile Exchange handles decisions relating to the public interest." Whether  a decision relates to trading procedures "or penalties for thievery . . . or,  most recently, the Brian Monieson matter, the Merc decision is usually a  non-Lincolnian decision of insiders by insiders and for insiders," Eagleton  wrote.  </P> <P> The resignation of Eagleton, who was Democratic vice presidential nominee in  1972, is likely to further fuel the controversy over the handling of the  Monieson case. The outcry has also come at a time when many outsiders are  calling for more aggressive regulation of Chicago's booming futures markets.  </P> <P> Eagleton said the Merc's investigations department six times had fined or  warned Monieson's firm, GNP Commodities, and that Monieson himself was fined  $10,000 in 1986.  </P> <P> "In Mercdom, an attack on one insider is an attack on all insiders," Eagleton  wrote. "All of the Merc power has been brought into action to save Monieson's  neck." He said Merc founder Leo Melamed, U.S. Agriculture Secretary and former  Merc President Clayton K. Yeutter and Robert Wilmouth, chairman of the National  Futures Organization, "a supposedly 'regulatory' organization," had asked to  speak for Monieson at a CFTC hearing set for Monday. Also, Eagleton said, the  Merc's principal outside attorney, Jerrold Salzman, had gotten special  permission to represent Monieson.  </P> <P> "As I see it, the Merc has intruded into the legitimate enforcement affairs of  the CFTC . . . and against the public interest," Eagleton wrote.  </P> <P> Eagleton, a member of the huge futures exchange's board of governors for three  years, has increasingly opposed Merc officials over how to police the industry  and limit the stock market volatility that some believe is worsened by  stock-index futures trading.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview from his office in St. Louis, Eagleton said he had  made clear his views on the Monieson case at a stormy meeting of the Merc's  board of governors last Wednesday. He had asked that the Merc officials and  Salzman not take part in the hearing but had been rebuffed by all others on the  board.  </P> <P> Eagleton said that he did not have pronounced differences with industry  officials until this year but that "my temperature began to rise quickly after  January," when the FBI's undercover investigation of trading floor cheating was  disclosed. "I began to see more and more that was needed," Eagleton said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] Informed sources today [23 January] confirmed a  report in the U.S. NATIONAL DEFENSE NEWS WEEKLY concerning  Taiwan's arms procurement. According to the report, Taiwan,  bowing to the Legislative Yuan's demand for low-priced high  technology and expanded participation of domestic industrial  sectors, has decided to temporarily postpone the purchase of  M-60 tanks and other weapons from the United States.    Taiwan is no longer an enthusiastic patron who would  unconditionally buy all U.S.-made weapons on the list, and this  is the first time in several decades that Taiwan has postponed  the purchase of arms already approved by Washington for export,  reported the weekly.    The weekly's report says: At a secret meeting between the  two sides at the Pentagon 5 January, officials from Taiwan's  Defense Ministry disclosed that they must temporarily postpone  the purchase of M-60 tanks and about two squadrons of T-38  trainer aircraft. In addition, due to domestic pressure, the  Defense Ministry may temporarily postpone the purchase of at  least two major equipment systems already approved by Washington  for sale to Taiwan. Included in the purchase is an improved  antiaircraft system valued at about $1 billion. According to  the officials, Taiwan has postponed the purchase of arms because  of the increasingly tight defense budget and growing pressure  from the Legislative Yuan which is demanding that it examine  each and every major arms purchase project.</p>

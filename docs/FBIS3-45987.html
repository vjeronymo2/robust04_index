			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Interference From Beijing"] </F>   [Text] Communist China has not lessened its longstanding  efforts to isolate Taiwan and cut off the island's sources of  weaponry supplies because of the steady improvement in economic  and other civil relations between the two sides.    On Wednesday [12 January], mainland China and France  simultaneously announced a communique in which Paris agreed not  to authorize any new arms sale to Taiwan in the future. The  joint communique was reached following a recent round of  bilateral talks in Beijing.    Since late 1992, when France approved the sale of 60 Mirage  fighter planes to Taiwan, Beijing had persistently pressed Paris  to cancel the deal, using various retaliatory measures,  including suspensions of a subway and several other big-ticket  sales contracts awarded to French companies earlier.    Beijing apparently failed to win concession from Paris on  this point. French Foreign Minister Alain Jupe told a news  conference in Paris on the same day that the Mirage contract  with Taiwan will be honored and that spare parts will be  delivered.    The reason Paris acquiesced in Beijing's demand not to allow  future arms sales to Taiwan is obviously because France wanted  to do so to restore its relations with the mainland so as to win  back its lost businesses and to facilitate its development of  the mainland market.    But for all the commercial considerations, it is regrettable  that the French government has given its consent to the demand  of Beijing. The mainland has no valid reason to block Taiwan  from purchasing weapons from abroad.    This is especially true in light of the fact that mainland  China itself has continued to expand its air and navy forces in  recent years, posing a threat to the security of Taiwan and in  fact the whole region.    Taiwan wants to purchase weapons for only one purpose to  defend itself against a possible military invasion from the  mainland. Beijing has been on record that, if necessary it will  not hesitate to take Taiwan by force.    Beijing has never relaxed its efforts to prevent Western  nations from providing Taiwan with weapons. At the Settle  summit in November, Communist Chinese President Jiang Zemin  complained to President Bill Clinton of his predecessor's  decision to sell 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan and demanded U.S.  agreement not to allow new sales. In that same month, Beijing  raised a similar demand with Germany when Chancellor Helmut Kohl  visited the mainland.    Beijing's persistent intervention will make it more  difficult  for Taiwan to obtain the supply of high-performance weapons in  the future. To cope, Taiwan must strengthen its investment in  the development of military technology to reduce dependence on  foreign supply.    Also on Wednesday, Beijing announced establishment of  diplomatic relations with Lesotho, an African country which had  maintained formal links with Taiwan since 1990. Over the years,  Beijing has not only continued to prevent other nations from  recognizing Taipei, but also tried all possible means to win  recognition from nations which have diplomatic ties to this  government.    The reason Beijing consistently does so is to isolate Taiwan  from the international community and force the name of the  Republic of China to disappear from the whole world.    This Beijing interference has indeed caused difficulties for  Taiwan's foreign policy in the past but clearly it has not  succeeded in isolating this island. Taiwan still maintains  strong relations, in both official and unofficial forms, with  countries around the world.    There is no reason that this will not be the case in the  future, given Taiwan's continued efforts to develop democracy  and economy as well as the island's willingness to fulfill its  international obligations.</p>

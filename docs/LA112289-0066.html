			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IGNORING PLANNERS' ADVICE, S.D. COUNCIL APPROVES GOLF COURSE NEAR LAKE HODGES  </P> <P> Despite the opposition of environmentalists, Escondido leaders scored a  hole-in-one with golfers Tuesday by persuading the San Diego City Council to  reverse city planners and approve permits on a 40-acre parcel to complete an  18-hole golf course near Lake Hodges.  </P> <P> San Diego planning commissioners had voted 6 to 1 to deny the use of the former  agricultural land in the San Pasqual Valley for a public golf course, citing  the loss of habitat for the black-tailed gnatcatcher and the possibility of  pesticide contamination in Lake Hodges.  </P> <P> Escondido Councilwoman Carla DeDominicis, speaking for the four Escondido  council members present, pleaded the case of her city, pointing out that San  Diego is a partner in the golf course development, had sold an adjoining tract  to Escondido for the golf course and a housing development, and will share in  the net profits when the facility is built.  </P> <P> Delay could endanger negotiations with a golf course operator, DeDominicis  said, and might delay the start of play by a year.  </P> <P> DeDominicis offered to mitigate the loss of habitat for the gnatcatcher with  similar land about a mile away. She countered the contamination charge by  pointing out that agricultural operations on the land would cause more  pesticide runoff than a golf course would.  </P> <P> The unanimous vote of the San Diego council, with Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer  absent, was conditioned on the approval of the substitute habitat land by a San  Diego city biologist.  </P> <P> After Tuesday's hearing, DeDominicis said the construction of the municipal  course will continue on schedule and allow the facility to open in a year.  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer, whose district includes the northeastern San Diego area, opposed  the project earlier because it involved a 528-home subdivision in the San  Dieguito River Valley, where she is attempting to create a linear open space  park stretching 42 miles from Del Mar east to near Ramona.  </P> <P> In an agreement between the two cities worked out two years ago, Escondido  purchased 276 aces of San Diego-owned land on the boundary of the two cities  for $12.6 million, then immediately sold the land to a developer of a 580-unit  subdivision. About 120 acres was deeded back to Escondido by the developer for  the public golf course.  </P> <P> When it became apparent that the golf course layout would require more land,  the San Diego City Council agreed to lease Escondido the 40 acres for 62 years.  The land had formerly been part of the San Pasqual Winery vineyards.  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer had opposed the 62-year lease of the city land as "a violation of  law and policy" which was "done in the back room with the good old boys at  work."  </P> <P> Under terms of the original land sale and lease, residents of both cities will  pay lower greens fees on the new course than will outsiders, with senior  citizens getting a greater discount. Escondido will pay for construction of the  course but will share any profits from its operation equally with the city of  San Diego.  </P> <P> The golf course will lie east of Interstate 15 near the North County Fair  shopping center on the southern edge of Escondido.  </P></p>

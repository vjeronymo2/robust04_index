			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Securing satisfactory price to secure orders ROSYTH DOCKYARD would have to agree a satisfactory price to secure orders for refitting the surface ships intended to give it a continuing role after losing the the Trident submarine contract, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. The government had a majority of 72 (281-209) at the end of a three-hour emergency debate in which Labour warned that Rosyth's closure would have a devastating effect on the Scottish economy. Mr Rifkind emphasised that Rosyth would be allocated 18 'major' warships and 49 other vessels for refitting over the next 12 years. Mr Jonathan Aitken, minister for defence procurement, emphasised that the allocation of ships for refit at Rosyth meant than no other yard would be able to tender for the work. Mr Rifkind's insistence that the interests of the taxpayer had to be safeguarded brought angry protests from opposition MPs. They accused him of breaking a promise from a former Tory defence secretary that Rosyth would be given a 'guaranteed' programme of work refitting Tridents.</p>

			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PASADENA HOPES TO SEE THE LITE ON UTILITY BILLS  </P> <P> In an east Pasadena neighborhood of well-kept residences along Mountain Avenue,  a dozen people in polo shirts were on a house-to-house mission.  </P> <P> They knocked. Householders opened doors and let the crew of perfect strangers  invade their privacy, explore their bathrooms and even issue comments on their  cleaning habits.  </P> <P> At one house, the visitor showed a woman that, by simply removing the bottom of  her refrigerator, she could clean the dust from the cooling coils, improving  the energy-guzzler's efficiency -- and saving money on her the electric bill.  </P> <P> Down the street, another visitor replaced a shower head with one that uses half  the water, potentially saving nearly 50 gallons per shower. In a commode, she  installed a flexible metal-and-hard-plastic device called a toilet dam, said to  save half a gallon per flush.  </P> <P> At still another house, the guest installed a super-efficient, long-lasting  fluorescent light bulb in a coffee table lamp. The bulb, which sells for $10 to  $15, can more than pay for itself over its five- to 10-year lifetime.  </P> <P> But this one was free, courtesy of the city and its new "Lite Bill" energy  conservation program.  </P> <P> "This ties in nicely because I'm keen on recycling too," an amazed Megan  Elliott said last week after she received her free conservation kit from one of  the polo-shirted workers going door-to-door. "I didn't know about a lot of this  stuff."  </P> <P> City officials hope that other residents will be pleased with the smorgasbord  of approaches for cutting water and electric use in the city, and, in turn,  reduce consumers' bills and the city's own energy-related expenses.  </P> <P> Pasadena, which operates one of the four municipal utilities in the Los Angeles  Basin, has within the last six months embarked on an ambitious program that  city officials say goes beyond federal and state mandates on energy  conservation.  </P> <P> Last year, the city began a water survey and inspection program for residential  users who use large amounts of water. The program, open to all water customers,  provides conservation ideas.  </P> <P> In November, the Lite Bill program started. It will reach 37,000 residences  this year. The retail value of the free materials being handed out door-to-door  is about $60 per residence; the city's cost is $25.  </P> <P> At the same time, the city has adopted a rate system that encourages  conservation, especially during the summer months of peak demand: Rates are  increased for consumers who use large amounts of water.  </P> <P> The city has also adopted rules that require all new municipal landscaping to  use plants that flourish in the semi-desert of Southern California. City  officials say they want to set a good model for the rest of the community.  </P> <P> Eighteen months ago, the city created the Resource Planning and Conservation  Division of the city's Water and Power Department. "Conservation programs did  exist, but there weren't as many or as intense," said Mariann Long, the city's  conservation and consumer programs coordinator, who previously had worked in a  similar Santa Monica municipal project.  </P> <P> Still, some environmentalists say the city has taken too long to implement the  measures.  </P> <P> "I'm still not satisfied," said activist Tim Brick, a member of the city's  utility advisory panel and the city's representative on the board of the  Metropolitan Water District of Southern California.  </P> <P> Yet critics acknowledge that, when compared to the other three municipal  utilities in Los Angeles County, Pasadena spends a far greater portion of its  revenues to promote conservation.  </P> <P> An analysis of the latest spending of revenues by the region's four municipal  utilities shows that Pasadena spends $18 for every $1,000 of revenue to help  customers cut water and electric usage. Utility leaders in the field nationally  spend nearly twice as much as that.  </P> <P> In comparison, Los Angeles spends $6.80 per $1,000, and Glendale and Burbank  even less: Burbank, $2 per $1,000, and Glendale, $1 per $1,000.  </P> <P> In fact, Pasadena officials boast that no other city-operated utility in the  country goes to such great lengths on so many fronts.  </P> <P> "Most of the municipal utilities are looking at either water or electricity.  What we're saying is that there's a synergy between the two," said Deputy City  Manager Edward K. Aghjayan, who oversees the Water and Power Department.  </P> <P> "There is no reason why we can't reduce water and electric consumption by 25%.  In terms of the positive impact on the environment and scarcity of resources  alone, we could justify our expenditures on conservation," said Aghjayan, who,  before coming to Pasadena four years ago, had set up nationally recognized  conservation programs in Austin, Tex., and Palo Alto.  </P> <P> As an example of the voluntary conservation approach Pasadena is actively  encouraging, Aghjayan cited the new Doubletree Hotel, where special  low-water-use toilets were installed at the city's suggestion. The toilets cost  the hotel's developer an extra $30,000, Aghjayan said, but there will be a 50%  savings on water needed to flush, and an overall reduction of 25% to 30% of the  hotel's water bill. In two years, he said, the hotel will have recouped the  expense.  </P> <P> Over the long term, conservation makes economic sense for a utility company and  for consumers, he said. "To the extent that our customers conserve, they not  only save money for themselves but we save money by not having to build more  facilities, improve power plants or treat more water."  </P> <P> In addition, when consumers use less power, the city generates less, he said.  That helps because the city's power plant faces increasingly tighter  restrictions on the amount of emissions it can legally release while it  generates power.  </P> <P> "We're getting on the bandwagon late, but we're getting on with a bang," said  City Director Rick Cole. "There's some justification to the boast that we're  going beyond what other (communities) are doing."  </P> <P> But Cole expressed concern that the city, in its aggressive pursuit of  progress, may give the appearance of establishing a "water police force" to  penalize those who don't comply.  </P> <P> However, Thomas E. Pape, a city conservation program specialist, said: "It's no  hard sell and we're not the water police or the energy police.  </P> <P> "A lot of what we do is salesmanship. We're trying to show that it's easy and  it's low cost and the savings are guaranteed."  </P> <P> The Lite Bill program will cost about $800,000 this year. In addition, the city  expects its conservation programs to cost it $200,000 in lost revenues over  five years because of lower consumption. Yet the city will save in other ways,  and will receive a $373,000 credit for water-savings efforts from the  Metropolitan Water District. The incentive is offered because the district can  reduce its pumping expenses when use goes down.  </P> <P> Pasadena's efforts, meanwhile, are not occurring in a vacuum. On Wednesday, a  coalition of environmentalists, utility executives and state officials  announced a $550-million proposal to boost California to the forefront of  energy conservation. Under the plan, the state's four major utilities would  double what they spend to encourage conservation.  </P> <P> It would provide rebates to customers who install energy-saving devices such as  super-efficient light bulbs -- just like the ones the people in polo shirts  passed out last week on Mountain Avenue in Pasadena.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Richard Lee Colvin contributed to this story.  </P> <P> PASADENA'S NEW CONSERVATION PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Lite Bill  </P> <P> Door-to-door campaign designed to help cut water and light bills for residents  of 37,000 single-family houses and apartments and condominiums of up to four  units.

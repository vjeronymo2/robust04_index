			<p>BFN     [Text] The Riigikogu adopted the broadcasting law today.  According to this law, Estonian Radio and Estonian Television  will continue as independent legal entities. The Riigikogu  concluded that it would be unjustified to merge the two. Both  Estonian Radio and Estonian Television may broadcast advertising  material for up to five percent of the day's broadcasts. This  permission has been given in order to provide them with proper  funding.    The Riigikogu will set up a broadcasting council before  taking its summer recess. The council will be the top authority  for both Estonian Radio and Estonian Television. It is expected  to be set up in June.    As recommended by experts, several clarifications were  included in the broadcasting law. For example, the procedure  for issuing broadcasting licenses to privately owned  broadcasting stations has been made more specific.    The law adopted today regulates the rights and obligations  of  the electronic media, including those on the basis of which  private radio stations operate in Estonia.</p>

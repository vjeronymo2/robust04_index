			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH UNVEILS FINANCIAL AID PLAN FOR POLAND  </P> <P> President Bush announced a U.S. aid plan for Poland today, telling Poles their  democratic reforms could usher in an era of stability in Europe and had  Washington's full support.  </P> <P> "Poland is where the Cold War began -- and now the people of Poland can help  bring the division of Europe to an end," he said in an address to the newly  elected Polish Parliament.  </P> <P> He said he would ask the U.S. Congress for $100 million to promote private  enterprise in Poland and $15 million for a joint U.S.-Poland environmental  project, and seek World Bank approval for $325 million in loans for Poland.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Postpone Debt Payments  </P> <P> In addition, he said he would ask other industrial countries to postpone Polish  debt payments of $5 billion this year.  </P> <P> Earlier, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Polish Foreign Minister  Tadeusz Olechowski signed agreements deferring repayments of $1 billion in  overdue debt to U.S. government agencies.  </P> <P> Payments that were due in 1985 and over a three-year period beginning in 1986  will be deferred for five years. The bulk of the money is owed to the Commodity  Credit Corp. and the Export-Import Bank.  </P> <P> Bush, who was greeted by a two-minute standing ovation, said the world was  watching with admiration the reforms taking place in Poland and its Warsaw Pact  ally Hungary.  </P> <P> "By creating political structures legitimized by popular will, your reforms can  be the foundation of stability, security and prosperity -- not just here, but  in all of Europe," he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Huge Economic Problems  </P> <P> He noted that Poland, burdened by a $39-billion foreign debt, faced huge  economic problems whose solution will require sacrifice.  </P> <P> "But I want to stress to you today that Poland is not alone. Given the enormity  of this moment, the United States stands ready to help you as you help  yourselves," he said.  </P></p>

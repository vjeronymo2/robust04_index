			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Rumours spark Asprey share tumble Shares in Asprey fell 17p to 135p yesterday amid market rumours about the financial position of the jewellery retailer, writes Peter Pearse. On September 9, the shares plummeted from 310p to 200p after a warning that the loss of a few big-spending customers would depress its profits. Yesterday Asprey said it was forced to put out a statement to the Stock Exchange asserting that the 'rumours are without basis in fact'. It said that there were three rumours it wished to deny. First, the company had one bad debtor, owing some Pounds 30m. Second, it would have to make a Pounds 40m write-off for stock. Thirdly, it would not be able to pay its preference dividend. Asprey responded that at its most recent review, it had stock of Pounds 150m. The next review is at the time of the interim results and it did not expect that 'further provisions, if any, will be material in the context of the value of the stock as a whole'. It said it had never had a 'material bad debt' in its history as a public company. It added that nothing had altered since the profits warning to change its view of the upcoming results for the six months to September 30. It therefore expects to pay the preference.</p>

It said the K factor, which determines prices over the next 10 years, was lower for Portsmouth than for any of the 10 privatised water companies and harsher than all but two of the 31 companies involved in the periodic review. The K factor of minus 1.5 per cent compared with an average of plus 0.6 per cent for all water companies and plus 1.4 per cent for the industry as a whole.

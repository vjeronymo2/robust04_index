			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with presidential candidate Elisabeth Rehn </F> by reporter Jouni Turunen -- live]    [Excerpt] [Turunen] Well, Elisabeth Rehn, 70 percent of the  votes have now been counted and the result does not seem to  change. Has the moment now come when admitting defeat is topical?    [Rehn] No doubt the time has come. As I have said, I want to  see at least 70 percent, looking at past experience. Now that  number has been counted and the trend is not leveling, but on  the contrary, the difference seems to be growing, so I concede  very willingly that Martti is the winner. I have been  repeatedly asked that defeat must be conceded and if everybody  is happy for me to make that admission, I will give it gladly.  But believe it or not, I am immensely proud that I have  achieved this result because it is against all expectations.  All possible barriers have been broken here and I think this is  splendid as far as I am concerned.    [Turunen] The dramatic moment of these elections has thus  been experienced. Elisabeth Rehn has conceded defeat to Martti  Ahtisaari. In brief, why did you lose this campaign, what  decided this?    [Rehn] I would leave that option to various analysts; I am  no  election expert. I myself know that I had a good campaign with  small resources. I had no party machinery behind me, but jolly  amateurs, enthusiasts, eager people were behind me, and we  worked hard and happily. What makes me most happy is that we  never took the dirty road. I can look at myself in the mirror  and so can my election staff, so I am really satisfied.    [Turunen] What will Elisabeth Rehn do after this?    [Rehn] I will go to the election party.    [Turunen] In politics?    [Rehn] I hold the post of defense minister and will stick to  that as long as the government is in power. I am a parliament  deputy, we have parliament elections in just over a year. Let  us see then what I will do. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 12 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel  said today the current state where the undissolvable Chamber of  Deputies was taking over the powers of the yet unformed Senate  could not last forever since "it is really dangerous." In his  regular Sunday radio programme "Talks in Lany" Havel said that  either the Senate had to be set up in compliance with the  Constitution, or some other constitutional solution had to be  found.    He was reacting to the fact that the Chamber of Deputies  failed on June 2 to pass a bill on elections to the Senate and  to the Chamber, thus making senatorial elections planned for the  autumn probably impossible. Elections to the Chamber are to be  held in 1996.    Reacting to Friday's [9 June] proposal from the coalition  Christian Democratic Union-Czechoslovak People's Party (KDU-CSL)  on the division of the Senate's powers between the Chamber of  Deputies, the president and possibly the government, Havel said:  "Every additional power needs more work for my Office which  already now would need more employees than it has. The question  is what is correct."    But he added that "the powers which the Senate was to have,  must go somewhere." It would be logical if the president's right  to return laws to the Chamber would be extended by the right to  accompany the returned law with comments which the valid  Constitution does not guarantee for him, Havel said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bratislava Feb 28 (CTK) -- Slovak President Michal  Kovac will accept the resignations of Deputy Premier Roman Kovac  and Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik only after the proposal by  Premier Vladimir Meciar to appoint a new foreign minister is  approved, presidential spokesman Anton Bodis said today. He  thus made previous information that Kovac had decided to accept  the resignations of the two ministers more accurate.    Kovac rejected Meciar's proposal to appoint Jozef Prokes,  current deputy premier and honorary chairman of the Slovak  National Party (SNS) as new foreign minister today. At the same  time, Kovac asked Meciar to nominate another person to head the  Foreign and Privatisation Ministries.    Bodis said Meciar had accepted Kovac's request to nominate a  new candidate to the post of the foreign minister.    Meanwhile, government spokesman Ondrej Hanko declined to say  when the next meeting between Kovac and Meciar would take place  and who were possible candidates for foreign minister. "That  would be premature speculation," said Hanko [when] asked whether  Slovak Ambassador to the Czech Republic Ivan Mjartan was among  the candidates.</p>

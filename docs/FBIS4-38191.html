			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 28 Jun (INA) -- Vice President Taha Yasin  Ramadan has asserted that the Iraqi people, who are being  subjected to an unfair blockade imposed by the evil coalition  forces led by the United States, have managed, through their  heroic steadfastness under the leadership of President Saddam  Husayn, to break the blockade, preserve their strength, and take  the reins of progress and development by virtue of their will.    During his reception of Muhammad Gulcegun, deputy chairman  of  the Turkish Social Democratic Populist Party and member of the  Turkish Grand National Assembly [title as received], and his  delegation, Ramadan added that the governments implementing the  U.S. policy are imposing a blockade on their own peoples and  subjecting them to suffering due to the deterioration in their  economic situation as a result of the continued blockade on Iraq.    The vice president touched on Iraqi-Turkish relations and  their development under hard circumstances throughout history.  He asserted that promoting the relations between the two  countries will contribute to improving the economic situation of  both neighboring peoples and consolidate regional stability and  security.    The Turkish party official pointed to the Turkish people's  suffering due to the continued blockade on Iraq, as well as the  activities carried out by the Turkish parties and organizations  which demand the lifting of the blockade imposed on Iraq. He  also lauded the Iraqis' steadfastness and their defiance of the  blockade. This proves the Iraqis' strength, adherence to their  principles, and struggle for sovereignty and progress, he added.</p>

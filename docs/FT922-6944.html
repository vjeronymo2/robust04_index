			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / International Company News: Maple Leaf Foods advances 31% despite weak markets MAPLE Leaf Foods, the Canadian food-processing subsidiary of the UK's Hillsdown Holdings, has again overcome weak markets to post a 31 per cent rise in first-quarter earnings. Net earnings from continuing operations climbed to CDollars 12m (USDollars 10), or 15 cents a share, from CDollars 9.2m, or 14 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales dropped to CDollars 638m from CDollars 747m, due largely to the surgery which has transformed Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers, over the past 18 months into a more tightly focused and aggressive company. Mr Charles Bowen, recently appointed chief executive, ascribed the improved earnings to continued cost-cutting, lower interest expense and wider margins as a result of a greater emphasis on value-added products. The company earned net interest of CDollars 1.9m this year, compared with debt-service charges of CDollars 3.7m in 1991. Maple Leaf, which has virtually no long-term debt and net cash reserves of over CDollars 200m, has recently switched its focus from reorganisation to expansion. It has signed a flour-milling joint venture with ConAgra, the big US agri-business group. The company reported sharply higher first-quarter earnings from its milling opera-tions. Maple Leaf has also proposed buying out the minorities in Corporate Foods, its baking subsidiary, as a first step towards North American expansion.</p>

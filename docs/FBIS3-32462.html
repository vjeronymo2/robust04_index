			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [EL ESPECTADOR editorial: "Politics Heats Up"] </F>   [Text] As was the case approximately 10 years ago, when  drug trafficking money invaded election campaign coffers, the  issue of the influence of drug money in politics is being  stirred up again. Not because of a whim of those who valiantly  denounce an act which is so abominable, but because there are  indications--which perhaps could not be fully proven--of the  intimate association, murky and punishable by law, between  unscrupulous politicians and traffickers who seek support from  persons in a position to decide the fate of many things. If Juan  Jose Chaux and Lucas Lebolo Conde stated that certain aspirants  in their departments have an abundance of money at their  disposal, it is because--in the absence of tracks which all  those involved seek to erase--the millions which finance the  politicians are circulating and thus ensure loyalty to the  generous donor.    It is said there will be filters to prevent what is already  a  shameful reality for our parties, and that the controls will  prevent those Colombians, who more than anyone else should  preserve their political and moral transparency, from being  bribed on a continuing basis. But for some time now we've talked  of these things--of strict vigilance over the financial records  and resources of these coffers--but the evil of the  surreptitious and corrupting influence of this illicit traffic  has not abated. On the contrary, its harmful effects persist and  we see situations which bring dishonor to a political tradition  of which we were proud. What occurred with extradition in the  Constitutional Congress and now, in recent times, with the  confiscation of property obtained as a result of drug  trafficking are two dishonorable chapters which are a confusing  mixture of vanity and cowardice.    It is not sufficient to have dismantled the infrastructure  of  a powerful cartel, nor to have eliminated its most prominent  godfathers and capo regimes in order to reverse the unhealthy  penetration of their harmful practices--from the bribing of  consciences to indiscriminate or selective terrorist acts. Other  less bloody, but nonetheless criminal and corrupting  organizations, seek similar ends. Though they may use greater  discretion, the attack on morality and on good political and  administrative practices is of equal or greater magnitude.    It is no secret to anyone that there are cartels and  independent traffickers throughout the breadth and length of  Colombia. What's more, in every city in Valle Department there  is a drug "trust" [preceding word in English] with a commander  and troops. In the coastal region, the same thing. In Medellin,  there is still a considerable presence. In Bogota, an old  organization has lowered its profile, but has not ceased to  defend its power. And even in jungle regions where the growth of  businesses in many products attracts the voracity of the  traffickers, very rich and powerful groups have formed which are  independent of those operating in some of its municipalities and  which continue to maintain an understanding with politicians in  order to put themselves out of harm's way with regard to  official action, whenever they need a favor from someone in  public office, at whatever level.    As is evident, the above statements must be a cause of  concern to public opinion and to the sectors of the country  which vigorously reject the deterioration of our political class  and its permeability to money derived from the deepest depths of  crime. Criticisms such as those made by Enrique Gomez against  the council members in Cartagena, and on which he will now  expand citing new motives, as EL ESPECTADOR anticipated,  reassure Colombians who view with alarm the increase of immoral  activity by public officials in Congress, the assemblies, and  the councils.    Together with the majority of our compatriots, we cherish  the  hope that those promised filters for the upcoming campaigns  function effectively, and that the party leaders contribute,  with a scrupulosity that will benefit the campaigns, so that the  authorities feel the incentive of some political organizations  prepared to rescue public life from the mire of concupiscence  and not to serve as accomplices, out of purely electoral  interests, to the owners of the putrid fiefs of our departments  and municipalities. Our democracy will have lost much if its  congressmen, deputies, council members, governors, and mayors  are the product of the corrupting influence of crime or the  intimidation of an insurgency also corrupted by its desire for  riches.</p>

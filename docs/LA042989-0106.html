			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FAMILY BIDS FAREWELL TO VICTIM OF BATTLESHIP BLAST;  </P> <P> IOWA SAILOR IS LAID TO REST  </P> <P> On a brass coatrack in a tiny room just off the sanctuary of the Costa Mesa  Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, hung the symbols of Geoffrey Scott  Schelin's youth: a red Estancia High School baseball T-shirt, a worn catcher's  mitt, an old pair of cleats covered with a layer of ocher dust.  </P> <P> Arranged on a table nearby were the symbols of his emerging manhood: a  photograph of Schelin in formation with other seaman during a Navy parade, a  letter of commendation from a rear admiral, a magazine article describing life  at sea.  </P> <P> Friday afternoon, just before Schelin's large, close-knit family filed into the  church sanctuary for his funeral service, they gathered in silence for a few  moments around the lovingly-built shrine.  </P> <P> "You entered the Navy a boy, you grew to be a man, you died a hero," said  26-year-old Craig Schelin later, as he delivered a tearful and moving eulogy  for his youngest brother, the only sailor from Orange County to die in an April  19 explosion aboard the battleship Iowa that killed 47.  </P> <P> The bodies of the sailors were returned to the Iowa's home port of Norfolk,  Va., on Monday, where a mass memorial service, attended by President Bush, was  held. The sailors' caskets were then shipped to their hometowns for funerals  and burial with full military honors.  </P> <P> At Schelin's services Friday, the most often repeated theme was that he had  come into his own in the Navy, and that in dying in service to his country, his  short life had become a soaring triumph instead of a senseless tragedy.  </P> <P> "He performed his assignment well. He will be back at some other duty  assignment after this," a Latter-day Saints official told the Schelin family,  expressing his religion's belief that the earthly sojourn and the afterlife  have purpose.  </P> <P> After the graveside service at Pacific View Memorial  </P> <P> Park in Newport Beach, at which a detail of Marines fired the traditional  volleys over his grave, another of his older brothers assured reporters that  the Schelins are angry with no one over the devastating blast in one of the  Iowa's gun turrets.  </P> <P> "It was just a freak accident," Daryl Schelin, 36, said. "You probably had the  best turret crew in the world in there."  </P> <P> He and 20 other members of the family were given a tour of the Iowa and its gun  turrets Monday after it arrived in Norfolk. They were satisfied that every  possible safety precaution had been taken on the vessel of World War II  vintage, he said.  </P> <P> "There was nothing they held back," he said. "There was no unstable ammunition  on that ship."  </P> <P> In the eulogy, Craig Schelin remembered his brother, the eighth of Darlene and  Dale Schelin's nine children, as a confused youth without direction in 1986  after he graduated from Costa Mesa's Estancia High School.  </P> <P> Some of that confusion, Craig suggested, may have stemmed from Geoffrey's  attempts to move out of the shadows of four older brothers. After he joined the  Navy in 1987, and after a brief period of difficulty adjusting to boot camp, he  began to develop discipline and a sense of purpose.  </P> <P> "I can't believe how much he grew in the last 2 1/2 years," Craig Schelin said.  </P> <P> Geoffrey Schelin, a petty officer 3rd class, had become so good at his job of  supervising the loading of gunpowder on the Iowa's gun deck that turret  captains were vying over which would get to keep him, the family said.  </P> <P> Bishop Bruce Hoggan of the Mission Viejo Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, of which Darlene and Dale Schelin are members, said being on the Iowa  was no accident in Geoffrey Schelin's life.  </P> <P> Given the choice of being assigned to any one of four ships in January, Hoggan  said, Schelin "immediately chose this great ship, for this was the best. He was  proud to serve among those who served on his ship."  </P></p>

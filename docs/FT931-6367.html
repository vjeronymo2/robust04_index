			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Technology: Searching for the perfect rice cooker The recession in Japan may have dampened consumers' appetite for electronic goods, but a quick glance in any electrical retail shop in Tokyo shows it certainly has not killed their taste for high technology. The decline in consumer spending in Japan has led manufacturers to review their product strategies and adjust their marketing and distribution plans to the new environment. Product ranges and cycles have been reduced. Some retailers report that certain manufacturers have clamped down on discounts and rebates for poorly selling products. However, one thing that has not been affected is the rising level of sophisticated technology that manufacturers feel compelled to incorporate in their products. Take rice cookers, for example. There is no denying that the Japanese take their rice seriously. But when facing a row of rice cookers, each proudly proclaiming the use of microcomputers, induction heating or fuzzy logic, it is difficult not to feel that things have gone a bit too far. The key to cooking good rice is a strong initial burst of heat. Conventional rice cookers, in which a coil at the bottom of the rice cooker heats the inner pot, do not provide sufficiently strong heat. But a new range of rice cookers has appeared on the market using a method known as induction heating. Friction between a magnetic coil at the bottom of the cooker and the pot that contains the rice creates the heat which is transferred through the pot. The heat is stronger than in conventional cookers and spreads around the pot to cook the rice evenly. Induction heating is a method long used in industrial furnaces. With the use of more semiconductors, rice cookers can also obey instructions to cook the rice normally, or slightly drier or wetter than normal. Because the new rice cookers do not just turn on and off, but can make subtle adjustments depending on the circumstances, they are described as being 'neuro-fuzzy'. From toasters to washing machines, manufacturers are testing the computer programming skills of housewives with the use of microcomputers and liquid crystal display panels that show any number of programmes which need to be set up to get the machines to work. Manufacturers claim Japanese consumers are becoming increasingly sophisticated and they are only trying to meet the demands of consumers for better-performing household appliances. But it is more likely that the excess of high technology in recent electronic products stems above all from manufacturers' needs to stimulate consumer demand and their desire to earn a higher profit from new products. They are also clearly desperate to offer an incentive for domestic consumers to replace their old equipment. According to the Economic Planning Agency, the penetration rate of washing machines in Japanese households is 99.4 per cent, while that of refrigerators is 98.9 per cent. In a country where penetration of electrical goods is as high as it is, it is not surprising that stimulating extra demand will take more than a few extra buttons. However, added features also provide a convenient excuse to raise prices. The latest rice cookers, for example, are about twice as expensive as conventional ones. As the difficulty consumers experience in programming video tape recorders has shown, too much high technology runs the risk of turning away potential buyers. Some manufacturers now recognise the need for easier-to-use electronic equipment and have started to introduce much simplified products such as VCRs. Whether or not Japanese consumers are happy with all the high technology in their homes, it will be some time before they start to express their exasperation. Meanwhile manufacturers possess a powerful trump card. Since the production of old models is usually discontinued after some time, Japanese consumers are left with little chance to vote with their purses by keeping them closed.</p>

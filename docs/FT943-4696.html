			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nordic pulp producers set price increases Leading Nordic pulp producers have announced their fifth increase in prices this year because of continuing wood shortages and strong demand from paper producers. Their move will lift the price of northern bleached soft wood kraft (NBSK) pulp, the industry staple, to Dollars 700 a tonne from Dollars 630 a tonne and will take effect over the next few weeks. It means prices have risen by 80 per cent from a low of Dollars 390 a tonne at the end of last year. Finncell, the Finnish marketing organisation, led the latest round of price rises, but it has since been followed by several Swedish heavyweights, including Stora, Europe's largest forestry group, and MoDo. There is every sign that the increases will be accepted, suggesting North American producers will push up their prices to the new levels. The latest rise has been driven by shortages of wood, which are holding down pulp mill operating rates, and a big rise in demand for fine paper on the back of the recovery in the worldwide economy. Mr Denis Christie, pulp and paper analyst at James Capel in London, said wood producers were diverting timber to the saw mill industry, where prices have risen sharply, and withholding supplies to pulp mills in anticipation of higher prices. He added that market pulp volumes had risen 5 per cent this year - around three times the normal annual level - partly because of stockbuilding.</p>

			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The National Labor Relations Board rejected numerous complaints filed against  the Hotel Employees &amp; Restaurant Employees Union, Local 30, and affirmed  the union's right to represent Host International workers at Lindbergh Field.  </P> <P> NLRB official Karin V. Gearhard overruled "in their entirety" the objections  filed by employee Perry Cruz and Host in March.  </P> <P> Cruz, who is a union member, and Host alleged that Local 30 officials had  engaged in unfair campaigning and coercive conduct during a recent  decertification election.  </P> <P> The disputed election arose from an unsuccessful attempt by Host to decertify  the union in February. Host workers voted to retain the union, 103 to 78.  Gearhard's ruling was released Monday.  </P> <P> Host and Local 30 are engaged in bitter negotiations for a new contract. The  union's old contract with the company expired in December. Earlier this month,  the San Diego Board of Port Commissioners told the company that it must pay  prevailing wages to its employees. The union has alleged that Host's San Diego  employees earn less than other local workers who perform the same jobs.  </P></p>

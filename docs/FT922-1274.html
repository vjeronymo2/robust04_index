			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lower oil prices hit Hardy Oil &amp; Gas Lower oil prices left post-tax profits at Hardy Oil &amp; Gas 29 per cent down at Pounds 7.22m in the year to March 31, against Pounds 10.1m. Turnover improved from Pounds 39.3m to Pounds 41m, despite low prices and dollar weakness, which resulted in oil sales being lower than expected. However, the company said that exploration results had been outstanding. There were three oil and gas discoveries on the UK continental shelf, four gas field discoveries in the US and good progress in Canada. The board is recommending a single final dividend of 1p, the first since its demerger from Trafalgar House three years ago. The move is in line with the company's previous expectations. Earnings per share were 8.3p (16.1p).</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> CLEVELAND TO RETIRE JERSEY OF UCLA'S TREVOR WILSON  </P> <P> He seems a little young for a retirement bash, but Cleveland High nonetheless  will retire the jersey of 1986 graduate Trevor Wilson before today's 7 p.m.  North Valley League game against Granada Hills at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Wilson, a junior starting forward at UCLA, joins Kevin Holmes (DePaul) and  Keith Morrison (Washington State) as the only Cleveland basketball players to  be so honored. Morrison and Holmes play professionally abroad.  </P> <P> Wilson will be honored in a pregame ceremony by Cleveland Coach Bob Braswell.  UCLA assistant Brad Holland, a Crescenta Valley High graduate, also may  participate in the presentation, Braswell said.  </P> <P> "We plan to talk a little about his accomplishments at Cleveland and UCLA,"  Braswell said. "He deserves it. He may very well be the first player from  Cleveland to play in the NBA."  </P> <P> Wilson wore uniform No. 4 at Cleveland, the same number he wears at UCLA.  </P> <P> Taking wing: Two seconds to play. Down by a basket. Inbounds pass . . .  </P> <P> Give the ball to Larry Bird, right?  </P> <P> Holy parquet floor! The pass is to . . . Darren Oldenberg?  </P> <P>  "I like the pressure," said Oldenberg, a senior guard for Canyon. "Some people  don't like to be in that position. I like it. It's worth it."  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the situation paid off in clovers for Oldenberg, a Boston Celtics  fanatic dubbed "Bird" by his teammates.  </P> <P> With his team trailing Quartz Hill, 73-71, with 2 ticks left on the clock,  Oldenberg found himself with the ball and both feet behind the 3-point line.  </P> <P> "It was supposed to go to Jamil Austin," Oldenberg said. "But the pass came to  me. I shot it and it went in. All net."  </P> <P> Oldenberg's 3-point basket gave Canyon a 74-73 victory. The shot heard 'round  the campus made Olden-Bird a school celebrity.  </P> <P> "It feels good," said Oldenberg, who donned his green Celtic jacket immediately  after the game. "It's something Bird does all the time."  </P> <P> First and last: The Del Rey League will unveil its first postseason tournament  next week.  </P> <P> Perhaps the word "tournament" is too strong. The 5-team league will stage 3  games next week to determine its 3 representatives in the Southern Section  playoffs. On Monday, the fifth-place team (Alemany) will play the fourth-place  team (probably St. John Bosco), and the winner will advance to a Wednesday game  against the third-place team (probably St. Francis). The winner of that game  becomes the league's third-place playoff representative.  </P> <P> On Friday, Crespi, which clinched second place with Tuesday's win over St.  Francis, will play league champion Loyola for the league's first-place playoff  berth.  </P> <P> Even though the tournament provides a no-lose situation for Crespi, Coach Paul  Muff has no enthusiasm for the postseason format.  </P> <P> "I was never in favor of it even though we may benefit most this year," he  said. "I don't think one game should determine No. 1."  </P> <P> We wanted to add a little something to the season because we play only eight  games in league, but I think we'll only do it this year."  </P> <P> Record run: Westlake center Kurt Schwan is on the verge of 3 school records, 2  of which likely will fall by the time the 6-8 senior leaves the floor after  tonight's Marmonte League game against Simi Valley.  </P> <P> Schwan, who will attend Weber State, has 234 rebounds this season, 2 shy of  Derrick Beale's single-season record set in 1978-79. Schwan, who has scored 440  points this season and 764 in his career, is 10 away from Paul Keenan's season  mark and 70 from Keenan's career record. Keenan played from 1984-87.  </P> <P> Westlake has 3 league games remaining and is in good position to make the  playoffs. Schwan, however, hardly seems to be caught up in the record-setting.  He said he set no such goals before the season started.  </P> <P> "It was just to go in and play the game," he said.  </P> <P> Waves get their man: Chatsworth senior Derek Wallace, who will pitch and play  first base for the Chancellors, has verbally committed to Pepperdine, which  recruited him as a pitcher. High school baseball players can sign national  letters of intent April 13.  </P> <P> As the best relief pitcher in the Valley area last year, Wallace posted a 7-0  record with 8 saves and a 3.17 earned-run average.  </P> <P> Job update: St. Genevieve Principal Rudy Trujillo has released the names of 3  candidates for the school's vacant football job. Being considered for the post  are Jeff Kearin, a Loyola High assistant; Mark Lovett, a Cal State Northridge  assistant; and Ralph Rosas, an assistant at Kennedy.  </P> <P> Former Coach Kevin Kane resigned at the end of last season.  </P> <P> Thumbs down: Chaminade senior Nick Siciliano, whose left thumb was broken  during a Jan. 20 game against Notre Dame, probably is lost for the season,  according to Coach Mike Lynn.  </P> <P> "Ironically," Lynn said, "it was the best game of his life."  </P> <P> Siciliano, who had never scored in double figures, finished with 12 points and  10 rebounds. He believed his thumb was broken early in the second half but  didn't want to leave the game.  </P> <P> Add Chaminade: When in doubt, call on Ted Corcoran.  </P> <P> Corcoran might become Chaminade's first freshman 3-sport varsity athlete. Last  fall, Corcoran joined the varsity football team at midseason. This week, he  replaced Siciliano on the basketball team. In the spring, Corcoran will take a  shot at varsity baseball.  </P> <P> "He might be remembered as one of the best athletes to come out of Chaminade,"  Lynn said. "Basketball is his worst sport."  </P> <P> Booted: The Reseda boys' soccer team, last year's City Section champion with a  13-4-2 record, will not qualify for the playoffs this season. The Regents are  0-4-2 in the Valley Pac 8 Conference and 4-5-3 overall.  </P> <P> Staff writers Tim Brown, Steve Elling, Sam Farmer, John Lynch, John Ortega,  Vince Kowalick and Rocky Pinheiro contributed to this notebook.  </P></p>

This was stated by Viktor Stelmakh, head of the Ukrainian  Council of Ministers' and presidential press service on 12  January in an interview with the NOVYNY Television and Radio  Agency. He pointed out: It is not difficult to predict that  both issues of bilateral economic relations and nuclear problems  will prevail at the meeting. As has been underlined by the U.S.  and Ukrainian sides, it is time the dialogue was expanded and  not reduced to problems of nuclear disarmament. Attention  should be paid to economic cooperation and bilateral ties.  Viktor Stelmakh emphasized that given the importance of issues  to be discussed on 12 January by Presidents Kravchuk and  Clinton, the Ukrainian-U.S. summit will be of great importance  for building mutual understanding between the two states and for  the entire world community.</p>

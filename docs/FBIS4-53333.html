			<p>BFN     [Text] Sendai, May 18 KYODO -- The Miyagi Prefectural  Government has decided to disclose information concerning the  delivery of nuclear material shipments to and from a power plant  in the prefecture, prefectural government sources said Wednesday  [18 May].    The central government in Tokyo, however, is opposing the  prefecture's plan.    "This decision...is regrettable," said Kenichi Maruyama, an  official of the Nuclear Safety Bureau of the Science and  Technology Agency.    He said management of information relating to transport of  nuclear fuel falls within an international framework and the  Miyagi Government's unilateral decision "deviates from this."    The central government in April 1993 advised power plant  localities to avoid divulging such information as a precaution  against sensitive materials falling into the wrong hands.    The Miyagi Government has decided to reveal information  regarding the shipping of spent nuclear fuel from the Onagawa  plant run by Tohoku Electric Power Co., the first such public  disclosure in Japan.    While the information will not include the time of  transport,  name of ship or route taken, it will detail such things as fuel  quantity, container type, country of destination and whereabouts  of a reprocessing plant.    The decision was made in response to the urging of a local  antinuclear group.    Maruyama said the agency intends to summon Miyagi Government  officials to discuss the situation.    He said the prefecture will be advised to tighten its  control  of information, taking into consideration the negative overseas  reaction that public disclosure of such information would likely  generate, as well as how it would adversely affect other  prefectures.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Libyan authorities have denied reports from the  Cairo representative of the opposition Libyan National Salvation  Front claiming that several people were shot and wounded on 17  March in Bani Walid, 150 km south of Tripoli, after they  attacked public buildings. According to this opposition leader,  the demonstrations broke out after Libyan television broadcast  false confessions extracted under torture from army officers  implicated in a military rebellion in Bani Walid last October.    According to the director of Libya's foreign information  service, the claims of this opposition leader are hardly  credible, given his collaboration with foreign information  services, in particular the CIA.</p>

			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Survey of Poland (15): Carbonates and culture - The Coca-Cola flag flies high in Poland SYMBOLS marking the arrival of capitalism abound in Poland, but none is more striking than the decision to locate the offices of Coca-Cola Company in the Palace of Culture building. Referred to by cynical Poles as the Power Tower or Stalin's Church, the 40 story building dominates the drab Warsaw skyline. In the decades since Stalin ordered its construction the building came to represent, through its granite and marble exterior, the power of the communist central authority. Now, while talk continues of tearing down this monument to Poland's communist past, it has become a piece of prime city office space. Mr Ryszard Wojtkowski, a senior manager for Coca-Cola in Poland, says that the decision to locate the company in the building was taken for purely commercial reasons. Since coming to Poland in March 1991, the company has outgrown its two floors of space in the building, highlighting the pace of growth the company has achieved. Now it is moving out to one of the modern office blocks springing up all over the city centre. With investment commitments to Poland of over Dollars 200m, the country ranks second to eastern Germany as the US groups's focus for investment in eastern Europe. Coca-Cola has made investments in 11 former Soviet bloc countries since taking the decision, in the late 1980s, to exploit the area's potential. Before making a direct investment, Coca-Cola maintained a token presence through arrangements with state-controlled brewers to produce Coke from imported concentrate. Legacies of this arrangement remain. But a mixture of joint ventures, partnerships with bottling companies and wholly-owned operations has enabled the company to gain a large slice of the carbonated drinks market. Per capita consumption of carbonated drinks in Poland is well below that in in western Europe. It has traditionally been supplied by relatively small local producers starved of capital and marketing skills. Coca-Cola and its rival, PepsiCo, are both caught up in the throes of large-scale publicity drives - and these are having visible results in all parts of the country. The power of these campaigns is expected to drive many small regional groups out of business as the two multinationals drive home their production and marketing advantages. Estimates vary widely, but Coca-Cola says that Coke and PepsiCo have about 50 per cent of the market and forecasts that this will rise to 70 per cent by the end of the year. Competition for market share between the two US companies has hotted up during the past 12 months, with Coca-Cola apparently winning the fight. Unlike its competitor, PepsiCo has sought to tie up deals with larger regional brewers for Pepsi production and is complementing its Polish operations with the introduction of a fast foods subsidiary, Pizza Hut. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola's sales volume rose 274 per cent during 1992, from a small start-up base. Current output of 40m cases a year of the equivalent of 0.4 litre bottles is forecast to rise to 100m within two years - equal to sales in eastern Germany last year. (This forecast is based on establishing nine plants in the main population centres by the end of 1993.) The company's joint venture partners in Poland are Brau, the Austrian brewer, and Ringnes, a subsidiary of Orkla of Norway, which is the Coca-Cola bottler in that country. Coca-Cola took its initial step into Poland through a joint venture in Warsaw in which the Norwegian group took a 51 per cent share. To widen its geographic spread, Ringnes then established a production site in Bydgoszcz, 280kms north of Warsaw. It took a 90 per cent holding in this, for a Dollars 20m investment. The investment will grow to Dollars 30m with the addition of another production line - and the expansion associated with this. A fully-owned production site at Lublin, in eastern Poland, will spread the Norwegian group's access to about a third of the total population. The introduction of Coke Lite, to be marketed alongside Coke, Sprite and Fanta, is the most important product change under way in Poland. The launch of the Coke Lite was held up because a branch of the government objected to the presence of one ingredient in the vital imported syrup. However, the process for approval received a helping hand earlier this year when Mrs Hanna Suchocka, the former prime minister, asked Mr Roberto Goizueta, Coca-Cola's chief executive, who was then on a visit to Warsaw, when she might be able to buy the Coke Lite. The reason for the delay was explained - and the rest is now part of Coca-Cola's history in Poland.</p>

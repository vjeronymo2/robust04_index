			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> POLICEMAN WOUNDS SUSPECTED ROBBER  </P> <P> Beverly Hills police shot and wounded a suspected robber Tuesday after he  allegedly advanced toward a detective while wielding a knife, authorities said.  </P> <P> Julio Quilla, 30, was in serious but stable condition at a Beverly Hills  hospital after being shot once in the stomach, Lt. Dave Griffey said.  </P> <P> An unidentified officer received a superficial wound when the bullet ricocheted  from the suspect and struck the officer's leg, Griffey said.  </P> <P> Quilla entered an elevator with a woman in an office building at 333 S. Beverly  Drive, Griffey said. The woman later told officers that Quilla threatened her  with a knife and attempted to rob her. She began screaming, officers said, and  the suspect ran without taking anything when the elevator doors opened.  </P> <P> Plainclothes officers later saw a man running and carrying a knife near a  supermarket at Beverly Drive and Olympic Boulevard, police said. The officers  ordered the man to stop, but he "started running right at our detectives with a  knife," Griffey said. An officer who was not identified fired one shot,  wounding Quilla, police said. He will be booked on suspicion of robbery and  assault with a deadly weapon, Griffey said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by "Rau.": "Will to Leadership"] </F>   [Text] NATO has decided after all in favor of an ultimatum  to the Serbs to leave Gorazde and the other "protection zones"  or else Serbian positions will be bombed. U.S. President Bill  Clinton seems to have finally brought himself to push this  through NATO.    No matter how much Bill Clinton rejects this, Bosnia is  becoming a touchstone for his leadership abilities. The  situation in the former Yugoslavia is extremely complicated and  risky. However, it is the job of the U.S. President to take  resolute action and risks if necessary.    The Clinton Administration has given way to local chiefs of  bandits in Haiti and Somalia. If it does not cope with the  Bosnian Serbs -- even if it were to withdraw while giving  weapons to the Muslims -- the judgment on its competence will be  passed.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of  Haiti has energetically protested the thoughtless statements by  U.S. Senator Robert Graham on the occasion of his visit to Cite  Solel on Saturday, 18 May [date as heard].    His statements, the Ministry says, are contrary to all norms  of international law and can in no way be tolerated by the  government of the Republic. Mr. Graham's provocation is all the  more unacceptable in his having taken advantage of the Haitian  people's hospitality to threaten the sovereignty of this country  and openly call for its invasion. There is no doubt that Mr.  Graham's cynical statements lie within the scope of his  electoral campaign.    Following Mr. Graham's unspeakable behavior, the government  of the Republic of Haiti declares him persona non grata and his  presence no longer accepted on national territory.    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Haiti  takes this opportunity to invite foreigners to refrain from  interfering in Haiti's internal affairs.    It should be recalled that Florida Democratic Sen. Bob  Graham, at the conclusion of a 24-hour visit to Port-au-Prince,  came out in favor of a multinational military intervention in  Haiti in case of failure of the international sanctions. He  asserted that President-in-exile Jean-Bertrand Aristide was  favorable to that as a necessary last resort.</p>

			<p><P> February 18, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CHARLES KEEPING A LOW PROFILE IN WASHINGTON VISIT  </P> <P> Britain's Prince Charles shunned the spotlight Friday as he met with American  achievers over lunch, accepted an invitation for tea with Vice President Dan  Quayle and headed for Camp David, Md., for dinner with President Bush.  </P> <P> On his eighth visit to the United States, Charles arrived alone aboard a Royal  Air Force jet from New York for a low-key, 24-hour visit to the nation's  capital. That contrasted sharply with his wife Diana's highly publicized tour  of New York earlier this month.  </P> <P> The 40-year-old prince rarely ventured from the British Embassy except for a  scheduled evening helicopter ride to Camp David for an informal dinner with  Bush and his wife, Barbara.  </P> <P> During the day, Charles spoke over lunch at the embassy with 16 leading  American figures in business, education, the environment, social welfare and  science.  </P></p>

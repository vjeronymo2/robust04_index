			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The effective date of all of the substantive changes in the statute and the regulations that are announced in any GAL (or change thereto) is the same as the effective date of the amendment(s) to which the GAL pertains, but any substantive change in GAL operating instructions applies, unless stated otherwise, in the case of all decisions made after the date of issuance of the GAL (or change thereto) by the Department. However, all of the substantive changes noted below in items A through R are subject to an opportunity for comment after publication of this final rule. After the end of the comment period, and consideration of any comments received, another final rule document will be published relating to these substantive changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Substantive changes in the interpretations of the 1988 Amendments which are addressed below relate primarily to the effective date and application of the new eligibility period for basic TRA, but also relate to other provisions of the OTCA, the Trade Act of 1974 and section 106(a) of Public Law 102&hyph;318 which amends section 231(a)(2) of the Trade Act, as discussed below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department's new interpretations center on the effective date provisions of subsections (a) and (g) of Section 1430 of the OTCA. These new interpretations are discussed in detail in paragraph A, below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Good Cause Exception <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B), that good cause exists for publication in final of the substantive changes in this document, because all of such changes are essential to the proper administration of the TAA program by the States, and such changes either relieve a restriction, and have been previously announced in controlling operating instructions issued to the States, or relate primarily to procedural relationships between and among the States. In addition, because of the delays encountered in issuing this final rule, any further delay in putting these substantive changes into effect would be impractical and contrary to the public interest. As explained above, comments are invited and will be considered, after which a final rule will be published. In the meantime, public implementation of these substantive changes as final regulations will not be delayed further. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the following text, therefore, substantive changes, on which comments are requested, are addressed first. These changes are followed by a discussion of the comments received on the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Substantive Changes from November 30, 1988 Proposed Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The substantive changes noted under this heading are either changes in the amendments to part 617, as published on November 30, 1988, or changes in other sections of Part 617 that were not included in the proposed rule. These substantive changes also include conforming changes in the transition provisions of &sect;617.67. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments are requested on all of these substantive changes, after which a final rule document on such changes will be published. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. New Eligibility Period for Basic TRA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1425 (a) of the OTCA amended section 233(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 to reinstate the ``movable'' eligibility period for basic TRA. Section 1430(a) of the OTCA made this amendment effective on the date of enactment, August 23, 1988, and section 1430(g) of the OTCA provided that amended section 233(a)(2) would not be applied in certain circumstances if it would result in an earlier expiration date of a worker's eligibility period established on the basis of the prior law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988 (53 FR 48474) (as well as in Section 4.F.1. of GAL 7&hyph;88), Section 1430(a) was interpreted as making this amendment applicable to any total qualifying separation which occurred on or after August 23, 1988. The limitation in section 1430 (g) was interpreted as applying with respect to any such total qualifying separation if it would result in an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period of a worker based on the prior law and a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In GAL 15&hyph;90, issued on August 21, 1990, the Department announced that, in conjunction with the development of final regulations implementing the 1988 Amendments, the Department determined that the previously published interpretations of the effective date provisions in the proposed rule published on November 30, 1988, were in error. The same erroneous interpretations were contained in GAL 7&hyph;88, and this fact necessitated the issuance of revised operating instructions in GAL 15&hyph;90, which was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 21, 1990, at 55 FR 48774. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsection (a) of section 1430 of the OTCA provides that: ``Except as otherwise provided by this section, the amendments made by this part shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.'' Subsection (a) thus applied to, among others, the amendment to section 233(a)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974, which prescribes the eligibility period for basic TRA. In the proposed rule and in GAL 7&hyph;88, the amendment to section 233(a)(2) was interpreted as being applicable to separations which occurred on or after the date of enactment of the OTCA, August 23, 1988. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

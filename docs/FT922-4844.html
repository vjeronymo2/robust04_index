			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Still no recovery in car market, says Ford chief THE EXPECTED post-election upturn in the badly depressed UK new-car market has not materialised, Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said yesterday. He said that even the cut in special car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent had not helped restore confidence, particularly among private buyers. In the first five months of the year sales to private individuals were running more than 10 per cent below year-ago levels. Unless there was a marked recovery in August - when the new registration prefix, which normally accounts for more than 20 per cent of annual sales, is introduced - this year's market could be smaller even than last year's 1.59m units, Mr McAllister said. He was speaking as Ford launched an 'Options' scheme, under which private buyers can acquire a new car by paying for its projected depreciation over two years, plus interest charges. Ford guarantees a minimum value for the car after two years - after which the 'owner' can choose to sell the car and keep any extra above the agreed minimum value, return the car to Ford, or keep it by paying the balance of the purchase price. The Options programme was launched with an insurance scheme for 'hot hatchbacks' such as the Fiesta XR2 and Escort XR3i, which in the past have accounted for up to 15 per cent of Escort and Fiesta sales. Soaring insurance premiums as a result of 'joyriding' and high accident rates have sent UK sales of 'hot hatchbacks' plunging by more than half this year. Ford hopes a panel of insurers it has set up will reduce premiums by between 25 per cent and 30 per cent - about Pounds 250 a year. Ford's initiatives are against the backdrop of one of the sharpest sales declines in the industry's history. Last year they were down more than 30 per cent from the record 2.3m units achieved in 1989. For the moment Ford is sticking to its forecast that sales will recover in the second half to reach 1.65m. This will depend on August's sales achieving Ford's current forecast of 400,000 - up from 360,000 last year. Even then, they will have to pick up sharply, to an annualised rate of 1.74m throughout the rest of this year for even the 1.65m to be achieved. Ford is locked in a neck-and-neck struggle with Vauxhall for leadership of the UK new-car market. Statistics due tomorrow will show whether Vauxhall became the top selling UK brand in May for the first time. Britain is poised to benefit from a 'sustained but fairly slow recovery', Sir Michael Angus, the newly-elected president of the Confederation of British Industry, said last night, Michael Cassell writes. Sir Michael said in Birmingham that there were grounds for cautious optimism about economic revival, although he warned that inflation was not yet defeated and dismissed suggestions that the government should help kick-start the economy.

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Cash crisis at charity may hit trust hospital ONE OF the new self-governing trust hospitals faces financial loss if attempts this week to rescue the charity Action and Research into Multiple Sclerosis (Arms) fail. The charity's national research centre is based at the Central Middlesex hospital, west London, which became a trust last year. Arms's 13 full and part-time research centre staff are included on the Central Middlesex payroll, with the charity then reimbursing the hospital. Central Middlesex managers estimate that they are owed about Pounds 500,000 by Arms, which is trying to secure its financial base. The collapse of Arms would leave several hundred long-term patients of the research centre without an alternative source of treatment. 'There is a paramount need for bridging finance so that the Arms clinical work can continue for a reasonable period while the future needs of patients are assessed,' said Mr Andy Black, Central Middlesex chief executive. 'We can't just put a sign up saying that the unit is closed.' Mr John Simkins, chief executive of Arms, said attempts were still being made to secure the charity's financial position. It is likely to become clear later this week whether Arms, which has funded research into multiple sclerosis and has operated therapy centres since 1974, will survive. Its regional therapy centres are managed as subsidiaries and would be likely to continue even if the national charity did not. The pressures behind Arms's financial difficulties mirror those of many charities in a climate of recession and increasing competition for funds. Arms's voluntary workers and staff blame the charity's difficulties on three main factors. They say that: The recession, which has proved longer and deeper than many charity fund-raising managers expected, is reducing contributions. 'Telethons' and other big national appeals are distorting patterns of giving and making it more difficult for smaller charities to maintain their share of donations. Charities face growing competition for funds from self-governing hospitals, universities and other public institutions. Arms has this year been running a Football Against MS promotion, with Nationwide Anglia Building Society as its leading sponsor. Nationwide contributed Pounds 300,000 to the project - Pounds 150,000 as a donation and the other half as a guaranteed minimum payment in advance of local fund-raising events staged by staff in the society's branches. Nationwide has now told its staff that any continuing fund-raising activity should be in aid of multiple sclerosis support generally, and it is no longer receiving donations to Arms. The society said: 'We felt we had no real option other than to suspend all direct fund-raising activities.'</p>

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / Japan's rich raise earnings: Tax report shows wealthiest are recovering from recession A rise last year in the number of Japan's top income tax payers suggests that the rich may be starting to recover from the ravages of recession. According to the National Tax Administration Agency, 128,000 people paid more than Y10m (Pounds 65,700) in tax in 1993, some 3,000 more than in the previous year, when the total fell for the first time, from 175,000 in 1991. The figure may not be a completely accurate guide to wealth, given the highly publicised tax evasion cases to have gone through the courts recently, like that of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former political godfather of the Liberal Democratic party. But it does at least indicate that the richest of those who do care to declare their revenues earned more in 1993. Japan's top taxpayer is Mr Yasuo Takei, chairman of the Takefuji consumer finance group, a classic rags-to-riches entrepreneur, who paid Y4.3bn in personal taxes last year. Much of that was in capital gains from selling shares in his company, to build up a core shareholding ahead of a listing, Mr Takei explained yesterday. Mr Takei, 64, started his career working in pachinko parlours and selling vegetables in the streets, before founding Takefuji in 1968. The top 10 include a selection of self-made business people and their relatives, including a race-horse breeder, a computer game producer and the owner of a video rentals company. Senior executives of Japan's industrial establishment held relatively modest rankings, such as Mr Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Japan's largest car maker, who came in a mere 92nd, with a Y330m tax bill. The annual list is a rare guide to the identity of Japan's rich, who are otherwise hard to spot given that only gangsters and the few property tycoons left feel it socially acceptable to flaunt wealth. A record 102 MPs are to be found among the Y10m-plus taxpayers, topped by Mr Yasu Kano, a member of the opposition LDP, with a Y579m tax bill. Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the government's backroom power broker, put in a surprise appearance as Japan's seventh most taxed politician, but a long way down the overall national rankings. He paid Y48.6m in 1993, three times as much as the previous year, much of it on the Y105m royalties on his new book. Blueprint for Building a New Japan, which sets out Mr Ozawa's argument for reforming the political system and taking a more prominent role in international affairs, has sold 700,000 copies since publication last May. It just goes to show, Mr Ozawa commented yesterday, that people have high hopes for reform.</p>

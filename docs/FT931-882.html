			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Redundancy costs hit Hepworth HEPWORTH, the building materials and home products company, yesterday announced a fall in profits triggered by redundancy costs and lower UK sales. But Mr John Carter, chief executive, said most of the company's UK markets seemed to have stabilised. 'Since December we've stopped receiving bad news in the UK. After four and a half years, that's a relief,' he said. Pre-tax profits fell 36 per cent from Pounds 70m to Pounds 44.8m in the year to December 31. At the interim stage, profits were 7 per cent lower at Pounds 32.8m. Shareholders were warned then that full year figures would be worse and yesterday's results were expected. The shares fell 2p to 320p. About one third of the profits fall was due to exceptional costs of Pounds 9.2m to cover redundancies and related payments. About 500 staff in the UK and 350 in France were made redundant, reducing group numbers to nearly 8,000. Turnover fell 5.1 per cent to Pounds 627.5m. Sales to UK customers fell most sharply, dropping some Pounds 40m to Pounds 303.7m. But sales to continental European countries increased 11 per cent to Pounds 278.5m. Saunier Duval, the group's French-based gas boiler maker, was the best performer. Operating profits increased 14 per cent to Pounds 26.2m following strong sales in France and Spain. The building products division, which includes clay pipes and plastic plumbing, continued to suffer from the UK recession and saw operating profits fall Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 18.7m. Hepworth Refractories, which makes heat resistant refractory products for furnaces and kilns, reported operating profits sharply lower at Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 18.2m). Mr Carter said the fall was due to a decline in sales outside Europe and that orders improved in the final quarter. Among other divisions, operating profits from home products fell from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds 10.6m while minerals and chemicals fell by Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 9.5m. Net borrowings continued to fall - from Pounds 57.5m to Pounds 29.8m - because of strong cash flow and lower capital expenditure in some divisions. Gearing fell from 33 per cent to 15 per cent or, treating a convertible capital bond as debt, from 215 per cent to 135 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 24.1p to 15.6p. Directors recommended a maintained final dividend of 9.35p to make an unchanged total of 14.85p. After paying the dividend, there was a retained profit for the year of Pounds 500,000, against Pounds 17.8m. See Lex</p>

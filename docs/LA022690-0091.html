			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> NEWPORT TO HOUSE LAGUNA PRISONERS  </P> <P> In what police say is an unusual arrangement that will allow Laguna Beach  officers to stay closer to home while their station at City Hall is being  remodeled, people arrested in Laguna Beach during the next year will be housed  in Newport Beach Jail.  </P> <P> The agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Newport Beach City  Council, means Laguna police will not be pulled off their beats to drive  prisoners to Orange County Jail in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> The arrangement, which will cost Laguna Beach $65 a day for each prisoner, will  likely add two inmates a day to Newport Beach Jail, Laguna Beach Police Chief  Neil Purcell said.  </P> <P> To keep the transportation of prisoners to a minimum, Purcell said, Laguna  Beach will begin a "very vigorous cite and release program" which will involve  releasing prisoners when possible rather than jailing them. For example, a  drunk driver would probably be released to a friend who could safely drive him  or her home instead of being jailed, he said.  </P> <P> Juveniles will be released to parents or guardians when possible or be taken to  Juvenile Hall in the event of a serious crime, Purcell said.  </P> <P> "We just do not have any choice right now," Purcell said. "The ones we send to  Newport are the ones where we have no other choice than to incarcerate them."  </P> <P> Lt. Tim Newman, spokesman for the Newport Beach Police Department, said the new  procedure will not pose a hardship for Newport, which has 29 bunks for male  prisoners who are held until bail is posted or until their arraignment date.  Newport shares resources such as dogs and helicopters with other cities, he  said, and sharing jail cells is just another way for cities to work together.  </P> <P> "That's just kind of the spirit of cooperation, the right thing to do," Newman  said.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach Jail, which has a detox cell and eight bunks, is considered a  24-hour temporary holding facility, he said. Two other cells with four bunks  each were abandoned to make room for property and evidence because of crowded  conditions in the department, Purcell said. The remodeling will not provide  more jail cells but will improve conditions, he said. LESLIE EARNEST  </P></p>

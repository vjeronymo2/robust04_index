			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / International Company News: Nokia to sell aluminium division Nokia, the world's second biggest maker of mobile telephones, has agreed to sell Nokia Aluminium as part of a plan to focus the Finnish group on its fast-growing telecommunications operations. The unit, with annual sales of about FM300m (Dollars 62.8m), is to be bought for FM130m by a consortium of Morgan Stanley Capital Partners (a division of Morgan Stanley of the US), CapMan Capital Management (a Finnish investment group) and the management of Nokia Aluminium. The deal is one of the last steps in the three-year transformation of Nokia. The company has evolved from a widely-spread and troubled industrial conglomerate into a dynamic telecoms group showing strong sales and profits growth, particularly in its mobile telephone division. Nokia is Europe's leading manufacturer of mobile telephones and second only to Motorola of the US in world markets. In the first eight months of the year, group profits rose five-fold to FM2.9bn, with sales up an underlying 40 per cent to FM18.2bn. A driving force was a 64 per cent increase in mobile telephone sales to FM5bn. The sale of Nokia Aluminium, which makes products such as lighting tracks and cable channels, follows Nokia's recent disposal of its picture-tube factory in Germany to Matsushita Electronics of Japan, and the FM1.4bn sale of the energy supply unit to the Finnish power group Pohjolan Voima. It is also floating off most of its 80 per cent stake in Nokia Tyres. When these moves are complete, Nokia will consist of four core divisions: telecommunications, supplying systems and equipment for telecom networks; mobile telephones; consumer electronics; and cables and machinery. Nokia Aluminium was part of the cables and machinery division, now weighted towards the telecommunications industry. Mr Tapio Hintikka, head of the cables and machinery division, said the sale of Nokia Aluminium meant the divestment plan was fulfilled 'at least for the time being'. The main problem for Nokia is its consumer electronics division, which has lost money in recent years. However, Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chief executive, has said the division will soon return to profit.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT PROPOSAL FOR LAGUNA KNOLL  </P> <P> The highest point in Laguna Beach is being planned to be bulldozed, permanently  destroying the last remaining 360-degree vista where Lagunans can enjoy ocean  and Saddleback Valley views. Of course, it is often said that you cannot stop  "progress" and that a developer has the right to develop his private property.  </P> <P> But this property is public property with the Laguna Beach Unified School  District as its steward. The district is planning to sell its school site on  Alta Laguna Boulevard and has devised a plan where, according to the  environmental impact report, "every biological feature on the knoll will be  destroyed."  </P> <P> What kind of environmental lessons should our children learn from the  district's actions? Their plans calls for 270,000 cubic yards of grading,  destroying the knoll; they certainly do not respect the land. The district is  also a big promoter of the Laguna Laurel project with the building of 3,200  houses in Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> Most Lagunans are concerned about protecting our quality of life and our open  space, especially Laguna Canyon. Most Lagunans are concerned about excessive  grading and the increasing traffic and congestion problems. I would like to see  the school district remain independent but not at the cost of raping the  environment and developing Laguna Canyon.  </P> <P> We all must work to preserve Laguna Canyon, save the knoll, and stop the  district from promoting excessive grading and increased development. Our  children deserve better lessons.  </P> <P> GENE FELDER  </P> <P> Laguna Beach  </P></p>

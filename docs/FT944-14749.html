			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Leading Article: Mr Clarke's Budget task Mr Kenneth Clarke will be discussing the European Union's fiscal position in Italy today, not the UK Budget. Treasury ministers and advisers will not plot the Budget strategy in Dorneywood without him, but some would say there was little need for them to meet at all. In the spirit of his new precept that 'sound economics is good politics', Mr Clarke has already ruled out significant tax cuts for this year, while the good performance of the economy this year rules out any further tax increases. But there is more to a 'sound' Budget, especially a unified one, than the fall or rise of headline tax rates. In his second Budget speech, the chancellor should set himself the task of explaining and illustrating this, not merely to the electorate, but to his party. The chancellor believes that the government can rebuild its popularity only on the basis of a revived reputation for economic competence. In his first Budget, that meant a willingness to imitate his predecessor's last Budget, by raising taxes to plug the hole in the public finances. There is still plenty of red ink on the public sector accounts. But a series of pleasant economic surprises means that the gap between the politically popular and the economically prudent is a good deal narrower than it was last November. Position reversed According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the public sector borrowing requirement for 1994-95 is likely to be under Pounds 32bn, some Pounds 6bn lower than the prediction in last year's Budget. The reasons can be found in what has happened to the components of nominal GDP growth, which is itself likely to come out only slightly lower than the 6.5 per cent expected a year ago. Last November, the Treasury expected that only 2.5 percentage points would represent real growth in GDP, with the remainder taken up by inflation. In the event, the position of the two has been reversed: inflation for fiscal year 1994-95 may be only 2.5 per cent, while real GDP growth could well exceed 3.5 per cent. The chancellor will find it easy to sound tough on public spending, announcing a reduction in the overall level for the second consecutive year. Last year's nominal spending targets have been undershot, without any reduction in the volume of public services. Indeed, the IFS has calculated that if the chancellor were to adhere to last year's planned real reduction in spending for next year, the revised nominal control total for 1995-96 unveiled in five weeks could be Pounds 5bn less than previously planned. Shrink faster This year at least, Mr Clarke should also be able to silence those in his party calling for tax cuts. A higher rate of economic growth in 1994 means that the economy will return to its trend level of output somewhat earlier than previously thought. Accordingly, public borrowing ought to shrink faster than planned over the coming years, in order to keep demand in check. Even the more pessimistic analysts, however, envisage the PSBR falling to very low levels - perhaps 1 - 2 per cent of GDP - by 1997. In that context, the pressure for voter-friendly tax cuts can be expected to be far greater next year. Mr Clarke is unlikely to extinguish those hopes in his coming speech. But the message of the 1994 Budget should be somewhat deeper. The chancellor should seek to establish a micro-economic counterpart to the framework for stable macro-economic policy which has been put in place since sterling's exit from the ERM. That means clearly laying out, not merely the level of tax and spending for the years ahead, but his plans for their structure as well. After the many new measures imposed in the last three Budgets, Mr Clarke should hold off dramatic change, and certainly he should lose his penchant for gimmickry. An end to 'boom and bust', for monetary policy, means early interest rate increases and transparent dealings between central bank governor and chancellor. Similarly, on the fiscal side, it means prior warning that the tax cuts, should they prove feasible, will be aimed at improving, first, the treatment of savings and investment and, second, the relationship between the tax and benefit systems. Mr Clarke should become a reformer. That would be sound economics, indeed.</p>

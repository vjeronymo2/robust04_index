			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Arts: Bach cantatas - Music On so exquisite a summer's evening as Monday's it was all the odder to enter the Queen Elizabeth Hall and submit oneself to a selection of Bach cantatas, music that is manifestly intended for liturgical use. Yet there was nothing gloomy and fusty about these period-style performances by the Orchestra and Choir of the Age of Enlightenment, under Ivan Fischer. To the contrary, everything was light and air and colour - colourful drama, indeed, to quote the title of the six-concert series devised by Sir William Glock, of which this was the first (the second was last night). Each programme affords two or three of the vastly numerous (nearly 300) and varied cantatas along with a selection from the motets, concerti and orchestral suites (there are two other conductors involved, Rene Jacobs for the second pair of concerts, Barthold Kuijken for the third). Monday's programme attracted a virtually full house, as 'authentic' baroque performance usually does these days, whatever the weather. The first of our three cantatas, No. 110, 'Unser Mund sei voll Lachens', written for Christmas Day 1725, was an apt and festive opening chorus, despatched with bright irresistible crispness and panache. Cantata No. 104, 'Du Hirte Israel, Hore' (1724) followed, bringing the mellow oboes d'amore to the fore as well as tenor and bass vocal soloists. The latter, Michael George, gave an affecting account of his lilting pastoral aria, whose instrumental bass parts Fischer brought out with a discreet complementary pungency. The double 12-part choir (with the merest continuo accompaniment) produced a poised, compact but dramatically expressive polyphony in the short motet, 'Komm, Jesu, Komm]' (BWV 229). The fourth Brandenburg Concerto was done without conductor and with sprightly soloists: recorder players Catherine Latham and Anthony Robson, violinist Elizabeth Wallfisch (leader of the OAE), who executed the fast decorative scales of the first movement in a fine spray of virtuosity. After the interval we were treated to the plaintive sombre funerary colours of the motet 'O Jesu Christ, Mein's Lebens Licht' (BWV 118) and the graphic St. Michael's Day cantata No. 130, 'Herr Gott, dich loben alle wir' (1724). The opening choral-instrumental movement was rendered with keen, brilliant pointing of rhythm; tenor Christoph Pregardien's gigue-like duet with Lisa Beznosiuk's flute was charming. Bach cantatas are wonderful things: full of the bracing inventiveness of his Passions, without their longueurs, and never two the same. My appetite is whetted for the rest of these splendidly conceived concerts.</p>

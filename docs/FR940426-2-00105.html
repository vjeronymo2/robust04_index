			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Under section 6(c), the SEC may exempt any series of transactions from any provisions of the Act or rule thereunder if and to the extent such exemption is ``necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions'' of the Act. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) as well as section 17(b) because the relief is requested to exempt more than one transaction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Section 2(a)(3)(C) defines an ``affiliated person'' as ``any persons directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such other person.'' In addition, under section 2(a)(3)(E) the investment adviser to an investment company is an ``affiliated person'' of such company. The Fund, the New Europe Fund, and CIEMF may be deemed to be under common control because the Manager is the investment adviser to each of them. Accordingly, the New Europe Fund may be affiliated with the Fund, and section 17(a) may prohibit the New Europe Fund from selling its securities to the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Applicants contend that the proposed transaction meets the standards for relief under sections 6(c) and 17(b). Applicants believe that the terms of the transactions between the Fund and the New Europe Fund are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching. The Fund will purchase A Shares and B Shares of the New Europe Fund at the same purchase price and on the same basis as all other purchasers of such shares. Applicants further believe that the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the Fund. By purchasing securities in the New Europe Fund, the Fund can invest in the emerging markets of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics while benefiting from the economies and diversification provided by pooled investments. In addition, applicants believe that the proposed transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the Act because the Fund and its shareholders are not disadvantaged by the self-dealing or overreaching of any affiliated person. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Section 17(d) prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company from affecting any transaction in which the company is a joint participant in contravention of SEC rules. Rule 17d&hyph;1 prohibits an affiliated person of any registered investment company, acting as principal, from participating in or affecting any transaction in a ``joint enterprise or other joint arrangement'' in which the company is a participant, without prior SEC approval. The Fund and CIEMF's investment in shares of the New Europe Fund may constitute a joint enterprise or other joint arrangement within the meaning of rule 17d&hyph;1. Applicants believe that the proposed transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act. Applicants assert that the Fund's highly autonomous board has approved the Fund's investment in the New Europe Fund after considering all relevant factors and concluding that the Fund would not be disadvantaged by the proposed transaction. Moreover, investing in the New Europe Fund will enable the Fund to diversify its investments in the emerging securities markets of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet republics at a lower cost than would be possible if it were to pursue such investments directly. In addition, the Fund, CIEMF, and all other investors in the New Europe Fund will participate in the investment on equal terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants agree that any order granting an exemption will be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The manager will waive its management fee (which includes administrative fees) with respect to the Fund's net assets represented by the Fund's proposed investment in the New Europe Fund. To effectuate this waiver, Fund assets represented by the New Europe Fund securities purchased by the Fund under the proposed investment will be excluded from the net assets of the Fund in the calculation of the Manager's fee. As such waiver relates to the Manager's fee schedule, any Fund assets invested in the New Europe Fund will be excluded from the Fund's assets before any fee calculation is made; thus, the Fund's aggregate net assets would be adjusted by the amount invested in the New Europe Fund prior to determining the fee based on the Manager's fee schedule (the amount waived pursuant to this procedure shall be defined as the ``Reduction Amount'' for purposes of Condition 4,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Any fees payable by the Fund to the Manager so excluded in connection with the proposed transaction will be excluded for all time, and will not be subject to recoupment by the Manager or by any other investment adviser at any other time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Fund's proposed investment in the shares of the New Europe Fund will be limited to 21/2% of the Fund's total assets, taken at the time of the Fund's subscription. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If the Manager waives any portion of its fees or bears any portion of its expenses in respect of the Fund (an ``Expense Waiver''), the adjusted fees for the Fund (gross fees minus Expense Waiver) will be calculated without reference to the Reduction Amount. Adjusted fees then will be reduced by the Reduction Amount. If the Reduction Amount exceeds adjusted fees, the Manager will reimburse the Fund in an amount equal to such excess. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Fund's shares of the New Europe Fund will be voted by an independent director designated to act in such capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. All shareholders of the New Europe Fund that are affiliated with The Capital Group, including CIEMF, will vote their shares in proportion to the vote of all other shareholders of the New Europe Fund. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Margaret H.

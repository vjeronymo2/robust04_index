			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ghassan al-Khatib, member of the </F> Palestinian delegation to the Middle East peace talks and  professor at Bi'r Zayt University, in Jerusalem, by Fayiz  al-Miliji in Cairo; date not given; from the "Dialogue From  Afar" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Al-Miliji] Good morning Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib.  We welcome you to our talk show.    [Al-Khatib] Good morning and thank you.    [Al-Miliji] To start with, could you fill us in on the  reactions to the signing of the agreement on starting to  implement autonomy in Gaza and Jericho?    [Al-Khatib] The reaction is the opposite of what was  expected. The Palestinian people in the occupied territories  received the signing of this agreement and the celebrations that  went with it lukewarmly and cautiously, quite opposite to their  reception of the Oslo agreement and the celebrations following  its signing in Washington. The reason is that the repeated  Israeli stalling in implementing the agreements has created  indifference among the Palestinian people. Because of the  Israeli stalling the Palestinians have lost faith that such  agreements will actually be implemented. The Palestinian man in  the street is saying that he will believe these things only  after they are implemented, because he has seen many things  signed and heard about many agreements. None of these ever  changed the course of his practical life. Therefore, the  reaction to, or judgement of this agreement by the Palestinians  here has been put on hold until after the Palestinian people see  the actual implementation or effects of this agreement on their  lives. Then, the whole situation will be different.    [Al-Miliji] The agreement that was signed the day before  yesterday still has some pending matters that have not been  agreed upon. Do you think the Palestinian people are worried  about these points?    [Al-Khatib] Frankly speaking, the Palestinian people are  worried about a lot of things. First, they are worried because  there are some matters that have been put off. Our people have  gone through some difficult times and were promised certain  changes that never happened.    [Al-Miliji] Although you have always shown concern for the  Palestinian people, do you not see any reasons for optimism now,  especially since the Palestinian and Israeli sides have adopted  the slogan "Let there be peace"?    [Al-Khatib] Yes. There are certain things that should make  the Palestinians optimistic. But this optimism is hedged with  caution and apprehension. For example, the possibility of  allowing the Palestinian leadership, police, and the army--that  is the Palestinian Liberation Army--to enter the Gaza Strip and  Jericho are great sources of hope and optimism for the  Palestinian masses. In addition, the possibility of releasing  or the majority of the Palestinian detainees, if not all of  them, is also a source of hope and optimism for the Palestinian  people. However, so far the Palestinian people have not seen  any practical results despite the large number of agreements and  hopes, so they have mixed feelings of optimism, expectation, and  anticipation to see what the practical changes will be. After  that, the government can be established.    [Al-Miliji] Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib, today is the third day  since the agreement was signed. In other words, the it has not  been very long. Now, everyone is waiting for the Israeli forces  to withdraw from Gaza and Jericho and the Palestinian police to  enter. Does this not provide grounds for optimism rather than  concern and tension?    [Al-Khatib] Yes, but you have to remember that there have  been agreements in the past and Israel stalled on implementing  them. It also stalled on the negotiations over implementation.  It created obstacles everywhere, thus hindering the practical  implementation of these agreements. Various dates were agreed  upon that were not respected by Israel, who always claimed that  deadlines were not sacred. Thus, our people are afraid to be  overly optimistic in order to avoid disappointment like after  the Madrid conference and the signing of the Oslo agreement,  etc. However, there is anticipation and hope. After the  Palestinian leadership and police enter the territory, after  some changes start taking place, and as soon as the Israeli  withdrawal starts, I expect the mood of the Palestinian people  to shift.    [Al-Miliji] Mr. al-Khatib, have the Israeli forces started  withdrawing from Gaza and Jericho?    [Al-Khatib] The Israeli forces have vacated a few locations  in Gaza City, or the Gaza Strip. This has left a positive  impression with the Palestinian people. The people understand  clearly that things take time and that complications may crop  up. Therefore, they are waiting to see how the agreement will  be implemented. They will take their stands based to that.    [Al-Miliji] In your capacity as a leading figure of the  Palestinian delegation to the peace talks, could you tell us  when the Palestinian police will enter?    [Al-Khatib] A group of 17 high-ranking Palestinian officers  have already entered the Gaza Strip at Rafah crossing. They  have begun a series of meetings with ranking Israeli army and  police officers to put the final touches on the process of  handing over the buildings and security responsibilities to the  Palestinian police. After these meetings, this group will submit  recommendations on the necessary time period for handing over  responsibilities. Based on their recommendations, the date for  the Palestinian police's entry will be set.    [Al-Miliji] Our last question is: How are the Palestinian  people preparing themselves to receive Palestinian President  Yasir 'Arafat when he enters the occupied territories for the  first time since Palestinian autonomy began?    [Al-Khatib] Actually, President 'Arafat is greatly respected  and supported in the occupied territories. I notice that the  Palestinian people are anxiously awaiting the return of the  Palestinian leadership headed by brother Yasir 'Arafat,  especially since the Palestinian people are expecting his return  to spread a sense of security and stability after the difficult  conditions we have gone through. Of course, when brother  Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] returns he will be accompanied by a  large number of Palestinian people, be they leaders or  otherwise, who are living abroad. The people here are awaiting  this very anxiously.    Therefore, I believe that the return of the Palestinian  leadership will soon have a positive effect on the mood of the  Palestinian people in the occupied territories.    [Al-Miliji] At the end of this dialogue, we thank our guest  Mr. Ghassan al-Khatib, member of the Palestinian delegation to  the peace talks and professor at Bi'r Zayt University, who spoke  to us from Jerusalem. Thank you Mr. Ghassan.    [Al-Khatib] Thank you.</p>

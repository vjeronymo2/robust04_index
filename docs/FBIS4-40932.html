			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NG" report under the "Repercussion" rubric: "Yeltsin's </F> Edict Excites Emotions. `Memorial' and Russian Union of  Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Make Statements"]    [Text] In its statement, the "Memorial" human rights  center believes that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's signing  of an edict "On Urgent Measures to Protect the Population From  Banditry and Other Forms of Organized Crime" puts in serious  doubt the possibility of building a law-governed state in Russia.    "Facing a serious threat to society and the state emanating  from the rising tide of crime, the president and the executive  branch have decided to sacrifice the principles of Law and  Democracy," the document underlines. "At the same time, the  Constitution, to whose letter and spirit the authorities only  recently vowed to be true, is being violated in the crudest way.  Also being ignored are international treaties and federal laws,  in particular the Russian Federation Criminal Process Code. The  authors of the edict have acknowledged their impotence to cope  with crime within the limits of the law. The authorities in  every country are tempted to achieve stability and order by  using dictatorial and law-contravening methods. We do know from  history that totalitarian regimes -- Soviet Russia, fascist  Italy -- coped with crime. But at what price?"    In the meantime, the Russian Union of Industrialists and  Entrepreneurs [RUIE] states that "in its scale, cynicism, and  impunity the terror thrust on society by criminal groups is  gradually turning from an essentially criminal factor into a  factor containing a real threat to the social foundations and  state security.    "There should be a clear realization of the fact that the  situation is already slipping out of control; hence it calls for  extraordinary measures. Otherwise, there will be a criminal  degradation of society. The should be not so much good  intentions as energetic, uncompromising actions to eradicate  crime that has gotten out of control."    The RUIE statement underscores that industrialists and  entrepreneurs of Russia are prepared to support any resolute  steps by the president, the Federal Assembly, and the government  to impose law and order and to provide guarantees of personal  security for the people of Russia.</p>

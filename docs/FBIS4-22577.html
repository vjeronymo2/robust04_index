			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report No. 13 (63) of 31 March: Interview with </F> Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Yevgeniy Saburov by Yuriy Shein,  date and place not given]    [Text] "THE CRIMEA CONFRONTS RATHER SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT  THERE IS NO CRIMEAN PROBLEM AS SUCH," SAYS VICE PREMIER YEVGENIY  SABUROV    A 48-year old prominent Russian economist YEVGENIY SABUROV  who heads the governmental Information and Social Technologies  Center was invited by the President of the Republic of Crimea  Yuriy Meshkov to take the post of the government's vice premier.  (As it is known, according to the Crimean Constitution, the  president heads the Cabinet). Saburov, who was born in the  Crimean city of Yalta, accepted the invitation and  parliamentarians confirmed him on this post at the last session  of the republic's Supreme Soviet. Our Interfax correspondent  Yuriy Shein speaks with Yevgeniy Saburov who has recently  visited the peninsular [as received] about the Crimea's  problems, prospects of its development, and mutual relations  between Kiev and Moscow.    [Shein] What are your impressions concerning the visit to  the  Crimea?    [Saburov] In the course of my trip I had to closely  associate  with the Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov and to see what he has  been done, to analyze the measures proposed to the republic by  different experts including representatives of the previous  composition of Crimea's Cabinet of Ministers and by different  commercial structures, governmental departments, and by  initiative groups and parties.    A total of 16 programs have been put forward for  consideration. As a matter of fact, the greater part of these  programs lacks technological aspects, they have no logical  conclusion and are of a purely conceptual nature though they  present a certain interest. The proposed programs suffer from  one major shortage -- it is impossible to fulfil them. These  are not programs but just good intentions and concepts which  have not been calculated from the economic point of view.  However, one can consider them and "improve" them to the level  of draft decrees. The Moscow experts, and, in particular,  experts from the Moscow State University, have done at least one  fourth of this work.    [Shein] What economic problems enjoyed priority during your  trip?    [Saburov] First of all, it was necessary to make it clear  what role plays Crimea's Cabinet of Ministers and what is the  situation with the management in the economy. [sentence as  received] The republic's previous leadership was not ready for  democracy; nobody has ever thought that the existing power  bodies can loose [as received] during the presidential  elections. The reaction of certain circles in Simferopol with  respect to Meshkov's victory was just a hysterical one. As a  result of Meshkov's unexpected victory they have entirely  withdrawn despite the need to organize the spring sowing  campaign, to get ready for the summer vacation period, and  presence of numerous everyday problems because this period is  the decisive one for the rest of the year.    Consequently, due to the offense, because the people have  voted not in such a way as the previous leaders would have  preferred, they were ready to leave the Crimeans literally in  hunger and in cold. This is the supreme level of political  tactlessness. However, this line of behavior is peculiar only  to the representatives of the supreme echelons of power.    The people from the next link of the management chain  remained absolutely calm regarding the results of the elections.  In general, they did not demonstrate their political likings  but honestly fulfilled their duties. Though there were some  exceptions, it, for example, concerns Crimea's Agriculture  Minister Yegudin. [as received] He reported both in Kiev and  Simferopol that the situation with fertilizers on the peninsular  is rather good. However, it appeared that the situation in this  field is just catastrophic. It seems that by his statements  Yegudin wanted to discredit Crimea's new government. I'd like  to repeat that, as a rule, the sabotage was peculiar only to the  supreme echelons of power.    [Shein] However, these people still hoped to continue their  work in the new composition of the government, didn't they    [Saburov] It was quite clear that they would not enter the  new Cabinet -- some of them were incompetent, some of them were  "stained" because the level of corruption in the Crimean  Government was rather high. It's interesting to note that there  were attempts "to fail" Meshkov even after these elections; the  statement stating that Meshkov would stay at power only for four  months which was voiced by the Ukrainian Ambassador to Russia  V.Kryzhanovskiy [name as received] testifies to this fact. An  artificially created shortage of bread and other goods in Crimea  would probably be one of the reasons of his dismissal. However,  I think that these actions have not been planned beforehand, the  question primarily concerns a spontaneous hysterical reaction.    [Shein] What is the reaction with respect to Meshkov's  victory in the regions?    [Saburov] I have visited Kerch, Bakhchisaray, the Simferopol  region, the peninsular's southern coast and met with leaders of  several farms and enterprises. I must say that they demonstrate  a positive reaction with respect to the recent events. If  earlier under the pressure of the official propaganda the  majority of the leaders of this level perceived Meshkov as an  extremist then now, when they saw his concrete moves and actions  (I believe that one of them is my invitation to the post in the  Crimean government), they have radically changed their opinion.  It became clear that the question concerns a normal life,  raising of the people's well-being, and, first of all, the need  to abolish several Ukrainian decrees regarding the economic  activity in the Crimea. As a result, Meshkov's rating started  to grow.    The world practice demonstrates that the popularity of a new  president falls immediately after his elections, it is a natural  phenomenon. We watch quite an adverse situation in the Crimea  -- Meshkov's rating has grown even in the circles which looked  at him with some fear. It is very important because this knocks  out the ground from under those who thought that the president  would quickly "fail," that he came to power thanks to populist  slogans. Now the people understand that Meshkov is a serious  politician who demonstrates a well balanced approach to  different problems and they agree to work with him. That's why  there is a kind of perplexity among his opponents now.    [Shein] What is the position of the Crimean Tatars?    [Saburov] This is a serious problem. Kiev persuaded the  Crimean Tatars that Yuriy Meshkov is a Russian nationalist who  would not take them into account. A great part of the Tatars  gave their backing to him, however, these were inactive layers  of the population who are not interested in political activity.  These people are not noticeable on the public arena.    For their part, the most politicized layers of the Tatars  counted on Kiev. Now it is clear that Crimea's new leadership  has no anti- Tatar moods and understands the tragedy of these  people (in 1994 all Crimean Tatars were deported to Siberia and  Middle Asia -- Interfax). Meshkov managed to persuade the  Tatars in his deep interest in peace and stability on the  peninsular and his sympathy towards them. Of course, there is  still no special kindness but there is no sharp confrontation  either.    However, after the Tatars' attitude towards the new Crimean  leadership started to improve it seems that certain political  circles outside the Crimea started to demonstrate that they do  not need stability and peace on the peninsular. Of course, if  the Crimean-Tatar people happily live in the Crimea then there  will be no need in noisy TV shows, loud statements, and stormy  meetings in the defense of the "oppressed" Crimean Tatars, that  is those factors thanks to which the functionaries try to earn  their political capital. Russia must seriously think over this  question -- Kiev has allocated material aid to this deported  people and where is Moscow?    [Shein] What is your opinion concerning the relations  between Simferopol and Kiev?    [Saburov] The situation is not quite clear. Kiev has not  demonstrated any objections regarding my candidacy. In  accordance with the developed scheme I signed a statement with a  request to grant the Ukrainian citizenship to me; the major  obstacle was removed by this move. However, there is still no  answer to my request. I believe that leaders in Kiev, both the  present ones and those who will come to power, must be  interested in the Crimea's well-being and in its relations with  the Russian Federation.    The existing discrimination of the Crimea cannot last for  ever, the politicians must understand this. The will of the  people is an exclusively serious thing. Objectively, the  appointment of a professional economist to the high post in this  important for Ukraine region is a positive factor.    However, there are certain circles in Kiev who stake on the  Crimean problem during the pre-election campaign. These people  deem it important to declare about their Ukrainian patriotism,  that's why they artificially aggravate the situation on the  peninsular. They do not occupy high posts but they represent  rather a garish group interested in stirring different kinds of  conflicts. I hope that the Ukrainian president has enough  wisdom not to go after these "functionaries." There are no such  functionaries in the Crimea. It maintains a provincial calm  atmosphere and is concerned over the solution of social issues.    [Shein] What can you say about the industrial sector of the  republic?    [Saburov] The presence of a great number of highly skilled  workers is peculiar for the Crimea. In my opinion, there is no  such a region from this point of view on the whole territory of  the former Soviet Union, including the Baltic states. Who can  boast about this in Russia? The Crimea produces tankers for the  countries of the Western Europe. Where in the former USSR the  production of the electronic industry can compete with the  western one? The goods produced in Simferopol can find a good  market.    The predatory Ukrainian laws present the main misfortune.  According to them, we are to pay 50 percent of the currency  earnings to the state on an extremely low rate, not in  accordance with the exchange one. For example, Kiev, say,  offers 9000 Ukrainian coupons for one dollar and its real price  is 36,000 coupons. It is unprofitable for enterprises to work  for export under this situation. It is necessary to remove  these obstacles and to create a normal currency exchange. The  question concerns enterprises of a European level.    As far as Crimea's agriculture is concerned, it has nothing  in common with the ruined Russian collective and state farms.  These are like large factories on the land built on analogy  with the conveyer industry as, for example, the wine producing  factories where there is no farms, this stage is left in the  past. Here the production is organized in accordance with the  modern technology and science, it's the XXth century.    In order to privatize these factories without destroying the  established system it is necessary to handle them in such a way  as the Russian industrial giants -- it is necessary to trade  them but not to dismember. Directors of these enterprises are  well educated people having high intellectual needs.    Unfortunately, all of them are in a difficult economic  situation due to the system of mutual payments between Kiev and  Moscow, existence of customs offices, levying of customs  tariffs, etc. One should take into consideration that the  Crimea's economy is oriented towards the Russian Federation but  not Ukraine. Russia, especially the Russian North, has been  also the major consumer of the Crimean products. The ports on  the peninsular have been built given this factor.    The break in its relations with Russia places the Crimea on  the brink of survival. That's why the demand to restore these  relations are not of a nationalist overtone on the part of the  Crimeans but a natural strive to restore the previous contacts.  The republic has been deprived of the market, it is a real  strangling of this region.    [Shein] The Crimea possessed the best resorts in the USSR...    [Saburov] Now the Crimean budget is arranged in such a way  that the recreation branch with its sanatoriums and rest houses  represents a stone on the republic's neck as it brings no  profits but necessitates appropriations. This is caused by the  existing taxation system and distribution of the expenditures  and revenues part of the Crimean budget. It is necessary to  create a real bank system, to let foreign banks, primarily the  Russian ones, to the Crimea. Let the Turkish, Swiss, and other  banks act in the Crimea, God bless them. Currently Russian  banks actually cannot function in the Crimea, they are being  choked, and the Crimean ones are rather weak yet.    [Shein] What is your opinion about Sevastopol?    [Saburov] Sevastopol is a city with highly professional  branches of industry which has much in common with Kerch and  Simferopol. The greatest naval base which must contribute  something into the Crimea's budget is situated here. I believe  that a good trade and passenger port can also be created here.    There are rather many minor political intrigues of  provincial  scale around the Crimea. Several politicians would like to  withdraw Sevastopol from the composition of the Republic of  Crimea. These people do not look into the far future they  cannot think strategically and imagine whereto this course can  lead. I think that this issue can be removed by means of a  rational explanation of the situation to the citizens. That's  why, I think that the situation in Sevastopol is very difficult.    At the same time I'd like to stress that the policy of a  forcible Ukrainization of the Crimea and stirring of  anti-Russian moods on the peninsular is very dangerous. The  Crimea is a Russian-speaking region. However, the republican  radio stations broadcast their programs in the Ukrainian  language. It has only several minutes a day to broadcast in the  Russian language. This irritates the population greatly. The  TV programs from Moscow are also broadcast not to the full  extent. There is no popular TV channel NTV at all. One can  permanently listen to songs in the Ukrainian language and see  Ukrainian dances. I am not against them but one should observe  certain boundaries. The people are irritated.    [Shein] Do you acknowledge the Crimea's joining Russia?    [Saburov] I do not think that one should raise the issue on  the Crimea's withdrawal from Ukraine. There exists a Ukrainian  law on delegation of authorities between the Crimea and Ukraine.  I cannot say that this is a masterpiece of the juridical  thought, it is compiled extremely illiterately, one article  contradicts to another one. Nevertheless, this decree grants a  substantial independence to the Republic of Crimea and we intend  to use this opportunity. It will be beneficial for Kiev,  Simferopol, and Moscow.    If there are no artificial obstacles and politically  shortsighted moves on the part of Kiev then the Crimea will be  able to play the role of a bridge between Ukraine, Russia, and  other countries of the former Union, it will become a kind of an  account center, something like a free bank republic or something  like this. It is technically feasible under the presence of  good will on the part of all parties.    I'd like to note that against the background of the growing  offensive of anti-democratic forces in several republics of the  former USSR, the Crimea remains a democratic region. Everything  what happens here is done in accordance with the will of the  people. That's why we are extremely surprised by the behavior of  several countries which deem themselves strongholds of democracy  especially when they oppose the will of the Republic of Crimea's  citizens. I'd like to ask these people to seriously treat the  situation and understand that Simferopol makes an interesting  attempt from the international point of view, it is going to  create a normal democratic market economy after the insane  failures of various experimentators.    [Shein] What do you await from Russia?    [Saburov] First of all, we must reach an agreement with  Moscow to restore the economic ties. According to available  information, Russian enterprises are interested in the Crimea's  production and in the development of further contacts. As I  have already said, the proposed programs of economic reforms in  the Crimea appeared to be non-technological ones but there are  highly qualified experts in Moscow who can render their  assistance.    I am very thankful to Leonid Kuchma (Ukraine's former  premier  -- Interfax) for a very interesting phrase which concerns the  entire situation in this region. When certain circles in Kiev  started to declare "Why should we invite someone from the  outside, are there no people among us?" minding my invitation to  the Crimean government, Kuchma said: "Why we can invite advisers  from Canada and the United States who do not know our situation  and we cannot invite a native Crimean?"    I do not want to boast but there are highly professional  people in Russia who understand our situation, who could work  here and not go in for politics. However, I'd like to repeat  once more that economic and intellectual contacts with the  Russians are extremely important and one should not forget that  in the moral plan Moscow is in a great debt in the face of the  Crimean Tatars.    [Shein] What relations do you intend to maintain with the  present Russian government?    [Saburov] I believe that the relations will be businesslike  ones and, of course, not such as now. Naturally, they would  depend upon the post occupied by this or that person. For  example, one acts as the Crimea's representative and another one  as the representative of Moscow, etc. I think that private  relations and the knowledge of who is who would positively  affect our relations. There is no need to get acquainted because  everybody knows each other.    [Shein] Can we speak about the personal composition of the  government now?    [Saburov] The new government will be formed in the near  term.  I want to invite several intelligent professionals from Moscow.  There are many people wishing to come to the Crimea to work, but  I do not think that all of them fit this work. We need those  who really fit this sphere but it is rather difficult to  persuade them to leave Moscow and to live in the Crimea. This  work in not just for one or two days. Many people offer their  services as consultants. I am not quite satisfied with this  either, we can use Moscow's consultations. In Simferopol we  need those who are able to really rule. They will face rather  high demands and the selection will be tough as well.    I hope to find support in the apparatus which already exists  in the Crimea. As I said earlier, it is quite workable.  However, it is impossible to establish contacts with several  people from the supreme echelon. One cannot lean on them as  they can let down at any moment.    According to the Constitution, one cannot appoint the  government in the Crimea, in contrast to Russia, as it is the  prerogative of the Supreme Soviet. That's why its too early to  speak about the composition of the Cabinet, I shall just select  people and the parliament will pass a corresponding decision.    [Shein] How do you work with Meshkov?    [Saburov] We interact with Yuriy Meshkov rather well. In  general, he granted freedom to me, a kind of "a cart blanche" in  several spheres. Everything what concerns the economy is in the  sphere of my competence and he, what is natural, solves the  political issues. However, it is difficult to draw a precise  line here.    I think that the Crimea faces different, rather serious,  problems but there is no problem of the Crimea as such. It has  been invented, it is just a card in the play of politicians who  do not live in the Crimea.    On the whole, the atmosphere is splendid there, I like the  Crimea during the winter-spring season very much. One should go  and rest there, quietness and calm reign there.    [Shein] And now my final question. You have recently  visited Great Britain and France. With whom have you negotiated  there?    [Saburov] We planned this trip long ago and I went there as  the Director of the governmental Information and Social  Technologies Center. However, it is quite clear that after my  appointment to the post of the Crimea's vice premier the tasks  of this trip have changed. As a result, I managed to hold  several meetings which were not scheduled beforehand. In  accordance with the mutual consent of the parties we did not  hold any official contacts on the state level. I think that  there is no need to force this process.    The conversations with representatives of business circles  of  Great Britain and France who are interested in their presence in  the Crimea were very interesting. I shall not speak about  concrete projects, the future will tell... It is important that  we have already reached several agreements. I even had an  impression that there is something more appealing in the Crimea  for the western businessmen than in Russia though this  comparison is tactless -- the scales are quite different.    I am especially thankful to Mr Lionel Stolarue who has done  much to introduce me into the world of the French business.  Earlier I knew him thanks to his splendid economic works, now I  am quite sure that this prominent scientist and state  functionary is an excellent man in the supreme notion of this  word. He is sincerely "ill" with the Crimea's problems. I  congratulate Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk with such an  adviser and wish him to more often listen to the recommendations  of Mr Stolarue.    In general, I'd like to underline that the Republic of  Crimea  intends to widely use the law on independent foreign economic  activity granted to it in accordance with Ukraine's law. The  guarantee of our survival lies in our openness.    When this interview was ready for publication we learned  that  on Monday, March 28, Yevgeniy Saburov flew to Simferopol to his  new place of work.</p>

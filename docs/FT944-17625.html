			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Funds threat to housing associations Commercial lenders to housing associations are becoming increasingly concerned at the very high levels of housing benefit required to help pay tenants' rent, Halifax Building Society said yesterday. Ministers have been considering ways of reducing the growing burden of housing benefit as they seek to contain public spending. Any reduction in payments levels could leave future housing association schemes vulnerable. About Pounds 5.5bn is estimated to have been lent by the private sector to associations which since 1988 have been required to raise a growing proportion of their funds from the private sector. From next April, associations in England will be expected to raise on average 42 per cent of funds for new developments from the private sector. This compares with 21 per cent in 1990-91. Rents since then have risen sharply to generate adequate returns to private sector lenders. Halifax is concerned that any further rise in rents could make developments uncompetitive and inhibit fund raising. Mr Douglas Smallwood, controller for policy and marketing in the society's commercial lending division, told a conference in London yesterday: 'Mixed funded housing associations will not continue to be regarded as a relatively low risk segment of the market when compared with the private rented sector, unless the rents it charges are within market rent levels.' About 60 per cent of all housing association tenants and more than four fifths of new tenants received housing benefit. Rents for new lettings by associations were on average 60 per cent higher than council house relets. 'Unless this problem is addressed in a social housing sector, where there might be an increasing number of providers and, therefore, more of a balance between supply and demand, mixed funded housing associations could be at a disadvantage,' said Mr Smallwood. Halifax has lent about Pounds 1bn of the Pounds 3.9bn estimated to have been lent by banks and building societies to associations since 1988 . A further Pounds 1.6bn has come from institutional investors supporting capital market issues. 'The appetite of the leading retail funders of housing associations is finite,' said Mr Smallwood. Methods used by the government and housing associations to measure the cost of rents and establish benefit levels were inadequate and took no account of the real cost of expenditure on necessities according to a study by Cambridge University for Halifax building society.</p>

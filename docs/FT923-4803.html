			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / BP confirms talks on possible sale of Australian mine stake BRITISH PETROLEUM, the UK oil group, said yesterday it had been negotiating with a potential buyer of its 49 per cent shareholding in the Olympic Dam copper-gold-uranium mine in South Australia for nine to 10 months, but it would take several more weeks before it knew if a deal could be signed. Analysts suggested this might provide an opportunity for Western Mining Corporation, which owns the other 51 per cent of Olympic Dam and is the operator, to trigger its pre-emptive right to buy the BP stake. WMC would have 90 days to exercise its right to buy after being informed by BP of the agreed sale terms. BP said it had also still to discuss the potential sale with Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. This implies the would-be buyer is not Australian, which rules out both WMC and another potential front runner, CRA. While refusing to identify the potential buyer, BP denied press suggestions that it was talking to Cogema (Cie Generale des Matieres Nucleaires), the French uranium group. Analysts suggested yesterday that some Japanese or South African groups might be interested in the stake. Gencor of South Africa said recently it was on the verge of announcing an important offshore investment. 'Could this be it?' asked Mr Rob Weinberg, analyst with Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities. He said Minorco, the overseas investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa, might also be a potential buyer. BP's search for buyers has been complicated not only by WMC's right of first refusal but also because there is a clause in the joint venture agreement which requires BP to finance 100 per cent of the expansion of Olympic Dam up to 120,000 tonnes of copper a year. Capacity at the mine was recently boosted to 65,000 tonnes but any potential buyer would have to agree to take on BP's commitment to spend several hundred million dollars on further expansion. WMC derived a net profit of ADollars 19m from its investment in Olympic Dam in 1991-92, on revenue of ADollars 130.3m (Pounds 46.7m). The mine is valued in the group's books at ADollars 425m.

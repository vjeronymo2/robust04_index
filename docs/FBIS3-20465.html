			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Xiaochuan (3769 0879 1557): "Raising </F> China's Overseas Enterprises Management Standards To Meet  International Competition." The author is affiliated with  MOFERT's Personnel Department]    [Text] China has approved the setting up of more than 4,000  overseas enterprises since reform and opening up. Total Chinese  investments have reached approximately $5 billion. These  enterprises are scattered in more than 100 countries and  regions, and they handle energy, industry, and services and  other businesses. A decade of practice proved that their  existence and development played a positive role in the  development of China's national economy, mainly in spurring on  China's export trade, and in particular, they played an  irreplaceable role in circumventing the host countries' trade  barriers. They also played a role in developing overseas  resources to supplement our country's inadequate resources. Such  overseas resources include financial and technological  resources. But objectively speaking, from the point of the  overseas enterprises' foreign investments and transnational  operations, we have only taken the first steps, and compared to  international standards, we still have a long way to go. In  order to narrow the gap as soon as possible and upgrade our  overseas enterprises, we must take into consideration the needs  of the transnational operations and focus on our own  inadequacies and make improvements and adjustments. This article  addresses the existing problems and offers some countermeasures.  <H5>  I. Inadequacies in China's Overseas Enterprises Today </H5>   1. There is a lack of thorough knowledge of the global  characteristics of the 1990's, and our entry strategy needs  adjustments:    To understand this problem, we must first look at the  characteristics of today's global transnational operations.  Everybody knows that global transnational operations which have  undergone nearly 50 years of development have completed their  preliminary phase and are entering an intensive development  phase characterized by the following:    A. Transnational operations are getting bigger.    According to statistics compiled by the United Nation's  Transnational Companies Center, in 1993, transnational companies  were operating more overseas enterprises, but more striking is  that their total overseas investments have topped $2 trillion,  increasing some 20-odd folds compared to the 1970s. This change  has in turn changed the world's economic pattern: Today,  one-third of the world export of goods and services are  transacted between the parent companies and their subsidiaries.  For example, in the United States, transnational companies'  annual trade and overseas profits are worth around $100 billion.  By conservative estimates, their internal transactions accounted  for more than 60 percent of that country's total export of  manufactured goods in 1992. They also created nearly 5 million  jobs.    B. Expansion forces the transnational companies to go beyond  regional boundaries to engage in fierce competition.    For geographic, national, and historical reasons, besides  investing in each other in the traditional sense, transnational  companies have reached some kind of tacit understanding in the  underdeveloped nations and regions based on their regional  strategies: For example, Asia is dominated by Japan; the United  States basically has a monopoly in Latin America; central  Europe, Eastern Europe, and parts of Africa naturally fall  within the European Community's domain. But increasing evidence  shows that due to differences and imbalance in economic strength  and technological standards, and for various political reasons,  their spheres of influence are constantly under siege. The  transnational companies are becoming global companies.    C. Intense competition has prompted the transnational  companies to change their management strategies.    To adapt to the needs of expansion and regional strategies,  transnational companies have modified their traditional  single-operation strategy to a multiple- or compound-operation  strategy. Instead of a bunch of individual nation-based  subsidiaries set up only to serve their respective countries, we  now see many subsidiaries that are integrated organizations with  organically linked functions that cover the entire spectrum,  from production to sales, with development, research, and sales  promotion tasks in between. Their main characteristic is to give  full play to the existing scientific and technological measures,  production capacity, and development capability, and the basis  of their strategy is to focus on cost and profit. Integration at  this point in time has profound implications. These enterprises  may appear to be coordinating trade and fund circulation, but in  fact they are coordinating commodities and labor and other  productive activities.    What about our own situation? Our overseas enterprises have  always believed that China has only just begun its transnational  operations, and so long as we get out and fight our way through,  so long as we find a place for ourselves, we should be happy and  satisfied. Moreover, since China is still a developing nation,  our transnational operations can only do business in a small way  and cannot set high standards, and that belief has translated  into management strategies and tactics that only allow us to  make war in the peripheries. We have never seriously studied the  characteristics of contemporary transnational operations and  have never taken the initiative to adapt.    2. There is a very low degree of integration in management:    The above shortcoming is reflected in operations with a low  degree of integration. Up to now, the absolute majority of  China's overseas enterprises have only tackled jobs that were  there and work they could handle. Their production management  programs and plans and transnational strategies and tactics are  instructions handed down to them. They cannot shape the  companies' behaviors or management activities. Many overseas  enterprises are practically "fly-by-night" outfits and  "individual peasant households." Their actual operation,  business scope, and product mix often have little or nothing to  do with the core business of their parent companies back home.  Clearly, this condition does not foster the organic integration  of domestic and foreign key factors of production, and it also  makes it difficult to achieve the goal of integrating the  management goals of the parent companies and their overseas  companies. Of course, we should understand that some enterprises  may be profitable in the short-run, but in essence, they still  do not comply with the objective needs and the intrinsic laws of  internationalized commodities production, and therefore they  cannot be considered transnational operations or overseas  enterprises in the true sense.    3. The organizational structure is still like that of an  elementary business cooperative:    Except for the oil refineries in the United States and  aluminum plants in Australia and some other large projects,  China's overseas enterprises generally operate in small scale;  the degree of concentration is fairly low. The average  investment per enterprise is less than $13 million, compared to  an average of $45 million for the developing nations and $60  million for the developed countries. Obviously there is a wide  gap. Ultimately, transnational operation is a contest of  financial and comprehensive strength. Without a certain  enterprise scale and financial basis, we are doomed to be weak  from the start. Moreover, since the markets have already been  captured by others, it makes it even harder for China's  enterprises to get in. To complete the picture, these  enterprises are operating with people of ordinary qualifications  and a simple labor-mix and management mechanisms. People compare  them to "mom and pop stores." It may not be exact, but it draws  a vivid picture.    Under this system, there are some problems, such as  loopholes  in bookkeeping and lax management, which these enterprises  cannot avoid or resolve by themselves.  <H3>  II. Countermeasures: Several Suggestions on Raising Overseas  Enterprises' Management Standards </H3>   As mentioned above, Chinese enterprises' overseas  investments  were given impetus by the state in conjunction with its  all-encompassing policy of opening up to the outside world to  encourage the full utilization of international resources and  international markets. The entire process had the distinct  characteristic of being artificially stimulated, which was  consistent with China's overall policy in the last decade or so  to vigorously open up to the outside world. It is no small  accomplishment for Chinese enterprises' transnational  operations, which had to start out from scratch, to develop to  today's scope in such a short time, but faced with the intense  competition from other nations' transnational operations, we  must focus on the above problems and quickly come up with some  countermeasures to raise our management standards. In the  near-term, I think Chinese enterprises' transnational operations  should work hard in the following areas:    1. We need a proper understanding of the characteristics of  the times and put our management ideas on a high point.    Earlier we have briefly talked about the characteristics of  today's global transnational operations. Through that  discussion, we have come to understand that a characteristic of  the times is that transnational companies are the product of a  combination of political and economic factors. So long as these  factors do not change dramatically, this characteristic not only  sums up the transnational operations at this early stage but can  also be interpreted as a basic requirement and the norm of  transnational operations for some time to come. This fact may be  more important in the practical sense and more valuable from the  economics point of view. Thus, in order to achieve our goals  through the global transnational operations, understanding and  grasping this characteristic, and even making it the basis of  our operations, are especially important. It may be regarded as  the premise and the basis of improving and raising the  management standards of China's overseas enterprises. This is an  issue of concept and is also an issue of management strategy.    2. We should promote the concentration and optimization of  the existing overseas enterprises.    After we have resolved the issue of strategy, as a second  step, we should begin to increase the concentration and optimize  the existing overseas enterprises which are too small and too  scattered.    The core enterprises should make a thorough analysis of how  the transnational companies stake out their territories and how  regional economic integration is shaping up, and on that basis,  they should conduct a solid assessment of their existing  overseas enterprises and formulate a brand new program which  takes into account their own strength, the market forecasts, and  the territories they intend to get into. They should strive to  acquire the capability to directly confront the large  transnational companies in specific territories and regions and  compete in global transnational operations.    Whether we can formally take part in the global competition  and whether we can acquire the capability to engage in direct  confrontation will be critical to Chinese enterprises'  transnational operations. To explain the importance more  clearly, I will cite a thought-provoking example:    The sale of equity rights to a New Zealand steel mill in  1989  caught industry-wide attention. Chinese enterprises put in a  great effort, but because our enterprises had always engaged in  small business and for other reasons, the deal which had been  very promising eventually fell through because the New Zealand  side had no confidence in our overseas enterprises. Imagine, if  it had been successful, the status of our overseas enterprises  in the world iron and steel industry and business circles would  have been greatly enhanced, and we would have gradually gained  strength too. Thus, modern industrial management mandates large  scale; without size, there can be no efficiency.    How can we increase enterprise concentration? Based on the  successful experiences of global transnational operations and on  what China's enterprises can handle, there are the following  ways: One, within the confines of the same region, merge the  small companies into one or two relatively large companies. Two,  apply the shareholding system to link companies that are under  the jurisdictions of different organs. Three, domestic financial  organs should act as guarantors in international financing and  capital expansion. Four, set up joint ventures with the host  countries' enterprises or with enterprises of a third nation to  increase size. As can be imagined, concentration is not  something China's overseas enterprise operations can achieve in  one leap.    3. We should implement international practices and general  methods to improve the management of overseas enterprises.    Transnational management formats and practices that are  widely accepted today have been developed by many countries and  entrepreneurs based on the laws of international economy in  combination with many years of practice and continuous summation  of past management experiences. To those of us who developed  transnational operations late, these practices and methods are a  priceless treasure. They are important because they can  eliminate detours and failures and are an organic integration of  management theories and practices. We need not come up with our  own proofs or experiments. They have minimized our opportunity  cost, and we late-comers can apply or utilize these methods  directly under appropriate conditions. Based on our own  situation, we should consider adopting the following methods:    A. The heart of transnational management and administration  is integration.    Theoretically speaking, integrated management is  self-evident  for all kinds of enterprises. Even if there are different  formats and mechanisms of division of power, all enterprises  must still be essentially integrated. Ordinarily, this would  apply to enterprises in transnational operations as well. But in  order to combine domestic and foreign key factors of production,  these enterprises have developed a management format whose basic  characteristic is to invest and operate overseas. This mandates  the separation of overseas and domestic operating entities and  that the entities be relatively independent. No doubt such  separation makes the operations of the parent companies at home  and the overseas enterprises abroad more convenient and  serviceable. But there is no denying that such a relationship  also hides the potential for variances in management. In  particular, enticed by easy and immediate profit, enterprises  are prone to develop strategies and goals that are contrary to  the core companies.' If the core companies fail to discover them  or succumb to this kind of profit, the overseas enterprises may  eventually become "resident-alien enterprises" and be completely  independent from their parent companies.    Looking at the transnational operations of enterprises of  all  nations, they all have strategic considerations, and what they  focus on is to help the core enterprises utilize foreign  resources and further expand their territories and spheres of  influence. But China's transnational operations are launched not  only for the above reason but also because economic  constructions at home need money too. We can imagine the huge  strategic importance. Under the circumstances, whether from the  economics point of view or for geographic reasons, we should not  allow our overseas enterprises to act alone and become  independent. Instead, we should modify them and turn them into  transnational management groups with the domestic core  enterprises at their hub. The operations of all overseas  enterprises should be put into the production and management  chain of the core enterprises and turn them into an organic part  of the group, such as the spare part and component producing  department, the assembly department, and the group's sales  department and so on, and each should also have its appropriate  structural functions.    B. The road to transnational operation is localization.    Overseas enterprises operate in the host countries and are  in  an environment often more complicated than that at home. Many  economic laws and human factors play a role, and in order to  fulfill their responsibilities and run their transnational  operation successfully, these enterprises must first acknowledge  that they belong to their host countries in form and are legal  entities operating in the socio-economic and legal environments  of the countries where they are located. In other words, they  must make localization the starting point and the only avenue.    The meaning of localization is two-pronged. First, it means  hiring local workers; second, it means adopting local enterprise  management practices.    The hiring of local works involves not just ordinary staff  but also middle management and a few upper management personnel,  and it also involves some special employees, such as lawyers,  certified accountants, auditors and other professionals. We must  interpret the use and development of foreign resources in the  broad sense to include the use of human resources. There are  many advantages to this, and at the least, we gain some training  time.    Adopting local management methods involves many areas. I  think the most important is that we should directly adopt local  or internationally accepted financial management systems,  accounting methods, *and auditing procedure, and so far as  systems are concerned, we can have partnerships, a shareholding  system, boards of directors, and boards of supervisors and so  on. Our existing overseas enterprises have adopted these  sporadically with fairly good results, and of course those that  have adopted them systematically have even better results. Thus  we must be determined to adopt this set of internationally  accepted methods to replace some of the unruly practices and  behaviors of some overseas enterprises.    Only when we begin to localize the operations can we  formally  get on the host countries' economic tracks. This is important  not only because we are accepting the host countries'  supervision and management in form, but the real essence is that  this is the way to legally get the host countries' permissions  to utilize their resources and reap the profit. This is the  premise and the basis of transnational operations, and it is  also the lifeline to improving transnational management.    People often believe, in a superficial and simplistic way,  that accepting the host countries' regulations and management  practices will make things more complicated for ourselves and  jeopardize our integrated management. But if we analyze this  carefully, we will arrive at the opposite conclusion. For many  years, our transnational management has been in a dilemma: We  want to develop overseas enterprises but we also worry about  losing control. We have tried to modify our existing management  mechanisms as a way of adapting, but despite repeated efforts,  we have not found a better way. If we modify our thinking and  utilize the host countries' existing management mechanisms, we  not only will satisfy their demands but can also utilize their  management resources to remedy our own management deficiencies.  That is good economics.    Raising the overseas enterprises' management standards is a  micro issue as well as a macro issue. Enterprises engaging in  transnational operations naturally should study the matter  carefully, but the state too must provide the necessary external  conditions, such as designing proper government functions,  creating a legal environment, and formulating a long-term  economic plan.    In short, this is a fairly large issue with broad  ramifications. We are only making some suggestions here.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Labour makes big gains in Irish poll THE IRISH Labour party has made sweeping gains in Dublin at the expense of the two main right-of-centre parties, and picked up seats in rural constituencies, according to early returns from Wednesday's general election. Such victories over Fianna Fail and Fine Gael would establish Labour's ability to hold the balance of power in a new coalition government. The returns, calculated before taking into account transfer votes under Ireland's voting system, show Fianna Fail, Ireland's strongest party since independence in 1921, suffering its worst setback in 50 years. Its share of the vote appears to have fallen to just above 40 per cent, which would secure only 70 of the 166 seats in the Dail (parliament). Labour appears to have doubled its share of the vote since the 1989 general elections to more than 20 per cent, giving it the breakthrough it has sought since its foundation in 1912. Labour candidates have topped the polls in 10 of Dublin's 11 constituencies and, overall, the party is projected to win 30 seats. Having broken the grip of the two larger parties in the capital and made significant advances in rural seats, Labour sees itself as just one step away from displacing Fine Gael as the second force in Irish politics. Mr Dick Spring, the Labour party leader, said: 'We have laid the foundations for achieving that in this election . . . and I am confident it is the start of a new era in Irish politics.' Labour must now decide how to exploit its strength in negotiating the formation of a government with either Fianna Fail or Fine Gael. In an early result from the three referendums on abortion, the right to travel abroad for an abortion and to receive information on the operation was overwhelmingly approved, while a proposal to allow abortion when the mother's life is at risk was rejected. Ireland's central bank announced that overnight interest rates for new funds would next Monday increase to 100 per cent from 30 per cent.</p>

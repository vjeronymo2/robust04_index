			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Thai coalition faces crisis Thailand's coalition government has been thrown into crisis after the New Aspiration party of Mr Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, interior minister, voted with the opposition to defeat a government bill to democratise village government. Mr Chuan Leekpai, prime minister, was quoted last night as saying he wanted the NAP to leave the government, although this was likely to deprive him of his majority. Mr Chavalit, who is to decide today what to do, had stuck to promises he made to village headmen that he would try to block government moves to open their posts to election. Yesterday he said: 'This idea that all coalition allies must always vote together is something drummed up by the government. We have to vote for what we think is right.' Parliament may not be dissolved as a result, however. Prof Suchit Bunbongkorn of Chulalongkorn University said: 'I don't think any of the parties really wants an election - elections are very expensive and even the opposition can't be certain they'll gain seats.' Mr Chuan could try to entice one of the opposition parties over to replace the NAP's 51 seats. But he would find it uncomfortable to work with many old-style money politicians in the opposition.</p>

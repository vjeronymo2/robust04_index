			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / International Bonds: US companies dominate new issues league table THE amounts raised in the international bond and equity markets reached record levels in the first six months of 1992. Eurobond market new issue volume jumped to Dollars 148bn from Dollars 130bn, according to IFR Securities Data, due to strong growth in a number of European currency sectors. In the international equities market, companies raised Dollars 12.9bn through initial public offerings (IPOs), primary and secondary issues, compared with Dollars 8.98bn in the first half of 1991 and Dollars 7.4bn in the second half of last year, according to IFR. US companies dominate the equity league tables, raising Dollars 5.08bn with 113 separate tranches of stock in the first six months. Nearly half of this was raised by one company - General Motors - which drew Dollars 2.14bn from investors in May. Western European companies raised Dollars 2.19bn in international offerings while Latin American companies issued Dollars 4.2bn of equity, with Mexican companies accounting for Dollars 2.76bn. However, the recent weakness of the world's stock markets has prompted the cancellation or postponement of a number of offerings. GPA, the aircraft leasing group, cancelled its Dollars 800m flotation as investors' concerns about the company meant there was insufficient demand for the issue. Last week, Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, the third largest soft drink manufacturer in the US, pulled out of its plan to go public in a Dollars 600m stock issue due to unfavourable market conditions, while Banacci, the Mexican financial services group, has postponed indefinitely its Dollars 1.4bn global stock offering. Investment bankers warn that volume may dip in the second half of the year, unless stock market performance improves. In the international bond markets, the calendar for new issue activity remains heavy. Although investor appetite for paper is rather subdued, many borrowers are still some way from meeting their funding needs. Mr Len Harwood, head of capital markets at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says: 'Borrowers will need to be as flexible as possible to achieve not only price but volume objectives.' The French and German markets, which have already grown substantially this year, are likely to expand further. In part, this expansion will be fuelled by the need to take up the slack in the Ecu bond market, which has stalled in the aftermath of the Danish referendum on Maastricht, and is likely to remain rather subdued, at least until the French referendum in September. In the first half of the year, volume in the D-Mark sector increased from Dollars 9bn to Dollars 14.8bn, which helped put Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank, at the top of the bookrunners' league table. The sector is set to grow further following the Bundesbank's further liberalisation of rules governing issuance. Issuance in the French franc sector rose from Dollars 5.5bn last year to Dollars 12bn, as the market's improving liquidity, boosted by the use of fungible issues, continued to attract growing international interest. The growth in the Lira sector - Dollars 7.2bn of new issues so far this year, compared with Dollars 5bn over the same period in 1991 - may be harder to sustain, as the Italian bond market has suffered a severe setback in the wake of the Danish vote. The dollar sector remained by far the largest, at Dollars 46bn, up from Dollars 42bn in the first half of 1991, despite the continued shrinkage of Japanese equity-linked offerings, which once made up the bulk of the market. In the first half of last year, Japanese corporations relied on bonds with equity warrants attached for about 50 per cent of their financings. This year only 18 per cent of their financings have had equity warrants. The continuing need for Japanese companies to refinance equity-linked bonds issued in the 1980s will help boost new issue activity. Japanese companies had assumed that the exercise of the warrants would finance the redemption of bonds. But many warrants are set to expire without being exercised, because of the weakness of the stock market. A number of other large offerings is expected in the next month or so. The World Bank is preparing a global offering of Dollars 1.5bn five or 10-year bonds due to be launched early this week; a yen global offering is also believed to be in the pipeline, and Ontario Hydro is preparing another global bond offering. Despite the heavy volume, business has been less profitable than in 1991 when the bullish tone in bond markets boosted trading profits. This year market swings have left banks and securities firms holding loss-making positions.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROBOND ISSUES BY CURRENCY  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  First half 1992           First half 1991                      Total     No. of           Total      No. of Rank Currency       raised     issues    Rank  raised      issues                   Dollars bn                  Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1    USDollars       45.95       222     1     42.66         193 2    Ecu             19.90        76     2     21.36          47 3    Yen             17.29        85     4     13.39          92 4    D-Mark          14.77        77     6      8.97          80 5    Sterling        12.55        57     3     16.08          79 6    FFr             12.17        57     7      5.54          37 7    CDollars        11.21        59     5     11.46          64 8    Lira             7.23        33     8      5.09          31 9    Guilder          3.03        23     10     1.10           8 10   ADollars         2.52        33     9      2.19          33  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IFR BONDBASE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

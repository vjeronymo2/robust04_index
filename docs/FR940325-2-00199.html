			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Under the Dual Distribution System, the Funds currently may offer two classes of shares: (a) Class A shares that are subject to a conventional front-end sales load and a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee, and (b) Class B shares that are subject to a contingent deferred sales charge (``CDSC'') and a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee. The Funds also may waive the CDSC with respect to certain redemptions of Class B shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Existing Orders were granted pursuant to a number of representations and are subject to a number of conditions. Applicants believe that certain of these representations and conditions unnecessarily restrict the operation of the Dual Distribution System. The Existing Orders also prevent the Funds from issuing other classes of shares. Applicants seek an exemptive order to permit them the flexibility to create new classes of shares and implement new types of sales charge and shareholder servicing arrangements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Applicants propose to establish a multiple distribution and shareholder servicing arrangement (the ``Multi-Class System''). Under the Multi-Class System, each Fund would have the flexibility to from time to time create one or more additional classes of shares the terms of which may differ as described in the conditions below. In addition, applicants may offer an automatic conversion feature as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Applicants also may enter into shareholder servicing plans with various organizations. Shareholder servicing plans are used to compensate certain organizations for providing support services to their customers. Such services typically would include aggregating and processing purchase and redemptions requests from a service organization's customers, placing net purchase and redemption orders with the Funds' Distributor, processing dividend payments on behalf of customers, periodically providing information to customers showing their share positions, and other similar services. Although none of the Funds currently has a shareholder servicing plan, applicants are seeking the broadest relief presently permitted so they will have the flexibility to respond to different market opportunities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants also seek relief to offer an automatic conversion feature. Applicants propose that one or more classes of shares in a Fund (the ``Higher Fee Class'') ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a class of shares paying a rule 12b&hyph;1 fee or a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fee which is greater than that applicable to another class of shares in the same Fund) may automatically convert to shares of another class (the ``Lower Fee Class'') without the imposition of any additional sales charges after a certain period of time. Thereafter, Higher Fee Class shares will be subject to the lower continuing fees, if any, applicable to Lower Fee Class shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Each time any shares convert into shares of another class, a pro rata portion of the shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of Higher Fee Class shares in the shareholder's account also would convert into shares of the other class. The portion would be determined by the ratio that the shareholder's shares converting into shares of the other class (excluding shares acquired through dividends and distributions) bears to the shareholder's total shares possessing this conversion feature and not acquired through dividends and distributions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. In one circumstance, it may be impossible for applicants to determine the period of time individual beneficial owners of Higher Continuing Fee Class shares have held such shares because of intermediary retirement plan record holders. Accordingly, applicants request the ability to treat Higher Continuing Fee Class shares that are Class B shares purchased by certain retirement plans (the ``Retirement Plans'') as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. Funds cannot keep track of the holding periods of Class B shares held by third parties in accounts on behalf of their individual plan participants. While a Fund's transfer agent keeps records indicating each purchase and sale transaction effected by the plan sponsor, such data does not correlate with purchase and sale transactions effected for the benefit of the individual plan participants. Therefore, a Fund is unable to determine the period of time an underlying beneficial shareholder has held Class B shares for purposes of determining when an automatic conversion would occur. Furthermore, the third party plan sponsors might not have such historical records readily accessible to be able to determine holding periods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The result is that even if a Fund followed its transfer agent's records in deciding when to convert Class B shares held of record by Retirement Plans, some plan sponsors would be unable to allocate fairly such Lower Continuing Fee Class Shares among the underlying accounts because there is no necessary correlation between the purchase and sale of Class B shares at the plan level and the placing of transaction orders by the plan sponsor with the Fund. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Applicants will treat Class B shares owned by Retirement Plans separately for purposes of the conversion feature. A Retirement Plan may own Class B shares in several Funds. Applicants propose that in the month in which the first share purchased by a particular Retirement Plan has been held for the period required for conversion, all Class B shares of all Funds held in that Retirement Plan simultaneously will be exchanged for Lower Continuing Fee Class Shares of the appropriate Funds. The conversion period for Retirement Plans will be set at a uniform period disclosed in each Fund's Prospectus or Statement of Additional Information and will be no longer than the maximum period applicable to Class B shares in the Funds held by shareholders who are not Retirement Plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants' modified method of conversion for Retirement Plans will apply only to shares that are outstanding before the conversion of all Class B shares of all Funds held by a Retirement Plan. After such conversion, applicants will not sell shares having a conversion feature to Retirement Plans unless the Fund or the Retirement Plan has adequate record keeping systems in place to account for the length of time participants in a Retirement Plan have held their shares. Thus, if Class B shares are sold to a Retirement Plan after the initial conversion, they will convert into Lower Continuing Fee Class Shares in the same manner as shares held by all other Class B shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. For administrative efficiency and to reduce a Fund's recordkeeping expenses, if after Higher Continuing Fee Class shares would convert into Lower Continuing Fee Class shares a shareholder would still own a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> number of Higher Continuing Fee Class shares of a Fund, those remaining shares will simultaneously be exchanged for Lower Continuing Fee Class shares when the other shares are so converted. A  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> level (expressed either as a dollar amount or a number of shares) will be established for each Fund, will be uniformly applied to all shareholders and will be disclosed in the Fund's prospectus. All accounts falling below the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de minimis  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> level will be converted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. The Funds will obtain opinions of counsel or rulings of the Internal Revenue Service that the conversion of shares does not constitute a taxable event under current federal income tax law. The conversion of shares may be suspended if an opinion of counsel or ruling with respect to the taxability of conversion is no longer available at the time of such conversion. If conversion is suspended, higher Fee Class shares might continue to be subject to the higher rule 12b&hyph;1 or non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder servicing fees for an indefinite period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

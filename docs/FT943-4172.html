			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / CIS strengthens economic ties The Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday agreed to form a payments union and an interstate economic committee in a drive to strengthen economic ties. The interstate economic committee, described by Russian deputy prime minister Alexander Shokhin as roughly equivalent to the European Commission, is designed to put into effect the economic treaties signed by members of the CIS, but often not implemented. The payments union is an attempt to achieve relatively speedy settlement of accounts between states with independent, and non-convertible, currencies. An official communique from a meeting of CIS prime ministers in Moscow yesterday said both mechanisms were approved by all members except the central Asian republic of Turkmenistan and the Caucasian republic of Azerbaijan. Representatives of these two states asked for further time to study the plans after saying they would dilute their sovereign rights. At the meeting Ukraine showed it still wanted to keep its distance from a closer union with the Russian-dominated body, in spite of the election of a more pro-Russian president in Mr Leonid Kuchma earlier this year. Mr Vitaly Masol, the Ukrainian prime minister said that since the proposal for a payments union assumed the free convertibility of national currencies at their market price, it should be brought in slowly through bilateral agreements between the states. 'For the free floating of the Ukrainian coupon we need a stabilisation fund and gold reserves, neither of which we have.' Mr Igor Mityukov, Ukrainian vice premier for the economy, said Ukraine did not intend to change its status as an associate member of the CIS economic union - and thus it could only become an associate member of the interstate economic committee, taking part only in selected discussions. Russia's regional governors yesterday demanded that the government erect tariff walls to protect Russian industry against the 'uncontrolled' flood of foreign imports. Mr Nikolai Sevriugin, governor of the Tula region and an emissary from a meeting of the Union of Governors in Yaroslavl, told government ministers that 'the untimely policy of opening the doors to exports will lead to the extinguishing of Russian consumer goods and other industries'. At the meeting, Mr Oleg Soskovets, the first deputy prime minister, said he would respond 'positively' to a proposal from Rosugol, the Russian state committee for coal production, for subsidies initially amounting to Rbs110bn (Dollars 50m) to subsidise coal exports and raise the planned sales to Europe from 9m tonnes to 16m tonnes this year rising to 30m next year. The ministers also agreed to increase subsidies to coal transport so that the tariffs paid by the producers are cut by 50 per cent.</p>

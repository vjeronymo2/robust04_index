			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DROWN MUST TESTIFY ON DUFFY AND JAIL ABUSE;  </P> <P> LAW ENFORCEMENT: SHERIFF'S CANDIDATE OPPOSES TIMING OF HIS APPEARANCE AT  HEARING, TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE ELECTION.  </P> <P> Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown has been subpoenaed to testify two weeks before  the Nov. 6 election about Sheriff John Duffy and allegations of inmate abuse by  a so-called "Rambo Squad" of deputies who were disciplined for jail beatings.  </P> <P> Although Drown said he has no new information about what went on in County Jail  at El Cajon, or what led to the punishment of 10 deputies for alleged abuse  there, his attorney has fought attempts to have Drown testify at the Oct. 24  county Civil Service Commission hearing and asked that his appearance be  delayed until after the election.  </P> <P> Drown, whom Duffy endorsed just after announcing last year that he would not be  running for a sixth term, is running against Sheriff's Capt. Jim Roache in what  polls show to be a close race. Roache won the June primary, gathering 32% of  the vote to Drown's 28%.  </P> <P> The commission hearing is an appeal by Sheriff's Capt. Maudie Bobbitt of her  35-day suspension without pay in late 1989. Duffy suspended her for "failure to  take appropriate steps to investigate various allegations of mistreatment of  prisoners at (El Cajon) by a number of deputies," according to attorney Martin  J. Mayer, who is representing both Duffy and Drown.  </P> <P> Bobbitt was one of 10 deputies and officers disciplined for alleged abuses at  the El Cajon jail as part of the "Rambo Squad," which the county grand jury  said tormented and abused prisoners.  </P> <P> Bobbitt was the jail's highest-ranking officer, and is the only Sheriff's  Department official whose case has not been resolved.  </P> <P> Her husband, attorney Everett Bobbitt, said Duffy singled out his wife for  punishment, even though the grand jury criticized the inner workings of all  county jails. Bobbitt said Duffy dislikes him for a series of court victories  the attorney has won over the years, including one that allowed Roache to run  for sheriff.  </P> <P> Bobbitt, who is representing his wife, said he will ask Drown why, as his  wife's supervisor, he did not review her suspension, as is normal practice.  Drown said he was not Maudie Bobbitt's supervisor when the alleged abuses  occurred. But she said Drown was her supervisor at the time the suspension was  handed down, which required him to review the punishment.  </P> <P> Everett Bobbitt also said Drown has told him in a tape-recorded interview taken  as part of his wife's case that that he has not reviewed the department's  investigation into the alleged jail beatings, a claim that Bobbitt says makes  Drown an uninterested administrator.  </P> <P> "I will attempt to link Drown and Duffy together as two people who mishandled  my wife's case," he said. "Already, there is a thinly veiled attempt to protect  Duffy and Jack Drown from testifying."  </P> <P> Mayer, the attorney for Duffy and Drown, asked Bobbitt in August to continue  the hearing until after the election.  </P> <P> "As you can appreciate, it is vital that (Drown) be able to devote his  undivided attention to his election campaign," Mayer said. " . . . It seems to  me that the best way to avoid unnecessary controversy would be a short  postponement of the hearing, so that Mr. Drown's appearance would take place  after the election."  </P> <P> Commission hearing officer Richard Lyon said he would not delay the hearing.  </P> <P> Mayer also has asked Lyon to exclude certain evidence in the case, including  the possible motive Duffy might have had in suspending Maudie Bobbitt, whether  Duffy had condoned abuse at the jails, whether Duffy chose to investigate  brutality allegations at other jails and, if not, whether abuse occurred at  other jails.  </P> <P> Lyon is expected to rule Wednesday on whether the evidence should be admitted.  </P> <P> Duffy could not be reached for comment Monday. In a letter to the grand jury in  August, 1989, Duffy said his own internal investigation confirmed the existence  of the "Rambo Squad."  </P> <P> The deputies involved, he said, engaged in "cell-trashing," the indiscriminate  destruction of an inmate's cell under the guise of a search; "wall leaning," in  which inmates had to lean spread-eagle against a wall until they lost muscle  control, and "what simply amounts to deliberate and cruel harassment of inmates  in order to establish control and to 'show the inmate who's running the jails.'  "  </P> <P> Duffy concluded that the deputies' conduct was "inexcusable, unprofessional and  embarrassing to the department."  </P> <P> Drown said Monday that he knew little about the "Rambo Squad" because the El  Cajon jail was not under his jurisdiction. He said he has no choice but to  testify, although he now is beginning to believe that Bobbitt is playing  politics with the hearing.  </P> <P> "I'm beginning to think all of this is very much pointed to me and the  election," he said. "I'm beginning to have resentful feelings about it. This is  not what civil service hearings are supposed to be about."  </P> <P> Drown said he had Mayer request the postponement until after the election  because "I didn't want to be sequestered away for hours waiting to testify."  </P> <P> Although Roache has likened Drown to Duffy, because the two served closely  together for so many years, Drown said he didn't always agree with his boss.  </P> <P> "We had operational differences from time to time, but you don't air those in  public," he said. "This campaign is not, nor should it be, a report card on  John Duffy. Come January, 1991, there will be a different management style and  different policies and programs in place."  </P> <P> Roache said Drown ducked the El Cajon jail incident because he found it  unpleasant and bothersome. Bobbitt said Drown believed it would come back to  haunt him during this election.  </P> <P> Bobbitt said he will ask Drown to assess Duffy's leadership and management  style during the hearing.  </P> <P> "I think the hearing could have a potentially great impact on Jack Drown's  chances for election," Bobbitt said. "Here he said he was concerned about  abuses in the jails, and he claims never to have read the investigative package  on the El Cajon jail. What does that tell you?"  </P> <P> Duffy was elected sheriff in 1970 and reelected four times. He decided last  December that he would not run for a sixth term, after scrutiny into whether  public money helped finance his home security system.  </P></p>

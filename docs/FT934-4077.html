			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: On a long road to the promised land - Theatre It comes as a shock to be reminded that Strindberg wrote 65 plays - how few of them one has read or seen. The Great Highway, written in 1909, was his last and remains one of his best-known works. It is now revived in all its sombre, northern splendour at the Gate Theatre in London's Notting Hill - an appropriate venue because the refurbished Gate seems designed for plays about mental anguish. Let me include a caveat before praising it. The Great Highway seems to me much more a dramatic poem than a piece for the stage. It is written in, at times, extraordinarily striking blank verse. There are echoes of Ibsen's Peer Gynt and sometimes Brand. For here is a wayward preacher looking back at his past in a place never wholly defined. There are scenes of dramatic action, to be sure, but it is almost impossible to get away from this central character, who must be Strindberg himself. The location looks like somewhere between heaven and north of Stockholm. A signpost at the start has arms pointing in two directions: one up, one down. Whether these are the way to paradise and the way to perdition is unclear. Equally ambiguous is whether the Strindberg character, described simply as the hunter, is trying to get back from the higher reaches to the lower or the other way round. Possibly it is a bit of both. It is clear enough, however, that this is the painful survey of one man's life. The great highway was real: it was the new road being built from the Swedish capital, to which Strindberg had returned, to the north of the country. (In England we would have called it the great north road.) It is also full of symbolism. Biblical images abound. 'Is this the way to the promised land?' a traveller asks, only to be told: 'This is the straight way.' Thus presumably it is not the only way. There can be lots of stops and dalliances en route. Nor is religion the whole of the play. 'What's to the north?' the hunter asks at the beginning. 'A cliff of slate, a cloud like a schoolroom blackboard as yet unwritten on.' Education and humanism must have been just as central. And there is one most peculiar fact. Strindberg in his wanderings introduces an old dying Japanese man. 'I have travelled, sinned, and suffered by the name 'Hiroshima' after my native town,' he says. No wonder some people claim Strindberg was prophetic. The last, poignant line of the play says it all: 'I could not be the one I longed to be.' The hunter is magisterially played by Sylvester Morand. The direction and design by David Farr and Angela Davies respectively are full of surgical Scandinavian precision, but I still think it is more of an epic poem than a play. Gate Theatre until January 8. (071) 229 0706</p>

			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Loaded dice in the cosmic void: The chances of something going bump in the night Are you more likely to die in an aircraft crash or in a cataclysmic collision between the earth and an object from space? Amazingly, the two risks are similar - about 1 in 20,000 for an average American - according to the latest astronomical calculations. Although aircraft crashes kill hundreds of people a year and there is no authenticated record of anyone on earth ever being hit by a heavenly body, once every million years or so a collision with a comet or asteroid does enough damage to wipe out a large fraction of the world's population. Over the long term, therefore, the statistical hazard from cosmic catastrophes is comparable to that from familiar natural and man-made disasters. Astronomers expect to view a similar impact in mid-July - from a safe distance of several hundred million miles - when Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 hits the giant planet Jupiter with an explosive force equivalent to millions of atomic bombs. Unfortunately they will not be able to see the collision directly from earth because it will be on the far side of the planet, but flashes will be reflected off Jupiter's moons and disturbances should be visible in the Jovian atmosphere for weeks. Scientists believe that similar collisions between the earth and comets or asteroids - lumps of ice and rock a few kilometres wide - were responsible for the mass extinctions that punctuate the palaeontological record. The most celebrated instance killed off the dinosaurs 65m years ago, according to a theory which is now generally accepted. Ironically, a cosmic collision on that scale brings global catastrophe by ice rather than by fire. Although the explosion which occurs on impact devastates thousands of square kilometres, its secondary effects are more lethal. Billions of tonnes of dust are thrown into the atmosphere, plunging the whole globe into a sunless 'impact winter' for many months. Few plants and animals escape death by freezing or starvation. Earth's fast-changing geology quickly heals scars left by cosmic impacts. Even so, scientists have identified traces of 140 craters left by giant meteorites, including the one that sealed the fate of the dinosaurs, which stretches 180km across Mexico's Yucatan peninsular. Anyone wanting to see the unhealed face of such bombardment need only look at the moon. A detailed hazard assessment by two leading American space scientists, Clark Chapman and David Morrison, published earlier this year in Nature, the science journal, concluded that an impact with global repercussions is likely every 100,000 years or so. There is one collision devastating enough to kill at least a quarter of the human population (1.3bn people) every 500,000 to 1m years - and to wipe almost everyone out every 50m years. The biggest extraterrestrial object to reach earth this century was an asteroid, probably about 30 metres wide, which exploded in the air over the Tunguska River region of Siberia in 1908, flattening hundreds of square miles of uninhabited forest. Smaller meteorites have damaged buildings and cars - in 1992, for example, a 12kg rock ruined a Chevrolet in New York state - but fortunately not people. Others have reportedly come close to setting off a nuclear alert by misleading American and/or Russian military commanders into thinking an enemy missile was attacking. But we may now be living through a relatively quiet period in the cosmic bombardment of earth. Some astronomers believe large meteorites come in cycles, rather like the streams of small meteors that cause periodic showers of shooting stars. According to one theory, earth passes through the debris of a huge comet every 3,000 years or so, producing more frequent Tunguska-sized impacts; this would have occurred most recently in the Dark Ages (about 500 AD). 'There is a lot of information buried in ancient annals about destruction by fire from the heavens,' says Mark Bailey, an asteroid specialist at Liverpool John Moores University. 'Until recently, scientists dismissed these stories as figments of someone's imagination, but perhaps the historical record is telling us about something that really happened.' For example, Mr Bailey says, the account by Nenius in his 5th-century chronicle of St Germanus, in which the fortress of the heathen king Vortigan was suddenly destroyed by fire from heaven, sounds like a large meteorite. Over the past decade, as cosmic collisions have moved from science fiction to respectable research, astronomers have begun to realise that we are not necessarily powerless to prevent a cataclysm. In principle, 21st-century space and military technology could be used to detect a threatening asteroid or comet in time to deflect or destroy it before it hit Earth - just as Arthur C Clarke described in his recent book, The Hammer of God. As a first step, scientists working for Nasa, the US space agency, have proposed a 25-year Spaceguard survey. It would use powerful telescopes to map all 1,000 or so large 'Earth-crossing' asteroids that could cause a global catastrophe, at a total cost of just Dollars 300m. It would give a warning time of several decades before an asteroid collision. Comets, which have much longer and more elliptical orbits than asteroids, present more of a problem. Even for the most elusive comet, however, Spaceguard would give a few months' warning of impending disaster. Most astronomers support the Spaceguard proposal. More controversial - and far more expensive - is the idea of setting up a meteorite deflecting system to keep on stand-by, just in case we find a comet or asteroid heading our way. Some enthusiastic veterans of former US president Ronald Reagan's Star Wars programme have taken up the idea as a way of developing nuclear and laser technologies that can no longer be justified on defence grounds after the collapse of the Soviet Union. But others, such as Carl Sagan of Cornell University, warn that using nuclear explosions to deflect cosmic bodies could pose more of a threat than the asteroids and comets themselves. They say such a system could easily be misused to deflect a previously harmless asteroid towards earth. As Professor Sagan puts it: 'There is no other way known in which a few nuclear weapons could by themselves threaten global civilisation.' So, for the time being, we must live with the knowledge that we are as likely to die in a cosmic cataclysm as in an aircraft. For the nervous flyer, that should be rather a reassuring thought.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chances of dying from selected causes (US)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Car accident                                  1 in 100 Murder                                        1 in 300 Fire                                          1 in 800 Firearms accident                           1 in 2,500 Electrocution                               1 in 5,000 Asteroid or comet impact                   1 in 20,000 Aircraft crash                             1 in 20,000 Venomous bite or sting                    1 in 100,000 Fireworks accident                      1 in 1 million Food poisoning by botulism              1 in 3 million  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Chapman and Morrison  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

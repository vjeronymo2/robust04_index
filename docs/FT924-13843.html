			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Observer: In the cold Meanwhile in Berlin last weekend, a formidable collection of intellectuals assembled for a 'last encounter with the cold war'. Foregathered in the former Soviet Friendship Society were many of the veterans who had fought hardest against the tyranny of communism - Edward Shils, Irving Kristol, Robert Conquest and Melvin Lasky, the long-standing editor of Encounter, the monthly which, it believed, fought the intellectual cold war almost single-handedly and which died two years ago. So what are the new dragons to slay? One idea is that there might be another magazine, even a new broadcasting station, designed to expose the lack of intellectual freedom in communist China. Another view is that the real enemy today is within, coming from demands for political correctness in American universities - though the Europeans were less inclined to spy this as the new Marxism. Now that the cold war is over, intellectuals on either side of the Atlantic may indeed be going their separate ways, as was perhaps already obvious at the time of Encounter's demise, when there was plenty of American foundation largesse, provided that some money - if only a symbolic amount - came from Europe. It did not. What lives on is the old fighting spirit. Lord Dacre was in Berlin to attack ideologies of all forms - including religion. It was for that kind of irreverent approach, as much as for helping to sink the cold war, that the magazine is missed.</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Recovery at Lloyd's may be delayed by bad debts Bad debts and declining investment returns - as well as the continuing burden of claims on policies underwritten in the 1980s and earlier - will hold back the expected recovery in profits at Lloyd's, according to Chatset, the company which monitors the London insurance market. Chatset expects Lloyd's to report a profit of Pounds 800m for the 1993 underwriting year, when results are reported in 1996, in line with the market's three-year accounting system. It estimates, however, that up to Pounds 500m of the profit might be needed to meet so-called long-tail liability insurance claims arising from US court awards for asbestos-related diseases, pollution and other health hazards. Such claims can emerge years after policies were underwritten. Lloyd's hopes to tackle the problem by setting up a new reinsurance company, NewCo, early in 1996, into which it aims to transfer all liabilities on policies sold before 1986. Aside from this, says Chatset, 'two horrors lurk - worsening investment returns, exacerbated by inadequate reserves for bad debts, and further reinsurance failures'. The fall in investment returns on premiums, mainly as a result of recent turmoil in international bond markets, will hit results for the years 1992-94, for which accounts are still to be closed. During 1993, syndicates earned returns of some 6 per cent on their investments. But the first half of 1994 has produced a 'dismal return', the average across the market being a profit of 0.5 per cent on dollar investments and a loss of 2 per cent on sterling investments. Chatset expects the situation to improve in the second half of 1994, but says that 'it will remain a disastrous year for investment' with returns down 'perhaps' by between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m. Overall, Chatset expects Lloyd's to post a loss for the 1992 year of Pounds 135m, when results are reported next year. Again though, this deficit will increase substantially when the extra reserves for earlier years are taken into account. Total bad debts due to unrecoverable reinsurance claims, as a result of the failure of a number of reinsurance companies, could account for more than Pounds 300m. The figure is already taken into account in the 1991 loss of some Pounds 2bn, but similar problems could depress results in future years, Chatset believes. Chatset notes that the 'failure of insurance companies has continued apace', with the list including the subsidiaries of London United Investments, the financial conglomerate which collapsed in 1990. The market's total losses since 1988 amount to some Pounds 7bn. Earlier this year it reported a loss of some Pounds 2bn for the 1991 underwriting year. Lloyd's has already allowed its Names - individuals whose capital supports the market - to credit some Pounds 440m of the expected 1993 profit against recent losses. Separately, Chatset is critical of errors and omissions (E&amp;O) underwriters at Lloyd's, who insure the agents being sued for negligence by Names. It reports 23 syndicates have increased reserves against potential E&amp;O claims following the failure of the Lloyd's out of court settlement offer earlier this year. Lex, Page 14</p>

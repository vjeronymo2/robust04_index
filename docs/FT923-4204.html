			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / International Company News: SocGen acquires 30% stake in HK brokerage SOCIETE GENERALE, the leading French private sector commercial bank, has acquired a 30 per cent stake in Crosby Securities, the Hong Kong-based stockbroking group. The French bank intends to increase its holding to 49 per cent within the next few months, but it would not disclose the size of its investment in the group which last year generated a trading turnover of Dollars 4bn. The announcement ends months of speculation that the brokerage was looking for outside capital backing. It represents a significant expansion move for the French bank, which has almost no exposure to Asia's emerging markets. Mr Marc Vienot, Societe Generale's chairman, said: 'We see this investment as an enlargement of the product range of our division Societe Generale Equities, which is in full take-off. It will allow us to offer to our clients highly judged financial analysis and high quality execution on the emerging markets of Asia.' The French bank added that this was part of its general strategy of building an international network of brokers specialising in research in secondary equity markets. Crosby has 10 offices in Asia, and sales desks in the UK and US. It has developed a presence in China, with offices in Beijing and another planned for Shanghai, while it recently set up a joint venture operation in Sri Lanka. The year to September will be the most profitable in Crosby's history, as a result of the booming Hong Kong stock market, but the level of international competition has been rapidly increasing in Hong Kong. The presence of the world's 20th largest commercial banking group will provide a necessary source of capital backing. Crosby was set up in 1984 by Mr Tim Beardson, chairman, with financial support from venture capital funds. Mr Bruce Darrington, managing director of Crosby Securities, was adamant the management would retain 51 per cent of the company and the brokerage would not change its name. He argued that the record of the banks' wholly-owned stockbroking houses had been limited and that by buying into Crosby, 'Societe Generale has leap-frogged (other international banks) who have tried to set up their own broking operations in Asia'. The SocGen stake was mostly acquired in the form of new equity, but some of the minority shareholders were bought out.</p>

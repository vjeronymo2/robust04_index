			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Merger is predicted for GMB: Edmonds signals TGWU link THE LEADER of the GMB general workers' union yesterday predicted a merger with the TGWU general union as he announced plans for a closer relationship between the two organisations. Asked about the possibility of a merger, Mr John Edmonds, GMB general secretary, said: 'We are keen to move along this path carefully and slowly. Not many people believe there will be two large general unions in Britain by the end of the century.' Mr Edmonds' comments follow months of speculation about an amalgamation. They will add poignancy to today's debate at the annual conference of the Trades Union Congress about the future role of the TUC. A growing number of union leaders believes the trend towards a smaller number of larger unions through amalgamations adds to the pressure for changes at the TUC. Mr Edmonds' merger comments yesterday would unlikely to have been made unless he was confident that Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, was also keen to explore an amalgamation. Some TGWU officials believe Mr Morris will make proposals about changing the GMB relationship - possibly setting out the consequences of merger - when his union's executive meets later this month. GMB leaders meeting in Blackpool yesterday decided to strengthen links with the TGWU by proposing a series of joint conferences on industrial issues, and joint servicing arrangements in some areas and industries. Mr Edmonds said that in future the TUC should concentrate less on lobbying the government on the economy and more on making its influence felt in Europe where social partnership values prevailed. He added that the TUC should campaign better on issues such as employment rights for individuals, including those that affect pensions. Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, speaking after his union's TUC delegation had met, also backed the case for reforming the TUC. unions.'

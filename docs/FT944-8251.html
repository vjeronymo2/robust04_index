			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Company News (This Week): Market tunes in for showing of LWT integration - Granada Granada Group, the broadcasting, leisure, rental and business services group, is expected on Wednesday to report pre-tax profits for the year to end-September of at least Pounds 250m, up from Pounds 176m last time. Earnings per share are forecast at around 30p, and the dividend is expected to be 14 per cent ahead at 10p. The second half will see the first full contribution from London Weekend Television, of which Granada won control in February for Pounds 760m after the first successful hostile bid in the UK television industry. The combined group commands about 30 per cent of UK television advertising revenue. LWT is expected to contribute about Pounds 27m towards the television division's total operating profits of around Pounds 80m, up from a previous Pounds 42.5m. At the interim stage LWT had been with the group for just a month, and made a contribution of Pounds 4.7m. Mr Gerry Robinson, chief executive, said in June that he had been 'rather confused' by City rumours that the integration of LWT was going badly. 'In fact, it is one of the easiest integrations we have been involved with,' he said. Since then the group has started integrating the non-programme making activities of Granada Television and LWT with the loss of between 150 and 200 jobs from a combined staff of 2,000. Despite an underlying decline in sales at the rental division, operating profits are seen rising to around Pounds 110m, from a previous Pounds 105m. Mobile telephones, satellite subscriptions and the sale of second-hand equipment are expected to make good progress. The leisure sector is forecast to contribute Pounds 46m (Pounds 37.5m), while a sharp increase at Sutcliffe Catering is expected to help the business services division increase operating profits to Pounds 50m (Pounds 17.4m).</p>

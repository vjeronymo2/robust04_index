			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'KING OF THE RIGHT' HEADED THE WRONG WAY  </P> <P> The idea of enlisting our youth into local and national assistance projects is  not new. It wasn't new when I wrote an essay on the subject to Sen. Alan  Cranston (D-Calif.) nearly 15 years ago. Cranston forwarded my recommendations  to a few of the appropriate federal agencies and that was that.  </P> <P> Make this proposal to almost anyone, and they will listen and nod their  approval but do nothing about it. The Kennedy charisma brought us closest to  the ideal with the Peace Corps. William F. Buckley's version is certainly worth  considering and maybe it's an idea whose time has come.  </P> <P> (But) Buckley simply doesn't go far enough. I definitely concur with a system  of offering high school graduates a two-year stint in either the military or  civilian sector of service to the country. Social services, environmental  agencies, medical clinics, parks and forests, and any number of local and  federal projects would be well served by such a source of workers.  </P> <P> (I propose that) for their service, the young population receive higher  education gratis. Those who did not volunteer for service would have to pay the  going rate for college. Those who served the two years and wanted to go on for  higher and specialized degrees would be given the option to pay or receive  their education free if they agreed to serve an additional two years following  the receipt of their degrees. In that additional term of service, they would  complete their internship in areas of the country woefully lacking in social  services.  </P> <P> In that sort of scheme, the nation is a winner. We have a work force that  enters into national service at a time when they are just formulating their  career choices. They are given the opportunity to try their wings and to work  in cooperation with their peers on worthy projects. They are exposed to the  realities of their society. Pretty good preparation for life.  </P> <P> How much is this going to cost? Far less than our ignorant abuse of national  resources has to this point. We will improve the current state of affairs  quickly and be investing in a much brighter future. The opportunity for  individual youngsters to realize their hopes could put a dent into the gang  culture we spawned through terrible neglect.  </P> <P> IVAN LADIZINSKY  </P> <P> Marina del Rey  </P></p>

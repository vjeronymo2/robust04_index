			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: Fortis profits 15% ahead at nine-month stage Fortis, the Dutch-Belgian financial services group, increased nine-month profits 15 per cent to Ecu411m (Dollars 338m) from Ecu357m for the same period of 1993. Fortis, jointly owned by Amev of the Netherlands and AG of Belgium, said full-year net profit would also be about 15 per cent higher than in 1993. The group said insurance companies in Europe and US life insurance activities were strong contributors to the results, which were also boosted by the banking and insurance activities of ASLK-CGER, the Belgian savings bank group. Nine-month pre-tax banking results rose to Ecu207.4m from Ecu56m, helped by acquiring control of ASLK-CGER bank. Insurance profits rose 11 per cent to Ecu469.7m.</p>

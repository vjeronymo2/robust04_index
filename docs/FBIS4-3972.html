			<p>BFN     [Text] Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces, Guangxi and  Tibet Autonomous Regions, and the cities of Chengdu and  Chongqing have joined together to explore the market, thus  enabling the great southwest to march toward the new market  structure with giant strides.    The southwest is one of the areas in China with the greatest  potential for economic growth. Nevertheless, the southwest's  per capita gross industrial and agricultural output value was  lower than that of other parts of the country by 320 yuan in the  early 1980's. Since early 1984, after the southwest economic  cooperation program was initiated, the great southwest has been  rising rapidly as a new power in the market. In 1993, the  area's gross industrial and agricultural output value increased  by more than 230 percent over 1983. Nowadays, the southwest has  become one of the areas in China with the greatest economic  vitality.    Over the past 10 years, the five provinces and autonomous  regions and the two cities have lifted restrictions one after  another, removed barriers between them, and opened their own  markets to each other. As a result, more than 6,000 economic  cooperation projects were started. In the field of  communications and telecommunications, all the parties of the  southwest have joined to raise funds totaling more than 200  million yuan to build trans- provincial highways with a total  length of 918 km, four cross-river bridges linking Sichuan  Province with other provinces and regions, and opened more than  100 province-wide passenger transport routes. With the support  of all parties, the electrification projects for the  Chengdu-Chongqing, Guiyang-Kunming, and Chongqing-Guiyang  railways were completed ahead of schedule. The key postal and  telecommunication facility projects and microwave  telecommunication centers of such central cities as Chengdu,  Chongqing, and Kunming, as well as the Tibet satellite  telecommunication station, have been put into operation.  Members of the southwest have also made major progress in their  joint efforts to explore energy resources.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We are standing in front of the U.S. Interests  Section as a consequence of the publication today by the weekly  JUVENTUD REBELDE of an article signed by Luis Baez Delgado. The  article is entitled: "Sullivan, the CIA, and the Splinter  Groups: Alliance To Fabricate Lies." It refers to a highly  secret document issued by the U.S. Interests Section here in  Havana. JUVENTUD REBELDE also published the full text of the  document.    According to Baez Delgado, the document, which is addressed  to the CIA among other addressees, is indisputable evidence not  only of the lies and falsehoods dreamed up and disseminated  against the Cuban Revolution, but also of the absolute  cleanliness and justice that have always characterized us.    Baez Delgado adds that throughout the past 35 years Cuba has  time and again stated that in this country there has never been  a murdered, tortured, or missing citizen. This truth no one can  deny, as no one can deny that here no one is under arrest for  political reasons, but only for crimes against the Revolution,  and that the so-called dissidents are only cheap CIA and U.S.  Interests Section puppets.    According to the article, those who dedicate their lives to  the ideas in which they believe neither persecute or imprison  because of those ideas, as the CIA and the U.S. Interests  Section have done. Those who believe in principles respect those  principles. Those who fight for the dignity and honor of men  will never be their executioners but will be their most faithful  defenders.    Joseph Sullivan, head of the U.S. Interests Section, knows  this very well, although he may dare to say so only secretly.  Let us pay special attention to some of the sentences of this  document, which, in ambiguous phrases, and considering the  author and addressees, comes to an unavoidable conclusion: In  Cuba there are no violations of human rights. This was not said  by Fidel Castro; it was admitted by Joseph Sullivan.    The document includes unreliable cases, unverifiable  documents or evidence, cases that are not congruous in certain  aspects and which are of interest only to the United States. The  general unreliability of the cases and the recognition of the  economic rather than the political factor as the essential cause  of emigration prove the above points.    The moral status of the members of those splinter groups  stands out in the document. According to Baez Delgado, the  leaders of those little groups peddle written guarantees like  trinkets; they perpetrate fraud; they accuse one another and  violate among themselves the most fundamental human rights, in  addition to biting the hands that guide and feed them.    Moreover, Sullivan's document only adds further questions to  the arguments that various U.S. Presidents have advanced all  through these past years to intensify their policy of blockade  against Cuba and makes the backward and ruthless individuals who  are trying to defeat us through hunger look like liars.    According to the article, those who are trying to emigrate  by  entering embassies that happen to represent countries with which  we have the best relations are also disappointed. No one with  such objectives should violate the diplomatic missions of any  country, much less if those embassies are not committed to any  agreement to grant asylum. Among these candidates for  emigration, none has had any political problem. The U.S.  Interests Section document has finally unveiled this trick.    Sullivan's call to the CIA for help is very eloquent. The  document states that given the expressed CIA interests in the  human rights issue, and its growing participation in and growing  knowledge of the different human rights groups, we suggest  closer cooperation with the U.S. Interests Section in accordance  with our common objectives.    This shows, Baez Delgado adds, that the police of the  unipolar world have run out of steam and bullets. The moral  bullets of the Revolution have once again demonstrated that they  have a much longer range. The small island of Indians is once  again giving a lesson to the North. Only a quarter of a century  ago, they looked down on us; now they respect us.    On 28 June 1987, referring to the human rights issue and to  the imperialist anti-Cuban campaign, Fidel Castro said: In our  struggle against tyranny, we have been educated to repudiate and  hate any use of violence against a prisoner; and those values  have led us to victory. Those values have maintained us here,  and history will see that this truth is written.    Baez Delgado ends his article by saying that history has  once  again proven that we are right and if, in their confusion or  arrogance, the CIA, the State Department, the Immigration and  Nationalization Service, and Sullivan himself deny the existence  of the document and say that it was fabricated by the Cuban  Government, they should be aware that the Revolution has never  made up a document and that its honesty has always been  irrefutable.    Caught redhanded, it is natural that their position is  uncomfortable and embarrassing, Baez Delgado's article concludes.</p>

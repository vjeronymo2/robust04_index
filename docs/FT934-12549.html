			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Automotive Products shows decline to Pounds 5.7m AUTOMOTIVE Products, which serves the car and aircraft industries and is owned by the Guthrie Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of BBA, reported pre-tax profits down from Pounds 8.7m to Pounds 5.7m in the first half of 1993. Sales from continuing operations rose from Pounds 135.7m to Pounds 141.1m, generating operating profits of Pounds 6.7m (Pounds 8.8m). The interest charge was reduced to Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.6m). Earnings per share came out at 4.9p (7.3p). The company said the worldwide recession continued to affect its markets and a cost reduction programme was continuing. This strategy was reflected in redundancy and reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.2m (Pounds 1.7m), which had been charged against operating profit. In June, the jury in patent/anti-trust litigation in the US recommended damages against the company totalling Dollars 5.69m (Pounds 3.76m). The case is proceeding and judgment will be entered in due course. If an award of damages against the company is confirmed, the award is liable, under US law, to be trebled. The company is confident, however, that following the appropriate appeal processes no material damages will ultimately be payable.</p>

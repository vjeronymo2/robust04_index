			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chile and seven other countries have made a  presentation within GATT against the United States. The  presentation contained claims against U.S. measures affecting  the sales of tobacco on the U.S. market.    This information was released by the Foreign Ministry  through  an official communique stating that the Chilean Government and  the governments of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador,  Guatemala, Thailand, and Zimbabwe have made a joint presentation.    The presentation was made before the GATT panel, which has  canceled the kinds of measures adopted by the United States,  which affect the import, sale, and use of tobacco on the U.S.  market.    The measure adopted by the United States, the Chilean  Foreign  Ministry states, is based on the U.S. budget law, which imposes  several restrictions on imported tobacco, among them that  cigarettes should contain at least 75 percent of tobacco  produced in the United States. Failure to comply with this  regulation will prompt the imposition of heavy fines, the U.S.  law sets forth. The U.S. law was approved on 10 August 1993.    The Chilean Foreign Ministry states that such regulations  violate GATT agreements, particularly Article No. 3, which  forbids the enforcement by countries of local regulations, that  is, regulations compelling the total or partial use of local raw  materials for any product.    Considering that this regulation affects the importation of  Chilean tobacco, the Foreign Ministry adds, the Chilean  Government supported the presentation to the respective panel,  awaiting a favorable decision, which should be made within the  next few months.</p>

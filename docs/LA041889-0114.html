			<p><P> April 18, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AMNESTY VOTE IN URUGUAY  </P> <P> The outcome of Sunday's special plebiscite in Uruguay was more pragmatic than  inspiring. A bare majority of the nation's 2.3 million voters, 52%, chose to  uphold an amnesty law that prevents the persecution of military officers  accused of abusing human rights.  </P> <P> Prior to a military takeover in 1973, Uruguayans had proudly regarded their  nation as the "Switzerland of South America" because of its tradition of  democratic government. But when the military seized power after several years  of political turmoil and terrorism, Uruguay's noble traditions were forgotten.  The generals detained thousands of people merely suspected of subversion,  torturing many. The effect of such massive repression on a nation of only 3  million people was dramatic. At one point, Uruguay had more political prisoners  per capita than any other nation in the world.  </P> <P> A series of economic failures and other political setbacks persuaded the  generals to give up power in 1985. But they pressured the new civilian  government to grant an amnesty to 180 officers, accused in lawsuits -- filed  after the military stepped aside -- of having violated human rights. President  Julio Maria Sanguinetti signed the amnesty law, saying it was a distasteful but  necessary step to ensure continued civilian government. But many Uruguyans  disagreed. More than half a million signed petitions that forced Sanguinetti to  call for a plebiscite on the amnesty issue, and more than 770,000 persons voted  to repeal the law.  </P> <P> But a majority agreed with Sanguinetti -- that it is time for Uruguay to forget  the past and move on. While that decision is morally troubling, one can still  take some hope from the plebsecite. The voting was peaceful and conducted in a  spirit of reconciliation.  </P> <P> Afterward, a leader of the anti-amnesty campaign said, "The people have  expressed themselves freely, and we are going to respect this democratic  outcome." At least the democratic tradition that existed before 1973 has not  been forgotten.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 14, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PANEL OPENS A LOOPHOLE FOR POLITICAL JUNK MAIL  </P> <P> The state's campaign watchdog commission on Wednesday created a loophole in a  voter-approved ban on mass mailings at public expense by allowing elected  officials to mail unlimited numbers of "meeting notices" right up to election  day.  </P> <P> In reaching its decision, the Fair Political Practices Commission unanimously  overruled its own staff, which in a memo to commissioners complained that the  new regulation "contains very broad language . . . which could lead to abuse."  </P> <P> The vote by the five-member panel was immediately attacked by one of the  authors of Proposition 73, which imposed a flat-out ban on mass mailings at  public expense.  </P> <P> Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, an author of the 1988  initiative, complained that the new regulation would also undermine the 1974  Political Reform Act, which for 15 years has effectively barred incumbents from  using mass mailings from the time they file for reelection up until election  day.  </P> <P> "The commission is thumbing its nose at the will of the voters who have clearly  spoken, in two statewide initiatives, that they don't want to pay for political  junk mail," Johnson said.  </P> <P> However, an FPPC spokesperson defended the decision, arguing that the  commissioners were simply trying to interpret Proposition 73's ban on mass  mailings in a way that would allow government to continue to contact citizens.  </P> <P> "What the commission has tried to do is have the mass mailing restriction apply  in a common sense way," said the FPPC's Sandra Michioku.  </P> <P> If the five-member commission had not acted to broaden the ban by regulation,  Michioku said, "an unintended result would have been to ban the sending out of  tax bills and welfare checks."  </P> <P> But Johnson complained that the new regulation created a "massive loophole."  </P> <P> "When voters passed Proposition 73, they thought they were voting to eliminate  outrageous political puff pieces mailed at taxpayer expense," Johnson said.  "These so-called meeting notices are a well-known campaign tactic and have no  business being paid for by the taxpayers."  </P> <P> Until the passage of Proposition 73 in June, 1988, there were no restrictions  on mass mailings at public expense except during election periods. Even then,  incumbents could mail out official notices to constituents, but with  restrictions on the types of mailings and how prominently the incumbent's name  could be displayed.  </P> <P> The new rule allows an incumbent officeholder to decide to hold a meeting on an  issue and then send out thousands of notices to constituents, urging them to  attend. The regulation does put restrictions on how often and prominently the  elected official's name can be displayed on the notice.  </P> <P> The FPPC's Michioku said that the meeting notice exception was requested by  local government officials, who wanted to be able to meet with constituents on  such controversial issues as toxic waste. She said that commissioners have  pledged to review their decision if they see evidence that elected officials  are abusing the meeting notice rule.  </P></p>

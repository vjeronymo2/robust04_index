			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Yang Zuohuan (2799 0146 2719) and Tian Huiming </F> (3944 1920 2494)]    [Text] Haikou, 17 May (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--The annual  meeting of the Society for Research on Restructuring Economic  System was held today at the China Reform and Development  Research Institute in Haikou. Well-known economist Gao  Shangquan, the institute's president, talked about the society's  five major research topics for the future as he reviewed the  actual conditions of the development of economic reform.    --The way to properly handle the relations among reform,  development, and stability. This is a problem which is very  complicated and covers an extensive area. Correct decisions  will be made only after systematic study by various quarters,  careful comparisons, and the consideration of advantages and  disadvantages.    --The way to expedite the reform of state-owned enterprises  and the establishment of a modern enterprise system. This is a  weak link in China's economic reform, as well as a problem which  must be earnestly solved as reform enters the current stage.    --The way to further develop and cultivate the market  system,  especially sensitive markets, such as the securities market, the  property rights market, the futures market, and the real estate  market. Not only are there different concepts and  understandings, but there is also a certain degree of risk, and,  if this work is not done properly, the system can become a venue  where some people engage in purely speculative activities.  Therefore, it is necessary to carry out thorough research on  how to unswervingly, healthily, and systematically develop the  market economy.    --The way to properly carry out reform of the wage and  social  insurance systems. Reform in this area involves the immediate  interests of millions of people and has a great degree of  difficulty and risk; therefore, it is necessary to adopt active  and prudent principles, win popular understanding and a  consensus, then promote them step by step in a planned manner.    --The way to promote the smooth implementation of the  macroeconomic reform measures that have been announced for this  year and to achieve the transformation of government functions  as soon as possible.    The Society for Research on Restructuring Economic System  has  been in existence for 11 years. The members of the executive  committee of the society include a large number of experienced  economists and officials in charge of economic matters. The  current annual meeting in Haikou, the first meeting of the third  executive committee of the society, will elect a new group of  executive committee members.    Li Tieying and Wang Shiyuan, minister and vice minister  respectively of the State Commission for Restructuring Economy;  An Shiwen, president of the Society for Research on  Restructuring Economic System, and Zhou Taihe and Tong Dalin,  the two vice presidents of the society; Hainan Governor Ruan  Chongwu and Hainan Deputy Party Secretary Du Qinglin, attended  the meeting along with approximately 180 experts and officials.</p>

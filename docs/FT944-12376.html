			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Tighter immigrant curbs for Canada Canada plans to dilute its traditional hospitality towards immigrants under a new long-term policy unveiled yesterday, reports Bernard Simon from Toronto. Besides cutting the 1995 immigration quota by about 12 per cent, Mr Sergio Marchi, immigration minister, announced tighter curbs on family members seeking to join relatives already in Canada. The government will in future place a greater emphasis on attracting entrepreneurs and other independent immigrants with skills or wealth to contribute to the economy. The refugee quota will rise by as much as three-quarters to 24,000-32,000 a year. Studies indicate that new settlers in the family reunification category, especially parents and grandparents, place a relatively heavy burden on health and social services.</p>

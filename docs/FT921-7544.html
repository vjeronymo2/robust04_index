			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Lack of training strategy criticised GOVERNMENT-funded training suffers from a lack of a clear and coherent long-term strategy, Astra Training Services, the biggest national provider of craft training, has told a Commons select committee. Astra, created in a management buy-out of 45 of the 60 skillcentres privatised by the government in 1990, said in a written submission to the Commons employment committee that the training market had become under-resourced. The company also said that funders were too concerned with the short term. It said: 'Skill shortages are already reappearing despite the recession and rising unemployment.' Astra said the government's strategy was to increase the commitment of employers and individuals to meeting their own training needs, thereby minimising its own involvement. 'This has not happened in practice, thereby reducing total funding available and consequently the range and quality of training provision.' Astra estimated that government grants covered less than 50 per cent of the total costs of training. Increased employer contributions were difficult to achieve because most companies were cutting jobs and found it difficult to justify taking on extra staff. 'The prospects of increasing the placement fee to compensate for the reduced government funding are remote during a recession,' Astra said. The company said that the auditing procedures demanded by the government were costly to provide and were not allowed for in funding regimes. It said it was deeply concerned that many training providers were in financial difficulties and were leaving the training market. 'This damage to the training infrastructure may take years to repair,' it said.</p>

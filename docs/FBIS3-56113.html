			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Khrustov: "'White House' Prepares for </F> New Occupants"]    [Text] Those who have moved houses even once will have  been able to satisfy themselves from their own experience of the  truth of the saying that one move is equal to two fires. And if  you are about to move into a building where several stories are  burnt out, almost all the windows are broken, ceilings and even  supporting structures are damaged, and hardly any utilities are  operational....    This was precisely the state in which the fine, snow-white  administrative complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment was  found recently, when specialists arrived to carry out a detailed  survey of the building and give an in-depth report on the nature  and scale of the damage.    It is well-known that on 5 October the president signed an  edict on handing over to the Russian Federation Government the  administrative complex where parliament worked until recently.  He thereby restored historical justice, if you like: The  complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment, which came to be known  as the "White House," was originally occupied by the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers (indeed, the building was  erected for that purpose).    Experts appeared at the site the following day. The  impression of "devastation and desolation" -- as Petr Surov,  head of the government apparatus construction department and  first deputy chairman of the government commission, admitted to  me at a recent meeting -- was depressing. Even with intensive  work, restoring the 20-story building (or, to be more precise,  the 24-story building, if you count the two basement floors and  the clocktower) to its former working state before September  next year seemed unrealistic.    But a tough schedule was set: The stylobate (six floors) to  be completed in 1993, and the upper levels, comprising the  seventh to 20th stories, to be completed by 15 February 1994.  Moreover, the leaders of the government commission were given  the necessary powers to engage any construction firms and other  organizations in the work to restore the government building;  and to conclude contracts with foreign firms.    "We immediately realized that we could not manage with  Moscow  builders alone (they have their own intensive program)," Petr  Surov said. "So we engaged colleagues from a number of Russian  cities, as well as foreign specialists. The extremely tight  schedule made the supply of materials and equipment a crucial  factor: We needed building and finishing materials (granite and  marble), elevators, and fire prevention systems. Our foreign  partners were able to deal with these matters promptly. In  other words, we undertook to complete the work within the  deadline by making sure we had all the necessary materials and  equipment.    "We received offers from 27 foreign firms. Many of them were  pursuing not so much commercial aims as political objectives:  They wanted to help us restore the government residence,  thereby expressing their solidarity with Viktor Chernomyrdin's  cabinet and the current reforms.    "The Turkish firms Gama and Enka were chosen because they  have made a good name for themselves in Russia. Enka already  built a maternity home and a military hospital with 1,200 beds  in Moscow and renovated the Petrovskiy Arcade. Gama agreed to  work without any advance payment, using its own money to buy the  necessary materials.    "Other firms were also engaged, mainly those that supplied  equipment when the complex on Krasnopresnenskaya Embankment was  originally built. Take the elevators, for example. We had to  replace 19 out of 49. This was done by Otis (a U.S. firm). The  shuttle-mail system is being restored by Ascom, the Austrian  company, which originally installed it. Hanwell (a U.S. firm)  is renewing the fire-prevention systems. There was no hard  currency available, but within 24 hours they had flown  everything necessary to Moscow and started work. The commercial  equipment for the dining room and snack bars (they are up and  running, incidentally, and catering for the construction  workers) was supplied by an Italian firm, which started work  even before signing the contract and sent all the necessary  equipment within one month.    "First of all, we had to bring the building `back to life,'  make it `airtight' (virtually every window was broken), and get  the utilities operational, that is, provide water, heating, and  a working sewerage system. As many as 5,000 people were engaged  in the restoration work virtually from day one.    "Then we had to eliminate the consequences of the fire and  destruction. Many dividing walls had collapsed, some  ferroconcrete floors were sagging, and some beams had to be  reinforced. Obviously, all the debris and rubbish had to be  quickly cleared from every story.    "This was not easy. The building is approximately 100 meters  high and the freight and passenger elevators are the only form  of transport, but they were not working (the electric wires were  burnt through). However, together with their colleagues from  Otis, Russian specialists had all the elevators working within  four days. Using an efficient hourly system (each story in  turn), the construction debris was removed and carefully packed  into sacks. As many as 100 trucks of rubbish left the government  building, covered in scaffolding, each day.    "People worked flat out, making the deadline -- which had  recently seemed unattainable -- a real possibility. People from  Yekaterinburg, Orenburg, Tolyatti, Omsk, Tomsk, Rostov, and  other cities worked around the clock, showing that we can work.    "Of course, all the necessary conditions were created for  the  construction workers: Everyone was accommodated close by, at  the Ukraina Hotel, free meals were organized, and their wages  reflected the work done.    "The `treatment' of the facade has proved very difficult: It  was quite literally decimated by the shelling. The process of  polishing the lower six stories is now complete: Only the upper  levels remain. But there the situation is worse: 1,200 square  meters of marble slabs have to be replaced. This is being done  by Gama (our specialists refused, suggesting that we wait for  warmer weather).    "The tower clock has been repaired (the hands were riddled  with bullets): It started working again on 30 December. One  firm (Russian) asked for 600 million rubles to repair the clock.  But local specialists did everything -- quickly and much more  cheaply.    "A total of 10 stories are now complete. Furniture is being  arranged, communications systems are being switched on, and the  first `new arrivals' are expected. Our department is already  here, incidentally," Petr Surov said.    "All the various chambers are ready: the awards chamber, the  reception rooms, the Gold Chamber, the Blue Chamber, the  government sessions hall, and the leaders' office suites.  Construction workers are also ahead of schedule in the upper  levels. The seventh story (including the reequipped dining  room) and the eighth to 12th stories are complete. Plus the  technical operations story (the 20th), which is responsible for  the heat and water supply and all other utilities.    "All work will be finished by 15 February as planned. Not  only restoration, but also modernization. It is intended to  develop the communications systems in the future. The question  of protecting the government building along the lines of the  President Hotel, for example, is being discussed. It is planned  to do this in the summer."    Petr Sergeyevich and I walked through the restored building.  It is now white again. The tinted windows and reinforced  window frames have somewhat changed its appearance and made the  building more beautiful than before. The interior decoration is  also of the highest quality.    All rooms in the stylobate (the first to sixth stories), and  also the eighth to 12th stories of the central upper tower  passed inspection by a working subcommission on New Year's Eve.  (For your information: The state commission will sign a  certificate of approval on completion of the complex).    Your ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent has been informed that  the Russian Federation Government headed by Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin will move to its new address in the near  future.    Happy house warming!</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The airline company KyrgyzAba Zholdary and the U.S.  aerospace corporation Boeing have signed an agreement in Bishkek  on leasing two Boeing-737-200 aircraft. Each aircraft  accomodates 120-130 passengers and uses half as much fuel as the  Ty-154. Its crew consists of only two pilots. The American  side agreed to a four-year-long lease. The first year our  airline company will not pay rent -- it will earn some money  first and only then will it pay for the lease.    It took half a year to negotiate the deal and talks were  held  both in Seattle and in Bishkek. Our experts familiarized  themselves with the manufacturing process and the system of  servicing and utilizing. The American side will train our crews  as a part of the lease payment and also provide us with  technical experts. Around 20 pilots will soon go to Seattle to  be trained there. At the end of this year, two Boeing aircraft  will land at Manas airport. They will fly to Moscow, Tashkent,  Istanbul, Novosibirsk, and other cities. The Boeing aircraft  can cover the distance of 4,000-5,000 km.</p>

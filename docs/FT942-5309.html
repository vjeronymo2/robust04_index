			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / The Pineau-Valencienne Affair: De Barsy - a high-profile minority shareholder Mr Andre de Barsy displays none of the low-key characteristics of the typical bourgeois Belgian investor. Unlike the Belgian shareholder who carefully avoids both the country's tax system and the limelight, Mr de Barsy is known for his forthright questioning at annual general meetings. At his sombre offices in central Brussels, Mr de Barsy, a financial analyst who runs his own investment company, expounds on the questions he has put to the management of Cofimines since 1991, when he first became a shareholder in the Schneider subsidiary. 'For some years I was singled out because, when I went to meetings, it wasn't just to hear what I could read in a report, it was to ask questions about the normal course of business,' he says. Other individual minority shareholders took note. A total of 180 of them turned to Mr de Barsy for advice when they first suspected that Schneider was giving them a less than fair deal in its takeover bid in late 1992. The group of minority shareholders took their case to the Belgian legal authorities. The threat of legal action prompted Schneider to raise the share price offer. While most of the individuals took the money and settled back in anonymity, Mr de Barsy refused to accept the raised offer - and has continued to ask questions about unexplained aspects of the Schneider-Cofimines link. From behind his solid wooden desk, piled high with papers and sporting a bakelite telephone, as well as two more modern handsets, Mr de Barsy has meticulously followed the Schneider case. He focuses on what he calls the 'complicated architecture' of Cofimines' elaborate off-shore operations, which he alleges has had the effect of hiding part of Cofimines profits from shareholders. 'I knew in 1992 of the existence of some of these offshore companies and asked why it was necessary to have this sort of investment vehicle. But I didn't suspect that other offshore companies existed as well.' In 1992, he says, Mr Jean Verdoot, the companies' former managing director, answered some of his questions in apparent good faith. 'But he evidently knew many things he didn't speak about.' One of the points queried by Mr de Barsy refers to guarantees on share transactions involving both Schneider and Cofimines, centred on the purchase of a stake in the Luxembourg steel company Arbed. 'At Cofimines annual general meeting in May 1992 I received an assurance that these (guarantees) were clear, and I was satisfied with the investment.' Now, however, he thinks that questions on these dealings need still to be followed up. Mr de Barsy questions Mr Pineau-Valencienne's closeness to the operations of Cofimines, of which he was the chairman, and alleges that the Schneider chief was rarely in Brussels. 'I think it is important that a manager is conscious of his need to report to the people, and not to stand apart like the Roi de Soleil.'</p>

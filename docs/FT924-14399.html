			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: Charge pushes Orkla into loss ORKLA, the Norwegian diversified foods group, reported a swing into loss of NKr161m (Dollars 27.4m) in the first eight months of this year from a NKr472m profit last year, due to a NKr874m charge against accounts on the group's securities portfolio. A charge of NKr228m represents a special write-down on its stake in Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer which collapsed into the hands of state administrators in August. At the end of August the market value of the group's securities portfolio was NKr3.432bn, representing a 14.7 per cent decline since the end of last year. Group operating profit increased to NKr759m from NKr530m last year, helped by a NKr650m advance to NKr10.99bn in operating revenue. Profits from associated companies rose to NKr85m from NKr20m. The group's branded consumer goods division lifted operating profit by 46 per cent to NKr627m from NKr429m in last year's comparative period, despite a stagnation in domestic markets growth. The chemical processing division nearly doubled operating profit to NKr118m from NKr64m, but the improvement was helped by the disposal of a 50 per cent stake in a vanillin plant for which it gave no further details.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AYATOLLAH KHOMEINI AND 'THE SATANIC VERSES'  </P> <P> I've got my order in for a copy of "The Satanic Verses" and I'm pleased to say  my bookseller tells me there is a long list of waiting buyers.  </P> <P> I'll wait. It was 30-odd years before I finally got around to reading "The Last  Temptation of Christ" and what a wonderful discovery it was. It taught me more  about the profound meaning of Christ the man and myth than all the turgid  sermons I ever heard before I finally gave up looking for any sense or  spirituality in churches as a young man.  </P> <P> I eagerly look forward to learning something about Islam that isn't filtered  through the twisted megalomania of a power-mad old imam or, even worse, through  the self-righteous "moderate" high priests who don't necessarily want to kill  the author but would stop any of us from making our own choices by banning the  book.  </P> <P> And by the way, shame on those booksellers who so quickly ducked their heads in  the sand.  </P> <P> KENNETH GALE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

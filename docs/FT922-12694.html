			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Arts: Berlin Bertie Odd how plays of a kind seem to flock together. At the Comedy we have the Italian anarchic left in Dario Fo's The Pope and the Witch (reviewed yesterday). At the Royal Court up, or perhaps down, goes the British left in Howard Brenton's Berlin Bertie, a play about the illusions shattered by the dismantling of the Berlin Wall. The two pieces have a good deal in common: for example, a performance better than the script deserves and the absence of targets worth hitting. As in politics, the left may have run out of ideas. One senses that a theatrical era is coming to an end, though the professionalism of the acting and the direction remains. Brenton is far too good a playwright not to have sensed that himself. The Bertie in his title is, in part, Bertolt Brecht. This is a play as much about theatrical approaches as about politics. Brecht stood for certainties, even if eventually it required a wall to shore them up. The question is what happens when people on the repressed side of the wall see the licence on the other side. Brenton lays it on thick. Here is south London, Easter 1990. Decadence is all over the place: uncleared-away Chinese take-aways, piles of capitalist newspapers, Coca Cola cans, Pepsis as well, mattresses on the floor, a dirty television set. The most frequent word used by the most talkative of the early characters begins with an 'f'. The same character wears a T-shirt advertising Virgin Airlines. When the principal female finally wakes up, she talks about the joys of having breakfast travelling first class on Cathay Pacific and having sex in the aircraft's loo. Then she drinks lager from the can. She is, of course, a social worker, for whom life has gone wrong; she is also on drugs. The girl on the other mattress is a 17-year-old suffering from venereal disease, but unwilling to go to the doctor for treatment and preferring to practise the skills of the commedia dell'arte. She spends quite a lot of time standing on her head and wants to move south to the Avignon festival. Outside is a backdrop of some of the ugliest buildings in East Berlin. From there the sister of the social worker arrives, as does her lover, an ex-Stasi official, sometimes posing as Brecht and wanting to make a new life in the Netherlands. He asks questions like: 'Are these conditions representative of a British working class house?' One could go on. The play is not quite as awful as a description of the plot makes it sound. Brenton can write, sometimes like Noel Coward, as in the line: 'Strange how continental men have overdeveloped legs'. The acting is very good, notably Penny Downie as the social worker and Diana Rigg as her sister, Rosa. Some of the political observation is sharp. Rosa did her thesis in East Germany on compulsive swearing, and notes there is a lot of it about in South London. Berlin Bertie is directed by Danny Boyle. Brenton has a prolific output and must be going through a period of adjustment. One looks forward to where he goes next. Royal Court Theatre. Part of a season supported by Wilde Sapte, Solicitors.</p>

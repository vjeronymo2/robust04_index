			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] This morning the Senate passed the 1994 national  budget bill, which contemplates total expenditures of  2,330,144,000,000 guaranies for the central administration and  3,518,351,000,000 guaranies for the decentralized  administration. This is the final version, and the executive  branch can now promulgate the bill. The Senate ratified its  original position because legislative proceedings do not allow  for a partial acceptance of the Chamber of Deputies' amendments.    The figures contemplate differentiated salary increases for  public employees not affected by the Labor Code, just as was  originally proposed by the Senate the first time it studied the  document.    As a result, teachers and health workers will have two  adjustments next year, one in January and one in July. Each  adjustment will be of 10 percent. This final congressional  decision might reestablish good relations between teachers  unions and the Education and Worship Ministry, and allow the  training of teachers who will start the educational reform in  1994. The adjustments would also prevent strikes from  disturbing the teaching schedule during the school year.  <H5>  Military and Policemen </H5>   Military salaries will have a single adjustment of 10  percent  as of January, plus a bonus of 85,000 guaranies for each food  coupon.    The National Police will have differentiated salary  adjustments: Officers will receive a single 10 percent salary  adjustment, while noncommissioned officers will receive a single  20 percent adjustment, both as of January. Both groups will  also receive 85,000 guaranies for each food coupon, just as does  the military.    Lastly, all other public employees not affected by the Labor  Code will receive the following adjustments: Those now  receiving a salary of up to 500,000 guaranies will be granted a  single adjustment of 10 percent in January, while those earning  more than 500,000 guaranies will receive a 7.5 percent  adjustment in July.    The Senate rejected the Chamber of Deputies' amendments to  the Central Bank and Social Security Institute (IPS) budgets.    As a result, the Central Bank will not be able to dispose of  9 billion guaranies for loans to bank employees and local  contribution to foreign credits aimed at supporting small  businesses in the country. The IPS will be able to dispose of  20 billion guaranies broken down as follows: 15 billion for  loans to companies, and 5 billion for loans to insurers.    The figures approved by Congress will not be objected to by  the executive branch if we believe the last Finance Ministry  message to Congress, containing a request to the Chamber of  Deputies to ratify the salary adjustments proposed by the Senate.  <H5>  Budget Deficit </H5>   Besides approving each public company budget, the Senate  also  approved the legal authorization for the Finance Ministry to  cover eventual deficits with Central Bank emissions or public or  private commercial bank credits (BNF [National Development  Bank], BNT [National Workers Bank], and other banks). These  financial aids could be considered as taken on account from  Itaipu royalties when the royalty disbursements are delayed.</p>

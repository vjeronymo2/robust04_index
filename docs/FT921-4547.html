			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Taxes, public indebtedness and democracy THE SIZE and role of the public sector is a hot political topic across the world. In the US, George Bush is in trouble with some republicans for raising taxes to cut the deficit; in the UK, the question is not whether to borrow, but instead whether a higher deficit should fund tax cuts or public investment; while in Italy, almost every politician would like to cut government borrowing, yet no politician is able to do so. International comparisons of public spending and taxation are increasingly creeping into these national political debates. This is particularly true in Europe, because of the pressure to harmonise national tax systems and the limits on public deficits and debt contained in the Maastricht treaty. This week's special table provides an overview of the activities of the public sector in each of the six largest industrialised economies over the past twenty years. All figures are expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product and refer to 'general government', which consists of central government, state, regional and local authorities and the social security system. Europe is the continent of big government, although the public sector has grown everywhere over the past 20 years. In 1990, total government expenditure accounted for 37 per cent of GDP in the US and 31 per cent in Japan but over 50 per cent in both France and Italy. The UK remains somewhere in between, with a lower ratio of government spending to GDP than its continental European partners and less public investment than any country, except the US. European countries have also tended to rely more on indirect taxes, particularly value-added tax, and on social security taxes than either the US or Japan. Reducing the size of the public sector has been a persistent theme of recent OECD economic reports. Public sector deficits grew rapidly in the first half of the 1980s, while rising government debt and higher real interest rates increased the burden of interest payments. But until the current economic downturn, the primary budget, excluding debt interest payments, of these countries, except Italy, had moved back into surplus. Nevertheless, the bulk of the fiscal retrenchment among OECD countries has come about through higher taxes, rather than lower spending. Of the 1.4 percentage point fall between 1984 and 1990 in the average deficit-to-GDP ratio, revenues accounted for 0.9 percentage points and expenditures for only 0.5 percentage points. France, Germany and the UK are exceptions to this rule. Not all OECD countries have brought their deficits and debt under control. Italy, Greece and the Netherlands, in particular, have had persistent primary budget deficits and high and rising net debt ratios. Their shared problem, according to a recent economic policy paper, lies not in the structure of their economies but in their constitutions. All three countries are what the authors term representational parliamentary democracies, with five or more representatives per electoral district. These countries have tended to have shorter-lived governments and more coalition governments than either majoritarian parliamentary democracies with fewer representatives per district, or presidential democracies, where the executive is more independent of the legislature. Indeed all those OECD countries which have seemingly unsustainable levels of public debt are representational democracies, save for Ireland and Portugal; and all the representational democracies, save for Denmark, have unsustainable fiscal policies. Representational democracies have, on average, had higher budget deficits over the past forty years, as the chart shows. Governments do not, it seems, deliberately accumulate debt with which to burden their successors. It is countries with short-lived, minority governments, and not those with regular changes of majority government, that have tended to accumulate public debt. Weak governments, unable to take necessary decisions to cut spending or raise taxes, fall back on borrowing instead. All of which suggests that Italy, the home of the minority government, may need to reform its constitution if it is to reduce its outstanding gross debt ratio to 60 per cent of GDP and so qualify for Emu. Proportional representation may be theoretically appealing; but too much PR can bring troublesome side-effects.

refer to general government finance. First tier (overview); The primary balance is the overall balance (revenue minus expenditure) less net interest payments on public debt. Second tier (revenue); Direct taxation (on incomes, profits and capital gains), is here split into personal and corporate. Indirect taxation is mostly that on expenditure, either general (eg VAT) or specific (eg customs duties). Also includes taxes on vehicles. Third tier (expenditure); government purchases of goods and services for consumption and for investment (gross fixed capital formation). The expenditure breakdown excludes debt interest payments, subsidies, and capital transfers. Health and Education figures include current and capital expenditure.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: OECD.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

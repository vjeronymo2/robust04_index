An MSW landfill may also receive commercial waste, sludges, and industrial solid waste. Portions of an MSW landfill may be separated by access  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roads.

Examples include, but are not limited to: earth, rock, concrete, clay products, inert tailings, plaster board, glass, inert slag, asbestos, and demolition materials containing less than 10% by volume wood and metals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-methane organic compounds (NMOC) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any compound in a gaseous state at standard temperature and pressure which contains at least one atom of carbon except: methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, metallic carbides, carbonates, and carbonic acid, as measured according to paragraph (g)(6) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Non-repeatable, momentary readings <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means indications of the presence of organic gases using a detector meeting the apparatus requirements of EPA Method 21 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A) which persist for less than 5 seconds and do not recur when the sampling probe is placed in the same location for at least twice the response time of the instrument.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Owner <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the fee owner of a solid waste disposal site and the person who through lease, or other arrangement with the fee owner is responsible for complying with all applicable federal, state and local requirements for landfill gas emissions, provided that upon the expiration of such person's responsibility for landfill gas emissions under such lease or other arrangement the fee owner shall be deemed the owner. Where specific requirements of this section apply to equipment at the MSW landfill that is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owned or operated by a second party other than the fee owner, the second party shall be deemed the owner for the purpose of such section requirements as they relate to such equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Perimeter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the outer boundary of the MSW landfill property.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Quarter <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the months that define a ``quarter.''

			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANOMIE IN A SHIFTING REALITY;  </P> <P> A PLAN FOR ESCAPE BY ADOLFO BIOY-CASARES TRANSLATED BY SUZANNE JILL LEVINE  (GRAYWOLF PRESS: $7.50, PAPER; 116 PP.)  </P> <P> Adolfo Bioy-Casares' choice of point of view is brilliant: He filters  experiences through the guarded speculations of someone who hasn't participated  in them. Juxtaposed with excerpts of an exiled Frenchman's letters are  narrative passages from his uncle who tries to make sense of the letters while  freeing himself from any sense of responsibility for his nephew's bizarre fate.  From the first page of his cryptic novel, "A Plan for Escape," Bioy-Casares  challenges his readers to question the reliability of this narrator.  </P> <P> First published in 1945, the book explores the decline and corruption of the  individual trapped within a machine of violence. Bioy-Casares draws parallels  to the atrocities of Nazi Germany in his treatment of horror and confusion,  conspiracy and fear. As his characters attempt to endure or overcome a corrupt  system that is secretive about its ever-changing rules, they are weakened or  contaminated. Hallucinations, misinterpretations and paranoia lead them into  irrational acts, but these acts don't matter nearly as much as the increasing  disorientation that arises from them.  </P> <P> A spoiled young Frenchman, Henri Nevers, is exiled to a group of camouflaged  islands off French Guiana to assist a governor who believes that his operation  is regulated by a unique order. Nevers, who always considered it absurd to  "meddle in things that had already happened," is disturbed by rumors of  mysterious experiments with prisoners in this world in which its inhabitants  are "dreaming that we dream." The prisoners are conditioned to imagine their  world "vividly, obsessively" and are kept in isolation "so that the obsession  would remain pure."  </P> <P> As the characters manipulate each others' reality, they move within a  nightmarish landscape where it's not always clear who the enemy is, and where  the power structure can change at any moment. "The governor was sure of  participating in the dream of the islands that he infused in others; but he was  afraid of losing forever our vision of reality."  </P> <P> Kept awake by his fear of insomnia, Nevers plots to get off the islands. He  wants to believe that his "stay in the Guianas was merely an episode in my  life. Time would erase it, as it did other dreams." Instead, he becomes  obsessed with the secrets and sheds his passivity by setting out on an obscure,  self-imposed mission that includes a false confession, intrigue and forged  identities. But perhaps he is not gaining a new independence; perhaps he is  merely playing his part within the governor's dream machine. "He found himself  before a growing conglomeration of mysteries. Were they independent of each  other? Or were they linked; did they form a system, perhaps still incomplete?"  </P> <P> Born in Argentina, Adolfo Bioy-Casares is well known as Jorge Luis Borges'  collaborator and friend. His numerous works, including novels, film scripts and  short stories, have been translated into many languages. "A Plan for Escape,"  like some of his previous works, explores the disintegration of communication  within an ever-shifting reality.  </P></p>

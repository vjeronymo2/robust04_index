			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Arts: Love's labour's well spent - Andrew St George enjoys a production in Manchester WILLIAM Hazlitt kept Love's Labour's Lost in a fitful exile from the stage by saying: 'If we were to part with any of the author's comedies, it should be this.' The Royal Exchange Theatre Company has called this difficult play back to life in a simple new guise. The mood is everything: winter or spring. But this production is too sombre for farce, and too light for a meditation. The 1594 Love's Labour's Lost is no frothy comedy. The cost of countering Hazlitt was a modish search for the gloom in the play. Peter Brook's 1946 Royal Shakespeare Company revival found out the sadnesses and compromised the mirth, making Don Armado a faded Grandee rather than an Andalusian Falstaff. Modern productions know that the frozen laughter at the end should start to chill even in the first scene. James Macdonald's production opens on a circular grass field; the four men arrive to begin their celibate retreat. All parts but Berowne's are a thankless matter of waiting, like a bell in a peal, to strike and then fall silent again. The women arrive, and the 'civil war of wits' begins. The characters are surprisingly cruel with each other, a fact that the direction fails to exploit. The women mock and the men bluster; the pedants look pathetic; and the token foreigner, the faded Don Armado, everywhere finds his confused gentility misunderstood. Don Armado is lugubriously and finely played by Bernard Bresslaw. He has that 'mint of phrases in his brain', but lacks the discipline of an exchange rate mechanism, for he, like everyone else in the play, is hell-bent on the conspicuous consumption of words: 'I am for her, volumes in folio.' The other wordsmiths, the pedants, Holofernes (David Ross) and Sir Nathaniel (Roger Delves-Broughton) are a quidditative delight, all intellectual ostentation met with simpering admiration. Linus Roache as Berowne spinning 'taffeta phrases and silken terms precise' keeps the action moving by the energy of his verse-speaking. But the women, ably led by Patricia Kerrigan's arch Queen, could be cooler and less flighty, since they call the whole thing off at the end, and must make this look plausible. Their ambassador is the 'honey-tongued' Boyet (John Bennett), inward with the women and haughty with the men. He needs more attention than Macdonald's direction gives him; he links the two courts, and his attitude - cruel or playful - makes the mood of the play. Ace McCarron's lighting, with a lovely change of state at the end, realises that the heart of the play beats in its final lines: 'The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of Apollo. You this way, we that way.' This is a wonderful theatrical moment, about what it means to watch a comedy, especially one that finishes with a death and not marriages. One is elated to think that life is seldom this bad, but dispirited to know that it is rarely this good. Out of this division, for an instant, Shakespeare's ending creates its own community in the theatre. At the Royal Exchange Theatre, Manchester (061) 833 9833, until October 17</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINIMALISM DEBATE  </P> <P> I agree with the atonalists' argument that minimalism, at its worst, is a far  too simple reaction to the complexity and austerity of atonality. However, I  strongly disagree with their assertion that as atonal/serial composers they are  the sole representatives of High-Art.  </P> <P> They seem to forget the words of the ultimate atonal master, Schoenberg, who  realized that atonality/serial techniques were not for everyone and that  (great) music would still be composed in C major.  </P> <P> MATTHEW HETZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

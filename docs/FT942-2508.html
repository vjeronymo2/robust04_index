			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Wine auction nets Pounds 1.4m A cellar of some of the world's finest wines was auctioned in London this week for a total of Pounds 1.4m. It took place at Christie's on Thursday and, with the auctioneers holding 320 different commission bids before the first of the three auctions started, bidding was always likely to exceed the already high reserves. Prices for the younger wines were considerably in excess of current retail levels. Most wines were bought by private buyers with representatives of the American, Swiss, German, French and Hong Kong wine trade flying in and out, some empty-handed. A leading British wine merchant, prepared to spend up to Pounds 500,000, came away with two cases and calculated that the British wine trade bought less than 1 per cent. A private British bidder spent more than Pounds 500,000 on rare bottles, including the first of two 'super-lots' for Pounds 340,000 (estimate Pounds 200,000). Other record-breaking prices were: a case of Cheval Blanc 1947 at Pounds 18,000 (estimate Pounds 4,500); Haut Brion 1961 at Pounds 6,200 (Pounds 1,200); Gruaud-Larose 1961 for Pounds 2,400 (Pounds 1,800) and a case of the rare Pomerol Le Pin 1982 for Pounds 3,300 (Pounds 2,000). Until recently a bottle of this last wine was on the wine list at the Dundas Arms, Kintbury, for Pounds 50. At Sotheby's on Wednesday three Nebuchadnezzars (20 bottles-worth each) of Chateau Mouton Rothschild, 1975, 1982 and 1990, were sold to a Japanese buyer for Pounds 36,300 - seven times the estimate. Some 32 other lots of Mouton raised Pounds 89,375: the first jeroboam (six bottles) of Chapoutier's Ermitage Le Pavillon 1990 sold for Pounds 572 and bottles of the Salon champagne 1979, 1976 and 1974 reached Pounds 286-Pounds 330 each.</p>

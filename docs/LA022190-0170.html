			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ROSEANNE TO SING -- FOR ELVIS  </P> <P> Two of the tabloids' favorite subjects -- Roseanne Barr and Elvis -- will be on  display for a three-night stand in San Carlos, Calif., starting Thursday.  </P> <P> It will be Barr's first stand-up show in three years, and the sitcom star says  she plans to sing an Elvis tribute as part of her act, which will also include  new husband Tom Arnold as an Elvis impersonator.  </P> <P> "I'm singing," Barr said. "I know my fans have waited a long time to hear  that." But Barr declined to give a preview of her Elvis vocals at a promotional  appearance in a $5,000-a-night penthouse suite at a San Francisco hotel. "I'm  afraid if I gave it away, they (her fans) would go wild, kind of like the 'War  of the Worlds,' " she cracked.  </P></p>

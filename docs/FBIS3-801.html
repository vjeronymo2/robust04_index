However, many of the ANC supporters who turned up at  King Zwelithini Stadium in the township north of Durban remained  behind to watch police and peace monitors trying to persuade IFP  supporters to leave the stadium. Those remaining were still  demanding the stadium be vacated. Police were negotiating with  them also.    Earlier, an IFP supporter was stabbed to death and his  vehicle set alight after he allegedly shot at ANC supporters  outside the stadium.    Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa, top ANC  official Mr Thabo Mbeki and five other ANC officials were kept  waiting while new arrangements for the rally were made. ANC  supporters were earlier teargassed by police, according to a  radio report.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 11 KYODO -- Former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa urged members of the Japan New Party (JNP) on  Saturday to take the lead in an expected further realignment of  political forces under the new electoral system.    Hosokawa told a party convention of its representatives  nationwide that "the JNP should play a pioneering role in the  second stage of political realignment even with a resolution to  dissolve the party for the sake of reform."    Hosokawa also demanded that the opposition Social Democratic  Party (SDP) [SDPJ -- Social Democratic Party of Japan] return to  the ruling coalition, saying, "if the SDP decides to join hands  with us, we will not spare any effort (to bring that about)."    The national convention is the first since the JNP was  established in May 1992.    More than 70 members of both Diet chambers and  representatives from local chapters attended the meeting, at  which they will set the party's key policies and reappoint  Hosokawa as party leader.    Hosokawa told reporters Friday [10 June] night that the  parliamentary group "Kaishin," of which the JNP is a member, is  likely to evolve into a new party within a few months.    He said Kaishin, whose members include the JNP, Shinseito  (Japan Renewal Party) and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), will  seek broad participation, including the SDP, the largest  opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the new party  Sakigake.    He said before Kaishin becomes a political party, it needs a  few months until a new electoral map is drawn for 300  single-seat districts under the new electoral system.    A new political reform law for the lower house enacted in  January calls for electing 300 legislators from single-seat  districts and 200 via proportional representation.    On allegations that he received 100 million yen as illegal  donations from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking business group,  Hosokawa told the JNP convention that Diet testimony by his  former aide Masatoshi Miyama will show his innocence.    Upon demand by opposition parties, Miyama is to testify  under  oath Wednesday at the House of Representatives budget committee  on the money scandal.    Hosokawa's questionable personal finances led his  resignation  as premier in April in part to take responsibility for a delay  in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 state budget.    "Through the testimony by my former secretary Miyama, I  think  (the opposition) can understand what I have said," Hosokawa said.    Hosokawa has repeatedly denied charges that the money was an  illicit donation, saying he took the 100 million yen from Sagawa  as a loan in 1982 and had repaid it with interest by 1991.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Disease link with meat 'inconclusive' A government-funded study released yesterday shows an apparent link between eating meat and Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease, the human equivalent of BSE or 'mad cow disease'. But the researchers said the statistical association was almost certainly a result of the way the study had been done rather than evidence that meat consumption could cause CJD. The annual report of the CJD surveillance unit in Edinburgh said the number of CJD cases in the UK fell from 55 in 1992 to 40 last year after rising for the three previous years. Statistical analysis of the cases showed no occupational link. People working with animals were no more likely than others to develop CJD. CJD victims were more likely than matched control subjects to have been regular eaters of meat, particularly veal. Dr Robert Will, the unit's director, attributed this finding to 'recall bias'. He said the only way of learning about CJD victims' diet was to ask their relatives, who inadvertently exaggerated the amount of meat eaten because there had been publicity about a possible link between BSE and CJD through beef or veal consumption. To support the 'recall bias' theory Dr Will said there was a similar excess of veal eaters among people who were suspected of having CJD when their relatives were asked about their diet but who actually turned out to have died from Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia. The study concludes: 'There is no conclusive evidence of any chance in CJD that can be attributable to BSE.' It says the apparent increase in CJD since the 1970s has been caused mainly by the fact that the disease is being recognised in people over 75 who would previously have been diagnosed as having senile dementia.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Senior Lieutenant General Dao Dinh Luyen, member </F> of the Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee and chief of  the Vietnam People's Army General Staff: "Take a New Step To  Build a Revolutionary, Regular, Seasoned, and Modern Army Step  by Step To Meet the Requirements of the Cause of National  Defense and Construction"]    [Text] To date, our Army has gone through nearly half a  century of building, combat, and development. Throughout the  course of its heroic birth and growth, our Army has proven  itself worthy of being called a revolutionary army. It has  always remained loyal to the party-initiated undertaking and the  interests of the masses and has won the people's trust,  assistance, and loving care. Now, as we enter the stage of  building and defending the socialist fatherland, our Army has to  undertake a new and very heavy task; namely, building,  consolidating, and enhancing our combat strength while  simultaneously participating in production to contribute toward  firmly maintaining political stability and promoting  socioeconomic development.    With a thorough understanding to the Seventh Party Congress  Resolution and the party Central Committee Third Plenum  Resolution on national defense and security in the new  situation, our entire Army has made serious and very great  efforts to apply these resolutions to life. As a result, we  have achieved initial but very important results and made marked  and steady progress toward building our military organization  into a revolutionary, regular, seasoned, and modern army step by  step.    Since the conclusion of the Seventh Party Congress, the  international and regional situations have developed very  quickly and have become complicated. They have had a very  great impact on our people's task of building and defending the  socialist fatherland. These days, our country enjoys peace and  stability. The renovation undertaking has brought about  important achievements and opened up great prospects. The  factors of instability, however, have not yet been eliminated.  Through the "peaceful evolution" strategy, hostile forces  abroad are collaborating with reactionary elements at home to  carry out their dark scheme, aimed at abolishing the Socialist  Republic of Vietnam. They have directed their offensive  spearhead against us on all fronts, especially on the  politico-ideological front, in a bid to sow disunity between the  Army and people, depoliticize the Army, and neutralize party  leadership over the Army. That situation requires our entire  party, people, and Army to heighten their vigilance, strengthen  national defense capabilities, and consolidate the people's  armed forces in order to stand ready to cope with every  eventuality and firmly defend our national independence,  revolutionary gains, and socialist regime.    Over the past three years, thanks to our party's correct  renovation policy and our people's efforts, we have made  comprehensive achievements in the national renovation  undertaking. We have overcome the socioeconomic crisis to a very  great extent. Our annual economic growth rate has increased  considerably and steadily. Broad sections of the population  have had their standard of living improved. Those socioeconomic  achievements have created the conditions for strengthening our  national defense capabilities, ensuring political stability, and  consolidating the people's confidence in party leadership and  their determination to pursue the socialist path chosen by  President Ho Chi Minh.    Along with the common efforts of our entire party and  people,  our Army has made a worthy contribution to building and  defending the socialist fatherland, especially in the task of  consolidating our national defense and security capabilities.  Over the past three years, by fully understanding the party's  policies and resolutions as well as the new revolutionary tasks,  our Army has continued to build and consolidate its strength in  all fields in order to enhance its revolutionary nature and  combat strength and stand ready to defend the fatherland in the  new situation. Due attention has been paid to the top priority  task of providing politico-ideological education to cadres and  combatants in order to enhance their political background.  First of all, we have improved both the form and content of the  educational campaign to promote everyone's awareness of the good  nature and fine traditions of our Army. As a result, our young  cadres and combatants these days not only take pride in their  fathers and elder brothers, but also firmly maintain and develop  these fine traditions. Due importance has been attached to our  efforts to enhance the political awareness of cadres, especially  key cadres. Learning activities have already been organized in  the framework of the Political General Department's curriculum.  Constant efforts have been made to keep everyone abreast of the  revolutionary situation and the Army's tasks, especially to make  everyone fully aware of the need to heighten vigilance against  the enemy's dark schemes and maneuvers. Besides  politico-ideological education, we have taken uniform steps to  build and revamp the party, consolidate and enhance the quality  of cadres, and renovate the forms and contents of the political  indoctrination program in our Army. As a result, we have  strengthened the leadership role and militancy of grassroots  party organizations and created conditions for a strict  application of the principle of absolute party leadership over  all aspects of Army-related activities.    Thanks to the satisfactory measures mentioned above to carry  out politico-ideological education and strengthen the party's  leadership over the Army, our cadres and combatants have  remained steadfast in the face of the enemy's psychological  warfare maneuvers and the difficulties, challenges, and major  changes in the international situation. They have constantly  believed in party leadership, firmly maintained their combat  determination and goals, and always proven themselves worthy of  being called a reliable and loyal force of the party and people.    As for the goal to revamp the militancy of the armed forces  in order to meet new requirements arising from the task of  defending the socialist fatherland, our entire Army has, over  the past three years, done many things of very fundamental and  important importance for further development. With the motto of  building an armed force of appropriate personnel strength and of  high quality, we have continued to reduce the personnel strength  of our regular force, consolidate and rearrange various units,  readjust the personnel strength of our armed services and combat  branches, and achieve a balance between our main force and our  local force to suit our strategic disposition on a national  scale and in each sensitive areas and to meet the demand for  ensuring sufficient on-site combat force for various defense  areas and a mobile combat force capable of coping with all the  situations that may arise in any areas in the country. Troop  training has been affirmed as a central task. Since 1989, our  entire army has continued to renovate the contents and  organizational methods of training with the motto of providing  basic training in a realistic and steady fashion and with the  concepts that training must be practical to combat, that lessons  of experience obtained from the past two wars of resistance must  be applied in troop training, that training must be conducted in  such a way as to develop democratic principles and to promote a  sense of voluntarism and creativity among trainees, and that  close combination must be achieved between training and  indoctrination and between theory and practice. Our entire Army  has applied these mottos and concepts scrupulously and  creatively. As a result, the quality of troop training has  further developed in an increasingly steady fashion. In  particular, over the past three years, we have paid attention to  training troops in our Army's traditional tactics, such as the  tactic of using a small force to defeat a larger enemy and the  tactic of using rudimentary means to triumph over an enemy with  sophisticated equipment. Therefore, in training, our efforts  have been directed at attaining the goal of ensuring good combat  skills for every soldier and every detachment. Soldiers must be  well-trained in detachment-level combat and in coordinated  combat involving various armed services and combat branches. In  order to evaluate its training quality, combat effectiveness,  and combat readiness, our entire Army has, over the past three  years, conducted many military drills involving units of various  sizes, from the detachment to divisional levels. With these  military drills, the Army has further improved the  organizational and leadership skills of its cadres and has  enabled cadres to familiarize themselves with "combat." Also  through training, we have drawn on many good lessons of  experiences, including experience on our residual shortcomings,  in order to ensure better training for troops. The results  obtained in troop training and indoctrination have helped  concolidate the determination and confidence of cadres and  combatants in their bid to fulfill their task of defending  national independence and sovereignty and the territorial  integrity of the fatherland.    Along with renovating our training, we have also vigorously  deployed our research on science, technology, and military arts.  We have initially resolved a number of problems arising in  combat and decided on the course for ensuring adequate equipment  for troops.    In combat, we have concentrated on summing up lessons of  experience obtained in the two past wars of resistance. On this  basis, we have been able to deploy and develop our activities  to suit the existing principles of our people's warfare and our  national defense. We have made appropriate investment in the  research and perfection of the methods of fighting in defense  areas for all the three categories of troops. We have also  stressed studying and getting to know the enemy. Therefore,  information on the enemy, including his equipment and weapons,  military doctrine, and combat tactics, has been promptly  exploited to serve our research activities. This has created a  basis for us to map out our counterpolicies and countermeasures.    Ensuring equipment for troops to meet existing and long-term  requirements is a new and difficult issue for our Army.  Proceeding from studying our realitic capabilities to learning  the experience obtained by countries with situations similar to  ours, we have basically been able to come up with appropriate  policies and lines. As an immediate task, we must concentrate  our efforts on preserving and maintaining satisfactorily our  existing equipment. As for obsolete and degraded equipment, we  must study ways to exploit to the fullest whatever is left.  Meanwhile, we must study the possibility of modernizing various  kinds of weapons and equipment to suit our combat tactics. In  the long run, we have been and are building a national defense  industry to manufacture the most essential equipment and weapons  for our troops. All these policies have been implemented by our  entire Army with great efforts and encouraging results have been  achieved. The scientific and technical cadres in the Army have  made worthy contributions and successfully carried out many  valuable scientific and technical projects.    Although building a regular army is a goal that has been  followed for many years now, the Standing Committee of the  Communist Party of Vietnam Central Committee Military Commission  recently issued a directive urging our entire Army to further  step up this move aimed at effecting an important change for the  better in the direction of military standardization. All  elements of the Army, ranging from agencies to units, have  concentrated on providing leadership and guidance to troops and  come up with substantive measures. Therefore, positive changes  for the better have been initially noted in both the thoughts  and actions of our cadres and combatants. Efforts to ensure  logistics for support of standardization have been intensified  and as has the budget earmarked for this. Therefore, all the  systems governing room and board and dress code for troops have  been improved. In particular, efforts to ensure unified  specifications for military uniforms such as color, design, and  quality have shown remarkable improvements. Troop management has  also been given constant attention by various echelons.  Therefore, changes for the better have been noted in the  maintenance of various systems of daily routine, official work,  and observance of military ceremonies and bearing. The number of  troops violating military discipline or deserting their units  has dropped sharply.    The Army's achievements scored in the past three years  after the meeting of the seventh national party congress in  military building, training, and combat readiness have proved  the great efforts exerted by our cadres and soldiers. These  achievements are very fundamental and they are creating a firm  foundation for subsequent development steps, despite some  remaining problems and shortcomings in our new requirements and  duties.    In few week's time, our Army will observe its 50th  anniversary, the age of many past challenges and experiences.  We are confidently building an Army that deserves the party and  people's expectation from an Uncle Ho Army of the people, by the  people, and for the people.    To meet that expectation, in the coming years, we have to  make more fundamental improvements to fulfill our both current  and future requirements and duties and to change our  revolutionary army to a regular, efficient, and modern army for  the protection of national independence, sovereignty, and  integrity and for our goal of making people prosperous, nation  powerful, and society civilized. The most important thing is  the education on politics, ideology, national tradition and  patriotism, and army tradition to make our cadres and soldiers  resolute in their ideology and fighting spirit and vigilant at  enemy conspiracies and tricks when they try to neutralize the  politicalization of our Army before invalidating our armed  forces. The party leadership over the Army must be further  strengthened to ensure that, in any situation, the armed forces  are absolutely reliable and loyal to the party and national  interests. The Army must increase its socioeconomic activities  and mass mobilization work to improve its public relations,  unite with the people, and preserve its nature as an army of the  people and one who fights for the people.    The improvement of our Army's capacity for fighting is an  urgent issue. Therefore, it is necessary to concentrate all our  efforts to accomplish these tasks:    1. Further accelerating the military standardization:    We must thoroughly understand the contents and requirements  of military standardization. Standardization is not only a  formality but also a necessary demand for a revolutionary army  to create high unity in conception and action, from military  organs to units and from cadres to soldiers for the creation of  a combined strength.    Military standardization is a long-term undertaking. But in  1994, we must strive to standardize the practice in military  training, combat readiness, and personnel and equipment  management. Especially, we must establish working regulations  for each military position. We must introduce uniforms for the  entire Army, creating a new image worthy of the honor and pride  of an heroic army. Together with fine uniforms, we have to train  the troops in military protocol, proper behavior for soldiers,  and working relations according to Army regulations.    2. Further improve military training:    All units must understand that military training is a  regular  and permanent task in peace time. In the past three years, due  to the reform of the training programs, methods, and  organization, we have achieved relatively complete results with  useful experiences. On that basis, we need to bring the  technological and tactical skills to a higher level.    We must continue to provide soldiers with fundamental,  practical, and sound training suitable to the particular duties  of each unit. For the main force, we must train soldiers to  fight with assigned weapons by themselves and together with  other Army branches and forces. For the local and militia  forces, we must train them to fight in small units and attack  the enemy's area, logistic establishments, and storage  facilities, how to maintain social order and security, and how  to protect the government and people at the grassroots level.    In the training process, the creativity of each cadre and  soldier must be developed to make them become more flexible and  active in combat. The training must concentrate on current  requirements in order to enhance their capacity to deal with all  forms of military intervention by enemy forces when they try to  provide support to peaceful evolution and violently overthrow  activities of reactionary domestic groups.    3. Continuing to build completely strong units according to  five requirements set forth by the National Defense Ministry.    Through review, experiences drawn from exemplary units  should  be widely applied in the remaining units. We have to do our  best to eliminate weak units and stop desertion. Experience  proves that if there is a close coordination between recruitment  units and local authorities in troop management and education  and in dealing with deserted soldiers, the desertion problem  will be overcome. Better care for spiritual and material life  is also very important to help the soldiers feel more attached  to their units and to carry out their duties. The building of  completely strong units must be linked with efforts to improve  party building work and other movements to create great change  in each military unit and the entire armed force.    Consequently, the three duties of military standardization,  training, and building are closely linked in a chain reaction.  Therefore, in the implementation process, all units need to  carry out uniform planning for these three duties. They must  not look down on any duty, but consider the military  standardization a regular and permanent task.    Soon, the Army will celebrate its 50th anniversary. The  entire force should launch emulative movements to improve the  sense of responsibility in all cadres and soldiers. They should  urge each other to do their best in their military achievements  to take the Army to new heights to meet the expectations of the  party and people in protecting independence, sovereignty, and  national integrity and maintaining peace and stability for  national construction and development. Their goals continue to  be to make people prosperous, the nation powerful, and society  civilized.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has condemned Israel's  abduction of al-Hajj Mustafa al-Dirani from his home in Qasr  Naba, Ba'labakk, at dawn on Saturday, describing it as a  violation of international law. Buwayz began contacts with  several world circles and Lebanon's permanent delegation at the  United Nations a few hours after the abduction to secure  al-Dirani's early release.    Buwayz said: I strongly condemn this act, which is an  aggression against Lebanon's security and compromises the Middle  East peace process at a time when the ongoing negotiations and  contacts seek a solution to the crisis.    A diplomatic source at the Foreign Ministry said Lebanese  diplomatic contacts are under way to discuss lodging a complaint  with the Security Council against Israel.</p>

			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Yeltsin ready to abandon referendum PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin said yesterday he was prepared to drop plans for a controversial referendum on whether the president or parliament should rule Russia, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. After Mr Valery Zorkin, the chairman of the Constitutional Court, and heads of republics within the Russian Federation joined opposition to the poll, Mr Yeltsin said: 'Let us proclaim 1993 the year of a moratorium on all political fist-fighting and other major political events. Let us deal with the economy. This is the main thing that can ruin us.' The referendum plan was born of a compromise at last December's Congress of People's Deputies between the president and parliament to try to break Russia's constitutional impasse. But Mr Yeltsin has become concerned that the referendum may not turn out to be such a simple solution.</p>

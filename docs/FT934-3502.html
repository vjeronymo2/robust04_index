			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries slip as prices of crude oil recover With crude oil prices firming, US Treasury bonds slipped yesterday morning after the vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve said vigilance was required on inflation in view of the economy's growth rate. By midday, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 101, and the yield rose to 6.17 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  3/32 at 100 3/32 , to yield 4.183 per cent. After the long bond surged nearly a point on Monday, selling pressure resurfaced as oil prices firmed on the Nymex. Crude oil futures had tumbled to five-year lows late in the previous session. Bond activity remained light, however, ahead of the release later this week of November price data, which are expected to show inflation is in check, at least for the moment. Traders now appear less concerned with current conditions than with possible developments in the first quarter of next year. Comments by Mr David Mullins, the Fed vice-chairman, served to support the view that the central bank could move to increase short-term interest rates sooner rather than later. His remarks held bond prices in negative territory, aided by profit-taking by dealers and speculative buyers, who had helped bid up the market during the past two sessions. UK government bonds slipped by between  1/16 and  1/4 point ahead of today's gilt auction, with stock in the auction area experiencing the largest declines. The Bank of England is auctioning Pounds 3bn of 6 3/4 per cent stock due 2004, and dealers said the 10-year area of the curve underperformed other maturities as market-makers and clients prepared for the sale of stock. Despite the release of a batch of 'bond-negative' news yesterday, German government bonds rallied and closed firmer, though off the highs of the day. The upward revision in October money supply data came as a disappointment since market participants had expected any adjustment to be downwards: M3 money supply grew at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent, up from the provisional 6.8 per cent reported last month, However, even less encouraging was the release of higher than expected GDP figures, which showed that western German GDP grew by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in the third quarter. The high-yielding European bond markets saw strong gains initially, with Spain following Germany's strength early in the day and rising three-quarters of a point, helped by renewed foreign interest. The Italian government bond market also saw a good rise on the back of confidence in the political situation, but lost some of the gains when news emerged that the treasurer of the Italy's federalist Northern League party had been arrested on suspicion of corruption. Prices ended about a quarter point higher. Dutch government bonds closed firmer, with the new tap stock providing the main focus of attention in the market. The finance ministry said the tap sale of the new 5.75 per cent bond due 2004 raised Fl 1.8bn yesterday after Monday's Fl 7.5bn. Today will be the last day of the tap sale. Japanese government bonds continued to climb to new intra-day highs, prompted by hopes of a cut in the official discount rate, but prices slipped back on profit-taking to end the day little changed overall. The March futures contract rose from its opening level of 116.58 to touch a high of 116.69 before closing at 116.54. In the cash market, the yield on the benchmark No 157 JGB opened at 3.15 per cent and ended at 3.185 per cent, corresponding to the low price of the day. Market participants said several contributing factors were driving the rate cut hopes. Last week, Bank of Japan and government officials were reported to be predicting an ODR cut in the week of December 13. At the same time, the central bank has allowed money market rates to slip below 2 per cent, which some regard as a sign that an official rate cut is in the wings. The steady stream of depressing economic news is expected to continue with the release this week of third-quarter GDP figures and the release on Friday of the quarterly Tankan survey of business sentiment, which is expected to be gloomy. Mr Gerard Lyons, international economist at DKB International, predicts that GDP will fall by 1.0 per cent quarter-on-quarter: 'I'm expecting to see the biggest quarter-on-quarter drop since the first quarter of 1974.'</p>

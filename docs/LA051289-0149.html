			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> TRUCK BLAZE PROMPTS WARNINGS, EVACUATION  </P> <P> Residents near Aliso Viejo were advised to stay in their homes with the windows  shut and several businesses were evacuated Thursday when fire broke out on a  flatbed truck carrying materials that officials feared were toxic.  </P> <P> It was later determined that the materials -- biodegradable soap and another  nontoxic cleaning solution -- were not hazardous.  </P> <P> Orange County Fire Department officials temporarily closed the southbound exit  of Interstate 5 at Crown Valley Parkway and evacuated workers at businesses  near the intersection of the parkway and Forbes Road at about 11 a.m. Thursday  when the unmarked containers on the truck caught fire, Fire Department  spokesman John Hamilton said.  </P> <P> The fire began as an electrical fire in the truck's cab but eventually spread  to the back of the truck and ignited the containers, Hamilton said. The driver,  whose name was not immediately available, was not injured.  </P> <P> Residents in the area were told to stay in their homes with their windows shut  until the fire was extinguished, which took less than 10 minutes, Hamilton  said.  </P> <P> However, a residual cloud remained, and officials were not immediately certain  if the containers' contents were hazardous. Later testing proved that they were  not, Hamilton said.  </P></p>

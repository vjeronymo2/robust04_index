			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BARGAIN CORNER: DOWN UNDER COUPONS  </P> <P> Down Under hotel coupons, good at more than 60 hotels in Australia, New  Zealand, Tahiti and Fiji and valid through March 31, 1990, are available from  Southern Pacific Hotel Corp. One must buy a minimum of 12 at $38 per coupon, a  discount from regular rates.  </P> <P> Most of the hotels are in Australia and New Zealand. Two to four coupons per  room are required for a one-night stay at the hotels, except for one property  in Tahiti, where five may be needed.  </P> <P> The number of coupons hotels take may vary depending on the time of year, and  the hotels may not always honor the coupons. So check beforehand. More coupons  will be required for a room during the October-April high season.  </P> <P> Coupons have to be bought in the United States. Hotel reservations can be made  either before departure or overseas. Booking the first night abroad while still  in the United States is always a good idea. The coupons don't have to be used  on consecutive nights.  </P> <P> Although the cost of a coupon is frozen to the end of this year, the rate could  go up in 1990. Also, Southern Pacific may add a surcharge if there's a major  fluctuation in the exchange rate.  </P> <P> When sharing a room with an adult, children 18 or younger can stay free.  </P> <P> Among the cities with hotels in this program are Sydney, Melbourne, Cairns,  Canberra, Brisbane, Darwin, Perth and Alice Springs in Australia; Auckland,  Rotorua, Wellington, Christchurch and Queenstown in New Zealand, and Suva and  Nadi, Fiji, and Papeete in Tahiti.  </P> <P> No refunds if the minimum 12 coupons aren't used. However, there's a refund for  extra unused coupons, minus a handling fee of $10 per order.  </P> <P> Contact travel agents or Southern Pacific Hotel at toll-free (800) 252-2155 or  (213) 557-2424.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> French Rail and Hertz are continuing their Hertz Euraildrive Escape program.  The 1989 program offers seven days of rail travel and three car-rental days  over 21 days for $269 per person.  </P> <P> Two people have to travel together, with the rail portion only on first-class.  The offer is good throughout most of Europe, and you don't have to visit  France. There may be a VAT charge on the car rental.  </P> <P> The passes have to be bought in the United States and are valid for six months  from the date of issue. Contact travel agents.  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> Update: Aerolineas Argentinas has revised its Visit Argentina pass, as of March  1. Instead of a 14-day pass for $199 and 30-day pass for $290, you can now buy  4 one-way flight coupons to fly within the country for $199; 6 coupons, $249; 8  coupons, $299, and 10 coupons for $349.  </P> <P> The coupons must be used within 30 days. They have to be purchased in the  United States, and you now have to fly to Argentina on Aerolineas Argentinas.  JACK ADLER  </P></p>

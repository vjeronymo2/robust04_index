			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Land hoarders under fire from HK bank Hong Kong's largest financial institution yesterday implicitly criticised property developers for hoarding land but warned the government against drastic measures in cooling the colony's overheated property market. The Hongkong Bank said in a report that the best way to bring high property prices down was to increase the supply of land for development. A 'more desirable pattern of price behaviour' could be achieved if steps were taken to ensure this better land supply was developed quickly and 'not simply added to developers' land banks'. But the bank warned the Hong Kong government, which has initiated an inquiry into high property prices, against taking any precipitate action. The colony's economy would be severely damaged if the government adopted a set of measures leading to a collapse in the market, it added. Most personal wealth in Hong Kong is bound up in property, either through direct ownership or the stock market. More than 50 per cent of the earnings of stocks included in the Hang Seng index are directly dependent on property. The property market last cracked in the aftermath of the Tiananmen massacre in June 1989. Earlier this month, the government set up a task force to recommend measures the administration should take to curb the market. It is expected to report to Governor Chris Patten in three months, but there is evidence that the announcement of this inquiry has already had an effect. Property agents have reported a fall-off in transactions this month, as would-be purchasers hold back awaiting the government's measures. Prices have responded, with values for a standard 600 sq ft to 800 sq ft flat falling about 10-15 per cent. In the first three months of the year, prices reportedly rose 20-30 per cent. They have been propelled upwards by mainland Chinese investors, many whom pay in cash, buying into the market as a hedge against inflation and a possible devaluation of the yuan. The Hongkong Bank highlighted the role of property developers as financiers. In the first three months of this year, developers provided finance for more than 60 per cent of the new properties offered for sale.</p>

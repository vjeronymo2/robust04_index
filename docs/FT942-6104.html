			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Squeeze on margins halves Plysu to Pounds 5.4m An erosion in margins sharply reduced profits at Plysu, the plastic container manufacturer, in the year to March 31. It yesterday reported pre-tax profits down almost 50 per cent from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 5.43m. Sales were up by 2.7 per cent to Pounds 88.8m (Pounds 86.4m). Mr David O'Shaughnessy, chairman, said the results were disappointing although he considered the year successful because of the development of new products and investment in plant and equipment. Plysu had issued a profits warning in October, just after Mr O'Shaughnessy was brought in as chairman in September. The dairy and juice division, which in the period increased its share of the UK milk and fruit juice containers market to 66 per cent, secured several long-term supply contracts. Two new factories were commissioned during the year, new products were introduced and additional capacity was brought on stream. Operating profit from continuing operations fell from Pounds 10.9m to Pounds 7.39m. Exceptional reorganisation costs of Pounds 1.4m covered closing some UK plants. Mr O'Shaughnessy said Plysu remained committed to its continental European businesses despite over-capacity in the industrial containers sector and the poor economic climate. There were signs of sustained improvement in the UK market, he said. Earnings shrank to 7.3p (15.3p). An unchanged final dividend of 5p is proposed, maintaining the total at 7p.</p>

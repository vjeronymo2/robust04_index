			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UK Company News: TV Enterprise buys 15% stake in Portman Television Enterprise and Asset Management, a media fund backed by Robert Fleming and the Rockefeller Company of the US, has made its largest single investment. Together with Primetime, the independent producer and distributor of television programmes, it is paying Pounds 2.9m for a 15 per cent interest in Portman Entertainment, another UK independent. Portman holds a catalogue of 1,500 hours of programmes, including popular dramas such as Home and Away. Television Enterprise was set up a year ago to provide funding for UK production in return for minority stakes in independent companies. The stake in Portman is the fourth it has made. It has also taken strategic interests in Workhouse, which has an output deal with Meridian, and Tiger Television, producers of the award-winning Mr Bean series. As part of the deal, RPTA, Primetime's programme distribution arm, will handle both the existing catalogue and future output of Portman.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Wheels offshoot sold as AAF losses rise to Pounds 34m AAF Industries, the building systems company, yesterday said it was selling Alloy Wheels International and its 49 per cent stake in Kent Properties for Pounds 19m to Murray &amp; Roberts Engineering of South Africa. It also announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 33.7m for 1993 on total turnover of Pounds 78.8m. It compares with a pre-tax profit of Pounds 4.76m on turnover of Pounds 72m. AWI, the biggest aluminium alloy wheel maker in the UK, will retain its borrowings of Pounds 10.2m. The disposal leaves AAF with pro forma net worth of Pounds 21m, compared with Pounds 35m at the end of 1992. Without the proceeds, which will be used to pay off Pounds 6.7m of debt and provide working capital, net worth would be Pounds 15.4m. AWI, which was bought by AAF for Pounds 13.2m three years ago, made profits of Pounds 722,000 on turnover of Pounds 31.8m last year. It had net assets of Pounds 12.3m at December 31. Mr Alex Brown, who took over as chief executive last summer, said yesterday that the group would have considered selling at the Pounds 19m offer price whatever the financial circumstances. As it was, AAF could now stop negotiating with its banks and get on with running the remaining business. The group's problems stemmed from the expansion of its prefabricated building manufacturing business in Blackburn into an on-site contractor. Mr Brown said sorting out the problems had proved 'a painful and difficult exercise'. The site was now closed. The closure and other reorganisation costs accounted for Pounds 24.5m of the latest loss, including a total of Pounds 4.9m of goodwill written off. A further Pounds 1.5m of goodwill was written off on the disposal of Diamond, its US modular building subsidiary, for Dollars 33.3m (Pounds 22.2m) last November. The group has also written down by Pounds 3.5m its operating assets of the hire and site services business. Net interest payable was Pounds 3.31m (Pounds 2.1m). Losses per share were 157p, compared with earnings of 24p last year. The board is not recommending a final dividend.</p>

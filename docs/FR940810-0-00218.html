The percentage determined by microscopy is multiplied by the fractions remaining after pre-preparation steps to give the percentage in the original sample. For example:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=24 g=1 f=1 --> Step 1. 60% remains after heating at 550  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C for 1 h.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 2. 30% of the residue of step 1 remains after dissolution of carbonate in 0.1 m HCl.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Step 3.

For samples where asbestos was identified, but is less than 1.0%, report ``Asbestos present, less than 1.0%.'' There must have been at least two observed fibers or fiber bundles in the two preparations to be reported as present. For samples where asbestos was not seen, report as ``None Detected.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Auxiliary Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the subjective nature of asbestos analysis, certain concepts and procedures need to be discussed in more depth. This information will help the analyst understand why some of the procedures are carried out the way they are.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4.1. Light  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Light is electromagnetic energy. It travels from its source in packets called quanta. It is instructive to consider light as a plane wave. The light has a direction of travel. Perpendicular to this and mutually perpendicular to each other, are two vector components. One is the magnetic vector and the other is the electric vector. We shall only be concerned with the electric vector. In this description, the interaction of the vector and the mineral will describe all the observable phenomena. From a light source such a microscope illuminator, light travels in all different direction from the filament.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any given direction away from the filament, the electric vector is perpendicular to the direction of travel of a light ray. While perpendicular, its orientation is random about the travel axis. If the electric vectors from all the light rays were lined up by passing the light through a filter that would only let light rays with electric vectors oriented in one direction pass, the light would then be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> POLARIZED.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Polarized light interacts with matter in the direction of the electric vector. This is the polarization direction. Using this property it is possible to use polarized light to probe different materials and identify them by how they interact with light.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant at about 2.99&times;108 m/s. When light travels in different materials such as air, water, minerals or oil, it does not travel at this speed. It travels slower. This slowing is a function of both the material through which the light is traveling and the wavelength or frequency of the light. In general, the more dense the material, the slower the light travels. Also, generally, the higher the frequency, the slower the light will travel. The ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to that in a material is called the index of refraction (n). It is usually measured at 589 nm (the sodium D line). If white light (light containing all the visible wavelengths) travels through a material, rays of longer wavelengths will travel faster than those of shorter wavelengths, this separation is called dispersion. Dispersion is used as an identifier of materials as described in Section 4.6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=3 --> 4.2. Material Properties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Materials are either amorphous or crystalline. The difference between these two descriptions depends on the positions of the atoms in them. The atoms in amorphous materials are randomly arranged with no long range order. An example of an amorphous material is glass. The atoms in crystalline materials, on the other hand, are in regular arrays and have long range order. Most of the atoms can be found in highly predictable locations. Examples of crystalline material are salt, gold, and the asbestos minerals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is beyond the scope of this method to describe the different types of crystalline materials that can be found, or the full description of the classes into which they can fall. However, some general crystallography is provided below to give a foundation to the procedures described.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of anthophyllite, all the asbestos minerals belong to the monoclinic crystal type. The unit cell is the basic repeating unit of the crystal and for monoclinic crystals can be described as having three unequal sides, two 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; angles and one angle not equal to 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;. The orthorhombic group, of which anthophyllite is a member has three unequal sides and three 90 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; angles. The unequal sides are a consequence of the complexity of fitting the different atoms into the unit cell. Although the atoms are in a regular array, that array is not symmetrical in all directions. There is long range order in the three major directions of the crystal. However, the order is different in each of the three directions. This has the effect that the index of refraction is different in each of the three directions. Using polarized light, we can investigate the index of refraction in each of the directions and identify the mineral or material under investigation. The indices  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> ,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> b <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  are used to identify the lowest, middle, and highest index of refraction respectively. The x direction, associated with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  is called the fast axis. Conversely, the z direction is associated with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  and is the slow direction. Crocidolite has  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> a <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  along the fiber length making it ``length-fast''. The remainder of the asbestos minerals have the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=6 f=1 --> g <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  axis along the fiber length. They are called ``length-slow''. This orientation to fiber length is used to aid in the identification of asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4.3. Polarized Light Technique  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Polarized light microscopy as described in this section uses the phase-polar microscope described in Section 3.2. A phase contrast microscope is fitted with two polarizing elements, one below and one above the sample. The polarizers have their polarization directions at right angles to each other. Depending on the tests performed, there may be a compensator between these two polarizing elements. A compensator is a piece of mineral with known properties that ``compensates'' for some deficiency in the optical train. Light emerging from a polarizing element has its electric vector pointing in the polarization direction of the element. The light will not be subsequently transmitted through a second element set at a right angle to the first element. Unless the light is altered as it passes from one element to the other, there is no transmission of light.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> 4.4.

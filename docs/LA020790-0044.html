			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RANCHER HAD RIGHT TO KILL DOG, JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> A San Fernando Superior Court judge has ruled that a Canyon Country rancher  charged with cruelty to animals for shooting a neighbor's dog had a right to  kill the animal because it was trespassing on his property and threatening his  livestock.  </P> <P> Judge John P. Farrell on Monday dismissed the charges against Ernest Lynn  Reubens, 59, who shot Freckles, a brown and white springer spaniel belonging to  4-year-old Erica Owen. Farrell said he based his decision on a section of the  Food and Agriculture code that allows livestock owners to shoot any dog  trespassing on their property.  </P> <P> Farrell dismissed the charges after the closing arguments in Reubens' second  trial.  </P> <P> A first trial ended in a mistrial in December.  </P></p>

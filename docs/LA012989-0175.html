			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE HOMELESS AND GOVERNMENT SALARIES  </P> <P> On Jan. 8, nine members of the First Presbyterian Church in Anaheim assembled  in the kitchen of the First Presbyterian Church in Fullerton at 5 a.m. to  prepare breakfast for the 72 adults and six children who had taken refuge from  the cold in the social hall of the church.  </P> <P> Because of the high cost of housing in Orange County, many low-income residents  are unable to earn enough to pay for the cost of housing, therefore, they have  had to move to the streets or camp in their automobiles.  </P> <P> In reference to the federal budget I find the federal pay raise and the  increase in pensions for senior government officials extremely hard to  understand, much less accept. How can the American people justify the high cost  of salaries and pensions for our legislators when so many of our nation's  people cannot afford housing?  </P> <P> CAROLYN S. BUCHANAN  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Shipyard tactic aims to sink Le Pen THE FRENCH government has given its blessing to attempts to re-open a bankrupt shipyard near Marseilles, attracting opposition allegations of underhand electioneering tactics ahead of tomorrow's regional poll. The yard, at La Ciotat, is an historic industrial symbol in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region, where the extreme right-wing National Front has had a big lead in opinion polls, ahead of conservatives and Mr Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant businessman backed by the Socialists. The district or departmental authority has just bought La Ciotat's assets from Banque Worms, a nationalised bank which took them over two years after Nordmed, the former operator, went into liquidation in 1987. The local authority has been keen to re-open the yard with Lexmar, the Swedish shipbuilder, ever since its demise, but it was only earlier this week that a formerly sceptical government gave its go-ahead for negotiations. This followed an announcement by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister, that he was prepared to give a 'helping hand' to attempts to refloat the yard, so long as no state aid was expected. Lexmar was yesterday preparing a rescue package, with local investors, to offer to the departmental authority. Previously, the government had resisted rescue attempts on the grounds that the yard could never become competitive. Any rescue attempt would have to get agreement from the European Commission, which allowed the French government to pay out FFr2bn (Pounds 206m) of redundancy aid on condition that the yard was taken out of production. But French officials say the restriction was only for five years, until March 1993.</p>

			<p><P> March 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUPREME COURT ON CHILD ABUSE  </P> <P> I was fortunate to be able to hear oral argument in Deshaney vs. Winnebago  County Dept. of Social Services on Nov. 2, 1988, and to read David Savage's  article on the case ("Rehnquist Court Restricting Constitutional Protections,"  Part I, Feb. 24). Counsel for Deshaney argued that the child had been taken  from the father by the county and in court proceedings the child was returned  with the agreement that the social worker would make frequent checks on the  child's safety. She did not do so. She entered in her notes that she strongly  believed the next time she saw the child he would be dead or seriously injured.  This came to pass. Under questioning, the state's attorney admitted that if the  child were in a foster home, the state would be liable.  </P> <P> No matter the labels we attribute to Chief Justice William Rehnquist and the  court's majority, we are departing from the political theory our Constitution  was founded upon. Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau wrote on the social  contract as the underpinnings of an orderly society. We gave up some of our  liberties to the state in exchange for protection and safety. This was a higher  level of civilization from a state of nature, or anarchy, where some lived  outside the law. Their teachings were endorsed by Thomas Jefferson and carried  over into our Constitution.  </P> <P> How strange to hear the chief justice expound that "The 14th Amendment was  intended to prevent government from abusing its power. . . ." Is it not an  abuse of power for the government to operate a police force, as its sole  monopoly, to protect its citizens and refuse to do so?  </P> <P> BRUCE M. STARK  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

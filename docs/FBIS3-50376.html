			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Damir Jurisic: "Abdic's Dubrovnik-Republic"] </F>   [Text] Ever since 28 September last year, when the  constituent assembly, chaired by Fikret Abdic, declared in  Velika Kladusa the autonomous province of west Bosnia, making it  a separate administrative unit within the union of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the assessments and statements of support or  denial of the act have not ceased. As is known, the first to  oppose the declaration was the SDA [Party of Democratic Action]  of Bihac, then Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, declared the act  unconstitutional, and finally asked the 5th Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army to put an end, by military means, to  what in his opinion was a short episode of his political  opponent, with whom he separated soon after the SDA won the  elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Fikret Abdic replied with the  proclamation in which he invited "all the citizens, especially  the fighters, to defend the people, freedom, democracy, and  human dignity with weapons and other means." The national  defense of west Bosnia was founded, and it prevented the 5th  Corps from controlling the entire territory. The present  demarcation line between Izetbegovic's and Abdic's army is  somewhere between Cazin and Velika Kladusa.    Croatian president Tudjman supported Abdic's idea of  autonomy; shortly after Abdic concluded another agreement with  Radovan Karadzic concerning free trade in the Serb-controlled  territory, trucks loaded with goods and buses carrying  passengers started taking the road connecting Kladusa and  Karlovac. The reporters in the area say that the prices are  indeed high, but that there are no shortages. There is Franck  coffee [Croatian] as well as Pancevo beer. Abdic trades with  everyone and he makes no secret of it. On the contrary, he  often points out that this form of cooperation with the  neighbors who were at one time his war enemies is the only way  to survive. The cochairmen of the peace conference on the  former Yugoslavia, Owen and Stoltenberg, also acknowledged his  project by inviting him to participate in the talks and by  giving a positive assessment of his political initiative.  According to his own statement, Abdic's basis for establishing  autonomy comes from the Geneva peace package for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to which this state is to be  organized on the basis of constituent units. The authorities in  the province were established through autonomous acts and laws,  the purpose of which is "to secure constitutionality and rule of  law, human rights and freedom, market economy, and the equality  of all peoples, cultures, and religions."  <H5>  The Muslim Island </H5>   According to the 1991 census, 245,435 people lived on the  territory of the autonomous province of west Bosnia (Bihac,  Cazin, Velika Kladusa, and Bosanska Krupa, which is now partly  under the control of the Bosnian Serbs). Muslims were 80.05  percent of that figure, 13 percent were Serbs, 3 percent Croats,  and the remaining 3 percent others. The territory covers a  little less than 2,500 square kilometers. The Zagreb-Split  railroad passes through Bihac, being the only connection between  northern Croatia and Dalmatia; there is also an important road  connecting Banja Luka with Knin and Split, and the road  connecting western Herzegovina with Zagreb. The most important  road for the province is the Bihac-Cazin-Velika Kladusa-Karlovac  road, continuing toward Rijeka or Zagreb. If this road is not  open, West Bosnia cannot exist, because the road is also the  connection with the sea, where, as geopolitician Topalovic says,  it exercises its transit rights in the free zone of the port of  Rijeka, rather than its territorial achievements.    The autonomous province of west Bosnia is, by its  geopolitical position, a Muslim island, which is, in the east,  separated by Karadzic's state from Travnik by over a hundred  kilometers. Travnik is controlled by Izetbegovic's  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. There are, therefore, no possibilities  of creating a corridor by the assumed war operations that would  connect these two distant territories. In peace time, Bihac and  Kladusa had more connections with Zagreb than with Sarajevo.  Businessmen say that the province, due to its natural  orientation toward Karlovac, Rijeka, and Zagreb, was in fact  part of the Croatian economic territory. Therefore, at the east  of the province are the Bosnian Serbs, while its other three  sides have, from the Serbian aggression against Croatia, been  controlled by the Croatian Serbs. The international community  calls the territory of the "Krajina" parastate the "Croatian  UNPA's" (north and south). If, according to the Vance plan,  which is a supplement to the Security Council resolutions, the  UNPA's are reintegrated in the Croatian constitutional and legal  system, then the Glina district would be in the north of west  Bosnia, the Knin district in the south, and the territory of the  municipality of Slunj, which, until the occupation, had a Croat  majority, would bear on the province from the west. According  to geopolitician Topalovic, the main points of support that  permit control of the Autonomous Province of West Bosnia are  mountains: Petrova Gora (Kordun), Zrinska Gora (Banija), Grmec  (Bosanska Krajina), and Pljesivica (Lika). All these mountains  are controlled by the Serbs, and there is no realistic support  for the claim that the Muslim forces from West Bosnia would have  any success in a war conflict with the Serbs. Thanks to the  military aid that arrived in these territories through Croatia,  the Muslims managed to defend themselves -- with more or less  success (they lost Prijedor, Sanski Most, and parts of Bosanska  Krupa) -- probably because the Serbs were satisfied with the  territories they had occupied. According to military estimates,  the Muslims from west Bosnia have no chance of retrieving the  lost territory by military means -- because they are isolated  and because of the balance of power.  <H5>  The Agreement With the Croats and the Serbs </H5>   As opposed to Izetbegovic, who, despite the circumstances,  forces the Muslim conflict with the Serbs, who completely  surround them, Abdic seeks a different solution. Realizing that  he is the inferior party, and that, without free roads, his  enclave would be doomed to a quiet death, while wanting to keep  the people and the territory under his rule, Abdic offered  agreements to the Serbs and Croats on the principle of "I give  to you, you give to me". He offered the Serbs transit through  the railroad to Knin in return for the passage through the road  to Karlovac, and the Croats the transit expenses for the free  zone in the port of Rijeka. Abdic has already announced the  consequence of such agreements: "The future west Bosnia will be  a free customs country with the stable economic support of the  great Croatian port of Rijeka, which is to function as a free  customs zone." Zlatko Jusic, prime minister of the autonomous  province of west Bosnia, tried to clarify this statement during  a short talk in Zagreb: "The free customs zone would be  introduced for a period of two years. What we do not have would  arrive in the province under favorable conditions, and what we  do have would be easier to transport abroad. Consequently, we  would not be isolated, our people would not leave, and an  economic environment favorable to development would thus be  created. As soon as conditions allowed, we would carry out the  privatization of ownership; we would do it even through decrees,  since we see that the democratic system slows down the process.  We are aware that the finishing of the process, with the free  transit of people and goods, is the precondition for our joining  Western, that is, the European civilization. This is our goal,  and we will not give up on it."    The differences between the two concepts of organizing West  Bosnia are now clearer. Izetbegovic's consists of a long-term  war and the population surviving thanks to humanitarian aid and  hoping for international military intervention, which creates  favorable conditions for religious extremism, while Abdic, aware  of the circumstances, is trying to preserve the people through  negotiations and provide not only an existence for them, but  also a living in accordance with the European standards.  <H5>  Whom Does West Bosnia Belong To? </H5>   Looking at Croatian history, one can see that the diplomacy  of the Republic of Dubrovnik made moves similar to Abdic's.  This little oasis of Croatian statehood was for centuries  building its prosperity by negotiating rather than employing its  military forces against its powerful neighbors (Venice,  Turkey....). Naturally, it paid for its freedom, but it in turn  earned the money from those it gave money to, since every  Dubrovnik contract included a clause stating that the Dubrovnik  tradesmen had free passage through a certain empire or kingdom  (naturally, a comparison with Apolonije's recent attempt at  founding a Dubrovnik republic would not be valid, since  Dubrovnik is connected to Croatia by continuous territory, and  because a separate Croatian state did not exist at the time of  the founding of the Republic of Dubrovnik).    However, Abdic is in an even worse position than the people  of Dubrovnik, as they at least had an open passage into the  world through the sea, while his West Bosnia is completely  surrounded. His policy therefore has no alternative if there is  a desire to preserve the people and the territory. If there is  the desire to be the victim, all it takes is to yield to the  myths of the past and to unrealistic ambitions. Everything will  be over very soon. "Izetbegovic is still trying to make the  Cazin Krajina a mass grave of the Muslim people, as he has done  in other parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina," said Abdic, aware of what  disaster this policy would lead to. However, it seems that this  policy cannot come about in West Bosnia. That is, it is almost  completely unimportant who is going to win in the inter-Muslim  conflict in West Bosnia. If Abdic wins, he will carry out his  planned policy of alliance, and should by any chance  Izetbegovic's forces win, they will also have to carry out  Abdic's policies if they want the people and the territory to  survive.    Through history, this province had leaders who easily  changed  military uniforms and allies, keeping in mind only the existence  of the enclave. This is what Huska Miljkovic, the leader of the  Muslim militia of the time, did during World War II. For a  while he was an Ustasha, and the next moment he was a partisan.  However, he preserved the people. This spirit of an autonomous  enclave is at the same time the message to those who believe  that the autonomous province of west Bosnia will take either the  Serbian or the Croatian side. It will take the side of whoever  is at its borders, unable to change its neighbor, but, weaker in  military terms, capable of making a bearable ally out of them.  However, in doing so, it will always remain its own, as it has  for the past several centuries. Therefore, the thesis offered  the Croats -- "central Bosnia for western Bosnia" -- is nothing  but an unfounded evocation of something that will never happen.</p>

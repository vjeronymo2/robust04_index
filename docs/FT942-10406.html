			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Nigeria wonders when its turn will come While the Nigerian military leadership was in Pretoria to witness the start of South Africa's majority rule, many of Nigeria's 88m people were at home wondering when their turn would come. Nigerians' admiration for South Africa's transfer of power is mixed with realisation that South Africa can now claim the title to which Nigeria has long aspired: foremost black African state. Mr Mandela's inauguration is poignant for Nigeria, which has championed black majorities in southern Africa more successfully than it has resolved its own political problems. Nearly seven months after Gen Sani Abacha seized power, promising a swift transition to lasting democracy, Nigeria is no nearer civilian rule than when the armed forces took over a decade ago. 'I wish Abacha had worn army uniform instead of the agbada (traditional dress) to show the world we have military rule,' said a Nigerian after watching the inauguration on television. There will be no political activity until next year at least, after a national constitutional conference, supposed to be starting on June 27, has debated and passed its recommendations to the government before the drafting of a new constitution. Until next year, political parties are illegal, all democratically-elected institutions are dissolved, and all political activity is banned. The conference was Gen Abacha's idea. Many hoped it would be a sovereign conference in which Nigerians could resolve some of the country's political problems, not least the role of central government and minorities representation. But the goodwill evaporated as the government delayed the start date for the conference and began to limit its scope and powers. The Campaign for Democracy (CD) has refused to share in or support the conference and has called for a boycott of the election of 270 delegates, due to start on May 23. 'This conference is a ruse, designed to buy time for a military regime in no hurry to go,' says Mr Sylvester Odion-Akhaine, the CD's general secretary in Lagos. 'The regime has removed all substance from the conference. If the government disapproves of any of the elected delegates, it can replace them at any stage. How can the divergent views of a country like Nigeria coalesce when a ban exists on all pre-conference political activity?' Information Minister Jerry Gana denies this charge. 'The constitutional conference is definitely not a ploy to buy time; we believe we are answering the yearnings of Nigerians,' he said recently. Since then, Gen Abacha has said his Provisional Ruling Council will vet the outcome of the conference's report. Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, has said the final report of the conference will be written by a commission appointed by the military. That commission will in turn report to a political bureau, to be appointed by the regime, which will draft the constitution. 'The so-called constitutional conference is unnecessary,' says Mr Moshood Abiola, who won the majority in last June's annulled presidential election. 'We don't need it because when you have held an election, the next step should be the formation of an elected government. We have not had that.'</p>

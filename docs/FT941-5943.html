			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Secret service 'out of control' A parliamentary report has criticised Mr Nicola Mancino, Italy's interior minister, for failing to exercise proper control of the domestic intelligence services, writes Robert Graham from Rome. The report, released yesterday, followed the discovery of large scale misuse of the organisations' funds and suspicions that secret servicemen had been involved in planting of last summer's bombs in Florence, Milan and Rome. The report says Mr Mancino lacked 'effective control' and his knowledge of the activities of the domestic intelligence (Sisde) was 'episodic'. More often than not, he was informed only after operations had been concluded. However, the minister's supervisory role had been handicapped by the 1977 laws setting up the Sisde, which gave its officials virtual autonomy.</p>

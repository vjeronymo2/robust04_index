Such recommendations are required by the Flow Evaluation Program, authorized by a January 14, 1981, Secretarial Directive, and for Section 3406(b)23(A) of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) dated October 30, 1992. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> For schedule of scoping meetings see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> section.

The keystones of the division are Lewiston Dam and Trinity Dam located just upstream of the town of Lewiston, California. The primary function of the Trinity River Division is to store Trinity River water for regulated diversion to the Central Valley of California for agricultural, municipal, and industrial uses. A substantial amount of electric power is generated as water diverted out of the Trinity River Basin passes through four hydroelectric power generation plants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Construction of the Trinity River Division resulted in the diversion of up to 90 percent of the average annual discharge in the Trinity River at Lewiston, and blocked access to 109 miles of spawning and rearing habitat to migrating salmon and steelhead. The Trinity River Hatchery was constructed at the base of Lewiston Dam to mitigate for those fish production losses that occurred upstream of Trinity Dam, and annual fishery flows of 120,000 acre-feet were released from Lewiston Dam to maintain existing salmon and steelhead habitat downstream. These measures were insufficient to maintain the fishery, however, and populations of salmon and steelhead declined at a rapid rate following completion of the Trinity River Division. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reduced river flows, combined with excessive watershed erosion and encroachment of the river channel by riparian vegetation, caused major changes in the morphology of the Trinity River downstream of Lewiston Dam. Reduced flows were no longer capable of transporting large amounts of sediment downstream. As a result, sand began to fill holding pools, spawning riffles, and over-wintering and rearing areas with devastating effects on existing anadromous salmonid habitat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In 1974, six State and Federal agencies formed the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Task force (Task Force) to develop an action plan and seek funding for restoration of the fish and wildlife resources of the basin. In May 1982, the Task Force completed a Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Management Program Report, which identified an action plan consisting of 11 activities aimed at restoring fish and wildlife habitat. These activities included sediment control and watershed stabilization, improvement of the Trinity River Hatchery, and habitat improvements in the river and its tributaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to declining fisheries and degraded habitat conditions, the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) decided in 1981 to increase flows in the Trinity River from 120,000 acre-feet to 340,000 acre-feet annually, with reductions in dry and critically dry years. In addition, the Fish and Wildlife Service was directed to undertake a 12-year Flow Evaluation Study to assess fish habitat at various flows, develop a recommended flow regimen, and evaluate mainstem channel restoration measures. The Flow Evaluation Study began in October 1984 and will conclude in September 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In October 1984, the Trinity River Basin Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act (Public Law 98&hyph;541) was enacted by Congress with the goal of restoring fish and wildlife populations to pre-CVP levels. The Act provided funding for construction, operation, and maintenance of the 11-item action plan developed by the Task Force in 1982. The program is administered by a field office staffed jointly by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Fish and Wildlife Service and will end in 1995. The Act also identified a Task Force consisting of representatives from 14 Federal, State, and county entities and the Hoopa Valley Tribe to assist and advise the Secretary. A 14-member Technical Coordinating Committee has been established to assist and advise the Task Force and the field office. Modification of the mainstem channel is a key element of the restoration program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3406(b)(23) of the CVPIA provides, through the Trinity River Division, an instream release of not less than 340,000 acre-feet of water to meet Federal trust responsibilities to protect fishery resources of the Hoopa Valley Tribe and to meet the fishery restoration goals of Public Law 98&hyph;541. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with Section 3406(b)(23)(A) of the CVPIA, of Public Law 102&hyph;575, recommendations for mainstem Trinity River fishery restoration will be developed after appropriate consultations with Federal, State and local agencies and after completion of an on-going Flow Evaluation Study. The Secretary of the Interior is directed to complete the flow study and recommendations by September 30, 1996. The draft EIS/EIR is expected to be completed and available for review and comment by the end of 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Fish and Wildlife Service and the Hoopa Valley Tribe will seek public input on alternatives, concerns, and issues to be addressed in the EIS through a series of scoping meetings.

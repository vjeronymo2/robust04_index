			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> RULING ON COAST STRIP BACKS PARK DISTRICT  </P> <P> A judge ruled this week that a 1.5-mile coastal strip that includes posh  Monarch Bay belongs within the boundaries of the Capistrano Bay Park and  Recreation District, not neighboring Laguna Niguel.  </P> <P> The decision by Superior Court Judge James Smith means the park district will  continue to receive the approximately $1 million in annual property tax revenue  from the area -- about half of the district's $2-million operating budget.  </P> <P> The ruling settled a portion of a long-running battle between Dana Point and  Laguna Niguel over control of the approximately 850-acre coastal area. The  judge upheld the reorganization of the 25-year-old park district to include the  coastal strip, a move that was approved by the Local Agency Formation  Commission in October of 1988 and then challenged by the Laguna Niguel  Community Service District.  </P> <P> "We consider this a major obstacle being hurdled for us," said David A. Lewis,  park district administrator. "Obviously, the revenue is very substantial for  our district."  </P> <P> The dispute began when the then-proposed city of Dana Point enlarged its  boundaries to include the coastal area. Following that action, the directors of  the park district voted in July, 1988, to annex the same coastal strip and make  its district boundaries contiguous with those of Dana Point.  </P> <P> "It just made everything cleaner for the agencies involved," Lewis said of the  boundary change. "Otherwise, you would have had a municipality, Dana Point,  with 99% of its parks controlled by one agency, ours, and with 1% controlled by  another, Laguna Niguel."  </P> <P> Attorneys for Laguna Niguel's district challenged LAFCO's decisions on both the  city's and the park district's annexations, claiming more analysis should have  been performed and an environmental impact report submitted.  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel City Councilman Paul M. Christiansen criticized the decision but  stopped short of saying the city would appeal.  </P> <P> "The annexation took several hundred thousand (dollars) of our tax revenues,  without a vote of the people, and gave it away," Christiansen said. "We will  pursue this to the maximum to get that money back to the city of Laguna  Niguel." LEN HALL  </P></p>

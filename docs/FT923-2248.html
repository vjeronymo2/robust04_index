			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu warns of 91% drop in earnings for half year FUJITSU, Japan's largest computer maker, yesterday said parent company pre-tax earnings would plunge 91 per cent to Y3bn (Dollars 24m) in the half year ending this month. The decline is caused by the slowdown in the domestic economy and the weak sale of electronics equipment internationally. Fujitsu expects losses in most of its semiconductor operations. The revised forecast confirms earlier reports that Fujitsu would suffer a steep fall in profits. Although Fujitsu yesterday said it was still preparing a formal forecast for consolidated earnings in the first half, it expected to post a net loss of about Y20bn. For the full year Fujitsu cut in half its forecast for pre-tax consolidated profits to Y40bn. This compares with last year's pre-tax level of Y51.5bn. Net earnings are expected to reach Y10bn, compared to Y12.2bn last year. Consolidated sales are projected at Y3,650bn, an increase over last year's Y3,441.9bn. On a parent company basis, pre-tax profits for the full year are forecast at Y25bn, against Y40bn.</p>

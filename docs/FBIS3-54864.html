			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Appeal by the Crimean Civic Congress to Ukraine's Supreme </F> Council and President Regarding Crimean Presidential Elections"]    [Text] As is known to you, despite the current  legislation, Ukrainian Constitution, and public protests, the  Crimean Supreme Council has introduced the institution of  presidency and appointed the Crimean presidential elections for  16 January 1994.    The course of the election campaign has revealed an  unconcealed antistate, anti-Ukrainian, and chauvinist  orientation of programs adhered to by many presidential  candidates. The mass media are full of malice against Ukraine  and call for restoring the USSR and going under Russia's flag.    The Crimean Ukrainian public and political organizations  came  out decisively against the introduction of the institution of  presidency in the Crimea, since this may lead to the obstruction  of the central presidential power, strengthening of separatism  and confrontation, and is, possibly, the last attempt to sever  the Crimea from Ukraine, something which threatens its  territorial integrity, peace, and quiet.    In addition, during this time of crisis, the holding of  Crimean presidential elections will be an additional material  burden upon the electorate and will later lead to an expansion  of the bureaucratic apparatus, which is too inflated even now.    The Crimean Ukrainian Civic Congress, whose constituent  congress was held on 28 November 1993, has employed the tactics  of active political and legal counteraction to the illegal  Crimean presidential elections and has, for this purpose,  enlisted the services of state and public structures.    However, we are extremely surprised and alarmed by your  inert  and reticent position regarding the events in the Crimea. Nor  do the Crimean Tatar people, who have been constantly supporting  Ukraine's state-building policy, but have encountered an  indifferent attitude toward their problems, understand the  silence of official Kiev.    The actions by Ivan Yermakov, Ukrainian presidential  representative in Sevastopol, are disloyal with regard to the  Ukrainian state. He has recently taken a direct part in  procommunist and chauvinist gatherings and expressed support for  anti-Ukrainian circles.    The fact that he decided to nominate himself as a Crimean  presidential candidate shows his contempt for the Ukrainian  legislature, the fulfillment of which he was supposed to  guarantee. Ivan Yermakov's 11 December 1993 appeal, full of  groundless and contemptuous criticism of Ukrainian leadership,  marks his transition to an open opposition to the Ukrainian  president, Supreme Council, and government. At a conference of  leaders of Sevastopol enterprises and organizations on 13  December 1993, he stated that he considered the institution of  Ukrainian presidential representatives inexpedient. Does such a  representative of the Ukrainian president have the right to  occupy this position?    The Ukrainian Civic Congress demands that Ukraine's Supreme  Council and president do the following:    1. Consider the question of the systematic violation of the  Ukrainian Constitution and current legislation in the Crimea.    2. Condemn the attempt by the Communist Party nomenklatura  to introduce the institution of presidency and to cancel the  Crimean presidential elections as being at variance with  Ukraine's current legislation.    3. To implement Ukraine's law "On the Ukrainian Presidential  Representation in the Crimea."    4. To remove Ivan Yermakov from his post as Ukrainian  presidential representative in the Crimea.    5. In carrying out the Ukrainian state-building policy in  the Crimea, to rely upon patriotic political and public  organizations.</p>

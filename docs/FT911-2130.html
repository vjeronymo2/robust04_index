			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Arts: All for Love - Almeida Theatre The first and - if you want a really short review - only thing to be said about All for Love is: see it] If you have neither read nor seen the play before, you will wonder why you remained in such ignorance for so long. If already acquainted with it, you may still be surprised by the passion that can be put into it. Either way, you are in for a treat. Diana Rigg goes with it. All for Love is John Dryden's version of Antony and Cleopatra. It is not invidious to make comparisons. Since Dryden was the foremost literary critic of his age, and no mean poet and dramatist, he knew exactly what he was doing. He invited the comparison himself. All for Love is not better than Shakespeare's play; it is just totally different, though in one area I think that it achieves something that Shakespeare never attempted - that is, frank talking by a woman about her lovers. Ms Rigg is not an especially queenly Cleopatra in the sense of wearing robes and crowns, at least till the end. She plays the part by exuding passion and not being embarrassed to admit it. True, she went first with Caesar, but Caesar possessed her person, not her love. She knows the difference between a wife and a mistress. There are two scenes that could never have appeared in Shakespeare: one where she explains her feelings to Antony, the other where she meets his wife (and Caesar's sister) Octavia. This is a kind of modern psychological drama. Octavia, played by Angela Down emerges as a real part. Beside the women, James Laurenson's Antony is a curiously subdued figure. That is the only query I have about the production. To be sure, he is pretty down, having lost his empire and his mistress, and continues to be torn between his love for Cleopatra and his duty to Octavia. But if you make Antony such a dead-beat, it makes one wonder why people had such regard for him in the first place. The admiration for Antony extends to his general, Ventidius. For Dryden did not write a play simply about the main characters. The lines that go with Ventidius's suicide scene are among the best quiet dramatic verse that has been written. Bernard Horsfall, having been slightly unconvincing at the start, cannot fail to rise to them. Equally, Dryden fills out the characters around Cleopatra: Charmion and the Eunuch. Charmion, played by Pauline Jameson, is a rather elderly figure; Alexas the Eunuch (Alan MacNaughtan) even older. Between them, they seem to make up the queen's sole court and thus emphasise her loneliness when she is apart from Antony. It occurred to me that Jonathan Kent's production could be filmed as it is. It is pure drama. So much for All for Love being an obscure, academics' play that seldom needs to be performed. It should now takes its place in the forefront of English theatre, which is where Dryden thought it belonged.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 14 (CTK) -- Adrian Nastase, speaker of  the Romanian Parliament, said he would like to see a greater  exchange of information with the Czech Republic concerning  legislative experiences in the processes of democratization and  economic reform. Speaking at a press conference today he  conceded that Romanian-Czech relations were as yet on a low  level. However, Romania, with a population of 23 million and  access to the Black Sea, could in future become a significant  trade partner for the Czech Republic.    Deeper relations can be promoted by Czech President Vaclav  Havel's forthcoming visit to Bucharest, he said. Havel will be  accompanied by a delegation which includes Czech Privatization  Minister Jiri Skalicky.    Nastase began a four-day visit to the Czech Republic on June  12. Nastase said he had not discussed the question of Romanian  immigrants living here illegally with Czech politicians. He  said in this area "serious difficulties that have not already  been resolved by our ministries practically do not exist". "A  few marginal matters" should not impede tourism between the two  countries, Nastase said.</p>

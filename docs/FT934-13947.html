			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Money Markets: UK overnights hit 10% OVERNIGHT money in the UK hit 10 per cent yesterday as the commercial banks initially ignored the opportunity to provide bills to the Bank of England in exchange for cash, writes Peter John. It appeared that banks with liquidity were unprepared to relinquish it, leaving those which were short of funds having to wait. Even though overnight rates reached double figures - compared with lows of around 4 per cent over the past fortnight - the central bank had to provide Pounds 725m of late assistance at the customary unspecified rate before the shortage was dealt with. One dealer said: 'We have had two weeks of cheap money and it seems to have come to an end.' The central bank forecast an initial liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.1bn, later revised to Pounds 1.25bn. Among the main factors affecting the shortage were the take-up of Treasury Bills and paper maturing in official hands, which drained Pounds 701m. Bills for repurchase by the market took out Pounds 1.128bn and bankers' balances below target removed Pounds 295m. Partly offsetting these, a fall in note circulation injected Pounds 880m. Meanwhile, growing optimism for European rate cuts was reflected in the performance of a number of short-term interest rate futures contracts yesterday, Short sterling continued to edge forward on the view that the foundations of economic recovery need to be shored by lower rates if the whole edifice is not to crumble. Turnover was slight but the most active contract, which expires on December 15, moved up another seven basis points in early dealing and closed marginally higher at 94.58. At that level it is discounting three-month money around 5 3/8 per cent and base rates of 5.5 per cent. The tightly traded futures contract for Belgian three-month money jumped a further 36 basis points to 91.87 in spite of the Belgian National Bank's insistence on keeping its key rate unchanged at 9.65 per cent. Short-term Belgian lending rates were at 10 per cent on Friday, and above 9 per cent yesterday when Belgian futures were discounting a one percentage point cut. German three-month futures were steady, with the market expecting the Bundesbank to ease its repo rate on Wednesday by at least five basis points. An easing was further signalled by a decline in call money to around 6.75 per cent from 6.8 per cent.</p>

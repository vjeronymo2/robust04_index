			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Working Life: The Chamber - Reading matter John Grisham, the lawyer turned blockbuster thriller writer, made his name and his millions writing books with titles like The Firm and The Client. Now we have The Chamber, which at first sight should be called The Formula, because it starts by conforming to the well-established Grisham pattern. It takes us swiftly into the main event, in this case a Ku Klux Klan bombing in the 1960s which kills a Jewish lawyer and his two young sons. Twenty years later, the man sentenced to death for the crime faces the gas chamber. A young, talented but independent lawyer from an underprivileged background, working for big time law firm, volunteers for the apparently hopeless case. The twist: the old racist prisoner is his long-lost grandfather. The first hundred pages are dramatic and promising. But thereafter the book should be retitled The Mess, or more accurately The Long Mess, because Grisham wrote it in long hand and it runs to almost 500 pages. It hints that it might become a detective story of the young lawyer's hunt for the mystery second bomber, who masterminded the attack but got away. That storyline peters out. The Chamber is a sustained attack on the mechanics and politics of the death penalty. It claims to be a thriller, as the hero desperately attempts to save his grandfather while the clock ticks away. Yet the story is peculiarly lacking in drama. It is largely a mechanistic account of ludicrous petitions being faxed backward and forward between courts. The book is mainly a portrait of the white, working class south, through a family which is inevitably and hopelessly wrecked by its history of racism. This portrait is at times compelling. But Grisham is far better at explaining events than exploring characters. So the moving story of the grandfather and the lawyer learning to love and depend upon one another on death row gets hopelessly confused with the thriller and detective sides of the story. For those who were gripped by The Firm and The Pelican Brief, this latest Grisham book may well go down as The Disappointment. The Chamber, By John Grisham. Century, Pounds 15.99 pp486</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- While observing the  seemingly endless wrangling between the ruling and opposition  parties, President Kim Yong-sam kept silent during the past week  since he wanted the National Assembly to approve his new prime  minister.    Moreover, Kim made no mention whatsoever of Yi Hoe-chang  after he had the former prime minister step down for challenging  the president's authority.    Kim has refrained from commenting on the former premier as  he  felt a deep sense of betrayal by Yi Hoe-chang, according to some  Chongwadae [presidential offices] aides.    The chief executive, however, has by no means been inactive  over the week.    He visited a precision-instrument factory in Ansan on Sunday  and invited 58 "new Koreans," selected from various segments of  society, to Chongwadae for talks on Tuesday. He praised them  for setting a good example for the rest of the country.    On Wednesday, Kim presided over a meeting of the New Economy  Promotion Committee at a Kwachon Government Building, showing he  was concentrating on boosting the nation's economy and  stabilizing consumer prices.    He then went down to Asan, South Chungchong Province, to  attend a cermony marking the 449th anniversary of the birth of  Admiral Yi Sun-sin and visited the grave of Yun Pong-kil in  Yesan to pay his respects to the independence fighter.    Through all these activities, Kim may have wished to  demonstrate to the people that their chief executive was busy  even though the legislative branch was wallowing in one  constroversy after another.    No one can say the president is in a happy frame of mind  these days, said one aide. It is apparent, however, that he is  determined to lead the nation no matter what.    But many officials at Chongwadae cannot deny that the past  week seemed as long as a month, not because of a subdued  president but because of the opposition Democratic Party's  refusal to approve Yi Yong-tok as prime minister.    The administration has been caught in a vacuum, so to speak,  throughout the entire week. The execution of national policies  has been put off and most Chongwadae and government officials  await the National Assembly's approval of their top  administrator.    Chongwadae has stood ready since last Monday for a ceremony  at which the president was to hand his credentials to the new  prime minister, but had to postone it day after day.    There had been speculation that President Kim would not  simply sit idle and leave the National Assembly in an  unproductive mess. He must be contemplating some action,  observers said.    He would surely act as soon as the National Assembly  approved  his prime minister, they said.    In other words, the president had no intention of allowing  the government to limp along in approving the prime  minister-designate. He would patiently wait for the National  Assembly to finally come to its senses and give him a  full-fledged prime minister.    "That is the Kim YS style -- the great and orthodox path,"  one commentator said.    As soon as Yi Yong-tok is approved as prime minister, the  president will consult with him and name Yi's replacement at the  National Unification Board. There may be a limited reshuffle of  the cabinet as well.    But since the current difficulty -- or "national crisis" as  the opposition party calls it -- resulted from the resignation  of Yi Hoe-chang, his replacement will put the government back on  track. No more personnel changes are needed, they said.    In fact, some observers believe that President Kim will  retain all of his senior presidential secretaries at Chongwadae  and change very little in the cabinet, leaving its framework  intact.    At the first cabinet meeting to be followed by a reshuffle,  the president will likely ask his ministers to rally around the  new prime minister and work for his administration's overriding  goal of reform.</p>

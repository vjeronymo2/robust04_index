			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / International Company News: Molson unit in SA deal Diversey, the special chemicals arm of Canada's Molson brewing group, has bought the cleaning chemicals division of Chemrite in South Africa, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. The deal gives Diversey a third foothold for expansion on the African continent. It already operates in Kenya and Egypt. 'South Africa is the foundation for our expansion across the entire southern cone of Africa,' said Mr David Hull, Molson's senior vice-president for international operations. He would not reveal the price but said local management would retain a minority stake in the business. The Chemrite division has been making chemicals under licence from Diversey since 1981. Diversey operates in 45 countries with annual sales of well over CDollars 1bn.</p>

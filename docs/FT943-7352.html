			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Japan minister on attack over short-term jobs A conservative cabinet member in Japan's new coalition government yesterday fired insults at the leader of the employers' federation in an unusually vitriolic debate over the future of lifetime employment in Japanese industry. Mr Shizuka Kamei, transport minister, backed away from a battle with the country's airlines over hiring policies, rescinding a ruling which had halted plans by the carriers to recruit most new cabin crew on short-term contracts. In a televised press conference, he acknowledged he had no powers to intervene. He added, however, that the defence of the scheme by Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Nikkeiren, the federation of employers' associations, suggested Mr Nagano cared little for job security. The minister claimed Mr Nagano epitomised 'the thinking of 19th-century management which doesn't give a damn about safety, pollution, security of jobs or the rights of workers'. Mr Kamei alleged: 'His top priority is profits and that gives me great concern'. At a Nikkeiren seminar last week, Mr Nagano expressed disquiet over prospects for economic reform under the new government, saying that for Japan to emerge from its longest post-war recession, wages and prices must be reduced. While agreeing that employment security should remain a prime concern of Japanese industry, Mr Nagano noted that prospects for women jobseekers were poor and the JAL plan to recruit contract stewardesses would benefit them as well as the company. He implied that Mr Kamei had an axe of his own to grind. Mr Kamei comes from the right wing of the Liberal Democratic party, conservative partner in the three-party coalition which took power at the end of June. Many in the LDP regard Japan's taboo on lay-offs as essential to corporate loyalty and a cornerstone of the post-war economic success which took place under its rule. Job security is among the areas of common ground in the LDP's alliance with the left-wing Social Democratic party of Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the prime minister. Japan Airlines is seeking to cut costs by hiring an initial 100 stewardesses on hourly pay which would be equivalent to perhaps a third of that enjoyed by its salaried flight attendants. JAL received 2,500 applications but could not proceed because Mr Kamei, invoking worries about how the two classes of employee would co-operate in the event of an in-flight emergency, threatened to decline new route applications if the plan went ahead. Mr Nagano did not respond yesterday to Mr Kamei's outburst. The employers' leader is chairman of Mitsubishi Materials, a producer of metal products, electronics and cement which fell into loss last year. The pollution barb will jog memories of a Texas copper smelter project his company shelved after problems with US environmental regulations. JAL could not say last night if it would revive its plan, but it needs new cabin crew to service domestic flights from Kansai Airport, opening near Osaka next month. JAL has been shedding staff through voluntary redundancy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Moron, Venezuela, 22 Jun (AFP) -- Riots, during  which two grocery stores were looted, rocked Moron and Puerto  Cabello today. Meanwhile, student protests were staged in  Caracas.    The disturbances took place in Moron after a march was  called  to protest the high cost of living, but the situation is already  under control, according to statements to the media by Governor  Henrique Salas. Similar protests were staged in nearby Puerto  Cabello.    Valencia--the country's third largest city located 100 km  west of Caracas--was left without bus service because of a  strike. Drivers are demanding higher bus fares, according to the  governor.    Around noon, protests were staged near the Central  University  of Venezuela in Caracas, and local journalists reported that  police had arrived on the scene.</p>

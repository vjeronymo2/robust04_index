			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Not a single safe Tory seat, warn the Euro-election polls: The rocky road to Strasbourg is compounded by poor voter turnout and first-past-the-post anomalies John Smith's death has thrown into turmoil all the parties' plans for the first week of the European election campaign. But the battle will still turn more on John Major's leadership than on any European issue. Between Thursday June 9 and Sunday June 12 voters in the 12 countries of the European Union will choose 567 MEPs to go to Strasbourg. Britain will have 87 MEPs. The political composition of the European parliament depends to a remarkable extent on British voters. Great Britain (though not Northern Ireland) alone votes first-past-the-post instead of proportionally; the winner in votes gets a disproportionate majority in seats. In 1979 the Conservatives secured 62 seats to Labour's 17. In 1989 Labour won 45 seats to the Tories' 32. If there had been proportional representation the Conservatives' lead in 1979 would have been 22, not 45. In 1989 the Labour lead would have been four not 13. If, as some suggest, the Conservatives suffer a Canadian-style wipe-out next month, the effect could give the left a net majority at Strasbourg 60 or 70 greater than it would have been if Britain had adopted proportional representation. If the Tories are embarrassed by the outcome they will be able to use as an excuse low participation. Britain has been consistently bottom of the turnout league. On average 33 per cent have voted, less that half the level for Westminster and well below the norm in local council elections. Voters can behave unexpectedly. In 1989 the Greens jumped from an opinion-poll level of 3 per cent three months earlier to 15 per cent in the ballot box, pushing the Liberal Democrats into fourth place in every constituency except Cornwall. Six months later, their support had evaporated. This year the Liberal Democrats seem set to mop up much of the protest vote  -and there is plenty of protest vote about. The local election figures and the opinion polls suggest that there is not a single seat that is safe for the Conservatives. In a three-cornered race, 34 per cent of the vote is needed to win, even if the other two contestants are evenly divided (which is most unlikely). North Yorkshire seems to be the only seat north of Birmingham where there is a serious chance of a Conservative victory, but even in the south there is no safe seat. There are only three constituencies where a swing at the level of the local elections last week would leave the Conservatives with 40 per cent of the vote, and in each of these the Liberal Democrats are the stronger challenger. On the basis of local election results last week it was calculated that Labour would get 56 seats, the Liberal Democrats 14 and the Conservatives 12. The ICM poll in The Guardian earlier this week suggested that the Conservatives would get only 27 per cent of the vote in the European election. Its findings could be projected to 57 seats for Labour, 15 for the Conservatives and nine for the Liberal Democrats. Some would say that both projections are too optimistic for the Conservatives. With no council tax at stake their erstwhile supporters may be tempted to a more vehement protest vote, or protest abstention, while the Liberal Democrats may gain even more from tactical voting by Labour. The fate of Mr Graham Mather, the Conservative candidate in Hampshire North and Oxford, will turn on whether Labour voters in Oxford East realise that their only hope of defeating the Conservatives lies in voting Liberal Democrat. Similarly, Dr Caroline Jackson's survival as the Conservative MEP for Wiltshire depends on whether Swindon voters stay loyal to Labour. On the other hand, it can be argued, as the ICM poll suggests, that the Liberal Democrats will get only 24 per cent in the European election. It may be that their pavement politics cannot be so effective in a European contest.

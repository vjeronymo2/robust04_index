			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In preparation for the Japan-U.S. summit set for 11  February, the government is hastening its work on how to deal  with the U.S. mass media, as, among other plans, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa will be granting an exclusive interview to the  chief of THE WASHINGTON POST's Far East bureau. Even though the  finale is approaching, real progress has yet to be seen in the  Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, which will top the summit's  agenda. However, the government is steadily making progress in  its strategy to build up the prime minister's image.    According to a government authority, THE WASHINGTON POST's  Far East bureau chief is considered the likely candidate to whom  Prime Minister Hosokawa plans to grant an exclusive interview  since the government has judged that "in comparison to the chief  of the Tokyo branch of THE NEW YORK TIMES -- THE WASHINGTON  POSTS's rival newspaper -- who tends to be critical of Japan in  his commentaries, THE WASHINGTON POSTS's Far East bureau chief  has a more favorable view of Japan; the fact that he has taught  at the Kumamoto University also conjures up a feeling of  intimacy." In the United States, public criticism of Japan  mounted in the advent of the 50th anniversary of the Japanese  attack on Pearl Harbor in World War II. Michio Watanabe, who was  then foreign minister, granted an interview to a THE WASHINGTON  POST reporter. Apparently, some quarters of the Foreign  Ministry said that this interview helped calm the situation.    The government also plans to take the opportunity for  Hosokawa to address the American people via the U.S. radio  network prior to the summit. In Washington, there are plans for  the prime minister to lecture on Japanese policies at Georgetown  University and for him to appear on local television, too.    Koichiro Matsuura, deputy vice minister of foreign affairs,  who will stand in the forefront as chairman of the Japanese  negotiating party in the framework trade talks, is scheduled to  grant an exclusive interview to THE WALL STREET JOURNAL's Tokyo  branch chief. As for news organs which will not be granted  exclusive interviews, it is expected that they will be attended  to separately by Yukio Sato, chief of the Foreign Ministry's  North American Affairs Bureau, and Kazuo Ogura, chief of the  ministry's Economics Affairs Bureau.    By being selective with reporters, the government's strategy  to deal with U.S. mass media is said to be primarily aimed at  "providing appropriate information so that accurate commentaries  can be drawn from them."    Although Prime Minister Hosokawa spoke with U.S. President  Bill Clinton over the phone on 31 January, their conversation  ended in "rhetorical" exchange, according to officials close to  the prime minister. On the surface, preparations for Hosokawa's  U.S. visit continues with rough sailing, but, underneath, the  government continues working shrewdly on its plans geared toward  the U.S. mass media.</p>

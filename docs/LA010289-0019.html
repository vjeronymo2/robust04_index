			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAEL BANISHES 15 ARABS IN BID TO CURB UPRISING  </P> <P> Israel on Sunday banished 15 Palestinians considered to be activist leaders of  the Arab uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in an apparent  challenge to the United States, which has condemned such actions in the past.  </P> <P> The expulsions followed the close of one of the bloodiest months in the  uprising, now nearly 13 months old. According to data compiled by an Israeli  member of Parliament, Israeli soldiers shot and killed 31 Arabs during December  and wounded another 400.  </P> <P> More than 330 Palestinians have died during the uprising. Ten Israeli Jews and  one Israeli Arab also have been killed. A total of 51 Arabs have been banished  from the country during the intifada, as the uprising is called in Arabic.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flown to Lebanon  </P> <P> The Israeli army flew the 15 by helicopter to southern Lebanon, where they were  each given $50 taxi fare, Israel Radio reported. The 15 then headed for an  office of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a radical faction  of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the radio added.  </P> <P> Two of the Palestinians taken out of the country Sunday agreed to leave after  giving up their court appeals in return for the right to come home in five  years -- provided they refrain from taking part in "negative actions" against  Israel. The rest refused the deal and are barred "for life."  </P> <P> The banishment was "due to their involvement in the leadership of the uprising  and the direction of it," an army spokesman declared.  </P> <P> The United States has opposed expulsions as a violation of due process as well  as of the 1949 Fourth Geneva Convention, which forbids the removal of civilians  from land under military occupation "for any reason whatsoever."  </P> <P> There was no reaction Sunday from the State Department.  </P> <P> Palestinian observers lashed out at the Israeli move. "The timing is  atrocious," Palestinian lawyer Jonathan Kuttab said. "When people are beginning  to talk solutions, talk peace, the Israelis create frustration."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Appeals to U.S.  </P> <P> Kuttab called on Washington to put some bite into its customary condemnation of  the expulsions.  </P> <P> The United States recently dropped a 13-year prohibition and opened contact  with the PLO, to which most Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza owe their political  loyalty. "The strength of the United States criticism of Israel will be a test  of its intentions to foster peace," Kuttab argued.  </P> <P> Israel Radio said the newly expelled Arabs played "leading roles" in the  intifada and that most belonged to Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction headed by  Yasser Arafat. Among the 15, the radio singled out four for special mention:  </P> <P>  -- Rizek Bayari, 29, a journalist who led popular committees in the northern  Gaza Strip and was charged with "directing violence" in Gaza.  </P> <P>  -- Abdallah abu Samahadana, 38, a lecturer at Islamic University in Gaza.  Samahadana spent four years in jail on charges of transporting hand grenades  and was released last year.  </P> <P>  -- Massoud Zaefer, 42, a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine who was a leader of the uprising in Nablus, the largest and most  militant Palestinian city on the West Bank.  </P> <P>  -- Abdel Hamid Baba, 25, a Fatah activist in the Amari refugee camp who is  reported to be responsible for violence in Ramallah, a West Bank city north of  Jerusalem.  </P> <P> Military sources said that the expulsions, in the works since August, were  timed to coincide with Sunday's 24th anniversary of the first PLO guerrilla  operation inside Israel, observed by the Palestinians as "Fatah Day." The  timing was a means of depressing Palestinian morale, the source said. In an  attempt at showing its psychological impact, the official compared the action  to a military raid Dec. 9 on a PLO faction's headquarters in Lebanon. That raid  coincided with the first anniversary of the intifada.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Local Committees Targeted  </P> <P> Removal of Palestinian leaders has been part of an Israeli effort to break the  back of so-called popular committees that have spearheaded Arab resistance to  Israeli rule in the occupied territories. Last August, Israeli authorities  accused the 15 Palestinians of leading the committees in various localities and  prepared the cases for expulsion.  </P> <P> At the time, a Defense Ministry spokesman said the popular committees were  designed "to impose by violent means the orders of the PLO and the uprising's  leaders on the population, to undermine the Israeli authorities . . . and to  create alternative mechanisms instead."  </P> <P> The number of December clashes and the expulsions appeared to be a concrete  sign of Israel's tough defiance of efforts in the international community to  encourage peace talks by Israel with the PLO. Israel refuses to make contact  with the organization, which it believes is unswervingly bent on destroying the  Jewish state.  </P> <P> Israeli officials insist that peace talks with non-PLO Palestinians must be  preceded by an end to the intifada. In the meantime, Israeli army officials  have pledged to take the fight to stone-throwing youths in Arab towns and  villages.  </P> <P> Last August, the Israeli army authorized occupying soldiers in the West Bank  and Gaza to use so-called plastic bullets, whose lethal range is said to be  less than that of full-metal projectiles. When the bullets were introduced,  firing rules were relaxed; it no longer was necessary for a "life threatening"  situation to arise before troops could shoot into crowds or at individuals.  </P> <P> Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin predicted that the bullets would increase the  number of wounded but reduce the number of dead.  </P> <P> The prediction about fatalities is debatable. In the close quarters of Arab  neighborhoods, the plastic bullets -- actually a blend of plastic and metal --  have proved as lethal as regular cartridges. In August, more than 20 Arabs were  shot to death. The toll dipped in both September and October, climbed to 20  again in November and surged to 31 in December.  </P> <P> On Dec. 16, paratroopers based in Nablus shot and killed eight Palestinians  during unrest that followed a funeral for an earlier victim -- the highest  one-day fatal toll in a single city since the uprising began. Arabs have taken  to calling the shootings "the Nablus massacre."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 40 Killed in April  </P> <P> The only month to top December in carnage was last April, when more than 40  Palestinians were killed.  </P> <P> Last week, Yossi Sarid, a member of Israel's Parliament from the leftist  Citizens' Rights Party, wrote to Defense Minister Rabin to protest the use of  plastic bullets.  </P> <P> "When Israel started using plastic bullets, the basic assumption was: They  don't kill," Sarid said in an interview. "This evidently is not the case. The  use of the bullets is intolerable. The death figures are horrible."  </P> <P> A few days earlier, Israel's attorney general, Yosef Harish, said he would  investigate the use of the bullets. His report would not be officially binding,  but, as legal adviser to the government, his opinion might have some impact,  Israeli observers say.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the army imposed a curfew on the entire Gaza Strip in an effort to  prevent protests or violence connected to the PLO anniversary.  </P> <P> During the day, at least five Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, Arab  sources said. The army reported that two teen-agers were shot in the legs when  soldiers fired at dozens of stone-throwing youths in Ramallah, on the West  Bank.  </P></p>

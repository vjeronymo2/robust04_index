			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / More changes to the letter of the law: Criticism of the Criminal Justice Act The bill leading to the Criminal Justice Act formed the legislative centrepiece of the UK's 1990-91 parliamentary session, although it is safe to assume that most people were not even dimly aware of its contents. Respectable, law-abiding citizens do not expect the act's world of criminal courts, custodial sentences and previous convictions ever to touch their lives. But public awareness has increased dramatically since new provisions for linking fines to individual incomes came into force last October, and some respectable citizens have found themselves fined thousands of pounds for motoring offences. Yesterday, amid growing criticism from judges, magistrates and MPs, Mr Kenneth Clarke, who inherited the act when he become home secretary last year, announced that a further bill would be introduced to change aspects of it. The two areas of reform concern the act's provision for unit fines related to an individual's ability to pay, and restrictions on courts taking previous convictions into account when imposing sentences. Many magistrates believe the October provisions leave them with insufficient flexibility in sentencing, and several have resigned in protest since they came into effect. It is rare for the government to seek to amend an act so soon after it has come into force. Pressure on Mr Clarke to do so became hard to resist in March after complaints in a speech by Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, that the act was forcing the judiciary into an ill-fitting straitjacket. Lord Taylor, during a critical speech, related an anecdote about a young lawyer at a seminar who told a senior judge that, having re-read sections of the act, he now realised that they did make sense. 'Read it again, you have obviously misunderstood it,' replied the judge. Judicial demands for action have been accompanied by mounting political pressure on Mr Clarke in the face of highly publicised examples of the peculiarities of the unit fine system. The most celebrated of these involved a Pounds 1,200 fine on an unemployed man for dropping a crisp packet, reduced last week to Pounds 48 on appeal. Bizarre as it appears, both penalties are logical under the unit fine system. This bands an individual's weekly disposable income from Pounds 4 to a maximum Pounds 100. Magistrates then multiple the income figure by a selected number of units to reflect their view of the seriousness of a particular case. The man accused of dropping the crisp packet faced 12 units. He did not declare his income, and in such cases the maximum Pounds 100 per week income is assumed. When it was established that he was unemployed, this was reduced to the Pounds 4 minimum. Mr Clarke believes that the act's principle of linking fines to income is correct and intends to retain it. But the Pounds 4-Pounds 100 spread will be narrowed to reduce extreme variations in fine for the same offence. This will relieve many MPs, who fear respect for the law would be undermined if better-off people guilty of relatively minor offences felt that they were being punished for their economic circumstances. Ministers believe some of the more breathtaking examples of high fines have arisen because courts have failed to appreciate the discretion available to them under the unit system. The Magistrates Association, whose representatives met Mr Clarke yesterday, is sending out new guidelines on the use of discretion. Mr Clarke has less sympathy with the act's restrictions on the introduction of previous convictions. 'I believe that a first-time offender is not the same as someone who goes out and offends again and again,' he said yesterday. 'I think courts should be able to take this into account.' He says the forthcoming changes will be designed to 'make the law work the way parliament intended when it passed the 1991 act'. Penal reformers and probation officers fear otherwise. The 1991 act has at its heart the liberal principle that the punishment of less-serious offenders should shift from custody to the community. Unfortunately for supporters of community penalties, however, the introduction of the act coincided with one of Britain's periodic outbreaks of anxiety over juvenile offenders. Mr Clarke's response, in spite of the act's intention to reduce the use of custody, has been to embark on a new generation of secure schools for 12-15-year-olds. Penal reform organisations fear yesterday's willingness to amend the act is further evidence that, in the face of public opinion, the government will prove reluctant to defend the wider principles on which it is based.</p>

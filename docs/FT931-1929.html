			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Right man, wrong job: Germany needs Hans Tietmeyer in Bonn, not at the Bundesbank Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, is favourite to take over at the top of the German central bank when Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the president, retires at the end of September. There is a chance, however, he will find himself in the wrong job. Mr Tietmeyer, 61, a former state secretary in the Bonn Finance Ministry, who joined the Bundesbank in 1990, would make a good central bank president. He is a formidable negotiator who combines wide knowledge of financial affairs with great powers of persuasion in public and private. The real gaps in the running of the German economy are, however, not in Frankfurt, but in Bonn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who will ultimately decide the Bundesbank succession, should put Mr Tietmeyer in supreme charge of tackling the economic consequences of German reunification - by making Mr Tietmeyer Germany's next finance minister. The suggestion is controversial. Removing Mr Theo Waigel, the present finance minister, who heads Mr Kohl's Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, would cause a coalition crisis. Additionally, Mr Tietmeyer would be loath to consider the idea because he started his Bonn career as an economics ministry official as long ago as 1962. He knows, first-hand, the strains and frustrations of government life - pressures which have been greatly increased by the problems of unification. The president of a universally respected, statutorily independent central bank enjoys a much more comfortable and predictable existence than the finance minister. The job is secure - it carries an eight-year mandate. And the Bundesbank boss earns around DM700,000 a year, well over double Mr Waigel's salary. For all this, there are compelling reasons why Mr Tietmeyer's talents would be put to better use in Bonn than in Frankfurt. First, Mr Tietmeyer's lack of mainstream political experience would be an asset, not a liability, in view of German voters' disenchantment with the established political parties. Mr Tietmeyer, a member of Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union since 1960, certainly has the ear of the chancellor. He is not a member of the Bundestag  -but then neither is Mr Klaus Kinkel, the current foreign minister, who took over last year. Second, Mr Tietmeyer's stamina and experience would give him crucial advantages in negotiations on putting the financing of German unity on a sounder footing. Mr Kohl's budget deal with the Social Democrats and the Lander 10 days ago still leaves gaping holes in public-sector finances. This means the search must go on for the right balance of spending cuts, tax increases and new public financing methods, including privatisation. As a technocrat of stature, Mr Tietmeyer would stand a good chance of remaining in his post if - as seems possible - a grand coalition of Christian and Social Democrats came to power during the next few years. Clearly, however, an outright SPD victory in the December 1994 general elections would deprive Mr Tietmeyer of a job. That is a risk he would have to take. Third, Mr Tietmeyer has been called in before by Mr Kohl on sensitive missions. In spring 1990, the chancellor made him head of the West German delegation negotiating the introduction of the D-Mark into east Germany. Mr Tietmeyer has since admitted that, reflecting the need for a quick deal, Bonn made important errors in its accord with the east Germans. These concerned above all the terms on which east Germany's assets and liabilities were converted into D-Marks. These mistakes have had important economic policy consequences. As finance minister, Mr Tietmeyer would have a chance to correct some of them. Fourth, on the international stage, Mr Tietmeyer would be a more convincing performer than Mr Waigel. Mr Tietmeyer has a better grasp of the issues at the heart of the debate over European economic and monetary union. If he made more strenuous efforts to correct imbalances in German fiscal policies, Mr Tietmeyer would carry more conviction in pleading for patience over the effects of these policies on Germany's partners. Commonsense, then, indicates that Mr Tietmeyer would be an optimal choice. But practical realities suggest that he is likely to stay in Frankfurt. That would be a pity. The Bundesbank often appears strongest when the government is weak. That is not good for Germany's image. An imaginative decision to recall Mr Tietmeyer to Bonn would help redress the balance. Summoning into the government a man of his reputation and intellect would emphasise the scale of the country's challenges. And it would improve the chance that, within a relatively short span of years, Germany will come to terms with them.</p>

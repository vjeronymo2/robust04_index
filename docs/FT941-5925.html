			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Business sceptical over policy switch During its first month in office, Venezuela's government, headed by President Rafael Caldera, has announced a series of economic measures that stand in contrast to the unpopular market reforms that were implemented over the last five years. The administration has depicted itself as seeking a middle ground between free-market policies and heavy government intervention in the economy. While the results are not yet apparent, businessmen are generally sceptical. The government, which began a five-year term on February 2, is facing the country's second year of recession. It is trying to cope with a drop in the value of its oil exports which accounts for much of the Treasury's revenue, 46 per cent inflation last year, a fiscal deficit of 8-10 per cent of GDP, heavy debt payments and a banking crisis brought on by the collapse of the country's second-largest bank. The imposition of 'temporary' price controls helped bring down the inflation rate last month from 4.3 per cent in January to 1.9 per cent. But the government's international reserves fell by Dollars 633m (Pounds 433.5m) last month to Dollars 11.2bn, after a Dollars 744m decline in January. These large falls - reserves fell only Dollars 519m in the whole of last year - resulted from lower oil receipts and dollar demand after the failure of Banco Latino. Businesses have been concerned these problems would prompt exchange controls and a big devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar, but the government has said it is not planning action on either point. Instead, the government has promised to cut the central government budget by 8 per cent, proposed a series of tax changes, set up an autonomous agency to collect income taxes and reduce tax evasion, extended price controls on medicines, and announced it will seek 'voluntary price restraint' on other items. It has also committed substantial resources in an effort to refloat Banco Latino and keep other troubled banks in business. There are also business worries that the huge volume of government financing required by these troubled banks will prove inflationary. Mr Caldera has suspended the constitutional right to engage in free business practices, giving him extensive power to decree drastic economic measures. The last suspension of economic rights lasted 30 years and was lifted only in 1991. This time the government has said the current suspension may be revoked soon, and that the special powers will be used prudently. Mr Freddy Rojas, former president of Fedecamaras, Venezuela's largest business association, called the presidential move 'an improvisation' and warned that it would scare off private investment.</p>

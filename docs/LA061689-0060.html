			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> TRANSPORT AGENCY WEIGHS ALCOHOL TESTS  </P> <P> The Transportation Department is considering expanding its drug-testing program  to include random checks for alcohol abuse among 4 million transportation  workers, Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told Congress. Skinner also said that he  would recommend that President Bush veto a House anti-drug bill, if passed,  because the measure covering railroad workers would require the Administration  to start over on a drug-testing program it has already ordered. Skinner made  the announcement on alcohol testing before a Senate committee considering its  version of legislation to require random testing throughout the transportation  industries. The Transportation Department last November ordered drug testing  programs in private transportation industries beginning at the end of this  year, but the programs face court challenges.  </P></p>

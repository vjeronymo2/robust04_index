			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: BHP considering Vietnam projects Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian natural resources group, said yesterday it was looking at a range of projects in Vietnam. However, it declined to comment on reports, published in a Vietnamese business weekly, that it was about to team up with General Electric of the US to build a USDollars 810m power and fertiliser plant near Ho Chi Minh City. BHP said no firm commitments had been made on the projects it was reviewing. The Ho Chi Minh City power project was reported to have formed part of a presentation made by BHP to the Vietnamese government last week. Gas to fuel the project would come from offshore fields in the South China Sea. BHP is involved in the development of the Dai Hung (Big Bear) field, in the Con-Son basin off the southern coast of Vietnam.</p>

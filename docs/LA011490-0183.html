			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VALLEY UPENDS GLENDALE TO CONTINUE SURGE IN WSC  </P> <P> The Valley College basketball team was a menagerie of personalities early this  season.  </P> <P> Injuries and illnesses to key players made for some interesting lineup  combinations and substitution patterns but didn't do much for consistency.  </P> <P> Valley players got healthy -- and apparently got themselves together  collectively -- when they opened play in the Western State Conference two weeks  ago.  </P> <P> Saturday night at Valley, the Monarchs stayed unbeaten in the WSC with an 82-69  victory over Glendale.  </P> <P> Valley improved to 13-8 overall and 4-0 in conference play.  </P> <P> The Monarchs, who on Wednesday snapped two-time defending conference champion  Santa Monica's 29-game WSC win streak, now sit alone at the top of the Southern  Division standings.  </P> <P> "They're playing as a team," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said of his players.  "They've found themselves."  </P> <P> The Monarchs were in a tight game midway through the second half against  Glendale when guard Andre Harrell spurred the run that put the game out of  reach.  </P> <P> Harrell, a redshirt sophomore who played at Inglewood High and West Los Angeles  College, scored seven of his 18 points during a 10-2 run that began with 8  minutes, 49 seconds left. The Monarchs led, 72-63, when they called timeout  with 5:15 left and went into a spread offense that pared time off the clock and  also seemed to sap Glendale of any comeback hope.  </P> <P> Glendale (14-8, 2-2), which had beaten College of the Canyons in overtime on  Wednesday, found itself unable to hit the open shot down the stretch against  Valley.  </P> <P> "You could tell that their will was a lot stronger to win the game than ours  was," said Glendale forward David Swanson, who scored a game-high 20 points for  the Vaqueros. "That's the first time that's happened to us in a long time."  </P> <P> Valley forward Steve Ward scored a game-high 27 points for the Monarchs.  Forward Shawn DeLaittre added 11.  </P> <P> Bruce Heicke had 14 points for Glendale while Gary Fowler and Justin Lord added  13 and 10 points, respectively, for the Vaqueros.  </P> <P> Valley was down by nine points early in the first half when the Monarchs  launched a 9-0 run that helped them to a 36-35 halftime lead.  </P> <P> Valley trailed, 21-12, when Ward hit a jump shot and Shelton Boykin followed  with two baskets. Erik McDaniels' three-point shot tied the score, 21-21, with  10:20 left in the first half.  </P> <P> Glendale led, 35-32, with 2:03 left when DeLaittre made a basket and free throw  for a three-point play.  </P></p>

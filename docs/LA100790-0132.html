			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ODYSSEY OF COMRADE FANG;  </P> <P> AT ODDS WITH HIS GOVERNMENT FOR THREE DECADES, CHINA'S LEADING DISSIDENT IS  FREE AT LAST -- AND TORN BETWEEN POLITICS AND SCIENCE  </P> <P> On June 24, Fang Lizhi and his wife, Li Shuxian, spent their last night in  China and their first night in a year sleeping outside an elaborately concealed  hiding place in the clinic of the U. S. Embassy in Beijing. After a farewell  dinner with U. S. Ambassador James R. Lilley, they went to bed in a guest room  at the ambassadorial residence. The next morning, accompanied by Lilley, they  were escorted to Nanyuan Military Airport in a motorcade led by a Chinese  police car bearing license plate No. 1.  </P> <P> The last time they had traveled through the streets of Beijing, their car had  sped along back routes, trying to avoid military patrols. It was the day after  the bloody end of the pro-democracy movement, and they had been on their way to  seek counsel at the embassy. Then the streets had been filled with People's  Liberation Army soldiers and milling crowds; now the Fangs' route through the  capital was lined with soldiers standing at attention. "It was just as if we  were visiting heads of state," Fang would later say with a smile. In fact, it  looked to Fang as if the Chinese Communist Party, which had so reviled him as  the country's best-known dissident intellectual, was now giving him a grand  send-off.  </P> <P> At the airport, the Fangs were met by a battery of grim-faced Chinese Foreign  Ministry officials and photographers assigned to record this strange  leave-taking. They boarded a U.S. Air Force C-135 jet, which had to be given  special dispensation to land in China. Moments later, relieved to be on the  verge of freedom but filled with ambivalence about leaving the country they had  struggled so hard to serve, they found themselves winging their way out of  China.  </P> <P> THIRTEEN MONTHS EARLIER, AS BEIJING plunged into chaos, American Perry Link had  hurried through the capital's dangerous streets to check on his friends Fang  and Li. The date was June 4, 1989. Link was a professor of Chinese language and  literature, in Beijing to administer scholarly exchanges for the National  Academy of Sciences. On his way to the Fangs' apartment, he passed burning  military vehicles at People's University and saw banners declaring "Mourn the  Dead" and "Blood Debts Must Be Paid in Blood," the first reaction to the  previous night, when troops had marched on Tian An Men Square, leaving carnage  in their wake.  </P> <P> Link found Fang and Li in a state of great agitation. Li was trembling and  whispering hoarsely, he recalls. "They just kept saying, 'It's extremely  dangerous, extremely dangerous: They've gone mad!' " Link recalled later. All  the friends could do was trade rumors. As Link left to attend to his own  family, Li pulled him aside and whispered in his ear: If she phoned and said,  "Bring your children over to play," Link should take it to mean that she and  Fang needed help -- and he should come at once.  </P> <P> The call came about 5 p.m., and Link immediately took a taxi back to the Fangs'  apartment. Friends had been telephoning, warning them that the Communist Party  had issued a classified order announcing an imminent wave of arrests. "Some of  those who called were rather important personages, and they all warned us that  we were in great danger," Fang remembers. "They stressed that if we did not  leave our home and seek refuge elsewhere, we would be arrested."  </P> <P> After a quick discussion, Fang, Li and their 21-year-old son, Fang Zhe, decided  to go to the Shangri-La Hotel, a large, nearby tourist establishment. Link knew  that CBS News had rented an entire floor there. If Fang and Li were in a  Western hotel, with members of the American press, Link reasoned, the Chinese  government would be less inclined to try to arrest them. He extracted a promise  of strict confidentiality from the CBS News staffers, as well as a pledge that  they would keep a careful eye on the Fangs, and again hastened home.  </P> <P> The next morning, Link found the Fangs even more shaken than the day before.  Students at Beijing University, where Li taught physics, had reported that they  expected the army to occupy their campus at any moment. Their options  narrowing, Fang, Li and Fang Zhe decided to risk the nerve-racking six-mile  ride across the city to inquire about temporary refuge at the U. S. Embassy.  </P> <P> After skirting the combat zones by taking back streets, the Fangs had to find a  way to get past the People's Liberation Army guards at the embassy gate. Link  got out of the car, flashed his American passport and succeeded in getting the  guards to open the gate. Then, while he distracted the sentries with  explanations in his excellent Chinese, the Fangs hurried inside, where they  raised McKinney Russell of the embassy's press and cultural section and Ray  Burghardt, the acting deputy chief of the mission.  </P> <P> "We told them that we thought the Chinese government was in a state of  irrationality and that they might shoot anyone," Fang says. "We asked if we  could stay until things quieted down, hoping that in one or two days, when the  government had regained a semblance of rationality, and order had been  restored, we could come out again. Above all, we told them, we did not want our  presence in the embassy to be made known to the Chinese government."  </P> <P> Russell and Burghardt pointed out that while "temporary refuge" was possible if  the Fangs were willing to officially request it, listening devices presumably  hidden throughout the embassy were doubtless already reporting their  conversation to Chinese authorities. Moreover, they said, with so many Chinese  staff members working in the mission, it was likely that their presence had  been noticed. The response of the Chinese government, they all agreed, would be  explosive: The United States would be denounced, the Fangs pilloried and the  whole pro-democracy movement attacked as the work of foreign forces. The  dangers of the situation were underlined when Chinese troops suddenly began  firing automatic weapons in the street outside.  </P> <P> "When all the talk was over," Link recalls, "Professor Fang turned to me and  said that he felt they should not ask for refuge even if their lives were in  danger. He said he wanted to do what was best for the movement."  </P> <P> Fang, Li and their son spent the night at the nearby Jianguo Hotel, where a  former classmate of Link offered the family the use of his room. About 11 p.m.,  their phone rang. "We are the two people you met this afternoon," a voice told  Fang. "We would like to come and talk to you again in person."  </P> <P> A short while later, there was a knock on the door, and two U. S. diplomats  offered to escort the family in a bulletproof car back to the U.S. Embassy as  the "personal" guests of President George Bush. Not knowing where else to find  refuge for the next few obviously dangerous days, the Fangs reluctantly  accepted the invitation.  </P> <P> On June 7, despite the Fangs' hope for discretion, White House Press Secretary  Marlin Fitzwater announced to the world that Fang and Li had requested  temporary refuge. And on June 8, at a press conference of his own, President  Bush justified the U.S. action by saying that his Administration "had acted in  compliance with international law, as an extraordinary measure for humanitarian  reasons."  </P> <P> Fang immediately wanted to leave the embassy. Hoping to get back to his  family's apartment before the Chinese Foreign Ministry lodged an official  protest, he asked for a car. Li urged him to stay, and so did embassy  officials, who were afraid for the Fangs' safety and concerned that if they  were arrested it would look as though the United States had left them out in  the cold. Fang finally relented.  </P> <P> It was a difficult decision, he confesses. Fang was all too aware of the stigma  that Chinese have traditionally attached to anyone seeking foreign protection.  "I may have a reputation for viewing things from a modern perspective," he  says, "but it is very difficult to say goodby to such traditional Chinese  views. And I must admit that I am very Chinese."  </P> <P> There was a quick and angry protest from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In  language that pointedly mirrored Article 41 of the Vienna Convention on  Diplomatic Relations, it charged the United States with "wanton interference in  China's internal affairs" and "violation of both international law and the  relevant laws of China." On June 12, a week after the Fangs entered the  embassy, the Ministry of Public Security issued warrants for the arrest of Fang  and Li, charging that they had engaged in "counterrevolutionary propaganda and  instigation." Fang Zhe, unnamed in the charges, left the embassy for home.  </P> <P> The Chinese media called Fang a "traitor" and denounced him as "scum"; Chinese  television newscasters read letters, purportedly from angry citizens, accusing  him of treachery. "His statements and actions have brought great suffering to  the nation," claimed one. "If he is not sentenced, it will be difficult to calm  popular indignation."  </P> <P> Trapped inside the embassy, Fang and Li could do nothing but wait.  </P> <P> GIVEN TO WEARING ZIP-UP jackets and nondescript trousers, Fang Lizhi is not the  sort of person one would notice in a crowd. He is a short man with a shock of  dark hair that falls over his brow toward owlish horn-rimmed glasses. He does  have one flamboyant feature, however: a disarmingly whinnying laugh that  immediately puts people at ease. At our first meeting, in 1987, he impressed me  as an unpretentious, almost ordinary person. Indeed, until a year before, Fang  was all but unknown outside China, except perhaps within the international  world of astrophysics. But after losing his job and being expelled from the  party following a round of 1986 democracy demonstrations, Fang quickly became  famous among liberal students -- and infamous among party hard-liners -- for  his outspokenness on the subjects of freedom and human rights.  </P> <P> When we first talked, Fang was living in a Beijing apartment, provided by the  Chinese Academy of Sciences, with Li and Fang Zhe, then 19. His eldest son,  Fang Ke, was in the United States, studying at Wayne State University in  Detroit. Although Fang was allowed to go to and from the Beijing Astronomical  Observatory, where he had been given a research position, he was forbidden to  have contact with students or journalists or to travel without special  permission.  </P> <P> Fang Lizhi (pronounced Fong Lee-jir) was born in 1936, the son of a postal  clerk, and he graduated from Beijing University at age 20 with straight A's and  a degree in physics. His future wife was in the same department. After college,  he went to work at China's Institute for Modern Research, but his career, like  that of so many intellectuals, was interrupted when, in 1957, Mao Tse-tung  launched his tectonic Anti-Rightist Campaign. Because Fang advocated academic  freedom and refused to confess to ideological error, he was expelled from the  party. But even after this rebuke, he remained a believer in China's socialist  revolution. He told me during our first meeting, "I continued to have faith in  Chairman Mao and to believe that it must have been I who was wrong."  </P> <P> During the Cultural Revolution of the late '60s, Fang again ran afoul of party  politics. By this time he was married and teaching in Beijing at the newly  organized University of Science and Technology, China's MIT. After being  incarcerated for a year, he was "sent down" to the countryside where, among  other jobs, he was forced to work in a mine and on the railroad. During this  rural exile, he had access to only one scientific book: Lev Landau's "Classical  Theory of Fields." "For six months I did nothing but read this book over and  over again," he told me. "It was this curious happenstance that caused me to  switch from solid-state physics to cosmology."  </P> <P> The treatment he received then finally began to unravel his belief in the  Chinese Communist Party system. Witnessing the hardship and inhumanity around  him, he says, convinced him that "the party was not telling the truth" and that  he "should not believe them anymore." When the high tide of the Cultural  Revolution began to ebb in the early '70s, the government, desperately in need  of anyone with technical training, sent Fang to Anhui Province, where the  University of Science and Technology had been moved. There, Fang was assailed  anew, this time for espousing the big-bang theory of cosmology, which provoked  attacks from hard-liners clinging religiously to Friedrich Engels' belief that  the universe was infinite. Just as the Roman Catholic church had once vilified  Galileo as a heretic, the party now began to look at Fang as a dangerous  dissident.  </P> <P> To Fang, the party's intrusions into science were witless and served to defeat  China's modernization. His investigations into the origins of the universe  required freedom of inquiry and expression, and he believed that the same  conditions were fundamental to any kind of creative thinking or imaginative  work. Through such party intercessions, Fang's strong disposition against any  and all constraining orthodoxies began to take firm root.  </P> <P> It was not until after 1977, when Deng Xiaoping was restored to power for the  third time, that Fang was given back his party membership and a tenured  teaching position at the University of Science and Technology. The next few  years were scientifically fruitful ones for Fang. He wrote scores of scholarly  papers, attended numerous international scientific conferences and had  residencies at both the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton in the United  States and the Institute for Astronomy at Cambridge University in England. By  the mid-1980s, Fang had also been appointed vice president of his university,  where he rapidly acquired a reputation as an advocate of academic freedom and  educational reform. He soon was much in demand as a speaker at other  universities. In 1985, he told a gathering at Beijing University: "We Communist  Party members should be open to different ways of thinking . . . for, if all  thought is narrow and simplistic, creativity will die. . . . We must not be  afraid to speak openly about these things. In fact, it is our duty to speak  out."  </P> <P> His call to intellectuals to throw off party domination by straightening out  their "bent backs" stunned students with its boldness even in the relatively  open political environment of 1986. What made Fang such a compelling speaker  was not just his message but that he dared to speak so freely. In a society  long accustomed to self-censorship and public silence, his speeches shocked  party leaders as much as they electrified students. Party cadres in charge of  "ideological work," who had become accustomed to controlling dissenters by  threatening, firing, detaining and even imprisoning them, were nonplussed by  the spectacle of Fang traipsing around the country like a circuit preacher,  speaking his mind.  </P> <P> That fall, he told a Tongji University gathering in Shanghai: "Speaking quite  dispassionately, I have to judge this period (of socialist revolution) a  failure . . . in essentially every aspect of economic and political life." He  went on to deride the notion of waiting for democracy to be delivered from on  high, telling his rapt audience that the concept of "loosening up" -- then  fashionable among reformist circles -- really implied nothing more than the  humiliating presumption that they were already "tied up tightly." He reminded  students that democracy is "first and foremost a question of the rights of  individuals and that individuals are the ones who must struggle for them."  </P> <P> Students hand-copied transcripts of his talks and passed them from campus to  campus. At one university after another, they flocked to hear him, laughing and  cheering as he criticized high-ranking leaders by name.  </P> <P> Late in 1986, when student demonstrations erupted at the University of Science  and Technology and then spread across China, a furious Deng Xiaoping finally  acted. Fang was fired and, along with well-known writers Liu Binyan and Wang  Ruowang, was again expelled from the party. The authorities then transferred  Fang to Beijing and put him under quasi-house arrest -- a move that backfired,  for it not only gained him enormous publicity in China but also improved his  access to the Beijing-based foreign press.  </P> <P> Even though his activities were limited in Beijing, in January, 1989, he boldly  sent Deng a handwritten letter calling on him to release Wei Jingsheng, a  dissident who had been imprisoned since 1979, and to declare a general amnesty  for all other political detainees and prisoners. Fang's letter provoked several  petitions of support from other intellectuals in what became a prelude to the  spring's historic Tien An Men Square demonstrations.  </P> <P> Again and again, even though he still regarded science as the real measure of  his success or failure, Fang was drawn into the political arena. Science, it  seemed, compelled honesty, and honesty compelled political involvement. "I  have, in fact, often just felt swirled into the middle of politics," Fang says  now. "At the moment of each political involvement, I have been aware that I  could have avoided it. But each time I did not want to go against what was in  my heart -- what was right. And, as a result, each time I have ended up getting  more deeply involved."  </P> <P> In February, 1989, Fang became embroiled in his biggest political brouhaha yet.  Although the Fangs had been invited to the farewell banquet at the end of  President Bush's official visit to Beijing, Chinese authorities prevented them  from attending. Forced out of their car on the way to the party, Fang and Li  were then hounded on foot by Chinese police through the streets of Beijing.  Picked up several hours later by a friendly Canadian diplomat, Fang was taken  to the White House press center, where he gave a tumultuous press conference.  Soon his face was in newspapers and magazines and on television sets around the  world. In several interviews, he suggested that the United States and President  Bush applied a "double standard" in judging human-rights violations, treating  the Soviet Union and China differently.  </P> <P> Precisely because of his increasing notoriety, Fang shied away from direct  involvement when the democracy movement erupted in Tian An Men Square that  April. "From the beginning, authorities claimed that the movement had been  started and was being controlled by a 'handful of rotten eggs,' and they hinted  at the involvement of Fang Lizhi," he says now. "I was, of course, very much in  favor of the movement, but in order not to give the government any pretext, and  so that the movement could demonstrate that it was actually a mass spontaneous  upwelling of intellectuals and students, I did not even go to the square."  </P> <P> His absence from the square has been criticized as a failure to assume  responsibilities he tacitly incurred. "I did not stay away from the square out  of consideration for my own safe  </P> <P> ty," Fang explains. "In fact, during that time I spoke every day with foreign  journalists. If I had wanted to protect myself, I would certainly not have  spoken out in this way."  </P> <P> In the aftermath of the protest, the party began a nationwide campaign to blame  the democracy movement on a "very small group" of "plotters against socialism."  After Fang and Li found sanctuary in the U. S. Embassy, they were accused of  almost single-handedly starting a "rebellion in which numerous people died."  </P> <P> But if the party overrated Fang's influence, so did many of the protest  movement's supporters. Fang recalls how, on May 18, at the height of the  demonstrations, a friend urged him to go immediately to the square, since he  was "the only person who could control the movement."  </P> <P> "Of course, I recognized that this was absurd," says Fang with a smile.  </P> <P> IN OCTOBER, FOUR MONTHS AFTER the violent end of the Chinese democracy  movement, I went to China in hopes of seeing Fang Lizhi. He was to receive the  annual Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award. The State Department, however, had  warned the Kennedy family, donors of the award, that a public announcement and  presentation could jeopardize delicate negotiations then in progress for the  Fangs' release. The Kennedys wanted me to ascertain Fang's feelings about  becoming the recipient.  </P> <P> The night I arrived in Beijing, the phone rang in my room at the Palace Hotel,  where I had been told to expect a call. An American voice, offering no  salutation and giving no name, said: "I am waiting for you downstairs by the  marble column just inside the front entrance of the hotel."  </P> <P> In the lobby, I spotted a figure in a dark suit standing alone near the  designated column. As I approached, he reached out to shake my hand and then  hastily turned and squired me through the revolving door into the chilly  evening. Only when we were in a hutong, one of the dark alleys that surround  the hotel, did he introduce himself as a Foreign Service officer assigned to  look after the Fangs.  </P> <P> He explained in great detail the concern embassy officials felt for the Fangs'  safety, especially given the recent bloodshed. If the couple's whereabouts  within the embassy -- three separate compounds several blocks apart -- became  known, U. S. diplomats feared that the Chinese government might be tempted to  seize them. The embassy, my interlocutor hastily added, would not be able to  defend itself or to protect Fang under such circumstances. "Whether you will be  able to actually see Fang, I cannot say," he concluded. "But please come to the  embassy tomorrow morning at 10."  </P> <P> The next morning, I got up early to bicycle around the city. As I rode toward  the Avenue of Eternal Peace, it was difficult to evoke those tumultuous days of  spring, much less to imagine the atmosphere of terror that had led Fang and Li  to the U. S. Embassy.  </P> <P> Just as in the past, clouds of bituminous morning smoke billowed up from behind  the walls of old courtyard houses as people began to light fires for breakfast.  The hutong were filled with the soft tinkling sound of bicycle bells and the  familiar whirring of spinning wheels as people pedaled off to work. On the  larger streets, the smell of frying youtiao wafted out from the stands of  pastry vendors, suffusing the air with fleeting zones of special pungency.  Children with backpacks made their way to school. And out on the large  thoroughfares, those public buses that had not been overturned and burned as  barricades during the demonstrations belched clouds of choking blue exhaust as  they labored away, jampacked, from their stops.  </P> <P> As I turned out into the heavy traffic of the Avenue of Eternal Peace, I felt  as if a dynamo somewhere in Tian An Men Square had suddenly revved up,  generating a powerful magnetic force that pulled me along. It was a feeling  that I imagined countless thou sands of Chinese throughout the past century had  also felt as they brought their protests toward this symbolic center of the  capital and the nation.  </P> <P> Then, suddenly, I found myself gliding past the Gate of Heavenly Peace, under  the implacable gaze of Chairman Mao as he looked out from his renowned  portrait. Around me spread nothing but a vast silence and emptiness. I had last  been here in May when the square boiled with onlookers and demonstrators, all  noisily debating politics, waving banners and roaring with a collective voice  that was as loud as a cataract. Now, like a stage with a struck set, the square  had been swept absolutely clean. It was so vacant, cold and quiet that it  seemed the perfect extension of the ponderous Mao Tse-tung Memorial Mausoleum  that had been erected at its south end to enshrine Chairman Mao's unnaturally  waxy and rouged remains.  </P> <P> The only pedestrians visible were armed martial-law troops wearing fatigues and  steel helmets that looked like mixing bowls. They stood in rigid rows along the  periphery of the square and guarded the enormous Monument to the People's  Heroes, which had served as the command post of student protest. Out in front  of the Great Hall of the People and the Revolutionary History Museum, I watched  as phalanxes of soldiers practiced goose-stepping drills.  </P> <P> In the middle of this sanitized public square, on the exact spot where the  Goddess of Democracy had stood before it was crushed by a People's Liberation  Army tank, there was now another sculpture. A party-ordered white  plaster-of-Paris surrogate featuring a worker, a peasant, a soldier and an  intellectual standing together in lifeless fraternal solidarity -- as if this  soulless socialist icon could exorcise the square of all heretical influences.  </P> <P> The reimposition of order in the square may have impressed China's hard-line  leaders as a great triumph. But despite their efforts, a few telltale signs of  what had happened still remained. In the middle of the Avenue of Eternal Peace,  looking almost as if children had made angel-wing patterns in the snow,  fan-shaped scars gouged by armored vehicles as they spun around that night to  fire on China's citizenry were still etched in the asphalt. There were bullet  holes in trees, buildings and walls. And the marble stairs leading up to the  Monument to the People's Heroes, where tanks had tried to climb, were cracked  and broken.  </P> <P> And these were only surface scars. "Don't be fooled," a taxi driver had told me  on the way in from the airport. "What has changed is not always easy to see  when you just look around. What is different now is something inside people's  hearts."  </P> <P> THE U. S. EMBASSY COMPOUNDS, like Tian An Men Square, were also surrounded by  cordons of People's Liberation Army soldiers armed with automatic weapons. As I  walked through one gate, a soldier cocked his gun menacingly. These troops were  a poignant reminder that the Chinese had not always scrupulously regarded the  sacrosanct nature of diplomatic missions. In 1900, government-supported Boxers  had laid a 100-day siege to foreign legations in Beijing. In 1927, a government  under warlord Zhang Zuolin raided the Soviet Embassy, arrested the founder of  the Chinese Communist Party, Li Dazhao, who had sought asylum inside, and  summarily executed him. Again in 1967, Red Guards invaded the British Mission  and set it on fire.  </P> <P> In the embassy, officials again stressed that they feared that visits would put  the Fangs at risk. All they really wanted to do was keep the Fangs physically  safe and out of the press. Nothing, they stressed, was promised, but I was told  to meet my original contact that night in front of the China International  Trade and Investment Corp. building. At the appointed hour, I was picked up and  taken to the American ambassador's residence a few blocks away. At the front  gate, we succeeded in breezing past the soldiers and security guards. As we  walked into the compound, I felt pulled by the same kind of powerful force I'd  experienced near Tian An Men Square. It seemed to draw me through the dark.  Soon, we were standing in a courtyard facing a single-story building that  turned out to be the embassy clinic. As we entered a lightless room, my guide  put a hand on my shoulder and led me to a closed door where he knocked out what  seemed to be some kind of code.  </P> <P> A moment later, the door opened. There before me, like apparitions, were Fang  Lizhi and Li Shuxian. Now in the half-light of their hiding place, Fang looked  much smaller than I remembered him. His hair was long, and his clothes were  baggy and rumpled; he had the air of a hibernating animal just awakened from a  brumal slumber. However, in his utterly characteristic way, he was smiling  broadly. Li, looking somewhat grayer, stood beside him, grinning like the  Cheshire cat. I was their first outside visitor in almost five months.  </P> <P> Both seemed in amazingly good spirits considering their circumstances. The  mock-apartment -- a few small rooms -- had been wired with an alarm system  complete with emergency buttons beside each place where Fang and Li worked and  slept. The windows had been covered so that no one could see in or out, and  special doors had been hung to deaden sound.  </P> <P> "It is a bit disconcerting to know that only a few yards away, there are PLA  soldiers with automatic weapons," Fang confessed at one point, gesturing toward  the outer wall. But then he laughed. "Nonetheless, we feel well and have been  working hard."  </P> <P> The first weeks of their hegira, especially the first few days, were the most  tense and frightening, they told me. They had heard about Cardinal Joseph  Midszenty, who had spent 15 years in the U. S. Embassy in Budapest, and about  the group of Pentecostals confined for five years in Moscow. "We did not  imagine that our time would be very short," Fang said. "But at the most, we  thought we would have to stay until the older generation (of leaders) died. It  couldn't be longer than that!"  </P> <P> As we talked, I could not help thinking that there were few people better  equipped for the rigors of such a monastic life than Fang Lizhi. As a  theoretical astrophysicist and someone interested in history, culture and  politics, he was possessed of precisely those intellectual resources that  enable a person to put so much slack time to good use.  </P> <P> It quickly became obvious that Fang had kept up-to-date on world events. We  talked about the Chinese democracy movement in exile and the events that had  been shaking Eastern Europe. He received foreign books, newspapers and  magazines almost daily through the diplomatic mail from San Francisco. We also  talked about the works of Hu Shi, a towering figure in non-communist Chinese  intellectual history, who ultimately became China's ambassador to Washington.  Hu had been a driving force behind China's first democracy movement, which  started May 4, 1919, and had traveled to the United States to study philosophy  and politics. There, he began to think and write about the ways in which he  hoped democracy, human rights and scientific rationalism could merge with  traditional culture to provide China with a future free from its old  conservatism and the new dogmatism of Marxist orthodoxy.  </P> <P> "It is a revelation to find that intelligent Chinese have written about all  these subjects that I am now thinking about," Fang said with a self-deprecating  laugh. "It was just our generation's misfortune not to have been able to read  them earlier."  </P> <P> And time and again, Fang talked about his own work. He lamented his lack of a  computer and technical books that would enable him to perform certain complex  computations more quickly. Still, he had finished three papers on astrophysics.  They had little meaning for me as a layman, but they were clearly of great  significance to him. They seemed to reassure him that his scientific persona  would not be eclipsed by his reputation as a "dissident," a moniker that has  not yet acquired the cachet in China that it now claims in Western societies.  </P> <P> Since Fang had arrived at the embassy, he had been very reluctant to make  public statements. But, from all he said that night, I gathered that he had not  been overtly pressured by the U. S. government to remain silent. What seemed to  constrain him was a desire not to impede negotiations with the Chinese  government. But I also sensed a more subtle inhibiting factor at work. Like a  typical Confucian gentleman, a junzi, he did not wish to be an improper guest  or to give the appearance of abusing American hospitality. Nonetheless, when I  mentioned the Kennedy award, Fang seemed pleased and immediately agreed to  write an acceptance speech.  </P> <P> What seemed truly to delight Fang was his growing collection of books, which he  kept on a set of shelves beside his desk. He referred to them grandly as his  "library." "So many people have been sending me books and periodicals," he said  with obvious pleasure.  </P> <P> The Fangs' most important possession, however, was a Chinese /English word  processor, a machine that enabled Fang to write scientific articles, to work on  his memoirs, to correspond with friends and colleagues. It allowed Li to  compile a kind of alphabetical "Summa Theologica" of the names and addresses of  the many people in China and around the world who were important to them. It  was hardly accidental that their address books were among the few things they  had grabbed as they left home.  </P> <P> Myriad behind-the-scene details had to be taken care of in the embassy. Somehow  the Fangs had to be outfitted with new clothing. This matter was solved with  old-fashioned American ingenuity: namely, a Sears catalogue, a mail-order  marvel that even produced the dark pin-striped suit Fang wore and the  red-and-white polka-dot dress Li wore when they finally surfaced in London.  What about vitamin deficiencies from lack of sunlight? A sunlamp would have to  be flown in from Hong Kong. What about meals? A microwave oven was installed,  allowing Li to cook dinner and Fang to cook lunch in what he called their  "high-tech Chinese restaurant."  </P> <P> Everything that was brought in to them, including food, had to be apportioned  into small amounts so that guards and staff members would notice nothing  unusual. All garbage and waste paper had to be secretly removed from the clinic  and disposed of elsewhere, no small feat considering the effluvia of a man  given to reading as many newspapers as Fang.  </P> <P> In this "black hole," as they humorously referred to their living quarters,  Fang and Li existed in a world devoid of day and night. "I am," Fang remarked,  "an astrophysicist who cannot see the stars." The Fangs attempted to keep their  circadian rhythms in cycle by adopting a daily regimen. They arose each morning  about 7:30, no matter what time they retired, and they ate at regular hours.  Their main contact with the outside world was the arrival each day of the young  diplomat assigned to them.  </P> <P> Suddenly it was 11:30 p.m., long past the time I was expected to leave. We  disarmed the alarm system and whispered goodby. Then I walked out the doorway  that they would not pass through for eight more months.  </P> <P> The next day, drawn more than ever toward Fang and Li's place of refuge, I rode  my bicycle to the embassy once again. Some writer's impulse made me want to see  it from the outside as well. As I pedaled past the gate on Guanghua Road and  turned left onto Ritan Road, the compound seemed as vulnerable as a lifeboat in  the middle of a vast ocean. Soldiers in battle gear were everywhere. And just  as Fang had said, several of them stood no more than a wall away from the very  place where he was doubtless sitting.  </P> <P> ON NOV. 15, FANG LIZHI "received" the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award.  "What Andrei Sakharov was in Moscow," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy during the  telecast ceremony, "Fang Lizhi became in Beijing." Lech Walesa memorialized  Fang and the previous winners, saying, "They did not shrug their shoulders,  they did not turn away, they did not cross the street when they saw another  human being harmed."  </P> <P> Fang's acceptance speech, which was read to the audience, was  characteristically understated. "In this land of my birth," he wrote, "human  dignity has once again been trampled upon." He admitted to feeling pessimistic  about China's current situation. But, he said, even within such a "climate of  terror . . . those who are most terrified are those who have just finished  killing their fellow human beings." Urging students and other Chinese in exile  not to discontinue their educations, he declared his undying belief in the  "force of knowledge" as the best ally of nonviolence.  </P> <P> "In my field of modern cosmology, the first principle is called the  Cosmological Principle," he concluded. "It states that the universe has no  center, that it has the same properties throughout. Every place in the universe  has, in this sense, equal rights. How, then, can the human race that has  evolved in a universe of such fundamental equality fail to strive toward a  society without violence and terror? And how then can we fail to try and build  a world in which the rights due every human being from birth are respected?"  </P> <P> By late fall, after Richard Nixon's October visit, the Chinese government had  softened its position to the point where it became willing to consider  releasing Fang and Li if they made public admissions of guilt. "Of course, we  refused," Fang says.  </P> <P> Then came the fall of Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, one of China's most  stalwart socialist allies. The Chinese balked again. It was not until the  anniversary of the June 4 massacre passed without incident that the Chinese  position again relaxed. More and more party hard-liners, it seemed, had  concluded that it was now in the interest of their country to resolve the  bedeviling matter of Fang and Li so that important economic relations with the  outside could be normalized again. Crucial, now, was finding a solution that  gave them a way out without losing face.  </P> <P> The second week in June, after President Bush recertified China's  "most-favored-nation" trade status, officials at the Chinese Foreign Ministry  unexpectedly invited Ambassador Lilley to dinner. The dinner presaged several  more phone calls requesting additional meetings. When both sides got together,  the Chinese asked to be reassured that President Bush had not written China off  and that Washington would look favorably on concessions from Beijing. Once  these assurances were given, negotiations took a businesslike turn.  </P> <P> A month earlier, Fang had reported experiencing minor heart palpitations.  Although there was no serious medical problem -- Fang himself later blamed his  chest pains on "too much coffee" -- Lilley astutely raised the matter of Fang's  "heart attack" in the negotiations. It gave the Chinese exactly the kind of  face-saving excuse that they needed to reverse themselves and let Fang and Li  go.  </P> <P> Asked what he thinks made the Chinese authorities finally relent, Fang had a  somewhat broader view: "I think it was all the pressure that they were feeling  from the outside world."  </P> <P> The negotiated deal required a public statement by Fang and Li. The complete  text, however, was never published in China. It read in part: "I am opposed to  the Four Cardinal Principles (i.e., adherence to the socialist road, to the  democratic dictatorship of the proletariat, to the leadership of the Chinese  Communist Party and to Marxism- Leninism-Mao Tse-tung thought) that are  contained in the preamble to the Chinese constitution, because their purpose is  to uphold a political system of class struggle. I take note that the above  political view violates this preamble of the constitution."  </P> <P> Highly selective editing allowed the Chinese government to claim that the  Fangs' statement showed their "signs of repentance." It also used another part  of the statement -- "we will appreciate and welcome all activities which accord  with the progressive interests of Chinese society and moreover refuse to  participate in all contrary activities whose motive lies in opposing China" --  to insinuate that Fang and Li had promised not to speak out against the  government after they arrived abroad. In reality, the wording left them free to  say or do anything they deemed to be in their country's interest.  </P> <P> Asked if he has any qualms, in retrospect, about the statement, Fang is curt.  "We would not and did not accept conditions demanded by the Chinese government  that we confess, repent and guarantee not to oppose them," he says.  </P> <P> If Fang is sensitive about appearances, so is the Chinese government. Lest  anyone at home interpret the release of these two arch-criminals as a sign of  Chinese weakness, Premier Li Peng was reported, in a paraphrase released by the  New China News Agency, to have declared: "Due to growing political and economic  stability in China, the Chinese government has taken a more lenient policy  toward people who participated in the turmoil last year. These moves did not,  however, result from pressure from the West."  </P> <P> For its part, the White House declared through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater that  the Administration had made "no commitments, no promises and no quid pro quo of  any kind" in gaining the Fangs' release. But Fang and Li were urged to yield on  one important point. Counseled that choosing the United States as their first  destination might inflame the Chinese government, they agreed to go to England,  where Fang had been offered a position as a Royal Society Guest Professor at  Cambridge University.  </P> <P> While the Bush Administration may not have made any direct promises, it was  obvious that the Chinese did expect specific returns. The Chinese were now  looking ahead to the Group of Seven summit scheduled for July in Houston and  the fall congressional vote on "most-favored-nation" status. When Japanese  Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced shortly thereafter that his country  would resume its multibillion-dollar aid and trade program with China, the  United States did not protest. Indeed, from the perspective of China's real  interest, yielding on Fang and Li proved to be a cost-effective way for the  leadership to remove one large symbolic obstacle between it and the rest of the  world.  </P> <P> FROM BEIJING, FANG AND LI flew to Alaska, where they were picked up by Air  Force II and flown to a U. S. air base just outside Oxford. One journey had  ended, but another was about to begin.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, the phones began ringing so frequently at the Institute of  Astronomy in Cambridge that the normally polite receptionist became distinctly  surly. The fax machine burped forth reams of urgent requests for interviews  from news organizations around the world. And camera crews staked out Fang's  new office, hoping to get a glimpse of him if he dared to come to work, which  he did not.  </P> <P> In fact, Fang spent the next 12 days avoiding the press. Although his son Fang  Ke had flown in from Detroit to be reunited with his parents for the first time  in 3 1/2 years, Fang Zhe was still back in Beijing. Twelve hours before the  release of his parents, he had been detained by the Public Security Bureau "for  his own protection." By delaying Fang Zhe's departure, the Chinese government  cleverly succeeded in restraining his father from speaking out at precisely the  time when world attention was most focused on what he had to say.  </P> <P> By the time I saw the Fangs in England, they had begun to settle into a  housekeeping apartment provided by the university, where they waited for news  of Fang Zhe. They were once again living in a kind of seclusion. Fang's laugh,  however, was as infectious as ever. Not once in the days that followed did I  hear him complain about his situation or show any hint of bitterness.  </P> <P> Still, he faced a new environment, a new job and a host of unresolved  questions. And I couldn't help but notice in him an uncharacteristic  tentativeness. One of his most immediate burdens was figuring out what posture  to take toward the overseas Chinese community. Many hoped that Fang would  succeed where others had failed, that "China's Sakharov" could galvanize the  disparate factions of the exile democracy movement.  </P> <P> As soon as Fang Zhe arrived in England, Fang Lizhi agreed to sit down for his  first formal print interview. About some matters he was perfectly clear. When I  asked him if he now viewed Deng Xiaoping as a criminal, he replied without  hesitation, "Yes, sure. Those who gave the order to kill bear the  responsibility and should be brought to trial." And, although he expressed  gratitude for all that the United States had done for him, he nonetheless  criticized Bush's conciliatory China policy. "The stronger the pressure from  without, the stronger the opposition from within," he said. "What I can tell  you is that Deng Xiaoping is not a superman. When he meets someone who is  stronger, he will give in. If you Americans will be strong, he will be afraid.  </P> <P> "Take my own case as an example," he suggested. "Ten years ago, it could not  have been solved this way. But finally the pressure exerted by international  scientific circles had a real impact on the Chinese government's decision to  make concessions."  </P> <P> Discounting fears that China could be forced back into Maoist isolation, he  pointed out that the country was now "much more integrated into the world than  during the time of Mao." Consequently, he felt that the American response after  June 4 could have been stronger. "At the very least, the U.S. could have  criticized the massacre and China's policy of suppressing dissidents more  publicly," he said. "The most important thing was to get the release of  political prisoners. We have many lists, and Bush could have used partial  sanctions coupled with conditions for lifting them to try to gain their  release."  </P> <P> "Your bodies may be big," he added, smiling, "but you also can be quite timid."  </P> <P> After we talked all morning, we picnicked under a tree along the Cam as  laughing students punted past on the river. Under a cloudless sky, with the  orderly lawns of St. John's College stretching away before us, it was almost  impossible to conjure up the bleakness of Beijing, much less Fang's dark hiding  place in the U. S. Embassy clinic. These two contradictory worlds, which Fang  had spanned in the space of a few days, seemed more like parts of a dream than  a coherent life.  </P> <P> After lunch, when Fang talked about his situation and his new life, I could  detect some indecisiveness. "I want to do something to affect the course of  events in China," he told me. "I know that young people abroad are trying to  figure out what to do next, and I too am puzzled by this question."  </P> <P> Fang Lizhi in exile, he said, would be a scientist first, as he had been in  China. "My major interest lies in science, and I think science is the best way  for me to make the maximum contribution," he said. But then he added: "I'm not  saying that this is the only way or that things won't change. Only that this is  the best way for now."  </P> <P> It was his desire, he said, to play a more spiritual than organizational role  in the exile democracy movement. And he was obviously reluctant to allow  himself to be seen as a savior. "I am not God, and I cannot pretend to be a  person who knows everything and is able to do everything," he said  emphatically. "If the Chinese are waiting for the appearance of a super-hero, I  am not that man. Moreover, I think that this expectation is in itself an  unhealthy one. . . . Chinese too easily tend to put all their hopes on the next  leader, only to become disillusioned."  </P> <P> When I asked him if he thought his departure from China was a victory or a  failure, his attraction to politics became apparent. "It is a victory in the  sense that the Chinese authorities finally had to let me go because they were  under pressure," he said. "But it can also be seen as a failure because I have  left my own country, and naturally my effectiveness will now be marked by  this." And then, as if he did not wish to appear too gloomy, he recounted the  successes of other exiled Chinese leaders, including Kang You-wei, Liang  Chi-chao and Sun Yat-sen, all of whom had played a part from abroad in  overthrowing China's last dynasty.  </P> <P> "In leaving China, the thing I am most concerned about is that there are so  many people in prison," he continued, raising one area of concern in which he  clearly hoped he could still have a positive impact. "This is the most urgent  matter, one that I regard as my moral responsibility. . . . As to human rights  activities, in these I will directly participate."  </P> <P> Fang has never been the sort of man to take to the barricades. What China  really needed, he told me, was to start absorbing modern ideas. "As Einstein  put it, the pursuit of truth is more valuable than the possession of truth."  </P> <P> But isn't such a strategy too passive to create change? I asked.  </P> <P> "To fill yourself actively with knowledge," he insisted, "is not a form of  passive waiting."  </P> <P> The pity of it is that because he is in exile, any role that Fang takes on now  will have only a limited impact on the future of his country. He poignantly  admitted as much. "Because I realize I can only really function in China," he  told me, "if circumstances allow, I will immediately go back and make whatever  contribution I can."  </P> <P> IN THE FUTURE, ONE CAN imagine Fang Lizhi's being called to serve his country  as Czechoslovakian President Vaclav Havel is serving his. But whether Fang  would ever consent to be taken for public service from science, like  Cincinnatus from the plow, is hard to say. He is both China's most eloquent  dissident intellectual, deeply involved in the political dialogue of his  country, and a dedicated astrophysicist, preoccupied with the misty reaches of  cosmic time.  </P> <P> Science is his foundation, and Fang seems wary of letting himself drift away  from it. Some may find a certain ingenuousness in the tenacity with which he  clings to academia and theoretical astrophysics when his country has so much at  stake in the here and now. How can he shrink from the role of leader when  suddenly he is set free and so many turn to him? they may well ask.  </P> <P> But whatever people's expectations, Fang has never viewed, much less  proclaimed, himself as the leader of an organized Chinese opposition. Each time  he has come into prominence, he has appeared to be thrust into it more by  circumstance than by any eagerness to capitalize on it for himself. Although he  clearly is fascinated with politics, in a way that strikes one as almost  Daoist, political attention has more often gravitated to Fang than he to it. In  this era of megalomaniacs and publicity seekers, any such reserve in political  figures is, in its cryptic way, both rare and reassuring.  </P> <P> While some may see weakness and lack of political commitment in Fang's  reticence, others will be heartened to discover a man who does not predictably  lunge for political power; a man who, given the opportunity to write himself  ever larger, cautiously continues to struggle not to lose himself, his  intellectual foundation or his principles.  </P> <P> There is no guarantee that Fang Lizhi will not be extinguished and forgotten  like so many other Chinese rebels who have momentarily streaked across the  political sky. Still, restrained political ambition can emit its own special  magnetic power, one that often ends up being far more persuasive than clamoring  egos, reams of official propaganda and even the firepower of a People's  Liberation Army.  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Survey of Nottinghamshire Coalfields Regeneration (6): Changing direction - Many ex-miners are looking on the bright side 'From my point of view, it was the best thing they ever did - closing down the pit,' says Robert McDiarmid, a former miner at the Sherwood Colliery in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire. Mr McDiarmid now manages a local pub. 'I am enjoying a new lease on life,' he says. Mr McDiarmid worked in the Sherwood Colliery for 20 years as a mechanic, chargeman fitter and a shift charger engineer. When the pit closed in February 1992, he was made redundant with 800 others. He had been down in the pit since the age of 16, although his father, also a miner, tried to dissuade him from taking a job there. After the colliery closed, Mr McDiarmid took a 'three month holiday' and then got in touch with a friend at Mansfield Brewery. The friend told him about an opening for an assistant manager at one of the brewery's licensed pubs, The Swan. He applied and got the job. He spent four months there before he moved to The Crown Hotel in Southwell, where he was manager for 16 months. Two months ago, he returned to The Swan to take over as manager, heading up Mansfield Brewery's most profitable pub, which turns over more than Pounds 1m a year. Mr McDiarmid says the job resembles the work he did at the pit. As a shift charge engineer at Sherwood Colliery in the last five years of his tenure he was responsible for the day to day mechanical operations of the pit and oversaw 40 men. At the pub he has a staff of 55. 'The job here is about managing people, and the job I had before was about managing people,' he says. He admits he occasionally misses the camaraderie of the pit, but he does not miss the work. 'The people who miss it are generally those who have found nothing else,' he says. It is difficult for many ex-miners to find satisfying jobs, because the skills they used in mining are not easy to transfer out of the pit. Peter Newham, a former ropes master splicer at the Cotgrave colliery, which closed down last April, replaced and maintained steel ropes on haulage installers in the mine. 'There is no call for these skills elsewhere,' he said. Now he is a fish salesman in Loughbrough, a 15-mile drive from his home. What he misses most, he says, is the 'laughs with the lads'. Many ex-miners yearn for the team spirit of the pit. 'You miss the comradeship,' said Alan Brown, an ex-miner and member of the Cotgrave town council. 'You used to work with a team and you worked with the same men for years. You knew how they ticked, they knew how you ticked and you trusted them.' In addition to the personal losses, the financial blow has been significant. Mr Newham and his family moved to Cotgrave in 1987 from Bulwell when the Hucknall Colliery, where he had worked since 1979, was shut down. When he came to Nottinghamshire, he was told he would have a job for life, and his family took on a large mortgage. 'Five years later, we were back in the same position,' his wife Sheila said. Many other families have been similarly affected by pit closures. 'There are people who feel trapped because they were encouraged to buy properties and make commitments on the basis of salaries that no longer exist,' said Bryan Barrodale, parish priest in Cotgrave. Mr Barrodale said that the husband of a couple he recently married was a winding engineer at the colliery and is now a cheesemaker making 50 per cent less than he did at the mine. When Mr Brown first took a redundancy from the Cotgrave colliery in 1989, he took a job as a part-time school caretaker. 'It cost me more in petrol to get there than I was making,' he said. Now he has a full time caretaker's job at Tollerton Primary School, about 10 miles from Cotgrave. Still, he is making nothing like what he was earning in the pit. 'We knew before we left the pit we would never get a job making that kind of money,' said Mr Brown. Even miners who have been able to get new jobs using their engineering or manufacturing skills have taken pay cuts. 'Coal mining is one of the elite jobs in manufacturing,' said Carl Leonard, Greater Nottinghamshire Tec's special projects manager in charge of communities affected by pit closures. 'It is very difficult for the men to get jobs that have equivalent salaries because the job market has changed.' Mr Brown is sees the bright side, however. As a caretaker, he does not have to contend with the three shifts a week that mining required. 'We used to call the 11:15 pm to 6:30 am shift the happy shift because we were so miserable,' he said. 'It is marvellous now to have a regular day shift. The kids say to me, 'why are you singing Mr Brown?' and I say 'of course I am - I am not working nights any more'.'</p>

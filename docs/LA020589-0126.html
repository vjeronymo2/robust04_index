			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'LETTER' TO EX-PRESIDENT PRAISED FOR ITS HONESTY  </P> <P> Thank you, thank you, thank you for having the courage to speak out. The  groveling and genuflecting to the Reagans is an anathema, disheartening and  disgusting to me.  </P> <P> It is wonderful to find a person gutsy enough and not afraid to speak out and  tell it like it is.  </P> <P> CYNTHIA CRISS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

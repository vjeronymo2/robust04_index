			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INSURERS SEEK TO KEEP TERRITORIAL RATINGS;  </P> <P> PROP. 103 HEARING WARNED CHANGE COULD HIKE COSTS IN SUBURBAN, RURAL AREAS  </P> <P> Insurance industry representatives Monday urged state officials holding  hearings on the implementation of Proposition 103 not to prevent companies from  basing auto policy rates primarily on where a driver lives.  </P> <P> Industry witnesses also said at the first of four days of state Insurance  Department hearings that the companies should be given "maximum flexibility" in  rate setting, despite a provision in the landmark insurance initiative making a  driver's record the prime criterion.  </P> <P> However, late in the day, one company, 20th Century, diverged from others,  suggesting a formula whereby the state insurance commissioner could weight  pricing factors according to a literal reading of proposition 103, thus  radically reducing the importance of where a policyholder lives.  </P> <P> Both department hearing officers and representatives of other companies  expressed surprise that 20th Century, the state's sixth-largest seller of auto  insurance, had become the first company to accept possible erosion of the  so-called territorial rating system.  </P> <P> Other companies warned that, while such a change would mean premium decreases  for urban areas, which pay the highest rates under the territorial rating  system, it could mean big increases for suburban and rural areas.  </P> <P> According to a controversial clause in Proposition 103, rates for auto  insurance policies "shall be determined by application of the following factors  in decreasing order of importance: (1) the insured's driving safety record, (2)  the number of miles he or she drives annually, (3) the number of years of  driving experience. . . , (4) such other factors as the commissioner may adopt  by regulation."  </P> <P> The fourth category could include not only territorial rating, but make and  model of automobile and a driver's age, sex and other factors.  </P> <P> During the election campaign that resulted in a narrow victory for Proposition  103, the industry argued that the initiative would virtually end the  territorial rating system and prompt rate increases in all but four of the  state's 58 counties.  </P> <P> After the election, however, some insurance company lawyers started trying to  figure out how to interpret the rating clause in such a way as to change the  basis by which rates are set as little as possible.  </P> <P> Monday, the department, with Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie absent  from the hearing but pledging to read all the testimony, began the hearing  process of deciding how to interpret and apply the clause.  </P> <P> For once, some consumer organizations, aware that a major move away from  territorial rating would mean higher rates for many Californians, appeared  hesitant to say what they thought the commissioner ought to do. Even Harvey  Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, sent written testimony suggesting that  territorial rating ought to be allowed to continue in some form.  </P> <P> However, Bill Press, representing the Los Angeles County Task Force on  Automobile Liability, called for outright elimination of territorial rating.  Press, a television commentator, is a prospective candidate for insurance  commissioner when the post becomes an elective one next year.  </P> <P> The insurers who testified took several positions.  </P> <P> Some, such as four industry trade association representatives, urged that  territorial rating be kept as a prime factor in setting rates, notwithstanding  the language of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> Representatives of some companies, particularly State Farm, the state's largest  seller of auto insurance, urged several possible interpretations of the  language of the clause that would, in effect, leave territorial rating and most  other present rating criteria, such as make and model of car, in place, thus  affecting prices little.  </P> <P> The State Farm representatives handed out a series of estimates of what they  think would happen if rates depended solely on driving record, miles driven and  years of driving experience.  </P> <P> According to the estimates, rural Northern Californians would pay 33% more for  auto insurance, suburban and rural San Diego residents 19% more and San Jose  residents 15% more, while Central Los Angeles and Beverly Hills residents would  pay 62% less, Santa Monica and Malibu residents 44% less, Anaheim residents 15%  less and Torrance residents 12% less.  </P> <P> State Farm warned further that if make and model of car were no longer to be  used as rating criteria, the owner of a Ford Escort in Central Los Angeles and  Beverly Hills would pay 90% more to insure the vehicle, while the owner of a  Rolls Royce would pay 92% less. It also suggested that, if age were no longer a  permissible factor, adult drivers would pay 11% more and youthful ones 48%  less.  </P> <P> Such results would be highly unjust, the State Farm speakers said, suggesting  three separate interpretations of Proposition 103 that they said would avoid  such injustices.  </P> <P> State Farm had by far the longest and most comprehensive presentation. By the  time its representatives got on, all nine television channels that had been  present earlier had left, as had most other members of the news media.  </P> <P> One hearing officer commented afterward to The Times that it is inevitable that  some "tortured" interpretation will eventually be used by the department, in  order to prevent wild fluctuations of prices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Different Approach  </P> <P> When 20th Century's representative spoke, he took a different approach,  suggesting a weighting formula whereby Proposition 103 could be applied without  a tortured interpretation of language.  </P> <P> Jim Curley, senior vice president of 20th Century, said that Gillespie could  order 30% of pricing determination be based on a driver's safety record, 25% on  miles driven, 20% on years of driving experience, 15% on where a policy holder  lives, 7% on type of car driven and 3% on the number of cars in a household. He  did not discuss what such a system would do to prices.  </P> <P> Other insurers in the room were highly critical of such an approach. They said  the state does not keep good enough records or keep records long enough to give  solid indications of what a driver's safety record really is.  </P></p>

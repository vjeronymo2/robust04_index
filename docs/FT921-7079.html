			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Hoare/ABN Amro At last the uncertainty is over for Hoare Govett. In ABN Amro it has found a parent with ample financial muscle which promises to allow it considerable independence. There is scope for links between Hoare Govett and the stock broking businesses already owned by the Dutch bank in Amsterdam, Paris, and Madrid. Less clear is how the purchase fits into ABN Amro's wider strategy. Buying a share of the over-broked UK equity market is not necessarily the most sensible proposition, even for a bank determined to diversify outside its home market. But perhaps ABN Amro found Hoare Govett so affordable it did not need to think very hard - on the most generous of assumptions it is paying less than 2 per cent of group equity. More likely, however, the purchase is part of a larger strategy for the UK which will eventually mean other acquisitions. Hoare's management may yet have to fight for its independence as the empire grows.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Now Scalfaro Must Be </F> Answerable"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- [President] Scalfaro's challenge has sent  shock waves through political circles. "I challenge anyone to  prove that any former interior minister -- not only myself --  allocated a single lira outside institutional purposes," the  president declared Sunday [29 May] in the library of the Oropa  [northwest Italy] sanctuary. This was the first time that Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro had directly broached the Sisde case, the scandal  in which the secret service's greedy treasurers have tried to  implicate the chief of state. Scalfaro did not say that he  never saw any money change hands; what he said was that he spent  it all for the sake of the state, challenging anyone to prove  the contrary. Now some people are applauding him for having  spoken out so clearly, while others would like him to answer for  what he said, demanding that he reveal exactly how the vast  secret funds were spent.    The first to put this question to him was Gianfranco Fini,  AN  [National Alliance] leader. However, yesterday Fini  backtracked, saying that he is not demanding Scalfaro's  resignation nor that he give evidence on how he spent the money:  "It is not he who must say how he spent it," he said, without,  however, adding who should do so. As the MSI [Italian Social  Movement] made this qualification, AN members issued peremptory  demands to the president. Late yesterday morning Gustavo Selva,  the new chairman of the lower house Constitutional Affairs  Committee, stated his own opinion: "The chief of state's  remarks cannot be called into question.... Nevertheless the  president's evidence should be verified, since Parliament is  entitled to know exactly for what institutional purposes Sisde's  secret funds were spent." Two hours later former Sisde Director  Luigi Ramponi, now an AN senator, renewed the demand: "It is  necessary to prove now that the funds were used for  institutional purposes...."    The watchword was: Scalfaro must explain. It was an  extraordinarily consistent one, with even the PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left] making the same demand: We want a financial  statement. The spokesman was Franco Bassanini, the  constitutionalist, who judged Fini's response "reasonable." "It  is perfectly possible that interior ministers used Sisde funds,  albeit legitimately. Perhaps those funds were allocated to  perform plastic surgery on some criminal who turned state's  evidence and to enable him to engage in some activity to make a  living. But Scalfaro must provide an explanation." What the  PDS deputy disliked most was the reference to ministers already  implicated in the scandal: "The most embarrassing thing is that  what applies to Scalfaro may also apply to his predecessors.  This means, then, that this documentation has not been  destroyed and that it therefore exists, or at least that it did  exist." This being so, according to Bassanini, there is only  one way to examine whether the funds were administered properly:  "To grant an independent authority the opportunity to check on  the destination of the funds."    Very well, quipped Pierantonio Graziani of the the PPI  [Italian Popular Party], but how can Scalfaro reveal it if the  expenditure was confidential? "Since these were confidential  funds used for equally confidential institutional purposes,  should Scalfaro -- in order to maintain this confidentiality --  whisper the truth in Fini's and Bassanini's ear?" But the rude  shock to the president's friends came with the statement from  Raffaele Della Valle. Having conceded that "for the present"  there is no "Scalfaro problem," Della Valle added Forza Italia's  weight to the demands for explanations from the president: "The  president's word cannot be called into question, but I do not  believe that anyone is exempt from the obligation to provide, in  the proper forums, fuller explanations of what he says."

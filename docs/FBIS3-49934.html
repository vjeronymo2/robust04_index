			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bucharest ROMPRES, 11/01/1994 -- The law empowering  the government to issue ordinances and authorizing the  contracting and guaranteeing of foreign credits was endorsed in  observance of the provisions of Articles 64 and 74 paragraph 2  of the Constitution, decided the Constitutional Court of  Romania, on January 11.    The Constitutional Court had been intimated on December 30,  1993 by 59 deputies on the unconstitutionality of the  above-mentioned law. They claimed that the law had been  endorsed consequent to the vote on the report of mediation on  chambers' divergences that did not meet the legal quorum.    In its decision released today, the Constitutional Court  shows that the quorum is the condition for the parliament's  chambers to meet in sitting. Therefore, failing to have a  quorum results in adjourning the sitting. So, one cannot  mistake the quorum for the vote. Consequently, the  constitutionality of the quorum condition and of the result of  the vote shall be assessed on separate moments of the  parliamentary legislative procedure.    As is known, the chamber speaker called the roll before the  voting to check the quorum and it appeared that 278  parliamentarians were present, as shown even in the intimation.  Which makes the quorum valid.    It is sustained in the intimation that the constitutional  wording "the presence of the majority of the parliamentarians"  means the number of parliamentarians who participated in voting  and not the number of actually present parliamentarians. This  mistakes the legal sitting quorum, which is a condition of  immediate presence before voting, for the voting itself, which  has a quite different meaning, which is the expression of the  attitude required for a majority to endorse or turn down an act.</p>

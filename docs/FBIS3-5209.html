			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yoshio Hatano, Japanese ambassador to the </F> United Nations, by Motohide Yoshikawa, chief of the United  Nations Policy Division at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on 7  December 1993; place not given]    [Text]Five Important Problems    [Yoshikawa] We would like to ask Japan's UN Ambassador  Hatano, who temporarily returned to Japan for an ambassadorial  conference on the Middle and Near East, to spare some time for  us and tell us about the United Nations, particularly about the  Security Council. It is generally thought that, with the end of  the Cold War, the United Nations has become very active and has  begun to play a new role in world security. First of all, we  would like you to tell us about the current problems facing the  United Nations as you see them.    [Hatano] I often say that the United Nations faces five  important problems at present: First, peace-keeping operations;  second, refugees; third, human rights; fourth, humanitarian aid;  fifth, the environment. These five problems have two aspects --  Japan can do much in one respect and can do little in the other.    As far as peacekeeping operations are concerned, the  Japanese  have the fundamental problem that they are reluctant to go to  dangerous places. The problem we face with the issue of  refugees is that although Japan provides aid for their  assistance, our contribution is limited as far as the acceptance  of refugees is concerned.    On human rights there is sharp contrast in values between  Asia and the West. Asia hopes Japan is well placed enough to be  sympathetic to its point of view, while the West hopes that  Japan, as a developed nation, will share its point of view. On  the positive side, Japan can mediate between the two; on the  negative side is open to criticism from both sides.    On the issue of humanitarian aid, Japan provides a large  amount of aid. But its philosophy is based on the idea that  helping those who help themselves is good assistance. At  present, however, those countries which can help themselves have  mostly been helped. For those countries which are still unable  to help themselves, Japan is often one step behind other nations  in providing funds, even if it does so in the end. Somehow,  Japan does not give the impression that it will provide aid of  its own volition.    Only on the issue of the environment does Japan take the  lead  without restraint. However, there is the problem of the weight  the country carries in the United Nations. Unless a country  makes a considerable contribution in the first four areas, it  will find it rather difficult to take the initiative in the  fifth.    The first four problems are, in many cases, discussed in the  Security Council when concrete, urgent countermeasures are  needed. It might be thought that the Security Council discusses  only security issues. Recently, however, the definition of  security has become so wide that it has come to include human  rights, refugees, and humanitarian aid. The original Security  Council resolution on Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia, and on  Somalia, was to dispatch peacekeeping forces to support the  smooth implementation of humanitarian aid. In that sense, many  of the important problems dealt with by the United Nations are  discussed in the Security Council. Important UN elections, such  as those for secretary general and judges of the International  Court of Justice are also conducted in the Security Council.  Therefore, the easiest way to make a contribution to the United  Nations is to have a voice in the Security Council. If a  country is not a member of the Security Council, it has no  chance to give advice or put in a word no matter how hard it  tries.    [Yoshikawa] The peacekeeping operations of the United  Nations were successful in Cambodia, but they met a severe  ordeal in Somalia. What is the current view of the United  Nations on peacekeeping operations?    [Hatano] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said that the  United Nations had had two crises. The first crisis lasted  until four or five years ago, during which no hopes had been  entertained for the United Nations. In my opinion, nobody in  the world at that time thought that the peacekeeping operations  of the United Nations could ensure the security of the world.  The second UN crisis which Secretary General Butrus-Ghali  referred to is the period in which undue hopes had been  entertained for the United Nations, and it lasted until  recently. The establishment of a just peace by the United  Nations through the Gulf war prompted successive requests to the  United Nations from all over the world for the dispatch of  peacekeeping forces to their places, thus raising undue  expectations. In answer to these expectations, peacekeeping  forces were dispatched to various places of the world, such as  Cambodia, Yugoslavia, and Somalia. However, the results fell  short of our expectations, except for Cambodia. Meanwhile, the  expenses have become so great recently that the so-called United  Nations fatigue and a tendency toward self-examination -- the  dispatch of peacekeeping operations cannot be continued in this  manner; or whether it is proper to continue the dispatch -- has  been born, to my thinking, in the United Nations and the  Security Council. However, there are successive requests from  all over the world for the dispatch of peacekeeping forces at  present, and the United Nations is racking its brains to cope  with these requests. If Japan expresses a negative view, it is  refuted: "Although Japan promoted peacekeeping operations in  Cambodia, is it against them when they are conducted outside of  Asia?"    It is often said in the United Nations that there are two  kinds of peace in the world: one is "peace with justice" and  the other is "peace without justice." If the United Nations had  not intervened in Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a peaceful  situation might have been produced, at least on the surface.  However, a peace of this kind would have been the product of  Iraq's unlawful annexation of Kuwait. The idea of the United  Nations is that it cannot tolerate such peace without justice.  Recently there have been a large number of countries where an  excessive violation of human rights is being practiced, famines  have broken out, and refugees have come into existence, not to  mention the invasion by Iraq. The insistence and  self-confidence of the United Nations are that it must not  remain indifferent to such a situation without justice and that  it must actively intervene in such a situation on its own  initiative.    I would like to add a few words here that there are people  who say that in Japan every peace is peace with justice despite  the fact that there are two kinds of peace as mentioned above.  <H5>  Demand for Transparency in the United Nations </H5>   [Yoshikawa] In my opinion, many readers of this magazine  think that the United Nations is doing something very difficult,  and they have no idea how the United Nations reaches a decision.  Now, you have served as Japanese ambassador to the United  Nations for the past four years, and you have also attended  Security Council meetings every day these two years as a member  of the Security Council. We would like you to tell us about how  the Security Council comes to a decision, about what kind of  role the ambassador and the permanent mission on the spot play,  and about the atmosphere of deliberations at the Security  Council.    [Hatano] It is said that the United Nations has three  classes of members: the first class is the five permanent  members; the second class is ten nonpermanent members (note:  the permanent members are China, France, Russia, Britain, and  the United States; the nonpermanent members as of the end of  1993 are Japan, Brazil, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Hungary, Morocco,  New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, and Venezuela); the third class is  the other 169 members. The customary practice is that when the  Security Council makes a decision, first of all only the five  permanent members of the first class hold a conference, make  their plan, and submit their plan to a conference of the ten  nonpermanent members for deliberation. The mutual cooperation  among the five members is very close. At the stage of a  conference by the five members, one or two members of them may  oppose vigorously. But, once an agreement is reached by the  five members, it is supported by the five members in a body both  at unofficial and official conferences of the Security Council.  Then the ten nonpermanent members find it very difficult to  oppose the agreement.    These permanent members have a veto. In actuality, a veto  is rarely exercised, but they exercise a right called "the  pocket veto" in the sense that they can exercise their veto when  the occasion demands. A proposal advanced by a nonpermanent  member may be rejected, but the same kind of proposal advanced  by a permanent member is accepted in compliance with its request  so that the permanent member will not exercise its veto. Since  these five members with special power make a plan without the  participation of the ten nonpermanent members, the ten  nonpermanent members can hardly oppose the plan. Japan was well  consulted on the problem of Cambodia and most of its opinions  were accepted in the end. However, Japan did not participate in  the discussions conducted by the five permanent members, but  took the form of effecting a liaison with the five members when  they conduct discussions, from outside of the five members.    Concerning the ten nonpermanent members, five of them are  nonaligned nations, which form a "nonaligned caucus" alias "the  caucus" and adjust their opinions. The remaining five members  are called "the non-nonaligned caucus," to use the jargon of the  United Nations. In the caucus, there are five nations,  including Japan, but their interests do not coincide nor do they  belong to the same group. They belong to a group which is not a  group in the strict sense of the word; therefore almost no  adjustment of opinions is made among these five nations. And so  they do not make a plan as a group or oppose other nations'  plans in cooperation with each other. That makes them easier to  be defeated one by one, which is of course generalization. The  rest depends upon the ability of individual ambassadors.    Last, there are relations between the 15 nations which are  the members of the Security Council and the 169 nations which  are not members of the Security Council. The other day a  Western ambassador said at an important meeting that in the  United Nations there are now 15 nations that make a decision and  169 nations that conform to the decision, and that such a system  must be changed. To my mind, this opinion probably represents  all the 169 nations. The non- Security Council members have  requested that they be allowed to participate in Security  Council meetings, even if indirectly, and that they should at  least be informed of what is going on in the meetings. These  are, what is called, requests for transparency, and there is a  growing consciousness among the current Security Council members  that improvement of the situation is necessary.    [Yoshikawa] You served as chairman of the Security Council  in January 1993. Please tell us about your experiences as  chairman.    [Hatano] The chairman of the Security Council works  twenty-four hours a day. Since there is a time differential,  the chairman must negotiate at midnight over the telephone with  the foreign minister of a foreign country or its president when  the occasion demands. The chairman is often awakened in the  dead of night. During my chairmanship, there were various  problems, of which the problem of the U.S. attack on the missile  bases of Iraq and the problem of seating the Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia in the United Nations were serious ones.  In the end, the two problems were settled off the Security  Council floor. It was three o'clock in the morning when I  talked with the U.S. ambassador over the telephone about the  attack on Iraq. I negotiated with the Iraqi ambassador a number  of times. I had a number of conferences with the foreign  minister of Greece, and the president and the foreign minister  of "Macedonia" [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. I spent  a lot of time on the elections in Western Sahara, on the  Palestinian refugees, on the conflicts in Angola, as well as on  former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Cambodia, and others.    An unofficial plenary session of the Security Council is  held  almost every day, and when the session begins the chairman must  make an effort to put the ideas of all the members in order and  to reach a consensus. However, the chairman has full power over  whether a particular agenda item should be taken up and when it  should be taken up if at all. If the chairman sends an agenda  item to a meeting of the Security Council when the time is not  ripe for action, that will only complicate the matter. In that  sense, the harder the problems, like the problems of the Former  Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Iraq, the more likely they  are to be solved off the Security Council floor. In short, the  chairman is most active before an official plenary session, and  the ability of the chairman is determined by how an adjustment  is made over the telephone and when and what kind of tentative  plan is shown by the chairman to persons concerned. On the  other hand, the chairman, attempting a compromise in this way  behind the scenes, must pay attention to the request for  transparency. I was attentive to the relationship with the  media. I was obliged to keep company with the television from  all over the world for more than 30 minutes every day. If I  failed to do that, I would end up being misreported or  criticized. I fully realized how dreadful the media was.  <H5>  It Is Impossible To Play the Leading Role Without Policy </H5>   [Yoshikawa] For the past two years, Japan had been in the  Security Council as a member of the second group. Since Japan's  term as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council expired on  31 December 1993, it now belongs to the third group. How do you  evaluate and grade Japan as a nonpermanent member which  participated in meetings held by the Security Council almost  daily?    [Hatano] It is difficult to make a self-evaluation of the  activities of Japan, but I think that Japan had always played  the leading role in Asian problems. Although Japan did not  directly participate in the conferences of the five permanent  members concerning the problems of Cambodia, it spoke a lot and  what it said was always reflected in the Security Council's  resolutions. I do not think there was any instance in which  Japan's will was overridden by the five permanent members.  Although the problem of North Korea (the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea) is not yet a topic of discussion in the  Security Council, Japan's opinion on the matter has already been  asked time and again.    On the other hand, concerning problems outside of Asia,  naturally, Japan's opinions are listened to if it is involved in  the problems. For example, Japan has donated $100,000,000 to  Somalia, and Japan's voice carries weight in its own way.  Concerning areas to which Japan has not made a great  contribution, it is making a contribution in the form of giving  advice. In my mind, the most important thing for Japan to do is  to establish a policy of managing each conflict. What is  Japan's idea for solving the conflicts in Tajikistan, in  Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia, Burundi, Rwanda, and Liberia? The  most desirable thing for Japan to do is to give advice upon  establishment of a policy of solving a particular problem after  a close study of each problem. Unless Japan has such a policy,  it cannot play a leading role. It would be meaningless for  Japan, even if it could.    [Yoshikawa] You have pointed out that a country cannot play  a leading role unless it has a policy. That is a valuable  suggestion. We would like to consider problems outside of Asia  as our own problems and establish a policy to cope with such  problems. On the other hand, this is not a  which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg question, but Japan is  compelled to express its view because it is given the chance to  do so at the Security Council. Under such circumstances, Japan  will come to have its own views on the various problems of the  world you have just pointed out .    On 3 December 1993, a General Assembly resolution was passed  concerning the reorganization of the Security Council, and the  problem of how to reform the Security Council will be discussed  in earnest in the United Nations early in 1994. This is a  matter of great concern in Japan because this is related to the  problem of what kind of position Japan will occupy in the  Security Council. We would like you to tell us about the  significance of the current decision of the United Nations and  about your view on the progress on this problem.    [Hatano] Concerning the which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-  egg question, you may be having a hard time in Tokyo. But, seen  from New York, it is a little different. I think it is wrong  for Japan to have its own view because it is compelled to do so.  It seems to me that Brazil, Spain and New Zealand, which are  currently members of the Security Council, have their own  assertions concerning each problem mentioned above, not to  mention the United States, Britain, and France.    Concerning the reorganization of the Security Council, I  think there are two problems. The first problem is: Japan and  Germany are the second and third largest contributors to the  United Nations; according to the Western style of thinking -- no  taxation without representation -- it is quite natural that  Japan and Germany, as great political powers, should be made  permanent members, because they are not only great contributors,  but they are also politically influential seen from the world as  a whole, whether they like it or not.    The second problem is: there were 51 member nations when  the United Nations was established in 1945, of which 11 were the  members of the Security Council at that time; the number of the  member nations has increased to 184, but the number of the  permanent members has increased from 11 to only 15; moreover, at  first the member nations of the Security Council were mostly the  so-called countries in "the North"; thereafter, the number of  member nations has increased due to the joining of largely  so-called independent nations in "the South," but the balance  between "the North" and "the South" has shown almost no change  since the establishment of the Security Council. Therefore, the  second problem is how to rectify the imbalance between the North  and the South.    I think that the second problem mentioned above has been the  main force in the reorganization movement of the Security  Council. The central idea of Japan is apt to be: "What are you  going to do with Japan?" Although the United Nations fully  understands the first problem, judging from the atmosphere of  the United Nations as a whole, the solution to the problem of  the representation of the countries of the South, which comprise  more than three-fourths of the member nations of the United  Nations, seems to be the main stream of the reorganization of  the Security Council at present.    From the standpoint of "the South," Japan is not only the  most important donor country, but also the friend of "the South"  who understands the claim of "the South." And "the North"  supports Japan not only because Japan shares the same sense of  value as "the North," but also because what Japan says is close  to the claim of "the North." I think that Japan is now in the  middle of the stream of the reorganization of the Security  Council, created by "the South." The UN secretary general says  that Japan should become a permanent member of the Security  Council and that would benefit the United Nations. It is not  impossible for Japan not to become a permanent member of the  Security Council, contrary to the current of the times, by  refusing to be a Security Council member. But, in that case,  Japan would be criticized for avoiding its responsibility.    Japan is by no means aiming for the position of permanent  member by overstretching itself or through maneuvering. The  position of a permanent member cannot be gained through such  means. Japan cannot be a permanent member unless the general  atmosphere of the United Nations expects Japan to become a  permanent member. Since such an expectation actually prevails  now, Japan's negative attitude toward that will only invite  disappointment and criticism.  <H5>  Reorganization of the Security Council Was the Pandora's Box </H5>   [Yoshikawa] Then, can we say that the success of  reorganization of the Security Council depends on how the wishes  of the countries of "the South" are reflected? Various  countries have already expressed all sorts of opinions at the  United Nations, and it will take some time, in my mind, to put  these opinions in order. This is a problem we have to think over  without haste, is it not?    [Hatano] That is right. I think the solution of this  problem will take considerable time. Japan's problem is not so  serious, but there will be considerable trouble among the  countries of "the South" in making plans for the participation  of "the South." "The South" itself must put its opinions in  order before "the North" expresses its opinions.    Looking back over the past two years, I find marked  progress.  Only one and a half years ago, the five permanent members used  to say that the problem of reorganization of the Security  Council is a Pandora's box. They had consented to open the  Pandora's box, pick out only Japan, and make it a permanent  member. But they had opposed this by saying that opening the  Pandora's box would produce so many problems that they would  become uncontrollable. I think that now all the permanent  members take the reorganization, as well as the admittance of  Japan and Germany to permanent membership, for granted.    Although things are moving relatively fast and there is a  mountain of problems to be solved, the problem of reorganization  may certainly move toward solution in 1995. The reason is that  1995 is the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and many  countries are thinking of doing something memorable and  conspicuous on that occasion. I think it is important to place  great value on this opportunity.    [Yoshikawa] In Japan, it is pointed out that an adequate  discussion is not being conducted on the effect that Japan's  permanent membership in the Security Council will produce on  Japan's course and its form of existence. On the other hand, it  seems that this problem has been taken up by the media and  others since the summer of 1993 and has become, so to speak, a  topic for public discussion.    I think that Japan should display initiative in the  international agency called the United Nations, which has 184  member nations of the world and which covers political, economic  and social problems, whether or not Japan becomes a permanent  member of the Security Council. We would like you to tell us  your opinion about what Japan should do in the United Nations on  the basis of your experience to the present day.    [Hatano] In Japan, there is a tendency to think that the  United Nations is like a noble world federal government, that  Japan must give its cooperation to such a government, and that  Japan should be pleased that it has been given a chance to give  its cooperation. Such a tendency is welcomed by those of us who  take charge of the United Nations, and yet I think that such an  idea is wrong. Japan is an important member of the United  Nations, and it is we ourselves who constitute the United  Nations. Therefore, Japan's concern is not to make its  contribution to the United Nations, but how to make use of the  United Nations. I think United Nations diplomacy is not for the  purpose of making a contribution to the United Nations, but to  make use of the United Nations.    Concerning the relationship with the Security Council, Japan  would have a decisive voice in the reform and reorganization of  the United Nations if it becomes a permanent member of the  Security Council. In that sense, it is one idea to make a  contribution to a reformed United Nations and to a reformed  Security Council; but I think it can also be said that it is  better to become a permanent member of the Security Council if  Japan is to make reforms. For example, the ultimate nature of  peace-keeping operations will be determined, after all, through  a succession of Security Council resolutions. And Japan will  have a decisive voice in the discussion of that problem if it  becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. Therefore,  I think it desirable for Japan to become a permanent member of  the Security Council to reform the United Nations at the  initiative of Japan.    [Yoshikawa] As you have just said, I think we should not  forget the fact that the United Nations does not have a  different existence from us, does not exist on the other side of  the river, in other words, is not "an outsider," but is "an  entity of which we are a part."</p>

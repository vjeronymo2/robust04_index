			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / World Commodities Prices: Wool Some Australian wool sale reports are a little brighter this week, but improved buying interest is confined mainly to Western Europe and China, with Japan, normally in the lead, only providing support. Prices are generally unchanged with occasional instances of slight easing, and some higher prices paid for carding wools which a few days ago were appreciably cheaper to buy. Traders in wool remain highly cautious in considering the chance of price rises, as long as the Australian stockpile overhangs the market. The AWC market indicator on September 1 stood at 411c/kg, the same as a week earlier.</p>

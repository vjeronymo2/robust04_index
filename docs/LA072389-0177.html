			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL ELITISM  </P> <P> Elitism is alive and well in Laguna Niguel as shown by Thom Taylor's fervent  plea to restore the Pan Pacific Auditorium (Letters, July 9). What chutzpah for  someone 30 to 40 miles away, completely insulated from about 10,000 daily  automobile trips anticipated for this project by the Environmental Impact  Report and the six intersections adjacent to the project, which are now at  gridlock levels as well as the six additional intersections which would be  raised to unbearable levels by this development.  </P> <P> Taylor's rhetoric is offensive to a community plagued by massive traffic  problems and a dearth of parks and open space, which would be exacerbated by  this so-called renovation. When he says (with no factual support) that "the  significance of the Pan is far beyond detractors perceptions," he is slandering  an entire community now cursed with the effects of uncontrolled development.  </P> <P> Taylor naively says "the developer has stated the fire would actually give them  a bit more latitude with the renovation plans, while respecting the historic  fabric of the building in a dignified manner." To those of us who have seen the  almost complete destruction caused by the fire and who know how little  so-called "historic fabric" remains to be respected, the developers' reaction  sounds like a self-serving statement by those who recognize a rare opportunity  to further exploit scarce park land for commercial development.  </P> <P> MAX W.

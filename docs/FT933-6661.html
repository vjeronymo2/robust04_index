			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / WH Smith cuts costs to move ahead by 5% WH SMITH, the retail and distribution group, yesterday gave an upbeat trading statement and announced an unexpected improvement in pre-tax profits, in spite of increasing losses at Do It All, its DIY joint venture with Boots. Pre-tax profits for the year to May 29 were Pounds 113.8m, up 5.3 per cent on last year's Pounds 108.1m, restated according to FRS3. That was well ahead of analysts' forecasts of about Pounds 110m. The shares closed up 16p at 471p. Sir Simon Hornby, chairman, said all the group's retail businesses had recovered strongly in the second half. 'This was caused partly by a modest revival in consumer spending, but more particularly by the actions we have taken to cut costs and increase sales.' Sir Simon added the underlying increase in sales had continued since the year-end. Smith has reduced staff by 800, and increased profit per employee by 3.2 per cent. Group turnover, excluding Do It All, and Virgin Retail, the joint venture with the Virgin group, rose 8.7 per cent to Pounds 2.31bn. Overall sales in the retail businesses increased 13.4 per cent to Pounds 1.48bn, with like-for-like sales - excluding newly-opened stores - up 8.8 per cent. UK retail sales, including WH Smith, Waterstones bookshops, and Our Price record shops, were 5.3 per cent ahead at Pounds 1.23bn, with sales of books, music, and videos all stronger in the second half. In the US, where Smith continues to expand with a chain of bookstalls in airports and hotels, a record shop chain, and two Waterstones, sales increased 55.5 per cent to Pounds 200.6m, and operating profits 69.2 per cent to Pounds 11m. Group operating profits increased to Pounds 130.3m (from Pounds 120.9), but losses at associated undertakings - Do It All and Virgin - rose to Pounds 14.4m from a restated Pounds 9.4m. Smiths' share of the operating loss at Do It All increased to Pounds 14.3m, with sales down 7.3 per cent. Smiths made a one-off gain of Pounds 4.6m on the sale of its stake in Yorkshire Television. The final dividend was raised to 9.9p, for a total payout of 14.2p (from 13.4p). Earnings fell slightly to 31.1p (from 31.2p). Do It All, Page 20 Lex, Page 16</p>

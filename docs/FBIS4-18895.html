			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Forza Italia leader Silvio </F> Berlusconi by Vittorio Zucconi in Arcore; date not given: "How  I Want To Govern Italy"]    [Excerpt] Arcore -- [Passage omitted] Who made you do this,  Doctor Berlusconi? What demons forced you to leave your villa  in Arcore and enter the fray with [Northern League Secretary]  Bossi, [National Alliance leader] Fini, [Democratic Party of the  Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto, and [Pact for Italy leader]  Segni? "Love for my country. I realized as far back as last  summer that I had to decide, when the new electoral law handing  Italy over to the politicians of the Left was passed, a Left  which pretends to be liberal but which carries within the  inextirpable kernel of economic planning and statism. The  center was in pieces, the Right was in tatters, I attempted in  vain to convince them to come to an agreement, to form a team.  I picked up their forces, and within three months I had created  a party from zero, and put together 400 candidates; I organized  the electoral campaign and I said to myself: My life as an  entrepreneur, as an industrialist, is finished. One phase of my  existence has come to an end, and another one is beginning, that  of politics. I am ready to sell my shares, if buyers can be  found in this difficult market, providing that the work and  faithfulness of those who have followed me is rewarded." Sell  everything, really sell? "I am ready to go even beyond American  standards. My life as an entrepreneur is coming to an end. I am  in the political world. I have overcome the first hurdle, and  there is still a lot to do. I also want to convince everyone  who said that I was mad."    Away from the rows of factories, condominiums, sham country  cottages, and motorway turn-offs, from Berlusconi's villa the  Alps appear extremely close and the dust of politics a very long  way off. But it is only a mirage, because the bites of Bossi,  whom he calls ("do not write it," but I do write it, be patient,  it is too beautiful) "dangerous and unpredictable as a wounded  boar," are strong. And the shadow of those young people's  fascist salutes following the victory weigh on him. "I know,  certain gestures and Fini's praises of Mussolini as a statesman  have made a bad impression, in particular abroad, and I am aware  that there is a lot of work to do. But a general has to make  war with the troops which he has, and I have no doubts about  Fini. His liberal choices are clear and have been made, his  path toward liberalism and freedom has been a genuine path. And  I am ready to guarantee this, I who am balance, moderation, and  measure personified. There is no, and I say, no getting away  from this choice of balance and moderation. This should be  clear, also abroad."    But, on the other hand, it is not clear indeed where the  promise of a stable, strong government, double quick, is going  to end, now that relationships between yesterday's allies have  become those between the hunter and the wounded boar. "Bossi  will do what he wants. Outside the alliance with me and Fini  there is nothing for him, and he knows it. He certainly knew it  a short time ago when, at the house of my friend [Fininvest  chairman] Fedele Confalonieri we lifted our champagne glasses  together to toast the new government program. I am speaking  clearly: If I am given the task, I will form the government.  If it is not a majority, we will vote again, and we will count  the votes...." Whose votes, and with whom? "For example, with  the votes of the moderate Catholics, now that the Church has  recognized my center role." And why should not the other  parties attempt to form a different majority? "Oh yes," he  adds, quickly stifling a yawn, "a nice government of Bossi, [PDS  Deputy Secretary] D'Alema, [former Italian Popular Party (PPI)]  Secretary Martinazzoli, [Rete leader] Orlando, and [Communist  Renewal leader] Bertinotti? They come to an agreement. One  could blow it over like a house of cards."    Maybe, but Silvio Berlusconi is not a laughing man, rather  he  is a man who smiles, with his now famous, voted for, telegenic  smile ("let us not begin with the story of TV in the electoral  campaign in which I had just 6 percent of presence on the TV  screens in March, less than Bossi; so what else?"), a smile  which perhaps was once the salesman's smile, but which has now  become his own. It now seems obvious that the Vendor and the  True Person have merged, as if Berlusconi has finally convinced  himself that he is what he says he is. And Berlusconi is not  someone to be ashamed of his success "which I have earned,  worked hard for, like [Milan soccer star] Baresi who made his  billions playing the great defender. And why not?"    If he does not smile, if he does not succeed in giving me  the  impression of a really happy man, at peace with himself, the  reasons do not lie in money, Fininvest accounts, or the quarrels  with Bossi. The secret lies in a championship which Berlusconi  feels that he has not yet won, making the victories so far only  partial victories: the superbowl of respect. When I ask him, a  bit louder, in order to be heard above the buzz of the motor  movers manicuring his lawns outside, if he, the most recent  arrival at the table of power, still feels that he is treated as  a "parvenu," I realize that I have struck to the heart of a man  who has had enough of the teasing, of the commonplaces, of "Mr.  TV," "Berlusca," "Arcore man," and "His Broadcasting Highness,"  which rain down on him.    It is as if a stopper had burst open. "It is a whole life  which is involved. When I entered soccer, you know the results.  I took a team on the edge of bankruptcy and carried them to  three, touch wood, four championships and two champions' cups.  When I wanted to make and sell houses which were different,  properties which were different with gardens, footpaths,  12-meter trees, and cycle tracks, people already began to laugh.  I took in hand televisions belonging to private groups which  were losing billions hand over fist, and everyone laughed  because they believed that they had had the better of me, that  they had hoodwinked the parvenu. I wanted to enter politics,  and everyone said to me, including my dearest friends, even my  family, but no, you are crazy, but you are going to your ruin,  and ruin there would certainly have been, also for my industrial  group, if I had lost. But I did not lose. Let them laugh."    Some 50 years striving for recognition, the liberation of  this incubus: the parvenu. On a shelf, under a stupendous 18th  century picture, I see a souvenir which reminds me of the first  dollar which American billionaires used to frame, but it is not  money. It is a little yellowed press clipping enclosed in  Plexiglas, a two-column headline dating from 1961 announcing the  award of the "Gioannino Manzoni" Advertising Award in an amount  of 500,000 lire to Berlusconi Silvio. The first clipping of  public respect. "I always had all of them against me, even in  this election campaign. The newspapers were against me,  Scalfari [LA REPUBBLICA editor], LA REPUBBLICA, and L'ESPRESSO,  because they belong to another party. Mieli at the CORRIERE and  Mauro at LA STAMPA because of their convictions and that of  their editors. Montanelli has left IL GIORNALE without my ever  saying anything to him, only a lunch-time phrase about Segni,  who seemed to me destined to lose. He has gone his way because  someone enamored of his own image as he was could not bear to  cohabit with someone who was beating him precisely in the area  of image. The same applies to Bossi. The big industrialists  did not move a finger to help me. I ran alone."    We walked together down the gravel paths of the park, past  the immense sculpture of Cascella, as far as the family tomb,  excavated in the basement, to host friends, himself, but in  particular his father, who died four years ago. "A certain  journalist teased me about this tomb. But do you know why I  built it? Because my father, before I died, said to me:  `Silvio, put me in your park, and when you go running in the  morning, stop for a moment and say to me: Goodbye, Dad.' Let us  move on," and he pushed me outside, toward the green soccer  fields where someone had placed the ball on the penalty kick-off  disk, ready to be kicked surely into the goal net. "You are not  cold?" he asked solicitously. "No, I have a question. With so  much rage in your body, Doctor Berlusconi, do you have a wish  for vendettas? Against the RAI [Italian State Broadcasting  Corporation], against the newspapers, against everyone.    ``What are you saying? But I am incapable of vendettas, I am  also incapable of taking it out against those who trip me up  within my own companies, who betray me at home, no vendetta,  never, against nobody. I would like to take the responsibility  of governing in order to give my country a hand, not in order to  punish anyone. This image of Berlusconi-Nero is ridiculous."    How many promises, how many easy hopes flew up into the blue  sky of Brianza, and how easy it is to talk. "I have never  spoken senselessly in my life, and my life itself demonstrates  this. In the first 100 days of my government, if I am given  responsibility for it, it will be necessary to give a hand to  those who take risks, who invest, who create work. We need to  work quickly to get the economy going again, very quickly. We  need to reward, not to punish with taxation as the statist  Socialists want to. And when we have public expenditure under  control, we can also look at fairer taxation for those who can  do less." One hundred days in the American fashion, in the  Reagan fashion, in the Thatcher fashion, the models spew out.  "Not models, but people I admire, and not that Ross Perot whom  some have compared me with mistakenly. I am not a John Wayne in  politics. I would certainly like to have Thatcher's success,  but not have the country pay the social costs of these  successes."    This then is the old "Italian dream," having one's cake and  eating it. But it is not dreams, but income policies which have  ruled our social peace until now. "You would like to ask me  whether I will have done, as prime minister, with the income  policy, with the agreements between CONFINDUSTRIA [General  Confederation of Italian Industry], the government, and the  trade unions. Martino, my main economic adviser, is a free  trader of the Friedman school, he believes in the principle of  competition, but he does not preach everyone fighting everyone  else. Agreements are necessary. The problem is not to turn  them into a straitjacket which imprisons development, the  market, and employment itself, in particular of young people,  which we wish to defend. I repeat, agreements with trade unions  are necessary, providing they do not transform themselves into a  barrier against the unemployed person seeking his first job."    Everything seems so easy, so logical, when one walks besides  a persuasive man such as Berlusconi in his park, and the desire  to "buy" is very strong. And for the same reason it is very  easy not to believe, just as one does not believe in the  promises of Carosello [TV advertising] promising to strengthen  hair with lotion. On 28 March, Italy, ripped off by the First  Republic, bought the Berlusconi lotion. Now we will see whether  the hair grows better.</p>

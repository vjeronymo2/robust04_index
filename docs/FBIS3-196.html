			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by four opposition political parties in </F> Niamey on 2 March following a meeting on armed rebellion; read  by Sanni Bako, information and propaganda secretary of the  National Movement of Development Society-Nassara--recorded]    [Text] We, the Alliance for Democracy and Social  Progress-Zoumounchi, the National Movement of Development  Society-Nassara, the Union of Popular Forces for Democracy and  Progress-Sawaba, the Union of Progressive Patriots and  Democrats-Chamoua, after meeting today and thoroughly analyzing  the document entitled Armed Resistance's Global Program, which  was referred to us by the president of the Republic through his  letter dated 22 February, make the following statement:    First, the national and international opinion notes that the  demands of the armed rebellion in our country seriously  jeopardizes national unity and territorial integrity. Those  demands are the logical consequences of the ostrich policy and  shady deals that this problem has engendered since the end of  the sovereign national conference. Second, all the demands made  by the armed rebellion should be examined in the strict respect  for the provisions of the 26 December 1992 Constitution, whose  guarantor is the president of the Republic. Third, in the face  of the armed rebellion's determination to continue its repeated  deadly attacks, we urgently call on the government to take all  the appropriate measures to ensure the security of people and  goods throughout the country. Fourth, and finally, we condemn  and call for an end to all the maneuvers, manipulations, and  other machinations from inside and outside aimed at partitioning  Niger. In this regard, we urge the president of the Republic to  assess the historic, political, and legal significance of the  oath he took before God as well as the Niger people and  therefore assume all his responsibilities.</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Sudan expels British envoy Sudan last night ordered the British ambassador, Mr Peter Streams, to leave the country within two weeks. The move appears to be in retaliation for a visit to the south of the country by Dr George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury. A Foreign Office spokesman in London said that Mr Abdul Rahman Bakhit, Sudanese charge d'affaires, was being summoned 'in order to demand an explanation of this totally unjustified action'. Dr Carey flew to the rebel-held south yesterday from Nairobi in defiance of a ban from the Sudanese government. He had earlier declined an invitation by President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, to pay an official visit to Khartoum. 'It is a sad development but it is the right and necessary decision,' Canon Roger Symon, secretary for Anglican Communion Affairs, said earlier. 'We did not want him to be identified with the government rather than the Church.' Dr Carey had explained he travelled overseas only as a guest of the local Anglican church. The radical Islamic regime in Khartoum has denied accusations it discriminates against the country's more than 3m Christians. It faced bitter criticism in September when an Anglican bishop was flogged in Khartoum after an Islamic court found him guilty of adultery. Bishop Peter Birish was given 80 lashes. Dr Carey had planned to meet Christians in Khartoum, Juba and the Nuba mountains as well as seeing government leaders to discuss inter-faith and humanitarian matters. 'But the government wanted to control the archbishop's programme and by implication this meant they would decide who he sees or does not see, where he goes or does not go. We found this unacceptable,' Canon Symon said. Dr Carey plans to meet leaders of the two factions of the Sudan People's Liberation Army which are fighting for autonomy for the south. Sudan's military-led government, which came to power in 1989, has become increasingly strident in its support of radical Islamic movements, and earlier this month was host to a three-day session of the Arab and Islamic Popular Congress which aims to defend Moslems against perceived western aggression.</p>

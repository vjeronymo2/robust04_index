			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: London housing scheme A project valued at Pounds 23m to design and build 365 dwellings, including land provision, has been agreed between LAING HOMES SPECIAL PROJECTS and the Peabody Trust. The Peabody Trust, one of London's largest charitable housing trusts, has selected Laing Homes Special Projects as one of its volume building partners. Work to construct the housing, which is for rent, will commence in Hillingdon later this year, with the first dwellings being ready for occupation at the end of the year and with contract completion expected in 1995. Volume building programmes are being offered by Laing in response to the Housing Corporation initiative 'Operation breakthrough', in which housing associations are encouraged to enter into long-term partnerships with house builders, so benefiting from economies of scale.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) In foreign countries where the amount agreed to does not exceed $2,500.00, the requirement for obtaining a guardian may be eliminated. However, in areas where the FTCA (subpart D) applies, local law should be consulted as a basis for determining whether a court appointed guardian should be required. The requirement to appoint a guardian should not be imposed until a particular claim is determined to be meritorious in an amount that would require the appointment of a guardian. The claimant should be advised of this requirement well in advance of settlement negotiations so that the cost of establishing guardianship can be considered by the claimant as a factor in evaluating the claim. This requirement also can be eliminated if local law authorizes or requires a claim such as for death of a parent of the minor, to be presented on behalf of the estate of the decedent by an administrator, administratrix, or the like. In such cases, a settlement agreement signed by the administrator, administratrix, or the like will suffice if, under local law, such action is binding on the minor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The above provisions are in addition to, not in lieu of, the requirements of &sect;536.20(a)(5). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Claims involving incompetents. The above stated principles may also be applied in appropriate cases involving incompetents. Authority to waive the foregoing requirements in appropriate cases is delegated to the Commander, USARCS. If it is felt that the foregoing requirements are materially impeding settlement of the claim, the matter should be brought to the attention of the Commander, USARCS for appropriate resolution. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Claims involving workmen's compensation carriers. The settlement of a claim involving a claimant who has elected to receive workmen's compensation benefits under local law may require the consent of the workmen's compensation carrier and in certain jurisdictions the State agency with authority over workmen's compensation awards. Accordingly, claims approval and settlement authorities should be aware of local requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.33 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Vouchers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Vouchers are prepared in an original and three copies. The original and two copies (one marked as comeback copy) will be transmitted to the disbursing office and one copy retained as a suspense copy. Upon payment of the claim, the disbursing office will return the comeback copy, which will be included in the file when it is transmitted to the Commander, USARCS for post settlement review. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;536.34 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Accounting codes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Certifying an approved claim for payment creates an obligation against the claims appropriation for the fiscal year then in progress. Accordingly, the voucher will bear the appropriate accounting code for both the appropriation charged and the current fiscal year, irrespective of the date the claim accrued or was filed. Confusion sometimes arises at the end of a fiscal year; for example, an approved claim is certified for payment on 28 September (the last business day of a fiscal year), but it is obvious that it will not be actually paid (i.e., a check issued by the disbursing activity) until on or after 1 October (the first day of the following fiscal year). At the time the check is issued, the accounting code will not be advanced to the next fiscal year. Claims checks are issued using the accounting code of the fiscal year in which the claim was certified for payment (i.e., the fiscal year in which the voucher was signed). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The accounting code for each type of claim remains constant, except for the third digit of the code which is the second digit of the fiscal year (e.g., ``O'' for ``FY90''). The accounting codes for claims appropriations are published each fiscal year in the AR 37&hyph;100 series. Accounting codes used in the payment of claims and refunds, and their references, are listed below; the ``X'' denotes the space where the second digit of the fiscal year appears. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 1,L1(,0,),p3,8/9,i1,s200 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Table  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> B&hyph;1._ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Frequently Used Claims Accounting Codes <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=22 g=1 f=4 --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0205 P202097.23&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0305 P202097.23&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart C (Military Claims Act) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0203 P202097.21&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0303 P202097.21&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart C (Military Claims Act) Use symbol only if claim approved for $2,500 or less_if approved for more than $2,500, allotment symbol will be filled in by GAO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0208 P202097.26&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0308 P202097.26&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart E (Nonscope Claims) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0206 P202097.24&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0306 P202097.24&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart F (National Guard Claims Act) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0207 P202097.25&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0307 P202097.25&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart H (Maritime Claims) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0204 P202097.26&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0304 P202097.26&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart J (Foreign Claims Act) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accounting code: 21X2020 22&hyph;0201 P202097.11&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 21X2020 22&hyph;0301 P202097.11&hyph;4230 FAJA S99999 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reference: Subpart K (Personnel Claims Act) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=4 --> &sect;536.35 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=4 --> Payment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .

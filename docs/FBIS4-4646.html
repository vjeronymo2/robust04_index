			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 1 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and the  United States will wait before deciding whether to hold this  year's joint military exercise in view of recent developments in  the North Korean nuclear row, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu said.    Speaking at a press conference for Korean correspondents on  Friday, Han said Washington and Seoul had left open the  possibility of holding Team Spirit when North Korea violated its  agreement with the United States on Feb. 25. South Korea and the  United States, however, have yet to discuss such matters as when  to hold the exercise, Han said.    Han then noted that the U.N. Security Council has just  adopted a presidential statement urging North Korea to permit  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspections. He said  he believed the U.N. action opened "another possibility" to  resolve the nuclear dispute through dialogue. But right now,  more weight is being given to the Security Council step than  dialogue, Han said.    Given these circumstances, Seoul has no intention of taking  the diplomatic initiative vis-a-vis Pyongyang in order to  achieve a breakthrough in the nuclear impasse. Neither has the  South Korean position changed with regard to its previous demand  that Pyongyang must accept IAEA inspection of all seven reported  nuclear facilities, Han said.    Asked whether Seoul is prepared to give in and let Pyongyang  and Washington hold a third round of talks before an  inter-Korean envoy exchange, Han said "no." There have been no  discussions between Seoul and Washington on this point, he added.    Han reiterated that progress would come only when North  Korea  accepted complete IAEA inspections. "There could be flexibility  as to whether North Korea accepts inspections or the IAEA makes  a proposal on negotiations (for inspections)," he said.    Commenting on U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's remark  that in order to resolve the nuclear dispute risk of another  Korean war can be taken, Han said Perry clarified that he had  been partly misinterpreted.    Prior to Friday's press conference, Han appeared on NBC-TV's  "Today" program and said another chance is at hand to resolve  the nuclear dispute. Han said he had reaffirmed in his talks  with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that they would  keep the door open for North Korea to solve the issue through  dialogue.</p>

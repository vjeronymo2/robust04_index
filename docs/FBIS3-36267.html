Democratic Russia's first prime minister, Silayev received  the appointment to Brussels after handing over his government  duties to Yegor Gaydar at the end of 1991. To be sure,  Silayev's new post was a kind of honorary exile, but at the same  time a sign of gratitude on the part of the president.    What is behind Ivan Silayev's resignation -- dissatisfaction  with his performance? another upcoming appointment? Our  correspondent called the ambassador's office in Brussels:    [Silayev] I am not a diplomat and therefore from the very  start of my work in this capacity I have regarded it as  temporary. After all, before that I had worked for approximately  40 years in industry, which has remained my main sphere of  interest. This is why when the president visited Brussels in  December, I asked him to consider the possibility of replacing  me. He promised to, although he said that he had no complaints  to make about by work. At 1000 on 20 January, in Moscow, the  president received me for a final conversation. I stated my  case and he agreed. Therefore on 1 March I will return to  Russia, and I am very happy about this. I am not hoping for any  government posts; I would like to go back to the production  sphere. Machine building and aviation industry -- this is where  I think my experience could be useful.</p>

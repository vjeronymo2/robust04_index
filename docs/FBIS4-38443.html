			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report over video by correspondent Viktor Tkachenko; from </F> the "Military Courier" program]    [Text] Our next reports come from different garrisons but  they are all connected with one common problem, the Armed  Forces' budget. The Defense Ministry's shortage of cash is now  affecting the holy of holy's, the Army and Navy, and their  combat training. The development of up-to-date armaments and  equipment is also being curtailed.    [Tkachenko] This is the state's missile test range at  Plesetsk. Our latest and most powerful missile, the Topol, is  being tested here. The testing of these missiles may have to be  substantially curtailed because of the shortage of finance. If  this happens, the combat readiness of missile forces could be  impaired because, unlike many other units of the Russian Army,  the missile troops are on duty 24 hours a day. The upkeep of our  nuclear missile shield is comparable with the running of a  modern nuclear power station.    The strategic missile forces, which consume less than seven  percent of the overall defense budget--a modest sum in  quantitative terms, are a very important argument that is always  present in the background at all talks with leading foreign  countries. At the moment Russia's intercontinental Topols are  flying reliably and hitting their targets. Will they be turned,  like their predecessors, the SS-20s, into [word indistinct]  heaps of metal? Will Russia continue to be a great power or will  it turn into a banana republic? Today this does not depend on  the missile troops but on the politicians.</p>

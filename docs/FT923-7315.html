			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Soviet Coup - One Year After: Industry wants course change - Business interests are pulling Yeltsin in opposite directions TWO years ago, Russian plant managers bullied President Mikhail Gorbachev into a conservative U-turn which paved the way for the abortive coup. Today, industrialists are once more in the limelight as they openly call on President Boris Yeltsin's radical government to change course or resign. The most active of these industrial politicians is Mr Arkady Volsky, head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, who claims he has no designs on high office but seems to be doing all he can to achieve gain it. 'He has even picked a cabinet, although they are having trouble finding young people to join it,' says one usually well-informed sympathiser. Mr Konstantin Zatulin, director of a rival business association, says: 'Now he (Volsky) has to make President Yeltsin fall in love with him.' Although it is not clear how far they support him personally, the directors he credits with 'keeping angry workers off the street' have had very real grievances against the government. First there was the banknote shortage which meant workers were not paid; that is now being sorted out. Then there was the uncertainty of legislation, which for instance has meant constant changes in foreign trade rules. Now there is a trio of industrialists in the cabinet, the main problem is how far it will give in to enterprises' demands for new credit as it tries to sort out a crisis over more than Rbs2 trillion in arrears. On Thursday, a group of 1,640 manufacturers attended a conference organised by Mr Yuri Gekht, leader of the parliamentary Industrial Union who made them vote for reversal of the government's financial austerity and radical privatisation plans. 'We have been bankrupted by its policies,' warned Mr Shamil Menzeleyev, manager of the 2nd Moscow Watch Factory. 'If the government does not heed what we have said here today, we will bankrupt it politically.' Many object to the privatisation programme  - mainly because it reserves only a minority of shares for management and workforce. There is growing alarm at the possibility of foreigners buying up their shares or taking over their markets. Many are angry about the government's chaotic approach to the conversion of military factories to civilian output. Many managers are also disappointed by the fact that foreign investors (often seen as auxiliaries of their government) have not rushed in to do business with them. But some will also admit that the reforms they hate have not been totally in vain. Says the head of a fishing conglomerate on Sakhalin island: 'We're starting to tell our customers to pay for goods and it is working. Things will get better but it will take time.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gerd Brueggemann: "Strategies Against Poverty"] </F>   [Excerpts] Washington -- The United Nations estimates that  the number of refugees seeking security and new life  perspectives in other countries is approximately 100 million  worldwide, with trends pointing strongly upwards. The World  Bank has thus made this problem, along with issues of population  growth, the focus of its annual spring meeting, which ended in  Washington on Tuesday [26 April]. [passage omitted]    Federal Economic Cooperation Minister Carl-Dieter Spranger,  who represented the Federal Government in Washington, pointed  out that all measures suggested by the World Bank have to be  accompanied by programs for the promotion of economic  development because only then could one tackle the economic  reasons of population growth and migratory movements. [passage  omitted]    Spranger pleaded for close cooperation between  industrialized  and development countries with the objective to "contain  international refugee and migratory movements and make them  controllable." In regions with a large population, drain  projects must be supported financially that diminish the reasons  for exodus and migration in the countries of origin. Support  for the reintegration of people who return to their home country  is also of preeminent importance.    Apart from the population problem, much time was spent  discussing the situation of world trade after the conclusion of  the Uruguay Round. The World Bank expects the new GATT  agreement to lead to $200-300 billion in annual income growths  worldwide. With full implementation of the agreement, one-third  of that amount would go to the developing countries. However,  it is to be expected that not all countries will participate  equally. Minister Spranger stated that this is why he strongly  suggested that the World Bank and the IMF provide particular  support to those countries that benefit only marginally from the  GATT round.</p>

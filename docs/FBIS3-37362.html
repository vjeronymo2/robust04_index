			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS observer Tamara Zamyatina] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Feb -- "The difference in principle in  the Russian president's administration which is being reformed  lies in the new constitutional functions of the head of state  which must be guaranteed." This was how Sergey Filatov, the  Russian president's head of administration, explained the  meaning of the reorganization being conducted in the Kremlin's  corridors of power in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent.    Two parallel branches, as it were, remain in the apparatus  of  the head of state: the staff of assistants of the president,  headed by Viktor Ilyushin, and the administration proper, led by  Sergey Filatov. Asked whether the presence of two parallel  structures in the apparatus of the president is an unnecessary  duplication, Sergey Filatov replied that he sees no  contradiction in this because "all assistants of the president  work for the head of state, using the administration apparatus  for the fulfillment of their tasks." The number of assistants  of the president in various fields of activity will be increased.    The head of administration named among the new structures  the  economic analysis service, the finance and budget section, and  the international department. The head of state needs these  structures because "the president, in accordance with the new  constitution, no longer heads the government, but at the same  time needs to be well informed on the state of the economy, the  budget and tax policy," Sergey Filatov explained. However, the  formation of sections with functions of executive power under  the president is already arousing criticism to the effect that  the norm of the division of powers enshrined in the Russian  constitution are being violated. This collision could become an  occasion for reproach against the president, as was recently  declared, in particular, by State Duma Deputy Sergey Shakhray.    The administration staff will also include the new  Directorate of the Federal State Service. The Council for Cadre  Policies under the president, set up in spring last year, is  headed by three co-chairmen -- Sergey Filatov, Oleg Soskovets,  and Vladimir Shumeyko. Three commissions under this council  "will deal with the preliminary assessment of cadres": They are  the commissions for judicial cadres (headed by Minister of  Justice Yuriy Kalmykov), for foreign cadres, and for senior  military titles and posts. "Their task includes the accumulation  of a data bank on cadres and their professional training,"  Sergey Filatov pointed out.    The president's analytical service is being substantially  reformed. A Council of Experts is being set up in it which will  very likely be headed by Sergey Filatov, and there will also be  a Center of Special Presidential Programs and an analytical  service proper. The composition of the Presidential Council  will also be renewed and filled with new names.    The number of staff in the administration of the president  of  Russia is currently, according to its chief, 1,983 (but a full  strength of 2,000 is proposed).    The president will approve the final scheme of the  reorganization of his apparatus in the next few days, Sergey  Filatov reported.</p>

			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UN Cambodia chief's gloom dismays staff UNITED NATIONS staff in Cambodia were aghast yesterday when their chief attempted to ease fears about possible Khmer Rouge artillery attacks during next week's election by saying that the guerrillas often missed their targets or used ammunition which failed to explode. Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac), summoned staff at Untac headquarters in Phnom Penh and told them it was 'more than likely' that the Khmer Rouge would try to disrupt the election by mining roads leading to polling stations and harassing voters. 'There may even be some bombardments and rocket attacks aimed at some of the polling stations,' he said as the official campaign period drew to a close. 'In most cases they will miss the targets but we have to be prepared. . . We cannot afford too many more sacrifices among our colleagues.' Many UN officials expressed their dismay at Mr Akashi's remarks. In contrast to his previously optimistic assessments of the UN's Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) peacekeeping mission in Cambodia, he has gone out of his way this week to paint a gloomy picture of the election, possibly so that the reality will not seem so bad. Twelve Untac staff have been killed by landmines or gunmen. Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister of the Phnom Penh government - which has not been recognised internationally and is regarded by the UN as one of the four main Cambodian factions - yesterday sought to reassure his critics by insisting that his administration would hand over power if it lost the election. Asiawatch, the US-based human rights group, yesterday accused the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (Untac) of failing to deal effectively with human rights abuses and said it had thereby left the way open for further abuses in the future. 'Hundreds of serious abuses have been documented by Untac, but few have been publicly exposed or redressed,' Asiawatch said in a report. Untac's failure was serious because its mandate emphasised measures to assure human rights in view of Cambodia's tragic history, the report said. Abuses had been committed by all the main factions: the UN had continued to court the Khmer Rouge after the guerrillas had slaughtered Vietnamese and Cambodian civilians, and it had failed to dismiss or prosecute government officials who condoned the murder and intimidation of opponents. Asiawatch urged Untac to appoint an independent tribunal to ensure that suspects in Untac investigations were properly tried, and suggested the government to emerge from next week's election should give priority to creating an independent judiciary.

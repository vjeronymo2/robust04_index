			<p><P> March 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JIM MURRAY: HE EARNS A FISTFUL OF RESPECT  </P> <P> I have never been a fan of the prizefighter, Julio Cesar Chavez.  </P> <P> I am now.  </P> <P> I thought he was overrated. I thought he was too small, too slow, couldn't  punch hard enough, couldn't box oranges.  </P> <P> He really wasn't impressive. All he seemed to bring into the ring with him was  an infinite capacity to stand pain, absorb punishment and remain upright. In  the old days, they'd dub a fighter like this the Rubber Man and use him as a  trial horse, a kind of complicated punching bag for the real contenders.  </P> <P> How he won 68 fights with no defeats confounded me. All I could think of was  Leo Durocher's line about Eddie Stanky: "He can't run, he can't hit, he can't  field -- all he does is beat you."  </P> <P> My colleagues wrote that Chavez was, pound for pound, the best fighter in the  ring. I thought that was sacrilegious. Sugar Ray Robinson was the  pound-for-pound fighter. They invented the term for him. He could do everything  Chavez couldn't -- punch, box, move. He only got hit every other eclipse of the  moon.  </P> <P> Julio Cesar Chavez fought like a guy on snowshoes. He made his fight like an  oncoming train. Nothing nifty about it.  </P> <P> Sometimes, you find out more about a man in a fight he loses. I found out about  Julio Cesar Chavez in a fight he lost in Las Vegas the other night.  </P> <P> Oh, I know the record books will say Julio Cesar won that fight but, take my  word for it, he didn't.  </P> <P> He took a right proper licking for 11 1/2 rounds. At least I thought he did. So  did two of the ringside judges. A guy who was not so sure was referee Richard  Steele. Well, he was closer to the action than any of us.  </P> <P> Perhaps you saw it, perhaps only read about it, but Julio fought a pretty  nifty, speedy Philadelphian, the ex-Olympic gold medal winner Meldrick Taylor.  Now, Taylor was not 68-0 but he was 24-0-1, which is the next best thing. He  had one draw to mar his record.  </P> <P> He gave Chavez a pretty good going over most of the fight at the Hilton in Las  Vegas. He repeatedly got off first and winged three punches to Julio's one. He  dug lefts in Julio's body that seemed to lift him two feet in the air.  </P> <P> In a way, he made only one mistake in the whole fight: He got up. That is to  say, he got up at the count of five when he got knocked down at the end of the  12th round.  </P> <P> When he got up, the referee stopped the contest. There were two seconds -- 2  seconds! -- left in the fight. It was the most astonishing hook in the history  of the fight game. More than 9,000 jaws dropped in the arena, and on cable  television, millions couldn't believe their eyes.  </P> <P> It is possible there were not 10 seconds to go in the fight when he got knocked  down. The red light was blinking in the corner over his head, signaling that.  If the count had gone to nine, he could have been saved by the bell and won the  fight. Under modern rules, the only round in which you can be saved by the bell  is the last.  </P> <P> You didn't know whether to laugh or get mad. At first, it looked as if good old  pugilistic gamesmanship was at work here. Bear in mind that Chavez is a Don  King fighter and that King still wields considerable influence over the conduct  of the sport.  </P> <P> What was Steele stopping this contest for? Well, he explained, not altogether  convincingly, that he was able to see when Meldrick got up, that the fighter  was badly hurt.  </P> <P> Indubitably. But then Steele said he didn't want Meldrick to absorb any further  punishment.  </P> <P> From whom? From his corner men? They were going to slap him around with wet  towels, were they?  </P> <P> There were only two seconds left in the fight. I told you, Julio Cesar is slow.  He couldn't get across the ring in two seconds, let alone start to land  punches.  </P> <P> By the time Steele would have wiped off Taylor's gloves, the final bell would  have rung.  </P> <P> Now, I yield to no man in my belief that you cannot stop a one-sided fight too  soon. But I must admit you can stop one too late.  </P> <P> But, having said that, and before you call your congressman, let's examine the  performance of Julio Cesar in that fight. Let us render to Cesar the things  that are Cesar's.  </P> <P> I am not sure he deserved to lose it.  </P> <P> It is the notion here that the point system is not always felicitous in judging  the outcome of a fight. Fights used to be to the finish and, although that  seems barbaric, there are times when you should take into account the relative  condition of the fighters at the finish.  </P> <P> I will tell you why: There are certain fighters who more or less concede the  first few rounds of a championship fight to their opponents. They are  exploring, not fighting, probing for weaknesses. If early rounds counted, in  war, Germany and Japan would have been the winners of World War II. Let's put  it this way: They had a great first half. But you don't score a football game  by quarters or a baseball game by innings.  </P> <P> Julio Cesar Chavez strikes me as being that kind of a fighter who would  discount the early rounds. He is like a plumber trying to find out where the  leak is. When he finds it, he goes to work on it.  </P> <P> There was the interesting discovery at the fight Saturday night that, as the  rounds wore on, you began to notice a peculiar thing: Taylor was doing all the  landing -- but Taylor was doing all the bleeding, too.  </P> <P> Chavez's punches might not look all that impressive, but their results are.  Taylor was swollen in both eyes and bleeding from the nose and mouth as the  bout wore on. Even if he had won, it could not have done him a great deal of  good. He looked like a guy who had just been run over by a truck.  </P> <P> Chavez is a study in indomitability. His heart, pound for pound, is the biggest  in the game today. He didn't win the fight by the Marquess of Queensberry  rules. But Richard Steele might have served a kind of poetic justice at that.  </P> <P> Julio Cesar Chavez not only didn't lose a fight, he gained a fan. I'm a fan  from now on.  </P></p>

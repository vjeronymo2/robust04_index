			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan counts the cost of cotton losses - Many growers are now thinking of planting alternative crops An uneasy quiet prevails around the village 'Chak 38' outside Faisalabad - the centre of agricultural research and planning in the Punjab province, which is the source of much of Pakistan's foodgrain and cotton. A small group of peasants have gathered outside the half-built house of Mr Bashir Ahmed, a local landowner. The mood is sombre, almost funereal. On the outskirts of the village, other peasants look, with a sense of immense frustration, at the bare 21-acre holding that should have yielded Mr Ahmed a valuable cotton crop. Their crops have also been devastated by this year's widespread pest attacks and many are now thinking of planting alternative crops. But if they do so it will be with heavy hearts. Meanwhile Mr Ahmed is still counting his losses. The destruction was so bad that he decided to plough his land rather than first taking the pick from his cotton plants. The labour costs would have been more than the value of the crop that remained after the pest attack. The tragedy is not confined to the cotton growers themselves. It has turned into a national setback for a country that was hoping partly to pay for its economic needs out of a bumper crop this year. Almost 60 per cent of Pakistan's export earnings come directly or indirectly from cotton. The government now estimates that at least 15 per cent of the 12m bales of cotton it was expecting has been lost. That projection subject to the uncertainty caused by local newspaper reports, some of which have estimated a loss of over 25 per cent. In the absence of reliable monitoring systems, no one can be exact, but there is no doubt that the losses have been substantial. 'We will not be able to achieve our targets and we may stay in the range of 10m bales,' says Mr Ahmed Mukhtar, the Minister of State for Commerce. 'This definitely would be detrimental to our economy because the surplus of 2m bales would have added to our meagre foreign exchange reserves.' Human error is being cited as one reason for the setback. 'Where the damage has been caused, it is because there was no virus here before and farmers did not take adequate precautions,' says Mr Waheed Sultan Khan, director of the government's highly respected Cotton Research Institute in Faisalabad. According to Mr Khan, the worst hit areas were those with no record of similar attacks in recent years. That created a sense of complacency among the peasants and pesticides, which could have provided a useful safeguard, were not used. The farmers did not realise the importance of doing so and instead chose to save on input costs. Cotton researchers are also looking into other factors that may have contributed to the severity of the damage. Scientists at the CRI are trying to establish a link between higher night-time temperatures - on average 3'C to 4'C higher than in previous years - and its impact on the final yield. They hope to develop new varieties more tolerant to such environmental changes. Meanwhile, back in the fields farmers like Mr Ahmed remain depressed. 'I shall never sow cotton again although I have done it for 6 years so far,' he declares. 'For us, there's no cotton, he says, waving his hand towards his fellow farmers. His prophecy of doom for cotton reflects the attitude of many other farmers, who are afraid that it has become a very high risk crop. Despite such fears, however, it is not yet clear how badly Pakistan's cotton production will suffer in the after-shock of this year's experience. More and more farmers are show reluctance to face the risks of cotton growing, but officials such as Mr Khan are confident that the profit motive will ensure that most will soldier on. He estimates that spending Rs1 (2.1p) on inputs for cotton can earn a farmer Rs43.50, a much better return than those offered by other crops like wheat or rice. Some officials are confident that Pakistan's success in raising its cotton output in the past will prove to be the crucial driving force behind future efforts to raise production. During the past four decades the countries cotton production has risen by a factor of ten with the adoption of newly developed high yielding varieties and improved husbandry techniques. Back in the fields, however, many peasants find that track record of rapid progress little consolation after this year's heart-breaking experience.</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / UK Company News: BMA strengthens SAS link British Midland Airways, the second largest UK carrier, is strengthening its relationship with Scandinavian Airlines Systems by taking over a number of SAS routes from the UK to Scandinavia as well as eight SAS Boeing 737-500 aircraft. Sir Michael Bishop, BMA's chairman, also confirmed yesterday that SAS would take up its option to acquire next July a further 5 per cent stake in Airlines of Britain Holdings, BMA's parent company. This would increase SAS's overall stake in the UK airline group to 40 per cent. Although SAS is currently reviewing its entire strategy following the collapse this week of the proposed Alcazar merger between SAS, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Swissair and Austrian Airlines, Sir Michael said the Scandinavian carrier was planning next April to look at how to develop its relationship with BMA. But the two airlines had already agreed on two projects to reinforce their co-operation, including agreement for BMA to take over SAS's Glasgow-Copenhagen and London Heathrow-Bergen services as well as the eight Boeing aircraft from the Scandinavian carrier. The new aircraft are part of a sizeable fleet renewal and expansion programme by BMA involving 17 jets worth Pounds 275m over the next four years. Apart from the new 737s, BMA will be the launch customer for the new Fokker 70 aircraft; it has also ordered the larger Fokker 100 aircraft. Sir Michael said BMA expected to report higher pre-tax profits this year than the Pounds 835,000 of last year. Although profits were still not at a satisfactory level, Sir Michael said the airline had continued to make money during the last three years of the worst post-war recession in the business. Turnover was expected to total about Pounds 350m this year while turnover for the entire Airlines of Britain group, including Manx Air and Loganair, would total about Pounds 450m. Reflecting the airline's steady international expansion, Sir Michael said European services would account for about 55 per cent of turnover this year compared with only 20 per cent five years ago. While SAS was now likely to enter of phase of retrenchment, BMA was continuing to expand. He stressed, however, that he considered SAS as a long term partner. 'We felt SAS was the best partner for us and the relationship has been outstandingly good. I am now 51 and I expect the partnership will continue for the rest of my working life'.</p>

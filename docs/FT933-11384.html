			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Money Markets: UK rate cut hopes THERE was strong speculation in sterling interest rate markets yesterday that the UK authorities would cut base rates in the next few weeks, writes Stephanie Flanders. The speculation was partly fuelled by a belief that a cut in Germany's discount rate this week would help the UK to ease monetary policy again. A report from the Confederation of British Industry on Tuesday that UK exports could have been hit by the higher sterling exchange rate in recent months also added to speculation that the UK would want to try to bring down the value of the pound. 'Most of the shift in expectations seems to have come directly from Tuesday evening's news reports,' said one observer. 'Rates had got stuck at a level which implied that cutting rates was a fairly free option, and now the market has begun to concentrate harder on precisely when it will occur.' Caught up most with the new mood was trading in sterling futures. The September contract gained a full 18 basis points, closing at around 94.36, while the December contract was similarly affected, ending 17 basis points higher at 94.58. However, some dealers felt that an early cut in base rates was hard to envisage. 'If anything, the futures market has over-reacted,' said a London analyst. 'Every piece of paper says that there will be a cut in rates around budget time, not at the end of this week, but clearly a lot will depend on events in Europe.' At the short end, there was a lingering Pounds 2.25bn shortage, dispatched by discount market operations throughout the day and a small amount of late assistance from the Bank of England. Observers said the delay could be traced to the 'wait and see' attitude of a number of players, pondering the new thinking on UK interest rates. Overnight rates peaked at 7 3/4 per cent, but later closed at around 6 per cent. In Paris, developments in the French markets reflected the belief that a German interest rate reduction at today's central bank council meeting, combined with a significant domestic fiscal stimulus, might allow the French franc to retain its parity for the rest of the summer. Three-month French money market rates fell to around 8.25 per cent, down 100 basis points on the day. Trading in French franc futures was also affected, with the September Pibor contract closing at 92.78, down two basis points from the previous day, and the December contract ending 5 basis points lower at 94.03.</p>

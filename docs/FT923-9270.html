			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Gould defiant on Maastricht ratification MR BRYAN GOULD, the defeated challenger for the Labour leadership, has given a clear signal that the party may face formidable internal dissent over ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Yesterday he confirmed that he would oppose the accord in the shadow cabinet. As a senior member of Mr John Smith's frontbench team, this will make him a rallying point for Labour's Eurosceptics and the growing number of pro-Europeans who argue that the party should not squander an opportunity to defeat the government. Mr Smith wants Labour to oppose a guillotine motion that would cut short debate on the treaty when the Maastricht bill returns to the Commons in the coming session. But as a lifelong pro-European he is against outright opposition to the treaty. He is determined that Labour must not be seen to block closer EC union for the short-term tactical gain of a government defeat. A measure of Mr Smith's difficulty is that earlier this year more than 50 backbench Labour MPs defied party managers and opposed a second reading of the Maastricht bill. Mr Gould argues that one consequence of the Danish referendum which rejected the Maastricht terms is that Labour is free to adjust its pre-election stance that grudgingly endorsed the treaty. During his leadership campaign Mr Gould argued that the treaty did not do enough to enforce greater democratic accountability in EC institutions and that its criteria for economic convergence - required to complete economic and monetary union - failed to address the need for growth and full employment. This week Mr Gould hinted that Labour's recent calls for 'co-ordinated action' across Europe to reduce interest rates appeared to be 'shorthand or code' endorsing a general devaluation against the D-Mark. With the leadership's position not finalised, Mr Gould has made clear that he does not feel bound by collective responsibility. 'It would be disastrous to go into self-imposed purdah,' he said, adding that he thought it highly unlikely that he would be unable to accept the final position adopted by the shadow cabinet.</p>

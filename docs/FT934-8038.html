			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / International Company News: Repsol rises 27% to Pta112.6bn REPSOL, the Spanish energy and chemicals group, yesterday reported a 27.5 per cent rise in operating profits to Pta112.6bn (Dollars 834m) for the first nine months of 1993. Net income in the third quarter improved 8.2 per cent to Pta59.7bn. The chemical division finally returned to profit in the third quarter, although its results over the nine months show a loss of Pta3.7bn. The gas side, which now owns 45 per cent of the national domestic gas distributor, raised its third-quarter profits by 63 per cent to Pta27bn following higher volume and reflecting Repsol's increased equity in the distribution company. Repsol has invested Pta138bn so far this year - Pta70bn on building petrol stations and on refining activities. A further Pta40bn has been allocated to gas distribution and to finance the increased shareholding in Gas Natural. Repsol is finalising the purchase of Enagas, Spain's monopoly industrial gas supplier. The deal will create one of Europe's biggest natural gas companies.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / International Company News: AT&amp;T to cut workforce in long-distance business American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications group, yesterday confirmed it needed to cut jobs in its consumer long-distance business, where it faces strong competition from rivals such as MCI Communications. In a separate move, the company said it had signed a licencing agreement with All China Marketing Research, a subsidiary of the Chinese government's statistical bureau, to commercialise and market worldwide a database containing information on more than 400,000 Chinese companies. Responding to reports that it could be planning to cut several thousand jobs in its consumer long-distance business, AT&amp;T acknowledged it needed to reduce costs significantly. It said it would take every initiative to do so before resorting to job cuts but believed some reduction in employment would be necessary. It expected that a significant portion would come through attrition, voluntary separation and retraining. AT&amp;T's consumer business, which employs some 32,000 people, is still the largest in the US, accounting for some 60 per cent of long-distance telephone calls. It has, however, been losing market share to smaller rivals, notably MCI, whose innovative marketing programmes have led to a growth rate of around 15 per cent a year, three times the industry average. Mr Joseph Nacchio, who took over as head of the consumer business three months ago, has a reputation as a cost cutter, and has promised to make AT&amp;T a much more effective marketer of services. The deal with China follows AT&amp;T's signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Republic last February to explore business opportunities. Eastgate Services, an information consulting arm of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, will publish an English language directory of the industrial database and licence it to third parties internationally.</p>

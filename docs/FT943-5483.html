			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / International Company News: Healthy recovery at Belgian retailer Delhaize 'Le Lion', the big Belgian retail group, posted a BFr1.7bn (Dollars 52.4m) profit in the first half of this year, a 73 per cent rise on the same period of 1993. Turnover rose 10 per cent to BFr179.6bn. The half-year result compares with earnings for the whole of 1993 of BFr1bn, against a BFr6.3bn profit in 1992. The group said it expected a significant improvement for the whole of this year. The Belgian supermarkets and stores saw sales rise 5.4 per cent to BFr47.8bn from BFr45.3bn. However, profits are only just begining to recover from recession, sharp discounting in food prices, restructuring costs and industrial disputes. Delhaize's main interest abroad, the Food Lion supermarket chain in he US, turned in a 6.4 per cent increase in sales, to Dollars 3.6bn, for the first half, with profits of Dollars 66m. This rise, of 25 per cent, is particularly satisfying to the Belgian group after a tough six months in which it weathered bad publicity in the US over alleged hygiene shortfalls, fierce competition, and a dispute with the US Department of Labor over overtime work and safety conditions for employees. Sales and profits also showed modest increases at the Belgian group's stores in Greece, the Czech Republic, and at the northern French PG Group in which it acquired a 74 per cent stake last May.</p>

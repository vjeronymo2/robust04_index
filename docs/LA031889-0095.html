			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Swissair to Start L.A. Service: Swissair announced that it will begin scheduled  flights between Los Angeles and Switzerland on Nov. 1, starting with nonstops  to Zurich on Mondays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. Daily service is envisioned by  1991. Meanwhile, Swissair and Delta Air Lines announced a "partnership" between  the two airlines and said they would coordinate flight schedules to offer  passengers fast connections on routes to and from North America. They also plan  to share reservation systems and airport facilities and to advertise their  services jointly. But "we are not looking for a merger of our companies,"  Swissair's Chairman Armin Baltensweiler said.  </P></p>

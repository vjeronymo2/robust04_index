			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BERKOFF'S 'RAMBO' AFTERLIFE: A DOCU-PLAY;  </P> <P> STAGE: THE PLAYWRIGHT-ACTOR-DIRECTOR'S 'ACAPULCO' IS BASED ON HIS EXPERIENCES  FILMING 'RAMBO II.' IT OPENS TODAY AT THE ODYSSEY.  </P> <P> Walking through the airy lobby of the Odyssey Theatre, Steven Berkoff looks  like he is ready for a fight. Short-statured and athletic, wearing garish  warm-up pants popular with bodybuilders and a sleeveless black jacket, Berkoff  suggests an urban warrior looking for turf violators.  </P> <P> Yet as he lopes toward the theater space where his new play, "Acapulco," opens  today, the British writer-director-actor is softly solicitous of a friend who  has just finished watching a rehearsal. He asks him, with a tinge of  self-doubt, about the work. The friend thinks Berkoff's staging of the play,  set at an Acapulco bar and involving actors on location for "Rambo II," is  going nicely.  </P> <P> "I always have doubts whether or not I can pull off a show," he says, "because  I don't work out a linear concept like other directors. As I go along, I  develop the mise en scene, which is as important for me as the play. Whatever  results, it won't be like any play anyone has ever seen before."  </P> <P> If theater is a battle with long odds, short engagements and small budgets,  Berkoff has been a feisty, sublime combatant. Critic Jack Kroll has called him  "a one-man avant-garde." He is known as a writer of fluid, brilliant and fiery  wordflows erupting lava-like out of his characters' mouths. He also has a  reputation as a director who can lend those words extreme and precise  physicality. And as an actor he has been cited for his unpredictable effects  and demonic force.  </P> <P> All of which sets him apart from other stage artists in Britain. And in  America, for that matter, where he has been going through a strange, triple  existence.  </P> <P> He considers the Los Angeles stage his American base. With good reason. "Greek"  at the Matrix in 1982 was universally acclaimed. He subsequently put his own  stamp on Kafka's "Metamorphosis" at the Mark Taper Forum, Aeschylus'  "Agamemnon" during the Olympic Arts Festival and "Decadence" at the old Pilot  Theatre.  </P> <P> "Kvetch's" engagement at the Odyssey is four years and counting. This year,  "East" came to -- where else? -- the Odyssey (Berkoff calls it "my lab"),  directed by longtime collaborator Barry Phillips.  </P> <P> By contrast, his New York adventures have been more precipitous: applause for  his 1988 New York Shakespeare Festival version of "Coriolanus" and a  "Metamorphosis" with Mikhail Baryshnikov, boos from New York critics for  "Greek" and "Kvetch."  </P> <P> Last, and least in Berkoff's mind, is his Hollywood work, which he has used for  his own ends in "Acapulco." Remember the Soviet sadist who hot-wired Sylvester  Stallone in "Rambo II"? Or Eddie Murphy's art dealer nemesis in "Beverly Hills  Cop"? Or the operatic portrayal of Hitler in "War and Remembrance"? All of them  were Berkoff as nasty as he wants to be -- or as much as movies and TV will let  him be.  </P> <P> "The movies are very useful, for they're my subsidies. Instead of getting money  from an arts council, the film company says, 'Here's some money. Do a little  bit and you can sit in your trailer and write your heart out.' " He wrote  "Kvetch," for example, in his "Beverly Hills Cop" trailer.  </P> <P> Berkoff calls "Acapulco" a chronicle, part-diary, part-reportage, of a time and  place. It represents a new turn for a writer who has specialized in plays  without sets or fixed locales, in which characters purge their souls through  language.  </P> <P> "Whereas 'Kvetch' is more an interior investigation of myself," he explains, "  'Acapulco' was written as if it were a painted study of people's moods and  spirits. This is the first time I've based a play upon a living experience."  </P> <P> Berkoff, portraying the Soviet lieutenant in "Rambo II," went on location on  Mexico's tropical Pacific coast near Acapulco as a stand-in for Vietnam. Most  of the cast stayed at the Acapulco Plaza Hotel, and communed at the hotel bar  after a day's shooting.  </P> <P> "I felt like a creature from another planet. In the bar area, all these people  talked about nothing but discos and food and the day's work and sex. Everything  was based on primal, basic needs and emotions. I found them fascinating,  charming, and I was envying their sensual needs and greeds, even though I'm  more interested in concepts, in seeing Montezuma's tomb in Mexico City. . . ."  </P> <P> Explains this native of London's tough East End: "I tend to relate more to  underdogs, not the stars . . . . I could have hung out with Stallone and the  guys at his house watching tapes of Laker games, but I didn't. It was more  interesting to hear how these 'ordinary folk,' with their peers, were able to  fully express themselves."  </P> <P> Mentally recording the conversation, Berkoff would rush back to his hotel room  and jot it down. As a play took shape, an outsider character emerged -- Berkoff  himself: "Because I couldn't romanticize my own dialogue, I lifted passages  from the journal I kept during my stay. Like all the dialogue in the play,  nothing is invented."  </P> <P> This journal has also appeared in England as a book, "Steven Berkoff's  America," but it's not the only preview of "Acapulco" in print. The play was  published by Grove Press (with "Kvetch") in 1987, when the Odyssey and Berkoff  first tried to produce it. Each year since, "Acapulco" was announced, then  canceled.  </P> <P> "It's always been a long time between the writing and putting them on the  stage. I wrote 'West' in 1979, but didn't stage it until 1983. With 'Acapulco,'  it was always scheduling conflicts." The strange effect of reading a play long  before its world premiere is made stranger, since, with Berkoff's textual  changes, the play in print won't always resemble the play on stage.  </P> <P> Despite "Acapulco's" attempt at what Berkoff calls "documentary theater," he  hasn't left behind his turbulent past work. "Fifteen years ago, I wrote a  short-story collection about sexuality called 'Gross Intrusions.' It hits on  the extremes of sex, coming from an impulse to write whatever came to me. It  will be reprinted, though I had wondered if it should be.  </P> <P> "But I realized that it should, since writing and sex have always been linked  for me -- sex as a metaphor of rebellion. To describe the indescribable, the  stuff you couldn't tell your best friend or loved one, but could to strangers  in the theater: that was my mandate as a writer."  </P></p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Observer: Stern stuff When it comes to tackling the challenge at IBM, there is one man who'll be sure the right candidate for the job is Northern Telecom's just departed chief executive, Paul Stern. That man is Paul Stern. Having stepped down from the Canadian telecommunications group at 54, he is still young enough to oversee the protracted turnround Big Blue may need. He is also an American, with computer industry experience as the first president of Unisys. What's more, his success in broadening Northern's horizons is undeniable. On the other hand - as witness his red Ferrari and the title of his book about his career, Straight to the Top - he is self-assured to a fault. Indeed, some of Northern's big customers as well as fellow-directors there are far from sorry to see him go.</p>

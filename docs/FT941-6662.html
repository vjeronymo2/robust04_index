			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Howard backs 'volunteer power' Mr Michael Howard, home secretary, last night said government should act as a catalyst to unleash 'volunteer power'. Giving the St Stephen's Club Disraeli Lecture in London he said ministers should try to tap the efforts of business and individuals before giving projects to the public sector alone. Today Mr Howard will announce proposals to increase voluntary activity.</p>

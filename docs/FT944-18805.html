			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Part-timers given hope over pensions  -A look at this week's European Court ruling This week, the European Court of Justice told employers how they should equalise pensions for men and women. In doing so, it raised the hopes of thousands of part-time women workers who may now be able to join their company schemes and back-date their pension claims for up to 20 years. The court also made clear, however, that women members are powerless to prevent their employers from raising the age at which they can claim a full pension from 60 to the male pension age, 65. This means that women may have to work and pay pension contributions for an extra five years. Wednesday's announcement by the court also will affect those with present and future pension rights in a scheme that is due to be wound up because the employer has gone bust. These people should now receive their benefits after a wait of up to four years (see other stories on this page). What is unequal about pensions? Under most scheme rules women could, until recently, claim a full pension at age-60. This meant that the value of a year's pensionable service for women was higher than for men. What does the law say? The concept of equal pensions for men and women in equal employment is enshrined in European Union law. Under the Treaty of Rome (1957), on which the modern EU is founded, employers may not discriminate between men and women in pay and benefits. Until 1990, though, employers thought pay did not include pensions. On May 17 1990, in a case known as Barber v GRE, the court ruled that pensions were part of pay and must be equal. A later case said that equal pensions could not be backdated pre-Barber. How did employers react to the Barber case? Quickly and ingeniously. To avoid the cost of paying men full pensions from age-60, most employers raised the female pension age by five years. Isn't this unfair? Many women thought so, as did the Equal Opportunities Commission which backed a case brought by five women who worked for Avdel systems, a Hertfordshire engineering company. In Wednesday's ruling on Avdel, the court said employers did have the right to raise the female pension age. But, in another ruling, the court said that the trustees of the pension schemes of Coloroll, a UK wallpaper and home furnishings group that collapsed in 1990, must apply equal pensions in the absence of the employer. This means that men in the Coloroll schemes can now claim the higher female rate for each year of pensionable service in the period between May 1990 and the date the company collapsed. What about part-timers? The court said that barring part-timers from a company scheme - where most of these employees are women - would be discriminatory. Moreover, it ruled that this issue had nothing to do with the Barber case but was confirmed by another case in 1976. Therefore, women could back-date their claim almost 20 years. Andrew Powell of legal firm Hammond Suddard, which specialises in pensions, suggests this action plan for scheme members: Check if the majority of part-timers excluded from the scheme are women. Work in a group rather than as individuals and, where possible, ask a trade union to co-ordinate any claim - which might also apply to women who have left employment or the dependants of any who died while in part-time employment. Check the cost involved in back-dating a claim. The court said that employees as well as employers must make back payments - can you afford this? Are the benefits worth it? Most schemes do not pay pension for the first tier of earnings - typically, Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 4,500 but sometimes more. Ask the pensions manager and/or trustees for the objective reasons on which they rely for their exclusion policy. If the reasons are unsatisfactory, seek help - you could be entitled to legal aid (see 'Who can help' in column seven).</p>

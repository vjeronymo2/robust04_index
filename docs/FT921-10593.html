			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / More debt centre cash urged from societies BUILDING societies were asked yesterday by Mr Edward Leigh, consumer affairs minister, to provide more cash for money advice centres to help people with debt difficulties. Mr Leigh met six of the largest societies on Monday together with representatives of the Money Advice Trust in an attempt to improve co-operation between societies and the trust, which was set up to raise money for debt counselling. Building societies have been criticised for being less generous in contributing to money advice centres than banks and other lenders, even though many building society customers have suffered severely with debts. The largest donation to the trust by a building society has come from Nationwide, the second-biggest society. It announced last week that it was giving Pounds 345,000 to fund a money advice support unit in London. Mr Leigh said yesterday that although obtaining money advice funding from societies had been slower than expected, he was hopeful about progress.</p>

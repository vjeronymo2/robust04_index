			<p><P> March 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE TICKET WITH 8 WINNERS PAYS $494,252 IN PICK NINE  </P> <P> A single Pick Nine ticket at Santa Anita Friday had eight of the day's nine  winning horses on it, and that ticket was worth $494,252.40.  </P> <P> There was a mandatory payout in the Pick Nine, after the carryover pool reached  $525,915 at the end of Thursday's program.  </P> <P> Under Pick Nine rules, the payout is made on the day after the carryover  exceeds $500,000.  </P> <P> Friday's crowd of 27,972, including 20,260 at the track, wagered another  $538,240 for a chance at a big payoff. A single ticket with all nine winning  horses would have been worth nearly $1 million.  </P> <P> With no perfect tickets, there was a three-tiered payoff. In addition to the  single winner with eight correct picks, 36 tickets with seven were worth  $2,941.80 each, and 563 with six returned $188 apiece.  </P></p>

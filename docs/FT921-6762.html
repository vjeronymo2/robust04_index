			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Struggle for control of Soviet debt bank: Republics seek to break Russia's grip on Moscow-based Vnesheconombank THIRTEEN former Soviet republics yesterday signed a communique demanding that Vnesheconombank, the Moscow-based conduit for the repayment of hard currency debt, be removed from Russian jurisdiction. Russia, however, was pointedly absent from the meeting of prime ministers and their deputies representing all other former Soviet republics, including the Baltics. The proposal - another foray in the economic battle between Ukraine and Russia - would place Vnesheconombank under the control of a new inter-state council in which all former Soviet republics, including the Baltics but not Georgia, would have one vote. Vnesheconombank is now governed by an inter-state council in which Russia has 61 per cent of the vote. The idea is to be discussed at the Commonwealth of Independent States meeting on March 20. A report by Salomon Brothers, the New York-based merchant bankers, warned yesterday that western commercial banks faced the 'almost certain prospect' of a moratorium on principal debt repayments by the former Soviet republics throughout this year. This was because the republics were more preoccupied with their own domestic problems and were suspicious of Russia's role in negotiating the debt. Ukraine's said after yesterday's meeting in Kiev that were control of Vnesheconombank to change it might be willing to accept collective responsibility with the other republics for former Soviet debt. European Community external affairs commissioner Frans Andriessen, in Kiev yesterday, underlined the pressure on Ukraine by insisting that the EC's promised Dollars 150m line of credit to Ukraine would remain frozen until Ukraine assumed 'joint and several' responsibility for the debt. Under the terms of an inter-republican agreement signed last December, western official creditors agreed to a temporary moratorium on medium and long-term official debt. This was followed by a temporary moratorium on payment of principal to commercial banks. A moratorium on official credits was extended to the end of 1992. This agreement, which committed each republic towards contributing a share of the convertible currency needed to make debt-service payments, was a precondition for assent by official creditors to an extension of the principal moratorium for all of this year. Salomon Brothers say that the agreement is almost impossible to implement, because: 'there is no way to ensure that each republic will contribute to the debt-service pool, even if they had access to convertible currency income'; 'all the republics, particularly Ukraine, are suspicious of the (banking and financial) apparatus that appears to be under the control of the Russian republic'; 'although the G7 (group of industrialised countries) warned the constituent republics that their specific creditworthiness would be harmed if the debt is not fully serviced, it is doubtful if the political elite in many republics are overly concerned with international creditworthiness at a time when popular discontent with food prices and shortages is the major concern'.</p>

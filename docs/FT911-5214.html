			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Reconstruction bank to start borrowing 'this summer' THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development expects to start borrowing on the world's capital markets this summer, according to Mr Anders Ljungh, the EBRD's vice president for finance. He told a group of bankers and journalists attending the EBRD inauguration that the bank would also start accumulating liquid reserves around the same time, which it would place with banks and in first class securities. In this way, the London-based bank, which is being set up to help eastern European nations develop market economies, will become an active participant in financial markets. Mr Ljungh said the bank would need to borrow because only 30 per cent of its Ecu10bn (Pounds 6.9bn) capital would be paid in, and that over a five-year period. But it would start borrowing before it actually needed the funds for its lending operations. In this way it would build up its reserves. He said that the EBRD would have to show that it was likely to make a profit 'fairly soon' to obtain and keep a high credit rating. It was currently in discussions with rating agencies with the aim of winning 'triple A' status. It would be 'natural' for the bank to borrow first in ecus, Mr Ljungh said. But the bank would be flexible and he did not exclude raising funds in other monies and swapping them to provide the convertible currencies that the EBRD's borrowers would want.</p>

			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Ministry to make checks on lettuces The Ministry of Agriculture will take random samples of lettuces this winter to monitor the use of fungicides. The move follows a report by a government working party which showed that 26 per cent of lettuces surveyed last year contained unacceptable pesticide residues, an increase from 17 per cent the previous season. The Department of Health has said the residues pose no risk to human health.</p>

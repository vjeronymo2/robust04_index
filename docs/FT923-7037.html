			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London COCOA prices showed no inclination to come down from the day's peaks, closing up to Pounds 17 a tonne higher. The market rallied on Tuesday on concern over growing conditions in west Africa, exacerbated by talk that one trade house was circulating bullish crop forecasts. COPPER prices were consolidating on the LME after the Dollars 90 rise of the past two days and at one stage three-month metal dipped back towards support around Dollars 2,540 a tonne. But renewed strength in Comex prompted mixed buying and short covering in London, which sent the price up to Dollars 2,560 by the close, up Dollars 4 from Tuesday. New York ORANGE JUICE prices were sharply down at midday as traders reacted to reports that Brazil had lowered its bulk price in line with Florida cash prices. Brazilian processors had been hesitant to cut prices until after the USDA Florida October crop assessment, said one analyst, but with estimates circulating for a sizeable Florida crop they had little choice. Nymex PLATINUM futures were higher by midday on talk of overnight Japanese buying. In Chicago SOYABEANS were lower in late trading after news suggesting a possible record crop in the eastern Midwest.

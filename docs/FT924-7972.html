			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Analysis: Breath of fresh air for Britain's building industry - Construction THE construction industry will have breathed a collective sigh of relief last night after the Chancellor delivered an Autumn Statement aimed at reviving one of the sectors worst hit by the recession. Contractors and building material companies said the outcome was better than they expected even though most are still expecting 1993 to be another difficult year. Initial judgments were that UK construction output would still fall next year but perhaps not by as much as the 2 per cent to 3 per cent decline which had been forecast. Much depends upon how quickly local authorities and industry can take advantage of concessions allowing councils to spend up to 100 per cent of capital receipts between now and the end of 1993, and provide 20 per cent capital allowances on new industrial and agricultural buildings. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is expected to announce measures today to ensure that local authorities release these receipts as quickly as possible. Much of this would be spent on housing repair and maintenance, one of the most labour intensive of construction activities. There was relief that public sector construction programmes for transport, housing and other public infrastructure have been maintained, even though some budgets for projects have been reduced to take advantage of lower construction costs in the recession. There will be particular pleasure at the signal that the Pounds 1.8bn Jubilee Line extension will go ahead as soon as agreement can be reached with bankers over financing. Of all the large transport projects the Jubilee Line is most advanced. Letters of intent awarding contracts are in place for much of the work, which could start almost immediately the geen light is given. The work will provide about 12,000 jobs. This compares with the 400,000 jobs the construction industry is estimated to have lost since summer 1989. There was some disappointment that more was not done to help the housing market. An interest rate cut of one percentage point would help but could have been deeper, was the view of builders which have seen sales and prices slump even further this autumn, following the recent turmoil in the currency markets. A decision to give housing associations a windfall Pounds 750m to buy 20,000 of the estimated 200,000 empty properties on the market was welcomed, but was not expected to find its way into the pocket of builders. Most of the money was likely to be used to buy homes repossessed by building societies and banks. The consensus was that the construction recovery may start with the Autumn Statement but that it would still be a hard and long haul back. More measures to stimulate housing, in particular, could still be needed.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Domestic Policies Reflected </F> in Kim Il-song's New Year's Address"]    [Text] Seoul, NAEWOE -- Kim Il-song's New Year's address  for 1994, while focusing on the economy, touches on military,  reunification, nuclear, and foreign policy issues. At a glance,  it appears to say nothing about domestic political issues,  except in passages devoted to a general assessment of the state  of the nation. While other parts of the address, including  those on the economy, are of course essentially linked with  developments on the domestic political front, one can hardly  find any specific references to them--at least as specific as  those made to other topics.    Nevertheless, inasmuch as North Korea has problems in each  and every domain addressed in the speech--economic, military,  the South and reunification, nuclear, and foreign policy--it is  inconceivable that the internal political sphere alone is  trouble-free.    The fact is that despite its alleged stability at home,  North  Korea failed to achieve its economic goals and, as a result, had  to allow a 3-year readjustment period. And the admission to the  failure of the Third Seven-Year Plan precisely alludes to  instability and chaos on the domestic political front.    The 1994 Kim Il-song New Year's address contains several  passages lending support to this observation.    The first such passage is: "The maneuvers waged by the  imperialists and reactionaries last year to isolate and  suffocate our Republic and crush our socialist cause were  unprecedentedly vicious, causing an extremely tense situation in  our country."    In fact, the so-called imperialists and reactionaries or  their maneuvers from outside to isolate North Korea and crush  its socialist cause, as alleged by Kim Il-song, did not exist.  Therefore, what he was speaking about was internal foes, the  alleged tension meaning an internal situation created by them.    Next is the passage dealing with Operation Team Spirit.  Under  the pretext of a "severe ordeal confronting the fatherland and  the revolution," North Korea declared a state of semi-war. By  doing so, Kim Il-song said, it "defended honorably the dignity  and safety of the socialist fatherland, demonstrating the  indomitable spirit of chuche Korea to the fullest."  <H5>  Pending Tasks Listed in the Address Suggest Problems </H5>   Since Team Spirit is an annual, defensive exercise and not a  military provocation against North Korea, it can by no means be  a "severe ordeal" that calls for the declaration of a state of  semi-war. Nonetheless, Kim Il-song asserted that North Korea  "crushed the enemies' provocations and maneuvers and honorably  defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland,  demonstrating the indomitable spirit of chuche Korea to the  fullest."    What he called "provocations and aggression" here did not,  in  fact, exist. Then, what was it that North Korea had to defend  "the dignity and safety of socialism" against? And what is the  truth of "the spirit of chuche Korea demonstrated to the  fullest" under such circumstances? In a nutshell, it is in  effect a confession that North Korea used the training exercise,  staged south of the truce line, to deal with its domestic  problems, the political chaos in particular.    To prove it, Kim Il-song stated that "this is a victory of  the revolutionary line of our party and a victory of the  wholehearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses."    At the same time, he explained the meaning of such victories  by saying that North Korea "again forcefully proved, through  severe ordeals and struggles in the recent period, that our  party is a great party with an iron will and a tested  leadership, that our people are a heroic people tested by  revolutionary ordeals and blessed with an indomitable spirit of  struggle, and that our way of socialism embodying the chuche  ideology is an invincible socialism deeply rooted in the masses  of people."    In other words, of these two remarks, the latter explains  the  backgrounds of organizational issues weighed at the 21st plenum  of the sixth party Central Committee held in December last year  and the sixth session of the Supreme People's Assembly, while  the former is gibberish aimed at justifying the results of and  measures taken in those sessions.    The ousting of Kim Tal-hyon and Kim Yong-sun, known as  leading technocrats of the North Korean regime, could be an act  of censuring them for the "severe ordeals" of the economic  crisis. And the reappearance of Kim Yong-chu and his appointment  as vice president; the promotion of Hwang Chang-yop, known as  chuche ideology theoretician, to chairmanship of the Foreign  Affairs Committee; the rise of Yang Hyong-sop--he and Hwang  Chang-yop are considered the twin masters of the chuche  ideology--to No. 18 from No. 32 in the power hierarchy, and the  fact that nine of the 17 new members and candidate members named  to the party Central Committee are military personnel on active  duty--all these measures represented moves to expand the power  base of the Kim Chong-il leadership.  <H5>  Team Spirit Used to Deal With Political Chaos </H5>   Therefore, the fact that the father-to-son succession is yet  to be finalized 20 years after Kim Chong-il was officially  designated the heir apparent, and that they still have work to  do to pave the way for the new leadership, is the whole meaning  of the political "severe ordeals"--as severe as the  self-acknowledged failure of the economic plans.    Such work is still needed, and the need, along with the  failure of the economic plans, constitute Pyongyang's current  political problems. Then, the rhetoric that North Korea  "defended the dignity and safety of the socialist fatherland,"  and the alleged "victory of the revolutionary line of the party"  and "great victory of the wholehearted unity of the leader, the  party and the masses" are all aimed at justifying the measures  taken at those sessions. It can be said Kim Il-song meant to say  that the measures primarily resolved the problems.    The assertion that North Korea, as a result, "again proved  that our way of socialism embodying the chuche ideology is an  invincible socialism deeply rooted in the masses of people"  stresses that Pyongyang will continue to implement similar  measures and, through them, carry on its present system. This  does not mean, however, that the domestic political confusion  was brought under control completely and the basic stability  regained.    Needless to say, what occurred was a rehash of the perennial  political disarray within the North Korean regime. This can be  seen in Kim Il-song's confession that "internally and  externally, our revolution remains in a complex, strained  situation, and we are building socialism amid a tense  confrontation with the enemies."    While external enemies in the "tense confrontation" could  mean the pressures on North Korea for its opening to the outside  world that have continued since the collapse of the former  Soviet Union and East European communist states, the "internal  enemies" means political troubles or elements causing domestic  tensions.    Furthermore, still included among the "external enemies" is  the South Korean government which North Korea views as the  target of a communist revolution and as a constant threat to its  system.  <H5>  Top Priority to Political Groundwork for Complete Succession </H5>   Therefore, when Kim Il-song stated that "internally and  externally, our revolution is in a complex and tense situation.  We are building socialism amid a tense confrontation with the  enemies," he was laying down a premise for 1994, and it was by  no means an accident.    He said: "...we must further strengthen the nation's  political, economic and military capabilities to meet the  demands of the present situation and of the developing  revolution." As seen here, he was apparently saying, openly,  that this year again North Korea will put greater emphasis on  the political groundwork to complete the leadership succession  than on the economy, and that if a military buildup should be  the way to do the job, the economy shall be annexed to it.    North Korea is, after all, not confronted with a threat or  possible threat of "war-provocative maneuvers of the enemies."  Nonetheless, Kim Il-song used such possibilities as a pretext to  stress that North Korea "must pay attention to strengthening its  defense capabilities." This explains his position as mentioned  above.    The father-to-son succession is being carried out through  the  military. Therefore, by the "war-provocative maneuvers of the  enemies" he could mean provocations not from outside but from  within the military, namely, reactions within the military  against the new leadership, or at least a possible challenge to  the military from within the political sphere. This cannot be  ruled out.    Kim Il-song emphasized that "we must be fully prepared  politically, ideologically, militarily, and materially against  any unforeseeable emergency, and thoroughly establish in the  whole society the spirit of attaching importance to military  affairs and giving positive support to the People's Army." This  could be a warning of such potential forces and possibilities,  issued to build the public support for the military in paving  the way to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership.  <H5>  Economic Policy as Pretense To Divert Attention of Outside </H5> World    Making his rhetoric more specific, Kim Il-song noted: "If we  are to push ahead forcefully with the revolution and  construction under the present circumstances, we must firmly  grasp the guideline of ideological revolution of our party and  further strengthen the wholehearted unity of the revolutionary  ranks, giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance." He emphasized: "When all the people unite in one  mind around the party and the leader, give full play to the  spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and fight on vigorously,  we can defend and preserve our way of socialism against any  difficulties, enhancing it endlessly, and we can attain the  chuche socialist cause victoriously." And he reiterated: "We  will defend--as the apple of our eye--the wholehearted unity of  our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm under the party  leadership, and we will further consolidate and develop it."    These points in the address are indicative of which way Kim  Il-song will likely take North Korea this year, politically.    Despite the present economic crisis, North Korea will  continue to focus on political programs to prop up the Kim  Chong-il leadership. It is trying to step up the mobilization of  people for labor to overcome economic difficulties in the name  of ideo-political unity, binding them into a united social force  for a drive to consolidate the new leadership. Such intent is  seen in the fact that since the beginning of this year,  Pyongyang has been urging the public to step up the "learn from  Kim Chong-il" movement while trumpeting the "historical  inevitability of the victory of socialism," and that it lately  has frequently used the expression "Kim Chong-il era."    Inasmuch as the consolidation of the Kim Chong-il leadership  continues to be its priority this year, North Korea will likely  pursue the labor mobilization program along this line as well.    The indication is in the address. Kim Il-song said that  "when  all the people unite in one mind around the party and the  leader, give full play to the revolutionary spirit of  self-reliance and fortitude and fight on vigorously, we can  defend and preserve our way of socialism against any  difficulties, enhancing it endlessly, and we can attain the  chuche socialist cause victoriously." Then, under that premise,  he noted that "we will defend--as the apple of our eye--the  wholehearted unity of our revolutionary ranks cemented rock-firm  under the party leadership, and will further consolidate and  develop it."    The phrases here such as "defend and preserve our way of  socialism" and "attain the chuche socialist cause victoriously"  do not mean a victory as a result of economic development. So,  when Kim Il-song said that "all the people unite in one mind  around the party and the leader," he was stressing the need for  ideo-political unity to consolidate the Kim Chong-il leadership.  And when he stressed that the "unity of our revolutionary ranks  cemented rock-firm under the party leadership" should be  defended "as the apple of our eye," and that it should be  further consolidated and developed, he was underscoring the goal  of that pursuit.    From this point of view, one can see that the contradictions  in the Kim Il-song address--as seen its laying emphasis on a  trade-first line on the one hand and urging a military buildup  on the other--and the denunciations of the South unveiling  Pyongyang's lack of interest in dialogue, have something to do  with the above-mentioned circumstances surrounding North Korea's  domestic political situation.    When one sees North Korea's trade-first line as a pretense  to  divert the attention of the outside world to its domestic  political situation, he will find how serious the situation is,  that it is so serious as to require such artifice. As for the  denunciations of the South, which in effect unveil the lack of  interest in North-South dialogue, they represent its shopworn  method fo covering up such grave realities.    North Korea, while focusing on domestic political programs  to  promote the Kim Chong-il leadership this year, will likely  continue to use foreign policy issues and North-South issues as  a bulwark to facilitate its push of such programs, effectively  combining them as strategic instruments.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHAMIR WILL TRY TO FORM GOVERNMENT AFTER PERES' FAILURE  </P> <P> Caretaker Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud Party,  was chosen Thursday to try to form a government after Labor Party leader Shimon  Peres failed to forge what he called a peace coalition.  </P> <P> A Shamir-led government could spell trouble for U.S. efforts to arrange a  Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.  </P> <P> Shamir has opposed the U.S. plan while Peres backs it.  </P> <P> Peres predicted that Shamir will also fail to form a government but contended  that if he succeeds, he will create "an extremist right-wing government the  like of which Israel never had."  </P> <P> Peres called President Chaim Herzog on Thursday and announced, as expected,  that he was unable to break a 60-60 standoff in Israel's 120-seat Knesset  (Parliament). Thursday was the deadline on an extension granted by Herzog.  Peres, 66, spent nearly six weeks trying to forge an alliance of ultra-Orthodox  religious parties and small, left-wing factions.  </P> <P> Herzog's office said he will give the job to Shamir, head of the caretaker  government that took over after Parliament voted to end the Labor-Likud  coalition.  </P> <P> If Shamir is unable to form a government, national elections may have to be  called.  </P></p>

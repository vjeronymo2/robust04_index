			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Apec and Europe Is it plausible that the mixed bag of countries represented at the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum will actually attain 'free and open trade . . . no later than 2020'? The answer must be no. Yet the fact that they have even made this commitment is intriguing. The question is what precisely has been decided. Apart from the broad commitment to liberalisation and the call for specific proposals to be advanced next year, there is only the agreement that industrialised countries should liberalise by 2010 and the rest by 2020. All else remains obscure. What, for example, is meant by free trade or by Apec's 'opposition to the creation of an inward-looking trading bloc that would divert from the pursuit of global free trade'? How can liberalisation be pursued within the region, while ensuring that the result is 'not only the actual reduction of barriers among Apec countries but also between Apec economies and non-Apec economies'? Any kind of discriminatory arrangement within so large a part of the world's economy would be undesirable. Why, for example, should Malaysia discriminate against Bangladesh in favour of the US? Yet non-discriminatory liberalisation within Apec would almost certainly be impossible, because of the concern about free-riders. The only escape from the dilemma would be global negotiations. But it would be unsatisfactory for such negotiations to be launched only after Apec had already decided its own position, since the rest of the world would then be presented with a 'take it or leave it' negotiating pos-ition. The right way for any global negotiation to proceed is globally. Ideally, therefore, Apec should be a catalyst for global negotiations and neither a substitute for such negotiations, nor an independent forum. The only outside entity capable of insisting upon this is the EU. But, first, it must commit itself to that notion and, more broadly, to engagement with the rising economies of East Asia. Before that, the EU has to ratify the Uruguay Round, something that should now be possible after yesterday's ruling by the Court of Justice on the powers of the Commission and the member states. If the EU is to be an effective negotiator, it will also have to develop a modus operandi for negotiations in areas of mixed competence. If nothing else, the outcome of the Apec summit should encourage it to do this swiftly. Otherwise it may find itself ignored, because it will be judged too intractable a negotiating partner. The promising aspect of Apec is the momentum it should impart to global liberalisation. How that momentum will, and should, be guided is, however, obscure. The essential prior step is ratification of the Uruguay Round. Then the priority must be further global progress. It is up to the EU, as the major player outside Apec, to give voice to that wider interest.</p>

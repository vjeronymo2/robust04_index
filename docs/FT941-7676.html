			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / France says'Non' to creeping franglais The Balladur government yesterday stepped up its counter-offensive against the incursions of English by announcing that it is considering legislation to make the use of French compulsory in public advertising, announcements and conferences, on radio and television and in work contracts. The government has not yet decided what penalties to impose for the use of a foreign word where a French equivalent exists and officials suggest the most likely sanction would be removal of any public subsidy from the offending organisation. The possibility of fines and even prison sentences has apparently not been ruled out. Considered in cabinet yesterday, the language bill will this spring go to parliament, where last December deputies showed that, if anything, they were more exercised than the government about the dilution of French culture. MPs passed into law a requirement that by January 1996 all French radio stations must bring the percentage of French songs in the music they broadcast up to 40 per cent. That followed France's successful and domestically popular attempt to prevent quotas for French films being negotiated away in the Gatt talks, as the US had insisted. Recently the legislators became a target when the secretary of the Academie Francaise, guardian of the purity of the French language, complained to the president of the National Assembly that MPs were using slipshod and improper French in their debates. The bill does not identify English explicitly as the culprit, but Mr Jacques Toubon, the culture minister, did so yesterday in an interview in Le Monde newspaper. 'Anglo-Saxon countries, far from contenting themselves by passively benefiting from the situation of English . . . are deploying considerable efforts . . . to conquer new territory for their language,' the minister complained. He has already publicly bridled at the decision by Eurotunnel, the Anglo-French company, to dub its Channel tunnel train 'Le Shuttle' rather 'La Navette', and in yesterday's interview went on to warn that 'use of a foreign language is not always innocent . . . it can become an instrument of domination'. Despite the efforts of the Academie Francaise to dream up French equivalents to expressions such as 'le corner' kick in football, such franglais may prove hard to stamp out. French businessmen find 'le cash flow' easier to use than 'la marge brute d'autofinancement'. But perhaps fining such franglais users will help the French government with its own cash-flow problem, otherwise known as its deficit.</p>

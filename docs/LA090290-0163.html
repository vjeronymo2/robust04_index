			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD OF PRIVATE POSTAL SERVICE IS STARTING TO GO FIRST CLASS;  </P> <P> RETAILING: FRANCHISED OUTLETS FOR MAIL BOXES AND PACKAGE DELIVERY ARE THRIVING.  THEY OFFER INCREASINGLY UPSCALE CONVENIENCES SUCH AS FAX AND MESSAGE TAKING.  </P> <P> Not so many years ago, private postal and packaging outlets labored under the  unsavory public perception that they were back alley mail drops used by  nefarious types to avoid the law, bill collectors or both.  </P> <P> The private postal service industry, however, has moved upscale in recent  years, gaining popularity, respectability and even favor on Wall Street. The  outlets -- categorized by the U.S. Postal Service as "commercial mail-receiving  agents" -- have transformed themselves by expanding their array of services far  beyond just the rental of private mail boxes.  </P> <P> Many of the mail centers now offer services such as fax, word processing,  message-taking and printing, services that have won them a huge following among  small-business owners who cannot afford to outfit and staff an office.  </P> <P> There are also signs that the major package and letter carriers are recognizing  the value of the retail mail centers.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes Etc., the largest of the private mail center chains, in June  announced a deal with United Parcel Service under which UPS would pay $11.3  million for stock and warrants that would give it a 17% stake in Mail Boxes.  </P> <P> The deal, which has not been finalized, has raised protests among Mail Boxes'  rivals, who claim that the alliance may give Mail Boxes an unfair competitive  advantage.  </P> <P> The deal highlights the fact that private mail-box rental now represents only a  small slice of the revenue pie for Mail Boxes and other national chains,  including PostalAnnex and Pak Mail Centers of America.  </P> <P> Although a major selling point for many of these operations is 24-hour access  to private mail boxes as well as call-in services allowing clients to find out  if they have mail waiting, the mail centers' largest source of revenue is  package preparation and handling for such carriers as UPS, DHL and Federal  Express. Mark-up on postage and fees for wrapping and handling packages is a  primary profit source.  </P> <P> Observers credit the growth explosion in small businesses, which now account  for more than half of private mail centers' revenue, and a corresponding  decline in service quality at U.S. post offices, for making the industry  possible.  </P> <P> The popularity has helped drive the industry's growth from 1,000 outlets in  1979 to more than 6,000 outlets nationwide today, according to Associated Mail  and Parcel Centers, an Albuquerque-based trade group.  </P> <P> "The main reason the industry has developed is because the consumer had  desperately needed a more service-oriented and convenience-oriented program  than what the post offices and major carriers have to offer," said John E.  Kelly, president of Pak Mail Centers of America, an Aurora, Colo.-based  200-outlet chain that is the nation's second-largest private mail center  network.  </P> <P> "The packaging and shipping industry has become the travel agent for packages,"  Kelly said. "If you had a mounted mako shark you want mailed back home, what  would you do? You take it to a Pak Mail store because they can make all  arrangements to get it crated and shipped. Otherwise, the average consumer  wouldn't even know where to start."  </P> <P> The industry is not through growing, which is why Wall Street is paying  attention. Nationwide, there should be room for a minimum 15,000 to 17,000  private mail outlets, said Alex. Brown &amp; Sons analyst Christopher Vroom.  Boosters say 20,000 outlets -- half as many as there are U.S. Postal Service  branches -- is not an unreasonable projection.  </P> <P> International expansion is also planned. Mail Boxes Etc. recently opened its  first franchise in Mexico and will soon be selling European franchises as well.  </P> <P> Most of the private mail centers are located in strip shopping centers with  easy parking and access, two keys to a location's success. Centers located in  giant shopping malls, on the other hand, have proven less successful because of  the distances customers must carry packages. Nevertheless, Pak Mail has signed  a deal to open up as many as 300 of its outlets in Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.  stores, many of them situated in shopping malls, over the next two years.  </P> <P> No company illustrates the success of the private mail center concept more than  San Diego-based Mail Boxes Etc., the industry's leading franchiser, which has  grown from 57 outlets in 1983 to more than 1,300 today. Mail Boxes, which is  now adding an average of one new franchise every day, is at the top of Alex.  Brown &amp; Sons' list of high-growth companies, Vroom said. Both Mail Boxes  and Pak Mail stock is traded over the counter.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes is widely credited with inventing the concept of the private postal  office as a business communications center. Company President A. W. (Tony) De  Sio said the franchising strategy adopted by Mail Boxes and others has changed  the industry from a fragmented one with hundreds of tiny firms to one that  someday will be dominated by national chains, much as 7-Eleven dominates the  convenience store industry.  </P> <P> One third of all mail and package handling centers are now franchised by chains  such as Mail Boxes Etc. and PostalAnnex, both headquartered in San Diego, and  Pak Mail. Ten years ago, virtually all private mail outlets were independent  and company owned.  </P> <P> Mail Boxes began as a chain of company-owned stores but found out that a  business with such a heavy customer-service orientation thrived when the owner  was on the premises supervising day-to-day operations. For that reason -- and  to facilitate rapid growth of the essential national network -- the firm turned  to franchising.  </P> <P> The strategy is starting to pay off. Mail Boxes Etc.'s system-wide revenue  increased to $338.4 million for the year ended April 30, up 44% from the  previous year. Company revenue was $25.7 million for the year, up 33% from  fiscal 1989. Its net income was $1.5 million, down from $2.4 million the  previous year, a decline that reflects a one-time charge of $2.8 million to  settle litigation in 1990.  </P> <P> "Business-to-business services" such as the private mail handling outlets are  currently among the fastest-growing franchising categories," said Peter Holt of  the International Franchising Assn., a trade group based Washington. "Mail  Boxes is an excellent example of a company that identified a niche that wasn't  being serviced and built a franchise around it." "These are the businesses that  basically are geared to helping the businessman getting their products mailed.  . . . They also target a consumer who hates the lines at the post office," Holt  said.  </P> <P> The turnkey cost of a Mail Boxes franchise runs about $65,000, about half of  which the firm will finance through equipment-leasing programs. That start-up  cost includes an initial franchise fee of $19,500. Each franchisee also pays  out 7% of store revenue in royalties.  </P> <P> Under terms of its stock deal with Mail Boxes, UPS would have the right to  raise its stake to 35% after one year and to appoint a board director.  </P> <P> The deal sent ripples through the private mail industry and beyond. Mail Boxes  executives, who say UPS packaging represents 40% of a typical franchisee's  revenue, have touted the investment as the precursor of an undefined "strategic  relationship." Just what the relationship could entail be has not been made  clear although some kind of joint marketing effort is likely, company officials  say.  </P> <P> UPS may even buy the rest of Mail Boxes stock someday, which would help give  the package carrier the retail presence it now lacks. Long-distance letter and  package carriers have felt the need for accessible retail outlets, but most  have been unable to make them profitable, analysts say, pointing to problems  that Federal Express has had with its retail counters.  </P> <P> "It took eight years, but UPS finally realized that private post offices are  increasingly becoming the place for pickup and delivery of packages," said  Blaine Roberts, president of Morgan Roberts &amp; Co., a La Jolla investment  firm whose clients hold more than 5% of Mail Boxes Etc. shares. Knowledge of  the relationship UPS has with Mail Boxes Etc. "can drive customers into the  stores, letting UPS centralize their pickups."  </P> <P> For its part, UPS says it acquired the Mail Boxes Etc. stock for investment  purposes only and has no intention of taking control. The $12.4-billion  corporation said the Mail Boxes Etc. investment is just one of many that it has  made in transportation and communications stocks, although UPS acknowledged  that the Mail Boxes stock buy is its first in a commercial mail service.  </P> <P> The news of UPS' investment raised the hackles of Mail Boxes' competitors.  Despite UPS' assurances to other private mail centers that its investment will  not cause it to give Mail Boxes Etc. any break on rates, many rivals worry that  an alliance with UPS, which controls 95% of the nation's package volume, would  give Mail Boxes Etc. an unfair advantage.  </P> <P> Jim Baer, president of Associated Mail and Parcel Centers trade group, said his  group has sent letters to legislators and government agencies protesting that  the relationship could lead to unfair trade practices, given UPS' "monopoly on  ground parcel shipping."  </P> <P> "The scenario could be that (UPS) will somehow market this relationship,  possibly end up acquiring Mail Boxes Etc.," Baer said. "UPS could be after a  combination that will control the delivery of packages through UPS and the  receipt of packages through Mail Boxes Etc."  </P> <P> "What this is going to do is damage small businesses and by doing so hurt the  general public."  </P> <P> Neither has the Postal Service overlooked the deal. Richard Strasser, senior  assistant postmaster general, said that the deal "makes it a little challenging  (because) it gives them a retail presence and avoids them having to run it  themselves. . . . It will help them in competition with us and with Federal  Express."  </P></p>

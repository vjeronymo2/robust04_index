			<p>BFN     [Text] Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly Speaker Miro Lazovic  said today that the Assembly of the Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Assembly of the Bosnian-Croat  federation were going to share their work. I expect the  Assembly of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina to meet.  According to the Constitution, it should take up the duties of  the federation's assembly with the proviso that at that session,  duties will be divided into two categories -- tasks covered by  the republic's Assembly and those relating to the future  federation.    I believe that -- if political agreement is reached -- it  will be possible to appoint top-level officials of the future  federation. Some issues relating to the Assembly of the Republic  of Bosnia-Herzegovina will also be examined, Lazovic said at a  news conference in Zagreb. The news conference was organized by  a delegation of the Serb Civic Council of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Miro Lazovic is its member. He stressed that in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina parliament there are deputies who had been  elected in the 1990 elections. He said he expected Croatian  Democratic Community [HDZ] deputies to come and take part in the  assembly's work -- in their capacity as representatives of a  party that contested the 1990 elections rather than as  representatives of Herceg-Bosna.    Lazovic pointed out that the federal concept outlined in the  Washington agreement should be extended to the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We believe that this is a concept that  suits the Bosnian Serbs, too, as they are the second largest  population group in Bosnia-Herzegovina. If this concept is not  accepted, a huge number of the Serbs who stay to live in the  territory of the Croat-Bosnian federation will fall into the  category of other peoples, although they will account for almost  the same percentage as the Croats.</p>

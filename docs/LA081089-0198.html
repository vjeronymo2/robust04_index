			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> SHEVARDNADZE HAILS PACT ON CONTRAS  </P> <P> The new Central American accord on disbanding the Nicaraguan Contra rebels  opens the door to a superpower agreement on halting arms supplies to the area,  Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said today.  </P> <P> In an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, Shevardnadze said the Central  American accord has "cardinally improved" the situation in the region and makes  possible a Soviet proposal for a halt in foreign arms deliveries there.  </P> <P> "An agreement between the U.S.S.R. and the United States that they will both  refrain from arms deliveries is most important in this respect," he said.  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for such an agreement nearly two  years ago.  </P></p>

The move, estimated to bring in hundreds of millions of  yuan,  is an important step for Shanghai's comeback as a financial  center for the Asia-Pacific region.    Already a few banking giants, such as J.P. Morgan and  Citibank from the United States, and Credit Lyonnais and Banque  Indosuez from France, have shown intentions to set up branches  or representative offices here.    According to Shanghai's blueprint, Waitan, which claimed 113  bank buildings before 1949 and was transformed into the city's  administrative center afterwards, will be built into China's  "Wall Street".    A special institute has been established by housing  management units, to help relocate the departments in these  former financial buildings mainly along the East Zhongshan Road.    Since last year, quite a few buildings have changed  ownership. For example, China foreign exchange center has used a  building which previously belonged to the aerospace industry  administration.    Now, many units, such as the municipal trade unions, textile  bureau and foreign trade administration, are preparing to  withdraw from Waitan.</p>

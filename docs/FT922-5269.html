			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Green shoots of good intention from business: The boardroom view of the Earth Summit MOST prominent in the approach to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this week has been the international business community, not environmental groups. Never have business people been so active in a UN conference. Captains of industry from all over the world addressed packed meetings in Rio last week. Such phrases as 'environmental responsibility' have tripped off tongues. Yet many of the chief executives present run the world's most polluting industries, such as car and chemical manufacturing. Changes decided at the UN summit will cost them, but they are not here to lobby against it. Rather, they are vocal in calling for regulations. Leading the green business offensive is Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss billionaire from the asbestos trade and now principal adviser on business and industry to Mr Maurice Strong, conference secretary-general. Mr Schmidheiny insists that industry is changing: 'Profit and ecology are linked. We're convinced that, unless we change course, we'll ruin our future. Soon it will be impossible to separate business excellence and environmental concern.' He runs the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD), which brings together heads of 48 leading corporations - such as Dow Chemical, Du Pont, Royal Dutch Shell and Mitsubishi - to formulate industry's position for the conference. The outcome of 18 months of meetings is a report calling for new partnerships of government and the private sector, and proposing payment for the use of natural resources, technological co-operation between the global north and south, and tougher rules on pollution so that the polluter pays. While the US government remains hostile to environmental regulation, some of the leading US business executives are in Rio calling for it. Mr Frank Popoff, head of Dow Chemical, says: 'It's very much in our interest to get regulation which will enhance business moves to sustainable development.' Sustainable development - that is the mantra of the new green industrialists. Mr Jan-Olaf Willums, executive director of the International Chamber of Commerce Office on Environment, defines it thus: 'Environment is an asset. Sustainable development is about learning to develop and maintain this asset so we live off the income, not the capital.' However, Mr Richard Lapper, industry adviser for the World Wide Fund for Nature, wonders: 'I don't know if any of them realise how sweeping the changes must be. Industry is driven on a set of rules which tends to work against the environment because it does not internalise environmental costs. Sustainable development means completely rethinking this.' Mr Kenny Bruno of Greenpeace is sceptical: 'By proclaiming environmentalism, these companies are trying to avoid responsibility for the fact that their products and practices have wreaked environmental havoc.' But Mr Carl Hahn, head of Volkswagen, argues: 'We have concrete examples of how we have reduced pollution. We should not be criticised because we too want to live in a better environment.' Mr Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of the Italian energy company ENI, admits there is a profit motive at work: 'The market will punish those who do not change. 'It is cheaper to produce non-polluting products than bear the costs of the problems caused by polluting.' The message is that what is good for the environment need not be bad for the economy. There can even be benefits. Mr Joseph Connor, head of the ICC, says: 'The corporate challenge is to take advantage of green consumerism and opportunities such as waste recycling and non-polluting products.' The market for enviromental products in Europe to the end of this decade has been estimated at Pounds 600bn. But for industry to change profoundly, Mr Schmidheiny repeats, it needs government incentives and penalties as carrots and sticks. 'The nations most successful in wielding these will be those whose industries prosper,' he says.</p>

			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Waterford Wedgwood seeks 500 job cuts by end of year WATERFORD Wedgwood, the luxury ceramics and crystal manufacturer, is to make a quarter of the 1,900 workforce at its troubled Waterford plant in southern Ireland redundant in what is likely to be a make-or-break effort to return the division to profitability. Mr Paddy Galvin, Waterford Crystal's chairman and chief executive, said the company was seeking 500 voluntary redundancies by the end of the year, after which a compulsory redundancy scheme would be implemented. The company was also seeking across-the-board wage and piece-rate reductions for those remaining, a pay freeze until February 1994 and an industrial peace agreement for an initial period of five years. Mr Jimmy Kelly, one of the union leaders at the plant, said yesterday that the workforce was deeply dismayed by the decision and added that industrial action 'could not be ruled out'. He said it could be several weeks before all the options had been discussed and a decision taken. However, Mr Galvin warned that strike action 'would create a most awful situation for us . . . we would not come out the other end. We will not survive a strike'. The crystal division of the company has not made a profit since 1986 and in the intervening five years has lost some IPounds 66m (Pounds 62.5m). When rationalisation was attempted in 1990, a crippling 14-week strike costing IPounds 10m ensued. Since then some 400 workers have left via voluntary redundancy and short-time working was introduced in an effort to further reduce overheads. Currently, most of the skilled glass blowers and cutters are working only about seven days a month. In the year to December 31 1991 losses were trimmed to IPounds 1.2m, but sales have continued to decline on the company's traditional product lines due to the ongoing recession. The company has also said that it intends importing new lines of crystal to market under the Waterford brand name in a further effort to reduce costs. This measure has further upset the unions who fear that even with the coming round of redundancies, the gradual move to overseas manufacture will eventually result in the closure of the Waterford plant anyway. Redundancy terms are currently based on the number of years service with the company. Waterford has spent approximately IPounds 10m on redundancy pay since the 1990 strike, and is likely to face a similar bill on the next round of redundancies.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Isle of Man Budget aims to help business THE ISLE of Man government yesterday presented to Tynwald, the island's parliament, a budget designed to spread the benefits from the island's thriving economy among less well-off residents and increase aid for business ahead of the island's autumn general election. The Isle of Man, a crown dependency, has its own parliament and manages its own financial arrangements, including setting its level of taxation. The Manx government will give an initial allowance of 100 per cent on new capital expenditure for industrial, tourist and agricultural buildings. Manx government grants towards such expenditure will no longer be taken into account when determining the allowance. Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx treasury minister, said his intention was to assist business, while 'seeking to ensure adequate funding for the provision of enhanced public services and for assistance to the less well-off'. Mr Gelling had Pounds 355m to distribute - Pounds 47m more than last year - of which Pounds 49m is intended for capital expenditure. He decided against a transfer from revenue to the reserve fund, which stands at Pounds 61.5m and will benefit from Pounds 4.75m in interest earned and the sale of Manx banknotes and coins. The island retains its two-tier tax system, with personal income tax for residents at 15 per cent for the first Pounds 8,000 of taxable income and 20 per cent on the balance. Non-residents and companies will continue to pay income tax at 20 per cent on their whole taxable income. Personal allowances will increase from Pounds 5,000 to Pounds 5,650 for a single person and from Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 11,300 for a married couple, fully transferable between husband and wife. Single parents' allowances rise from Pounds 3,440 to Pounds 3,900 and a registered blind person's allowance increases Pounds 200 to Pounds 1,450. Prescription charges stay at Pounds 1 an item and tax relief will be introduced on premiums on private medical insurance for those aged 60 and over. The increase in VAT in the UK Budget gave Mr Gelling an unexpected additional Pounds 2.65m, which is to be distributed to the island's residents through rebates on water and electricity charges. An average household in the island can expect a rebate of Pounds 32 a year on water and Pounds 34 on electricity.</p>

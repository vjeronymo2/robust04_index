Last month,  Graham's former assistant, Wendell Luttrull, also was charged with extorting  money in exchange for official services. Luttrull pleaded guilty Dec. 1 to a  single count of violating the federal Hobbs Act. At the time, Luttrull made a  court statement implicating his former boss. If he is convicted, the charges  against Graham could bring a maximum sentence of 75 years in prison. He will  not be arrested, but ordered to appear in court later.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Aliyev during a meeting with refugees </F> on the occasion of the Islamic Festival of Sacrifice in Baku on  21 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Esteemed sisters, brothers, and citizens from  Shusha, Khodzhaly, Malybeyli, Lachin, and Karabakh, which is a  beautiful part of our country: I congratulate you and the  people of Azerbaijan on the occasion of the Festival of  Sacrifice. I wish you and the people of the Republic happiness  and an auspicious future. [passage omitted]    The religious festivals are auspicious and happy occasions  for the people. However, our people are in a very difficult  situation at the present time. Azerbaijan has been subjected to  Armenia's military aggression for six years now. It has been  forced to fight to safeguard its territory. A serious situation  exists in the Republic. Azerbaijan's brave and heroic sons have  been martyred while trying to defend our territory. Our refugee  sisters, brothers, and sons from Shusha, Lachin, Khodzhaly, and  Malybeyli have met here today. They prove that our people are  in a difficult situation. However, they are optimistic. They  have never bowed their heads. They have never yielded. That  being the case, we have not forgotten our traditions and customs  even at this serious time and we have moved to celebrate the  Festival of Sacrifice.    Undoubtedly, marking the occasion in prosperity and security  is impossible. We are all aware of that state of affairs.  However, we all feel happy and optimistic on this day. That is  why I have come here to meet you. That is why I have come here  to meet the people who have suffered most in Azerbaijan.    I repeat that you have suffered significantly. You have been  forced to abandon your homes and places of birth during the past  two years. You have lost the property you inherited from your  forefathers. You have martyrs in your families. I am well  aware of the fact that each and every family in this gathering  has missing persons and martyrs. All the families are grieving.  However, you must rest assured that each and every patriotic  citizen of Azerbaijan shares your grief. I have congratulated  you on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice. Nevertheless,  my heart is full of grief. I share your grief. I have been  elected president through the people's will. That means that I  have to grieve more than anyone else. Rest assured that I do.    I have put my hope in you and the people of Azerbaijan. You  must rest assured that I shall spare no effort in the struggle I  wage to fulfill your expectations and those of all the people.    On the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice, I commemorate  our sons, sisters, and brothers who have sacrificed their lives  for the defense of Azerbaijan's territorial integrity and  independence. I wish to reiterate that their heroic services  will never be forgotten. We shall cherish their memory in our  hearts forever. Through their heroic services and martyrdom,  they have become an everlasting monument. I call upon you to  observe silence for one minute to commemorate those who fell to  become martyrs while defending our homeland. [silence observed  for one minute]    God bless their souls. God give patience to their families,  sisters, and sons. I pray that God also give you patience and  protect you. I wish to reiterate that the blood of the martyrs  will be avenged. Azerbaijan's people will maintain the struggle  that the martyrs waged. They will reestablish Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity. [applause]    We are well aware that you are in a serious situation. You  have been living as refugees during the past two years. You  have found a place to live in the recreation buildings in this  place, which were constructed in the past. I am aware that they  are not spacious. However, we are all aware that the majority of  those who have recently become refugees are now living in tents  and places that are even worse. They are living in tents in  Imishlinskiy, Sabirabadskiy, Agdzhabedinskiy, and other rayons.    It is common knowledge that Azerbaijan has lost 20 percent  of  its territory in the war, which has continued for six years.  This territory has been occupied by the Armenian military  forces. It is common knowledge that more than one million  citizens from Shusha, Malybeyli, Khodzhaly, Lachin, Kelbadzhar,  and other towns and cities in Daghlyk Karabakh have become  refugees during that period. We have been taking measures under  very difficult conditions to help them. Considering your  problems, I wish to inform you that I greatly appreciate your  steadfast resistance and patience. Thank you for maintaining  your steadfast nature. Thank you for enduring the tragic  situation, which applies to all the people. That is a unique  aspect of the Republic's people. [passage omitted]    The difficult times will pass and Azerbaijan's people will  have a happy and prosperous life in their independent country in  the future. I have confidence in that and I wish to assure you  that the state, the government organs, and the president will  spare no effort to achieve that objective. [applause]    I wish to take advantage of this meeting to convey my  views on the recent developments and the situation in our  Republic. It is common knowledge that Armenia has consistently  maintained its military aggression against Azerbaijan over the  past few years. Consequently, we have lost a part of our  territory. Several measures have been taken since my return from  Nakhichevan to Azerbaijan to establish the Azerbaijan Armed  Forces and other conditions needed for the defense of our  republic. Several measures have been taken to enable Azerbaijan  to adopt a policy on the war with Armenia and the developments  in the world, that is, a policy in line with the people's  interests.    You are well-aware of those measures. Most probably, you are  also aware of the war, the political developments in the  Republic, the struggle waged by various groups for power, and  the activities of individual people against the general  population's interests significantly curtailed Azerbaijan's  potential in the economic, intellectual, cultural, and social  fields over the past few years. You will remember that several  people at this gathering reminded me that in the past we have  met in Shusha and in the cemetery at Baku. One of them told me  that I had presented the order of merit to her. But, those were  different occasions. Our people had a comfortable and  prosperous life at the time. Please remember the work we  carried out to renovate Shusha in the 1970's. [passage omitted  lauding past renovation and construction work]    We have taken measures to enable Azerbaijan to end the war.  In addition, we have taken measures to establish and strengthen  the Azerbaijani Army and set up our defense positions. We have  taken political measures to find a peaceful solution to the war.  We have conferred with influential countries, and tried to use  various opportunities to benefit from international  organizations. Meanwhile, we have consolidated our military  strength, reactivated our economic potential to a certain  extent, and upgraded our foreign policy. Furthermore, we have  made an effort to use political measures to end the war and  remove the problems of the people. I wish to inform you that  the measures we have taken and the work we have done have  yielded results and will continue to do so in the future.    You are well-aware of the situation of our military forces  in  the past. It was not that we did not have an army, however the  military units were [words indistinct]. The people of Shusha,  Khodzhaly, and Daghlyk Karabakh are well-aware of that state of  affairs. We made efforts to establish a regular army and have  achieved significant success. We now have a regular army. You  are well-aware that our military forces launched attacks against  the Armenian Armed Forces over the past few months, particularly  after October and November 1993. As a result of those attacks,  we reclaimed a part of the occupied territories. Consequently,  Azerbaijan's military forces proved their high capability to the  entire world. The Armenians and the Armenian Armed Forces  realized that as well. The Armenian military units were forced  to withdraw. That is only a part of the outcome of our work.    However, we are well-aware that the war will lead to more  tragic situations if it is allowed to continue for another three  or five years. With that in mind, we wish to end the war. We  wish to find a peaceful solution to the dispute. That can be  achieved only through talks. Your sons must not be killed.  That can be prevented only through talks. We have held talks  from time to time.    You are well-aware that the dispute on Daghlyk Karabakh has  a  significant place in the policies of all the world's countries.  Each and every country in the world has expressed its opinion on  the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute. Regrettably, Azerbaijan  maintained a weak policy and failed to put its weight down in  international platforms over the past few years. Furthermore,  the officials responsible for Azerbaijan's policy were  unsuccessful. Consequently, the influential countries, mainly  the European countries and the United States, were convinced  that Azerbaijan had to be blamed and that the Armenians in  Daghlyk Karabakh were deprived of their rights. International  opinion has supported the Armenian side. That is a fact. Maybe  you may not be aware of that state of affairs, however we are  well-aware of the situation. Those who were involved in  politics in the past, and those who have currently appeared on  the scene claiming to be politicians, are also well-aware of  that state of affairs. Consequently, we have made efforts over  the past few months to end the war by finding a peaceful  solution to the dispute, but on the condition that the occupied  territories are returned to the Republic. Then, Azerbaijan's  territorial integrity would be restored, and the non-violation  of the Republic's borders is observed. However, you must  realize that achieving all that is not easy.    The general view of international platforms and  organizations  has been against Azerbaijan. Our territories have been occupied  as a result of the inefficiency and treachery of those who were  responsible for Azerbaijan's future. Undoubtedly, all that has  created very serious problems for us, and during the talks we  have had to find a peaceful solution to the problem. Many  countries around the world support Armenia. Meanwhile, we have  been unable to remove the Armenian military forces from our  territories. Consequently, the Armenian side has put forward  conditions in the talks. Can you realize how serious and  difficult that situation is? A wise and well-considered policy  has to be maintained. Yes, that is the kind of policy we are  trying to maintain.    You are well aware that Azerbaijan's relations with Russia  have deteriorated significantly during the past few years.  Obviously, an organization that called itself the Azerbaijan  Popular Front but that failed to concern itself with the  people's problems created a very unfavorable situation between  Azerbaijan and Russia. The question of international politics is  a complex matter. No country in the world, including small  countries, must avoid maintaining a realistic approach. How can  Azerbaijan, which recently achieved its independence but is  still unable to stand on its feet as an independent country,  allow itself to maintain a state of discord with a great country  like Russia? Is that possible? Anyway, there is no reason for  that. Azerbaijan has been influenced by Russia for 200 years.  Whether we like it or not, that is a historic fact. Many kinds  of relations were established between Azerbaijan and Russia in  those years, including humanitarian, economic, scientific, and  technical relations. How can those relations be destroyed? How  can more than one million Azerbaijani people in Russia be  ignored? How can we force a great country to be an enemy of  Azerbaijan? That is absurd.    In view of that, we made an effort to normalize Azerbaijan's  relations with Russia. I am convinced that we have succeeded.  Azerbaijan's relations with Russia are at a very favorable level  at the present time. We have established friendly relations.  That must be the situation in the future. Each and every  independent country should have friends in the world.  Neighboring countries should be friendly, not hostile. That is  what we have tried to achieve. Furthermore, it is common  knowledge that we have joined the CIS. That was very essential.  All that has created a significant basis for a peaceful  solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia.    Meanwhile, we have made an effort to establish close  relations with other countries. For example, we have  traditional, friendly, and fraternal relations with Turkey. We  are maintaining our friendly and fraternal relations. It is  common knowledge that I have visited that country and signed  important agreements. We have very sincere relations with the  top officials in Turkey.    Iran is a close neighbor. Millions of Azerbaijani people  live in that country. We have had close relations with that  country for many centuries. However, the policy that was  maintained until recently disrupted the relations between  Azerbaijan and Iran. That country became our enemy.  Nevertheless, we rectified that situation. President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani visited Azerbaijan and signed several  agreements. Consequently, our economic, humanitarian, and  cultural relations are developing in a very favorable way at the  present time.    We have also made an effort to improve our relations with  the  influential countries in the world. The United States is a  great country. It has a significant influence on international  politics. A very chilled atmosphere prevailed in Azerbaijan's  relations with the United States in the past. We improved that  state of affairs and I am convinced that the effort we have made  has yielded positive results. You will recall that the U.S.  Congress adopted an unjust resolution against Azerbaijan in  September 1992. That was because of unwise policies and the  inactivity of Azerbaijan's leading officials at the time. The  resolution banned any U.S. aid to Azerbaijan in accordance with  Article 9/7 [as heard] of the U.S. law on freedom because  Azerbaijan supposedly blockaded Armenia. The U.S. Congress  adopted that resolution, which created a significant precipice  between Azerbaijan and that country two years ago.    Azerbaijan's relations with Russia and the United States  deteriorated in the past. Had the officials--who supposedly  governed Azerbaijan in the past and who now claim that they are  great politicians--maintained a wise policy, Azerbaijan's  relations with Russia, Iran, and the United States would not  have been disrupted and the U.S. congress would not have adopted  that resolution.    We have carried out significant work in that direction. I  have held talks with U.S. officials who have visited Azerbaijan  several times. We also maintain contact with U.S. officials  through other means.    I can also inform you that President Clinton sent a letter  to  me a month ago. It indicated a positive shift in the U.S.  approach toward Azerbaijan. President Clinton described the  resolution, which banned any U.S. aid to Azerbaijan, as an  unjust decision. That was the first time he did so.  Furthermore, he informed me that he will work to have the  Congress cancel that resolution. Considering Azerbaijan's  present situation, I am convinced that this move is a very  appreciated step by President Clinton.    President Clinton also conveyed a congratulatory message to  me on the occasion of the Festival of Sacrifice on 17 May. I  believe that the meaning of that message is important from two  aspects. First, it indicates that the United States is aware of  our national and religious festivals. President Clinton has  congratulated Azerbaijan's people through me on the occasion of  this festival. Second, it indicates that President Clinton  appreciates Azerbaijan's efforts to find a peaceful solution to  the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute, particularly within the CSCE  framework. In fact, he has said that the U.S. Administration  will also work on the matter.    Those two aspects indicate that the talks we have had with  the United States within the framework of our foreign policy  have yielded positive results. A large U.S. delegation arrived  in Azerbaijan on 15 May. We held very fruitful talks with those  officials.    Furthermore, you are aware that I visited France at the  invitation of President Mitterrand, Britain at the invitation of  Prime Minister John Major, and the PRC at the invitation of  President Jiang Zemin. Very useful work was carried out during  my visits. The UN Security Council has five permanent members.  They are the United States, Russia, Britain, France, and the  PRC. I have held talks with the leaders of four of those  countries. You are aware that I have held talks with President  Boris Yeltsin several times. I met with the leading officials  of France, Britain, and the PRC during my visits. Our  independent Republic signed very important agreements with them.  Can you imagine, a new and independent Republic like Azerbaijan  has established close relations with several countries that  influence international politics. Official visits have taken  place and fruitful agreements have been signed. All this has  given Azerbaijan publicity in the international community.  Unfortunately, we have had many problems in connection with  that matter in the past. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's position in  the world has strengthened. A significant opportunity has been  created to remove the serious situation in our Republic.    However, that is not all the details of our foreign policy.  But I do not wish to give you detailed information on it. My  intention is to express my opinion and focus only on the need to  find a peaceful way to end the war between Azerbaijan and  Armenia. I am convinced that we have to strengthen our defense  forces and consolidate our capability to defend ourselves.  Meanwhile, we must also use all the existing opportunities.  For example, we are holding talks with Russia, the United  States, and Turkey on the matter. We are also in constant touch  with the UN Security Council and the CSCE. We are making a very  serious effort.    I have realized the importance of the CSCE's effort to find  a  peaceful solution to the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia ever  since I took office as president. In view of that, we have  cooperated with that organization. The Minsk Group, which is  made up of nine countries, is affiliated with the CSCE. I have  been constantly in touch with its chairman. The CSCE Minsk  Group used to be headed by Mario Raffaelli. It is now headed by  Mr. Jan Eliasson. I have held talks with Mr. Eliasson and his  delegations in Azerbaijan several times. I have explained  Azerbaijan's position to them for hours and days. Yes, I have  worked to have the CSCE play the main role in the effort made to  resolve the dispute. I will continue to work in that direction  in the future.    Mr. Eliasson recently visited Azerbaijan. We held talks and  agreed that the CSCE should make initiatives for a cease-fire.  We also agreed that measures should be taken later for the  signing of a cease-fire agreement to end the war. Naturally,  Mr. Eliasson also cooperates with Armenia and Russia. He  disclosed in our latest talks that the problem should be  resolved within the CSCE framework. However, he also said that  Russia should play a special role. That was his proposal. I  wish to inform you that Russia has made an effort to mediate for  the solution of the problem. We have not objected to that. On  the contrary, we have tried to benefit from that approach. We  have to use each and every opportunity. So, we have approved  the joint effort by the CSCE and Russia. That was proposed by  the CSCE. It was proposed by Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE  Minsk Group.    Meanwhile, we have taken a step to promote our work in the  international community. You are aware of the existence of  NATO. [passage omitted]    The heads of state in that organization convened in Brussels  and approved a program to create the conditions required by the  former Warsaw Pact countries, which have now become independent,  to join NATO. They adopted the program on partnership for peace  and disclosed that the countries that have recently become  independent may join it. We considered the matter and decided  that Azerbaijan will strengthen its position in the world if it  joins that program. Therefore, we made a decision and I traveled  to Brussels, which hosts NATO Headquarters. I addressed a  meeting in that headquarters and disclosed that Azerbaijan is  prepared to join the program on partnership for peace. In fact,  I signed that program. Four CIS countries have signed that  program; Azerbaijan is the fourth. The remaining CIS members  have not signed it. I am convinced that Azerbaijan's decision  to sign that program was right politically and diplomatically.  Furthermore, it was a daring step.    I was informed by a CSCE representative in Brussels that  Russia and the CIS must join the effort that is made to resolve  the Daghlyk Karabakh dispute and find a peaceful way to end the  war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. He said that the CSCE  believes that it must carry out joint work with Russia and the  CIS. I responded by saying that we shall support that approach,  since the CSCE is in favor of it. The important thing to us is  to end the war. Azerbaijan will not object to a CSCE move to  cooperate with a foreign country to end the war.    So, a new formula was drawn up. Jan Eliasson arrived in  Baku on the basis of that formula on 13 May. He presented a  draft agreement for a cease-fire. The draft also called for the  consolidation of the cease-fire regime. We had made several  initiatives for a cease-fire. For example, we proposed a  cease-fire through Russia's mediation on 28 April. However,  Armenia objected to it. Later, we maintained our initiatives  for the same purpose. They, too, were rejected by Armenia. The  interparliamentary assembly convened in Bishkek on 5 May. The  Daghlyk Karabakh dispute was discussed in that convocation.  Afiyettin Dzhelilov headed Azerbaijan's delegation to that  meeting. We gave instructions to him on various issues. We  informed him that we had to attend that meeting and hold talks  with the other participants. However, we instructed him that  Azerbaijan must not sign any document without the approval of  its president. We dispatched Dzhelilov to Bishkek with that  instruction. He acted accordingly. A document was placed on  the table. He said that he was not able to sign it. Later, we  studied the document. It contained a provision for a  cease-fire. Consequently, he decided that Azerbaijan should sign  it. Chairman of the National Assembly Rasul Guliyev signed the  document with our approval on 8 May. A cease-fire began on 10  May. Exchanges of fire have not taken place since that day.    The objective of Azerbaijan signing the Bishkek protocol was  to have a cease-fire. We have achieved our objective. That was  the right thing to do. Meanwhile, we held talks with Jan  Eliasson. He submitted a draft document for the consolidation  of the cease-fire regime on 13 May. We were satisfied with it  and we suggested that he should consult with Armenia. He  visited Armenia. The Armenian officials made some changes in  the draft document in accordance with their views. Eliasson  returned to Baku on 16 May. The defense ministers of Russia,  Azerbaijan, and Armenia held a meeting in Moscow at the time.  Yes, an initiative was made for such a meeting and we had  agreed to it. I wish to reiterate that we have tried to use  every opportunity. The defense ministers met in Moscow for two  or three days. Russia's defense minister held a press  conference on 16 May. He disclosed without Azerbaijan's  approval that Russia's peacekeeping forces will be deployed as  observers in areas between Azerbaijan and Armenia. He also  disclosed that a few battalions, that is, some 1,800 men, will  be dispatched to the region. Later, he urged Azerbaijan to sign  a protocol on that matter.    However, considering that such a protocol would be  inappropriate for Azerbaijan, I instructed the Republic's  defense minister not to sign it and to immediately return to  Baku. Jan Eliasson was in Baku at the time. He was briefed on  that matter. We agreed to his draft document and he returned to  Yerevan. The officials in Armenia refrained from signing the  document Jan Eliasson brought to us from Yerevan. So, that  confirmed that Azerbaijan supports peace and wishes to end the  war. It also was an indication that confirmed Azerbaijan's wish  to resolve the dispute through international organizations and  Russia. However, Armenia has exposed itself. It has confirmed  that it does not wish to end the war. Later, Jan Eliasson  returned to Vienna. He is continuing his work.    Meanwhile, we summoned the Republic's defense minister from  Moscow. We also disclosed that we could not sign that protocol.  I wish to inform you that the CSCE, the Minsk Group, and Jan  Eliasson are in close contact with Russia. They wish to  maintain their cooperation.    That is all that I can say on the developments. I wish to  draw your attention to the fact that exchanges of fire have not  taken place since 10 May. I believe that this is a positive  development for Azerbaijan. Our military forces heroically  fought during the past few months. However, we have had many  casualties. I wish to clearly say that there have been days  when we had 50 martyrs in one place alone. Azerbaijan's  officers have died together with their troops. They fought to  defend our territories. The Armenians planned to occupy Terter  by 1 May. They also planned to occupy Barda later. Their plans  were foiled because our military forces steadfastly maintained  their positions.    The Armenians have other plans too. However, you must  realize that Armenia is not waging war by itself; you are  well-aware of that. No, Armenia is not waging the war by  itself. You are well-aware of the countries and forces that  support it. Had it only been Armenia, Azerbaijan's military  forces would have evicted them from the republic's territory,  even though our forces are not yet at full strength. However,  that is connected with international politics. We are unable to  influence the policies of certain forces and countries in the  world, who act as they please. Therefore, we have to maintain a  wide-ranging policy, and we need experience and information in  order to be able to do so. We have to analyze and draw  conclusions. I am convinced that you believe that we are  capable of doing so. As president, I occupy myself with all  those matters round the clock.    Regardless of all that and at a time when our republic is  working in various directions, certain internal forces continue  to try to create discord among us. I am confident that the  people do not believe them. I am aware that the people trust  me. Some 7 million people in Azerbaijan trusted me and elected  me president. I rely on the people's support. I rely on your  support. I rely on the support of the people of Azerbaijan.    Why have I said all this? In an effort to create discord in  the republic, some individuals have recently claimed that  Azerbaijan's leaders are making the wrong moves. What does that  mean? I have already explained the developments related to the  Bishkek protocol. On 18 May, a group of deputies in the National  Assembly--they were Etibar Mamedov, several deputies from the  Azerbaijan People's Front, and a few others who always vacillate  on way and the other. [shouts against the Azerbaijan People's  Front from the audience]    Please be calm. I can see that you, too, have many things to  say. I am addressing you at this moment. I wish to express my  views. Later, I will give the floor to anyone who wishes to  speak.    Yes, they demanded that the National Assembly place the  Bishkek Protocol on its agenda. There is nothing to debate in  the Bishkek Protocol. The main objective of that protocol is to  effect a cease-fire. Their actions indicate that they do not  wish to see a cease-fire imposed. They want people to be  killed. This matter was debated; I attended that session. We  voted on the matter. The parliament has its rules. Their  motion did not pass. The Bishkek Protocol was not placed on the  agenda; then a recess was called. Some 15 deputies presented an  ultimatum and walked out when the National Assembly reconvened.  The remaining members of the National Assembly, who were in the  majority, issued a statement against them.    The walkout by the deputies conflicts with the ethics and  experience of a respected parliament. It confirms that their  cultural levels are not high enough. Obviously, they have used  uncivilized ways and means to achieve their goals thus far. As  president, I condemn their actions. I am confident that the  people will support me. I urge them to refrain from lawlessness.    However, the matter does not end there. I could have decided  not to mention these matters, but I feel obliged to do so.    Later, Etibar Mamedov held a meeting in the building which  houses his political party with a few inefficient individuals  who supposedly represent the Azerbaijan People's Front and the  Karabakh Liberation Movement. Have you heard about that  movement? Let the members of that movement go to fight in  Karabakh. They should not create such a state of affairs for  the people. We have a political party which is known as Bozkurt  [Gray Wolf]. It is led by Iskendar Khamidov. He and several  others have issued a statement, which is disgusting and unjust  and which conflicts with our present day national interests. It  is full of lies and calumnies. It claims that Russian military  units have arrived in Azerbaijan and that we wish to have them  defend our republic.    No Russian military units have been deployed in Azerbaijan.  The people must not be misled. I have explained the measures  we have taken during the past few months. The television  network will further inform the people on what I have outlined.  No Russian military units have arrived in Azerbaijan. The  people must not be misled. Furthermore, if they are opposed to  the measures that have been taken by the government, then they  should hold talks with the officials. Azerbaijan is an  independent country. Its president has been elected by the  people. The people hate secret meetings that are held in dark  rooms to draw up plots. Those are lawless activities, which no  one can tolerate.    They met again yesterday to draw up a policy for national  resistance. They disclosed that they will hold a large meeting.  What kind of a meeting will that be? Who is to organize it?  Yes, they are Etibar Mamedov, Iskendar Khamidov, Tofik Gasumov,  Isa Kamberov, Ibragim Ibragimov, and several other people like  them. They established a committee yesterday and urged the  people to attend the meeting they will organize. Undoubtedly,  the people will not allow them to hold such a meeting. The  state laws will be enforced if they act in a lawless way. Each  and every one of them will be penalized accordingly. I wish to  make that clear. [applause]    Regarding the movement that has been established by those  individuals, I believe that it conflicts with Azerbaijan's  national interests. [Shouts of "Treachery"]    Yes, I regard it as an act of treachery. Thank God that an  administration exists in Azerbaijan. Thank God that Azerbaijan  has a president and state organs. However, a handful of  individuals in the streets ignore them and claim that they  themselves wish to defend Azerbaijan's people. The people have  entrusted the president they elected with the duty of defending  them. The president is the guarantor of the people's security  in Azerbaijan. He guarantees the people's rights and protects  the republic's territory. [applause] Who has authorized those  individuals to assume those responsibilities? Who are they?    You are well-aware that I do not wish to say anything about  them, because I do not wish to lower myself to their level. The  people are already aware of their situation; but I do not wish  to lower myself to their level. If they wish to improve their  situation, then they will have to do the right work for 10 or 15  years. None of them have any experience in any field. They  have gathered together from here and there and from the streets.  [passage indistinct]    We have opened the door to democracy. Political parties have  been established. More than 40 political parties have  registered in Azerbaijan. The newspapers publish whatever they  wish. They published [words indistinct] and calumnies. In view  of democracy and pluralism in politics, I have not objected to  all that. Nor will I do so in the future. However, I will not  allow any calumny or activity aimed at misleading the people and  encouraging them to commit crimes. I wish to inform everyone in  that regard. [applause]    I have respected Etibar Mamedov. However, I can see that  several of you do not like him. Nevertheless, I have respected  him because he has carried out political work to a certain  extent. I hope that he will hear and understand what I am going  to say now. He must assess my respect for him. There is no  reason for him to maintain the claims he has made. [applause]    Etibar Mamedov has had only one objective in mind for the  past three or four years: He only wished to come to power.  Well, he was a candidate in the presidential elections, along  with Abulfaz Elchibey, Nizami Suleymanov, and several others.  He would have come to power if he had secured the people's  support. He was not elected; Elchibey was elected instead.  Etibar Mamedov moved against him. Later, Elchibey abandoned  his post. I tried to convince Mamedov to work together with me.  I invited him, asked him to serve as the republic's foreign  minister. He refused, saying that the post was not good enough  for him. I asked him to serve as the state secretary. He did  not agree to that either. [passage omitted]    Etibar Mamedov and Iskendar Khamidov have an agreement to  wage a struggle against the government now. Who is Iskendar  Khamidov? That state of affairs is very disgusting for  Azerbaijan. There is no reason at all for it. Khamidov  established the party known as Bozkurt. What kind of a party is  it and where does it find the funds it needs? Khamidov  disseminated unfounded reports; he committed many crimes in the  past. He has now moved to organize a meeting.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Major General Dani Rothschild, coordinator of  government activities in the territories, believes the power  struggle between the local leaders in the territories and the  PLO-Tunis leadership will continue. In his opinion, the PLO  will find operating the self-rule difficult unless it assigns  the local leaders a greater role. The local leaders, he says,  will continue supporting the peace process in any event and will  not join the anti-'Arafat organizations.    Speaking to our correspondent, Gen. Rothschild said the  Palestinians began by demanding that Israel leave them to manage  their affairs on their own, but they soon realized that the task  was very complex.    The true test of the agreement's implementation, in the  coordinator's opinion, will be the extent of the population's  satisfaction and the rate of improvement in every sphere of  life. Unless such improvement is attained, the strength of Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] and the other opposition forces  will rise.    As for the next phase of the Cairo agreements, Gen.  Rothschild does not anticipate easy negotiations on the early  Palestinian empowerment in the rest of Judaea and Samaria. The  matter is complicated, because we will be discussing joint  Israeli-Palestinian bodies, he said.</p>

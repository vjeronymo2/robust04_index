			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MARTIN MULL TAKES 'A REAL JOB' AS LEAD IN NETWORK SITCOM  </P> <P> Martin Mull has temporarily deserted such off-beat pursuits as "The History of  the White People in America" in order to appear in a network sitcom.  </P> <P> "I thought it was high time I took a real job," Mull said in an interview. "I'd  been having just too much fun all my life."  </P> <P> After appearing in Norman Lear's syndicated "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman" and  its spinoff, "Fernwood 2-Night," as well as the "White People" spoofs on pay  cable, Mull now stars in "His &amp; Hers," a sitcom to premiere on CBS Monday.  </P> <P> Mull plays Dr. Douglas Lambert, a divorced marriage counselor with two teen-age  kids, who is remarried to Stephanie Faracy as Dr. Regina Hewitt, a  never-before-wed marriage counselor.  </P> <P> He found the pilot script for the show funny, "and I thought it had some chance  to grow and change and be even funnier and more adult and sophisticated."  </P> <P> He feels unsure about the finished product -- and with some reason.  </P> <P> The opening show has some very funny moments as it explores the infertility  problems of its central characters, marriage counselors who have their own  domestic problems.  </P> <P> At the infertility clinic, when he is given a specimen container, he just  smirks with embarrassment and takes off for a private room saying, "I'll just  go in there and do whatever I'd do if I were in prison."  </P> <P> Mull and Faracy are funny and their chemistry is good, and Blake Soper comes  across as Mull's teen-age boy who gives off the emotional warmth of wallboard.  There also is Fluffy, a white cat who looks as if she inspired Don King's  hairdo.  </P> <P> "I'm not an animal hater," said Mull, who during the first show drops the cat  out the window several times, "but that cat. . . . It would not hit a mark, and  we were down an hour trying to get this thing to stay on a chair. If I was  supposed to have animosity toward that cat -- it was not method acting."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde  has written President Bill Clinton. As a man of exemplary  character and deep understanding, I want you to know that the  Haitian people want peace and well-being and not war and misery.  Monde writes: They reject dictatorship in any form and only  want the kind of true democracy that develops over years within  the framework of their own culture, customs, and history.    He continues: Mr. President, why are so many blacks in the  U.S. Congress so desperate to lead you into military  intervention against a small, poor, defenseless country? They  want victory for the U.S. Government and Armed Forces, yet -- as  Cornet, the French poet, might say -- they remain silent on the  tragedy of hundreds of thousands of their African brothers dying  in Rwanda. Monde asks: Mr. President, did you ever question  their interests and what the Democratic Party has to gain by  you, as the one representing them at the highest leadership  level, making this decision?</p>

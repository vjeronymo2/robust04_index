British  officials are hoping a meeting can be held and an agreement  reached before the end of the month. They also hope the issue  will not be complicated by the Government's tabling of the  remaining part of the 1994/95 electoral bill in the Legislative  Council.    The Chinese State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs  Office was also given an outline of the proposal by the British  Ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren. "The new offer is a  very good one and ought to be acceptable to the Chinese side,"  Mr McLaren said.    Zhang Junsheng, a vice director of the Hong Kong branch of  Xinhua (the New China News Agency), said the Chinese side needed  to study the new offer before making any comment. But Mr Zhang  criticised Governor Chris Patten for saying the new financing  package was an excellent Lunar New Year present. "This is not a  present he gives us. It belongs to Hong Kong. All (we) hope is  just that he will not misspend the money," Mr Zhang said. Mr  Patten yesterday pledged that the Government would not reduce  spending on public projects in order to pay for the airport.    Meanwhile, the Liberals' airport spokesman, Steven Poon  Kwok-lim, said yesterday the party would support the latest  airport financing proposal. Mr Poon said, under the proposal,  the debt-equity ratio would be even lower than their suggested  1:1, much lower than other projects. It is understood that the  Executive Council on Tuesday endorsed the fourth financing  proposal, which will see the Government's injection to the  airport project increase by $15 billion to $60 billion.</p>

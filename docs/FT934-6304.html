			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: HSBC to issue HKDollars 3bn 10-year collared FRN The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the principal subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, is raising HKDollars 3bn (USDollars 388m) through a 10-year 'collared' floating-rate note issue in its first external fundraising since 1986. The notes will pay interest equal to 25 basis points above three-month Hong Kong interbank offered rate, subject to a minimum rate of 7 per cent and a maximum of 9 per cent. Analysts said the terms appeared expensive for a bank of Hongkong Bank's quality in the market but it is understood that Wardley, which is arranging the issue, has developed a mechanism for hedging the 7 per cent to 9 per cent collar which will provide the bank with attractive Hibor-related funding over its life. The bank said the proceeds of the bond issue will be used to develop and expand its business, pointing to planned infrastructure projects, in Hong Kong, such as the building of an airport and the expansion of the colony's container port. The bond is redeemable in six years. Its worth to the bank as capital, however, will diminish when the bond is five years old, when the bank will have to begin to amortise 20 per cent of the bond a year.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Aegis rises to Pounds 14m aided by refinancing Last October's Pounds 60m refinancing package was behind a sharp improvement in interim pre-tax profits at Aegis, the London-based holding company of Europe's largest media-buying and planning group. The pre-tax figure rose from Pounds 9.7m to Pounds 14.2m on flat turnover of Pounds 1.45bn. Interest tumbled from Pounds 11.6m to Pounds 900,000. However, operating profits for the six months to June 30 fell by 27 per cent from Pounds 21.3m to Pounds 15.5m. The fall, which more than offset a reduction in operating costs to Pounds 54.8m (Pounds 59m), reflected a decline of just over Pounds 10m in gross income in France, where a law introduced last year slashed media-buying revenues. Mr Roger Parry, group development director, said the figures had been transformed by the refinancing. 'They reflect no significant improvement in trading, but they do show a significant improvement in the balance sheet.' The shortfall in shareholders' funds improved from Pounds 229m to Pounds 115m. Net debt at the end of the half was down 81 per cent at Pounds 26m (Pounds 137m). However, net cash outflows of about Pounds 30m were expected in the second half, including payment of a Pounds 4.2m fine to the Conseil, or French monopolies commission, for trading practices before the Loi Sapin was introduced last April. This would result in net debt reaching about Pounds 50m at the year end. The group remains extremely cautious over prospects in France. introduced French business produced 27 per cent of turnover and more than 30 per cent of profits. Operating margins overall fell from 5.5 per cent to 4.9 per cent in the period, reflecting the 'cut-throat competition' in both France and Spain. Northern European business was better, particularly in the UK, where turnover rose 30 per cent. Earnings were 1.1p (2.2p). There is no dividend this year. Mr Crispin Davis, formerly with United Distillers, takes over as chief executive next month from Mr Charles Hochman, who is retiring. Shortly afterwards a new finance director will be appointed. COMMENT The benefits of last October's refinancing are clearly shown. Aegis now looks much more financially sound and a raft of new appointments will strengthen management. With operating costs coming down, the company is well poised to take advantage of any improvement in southern Europe once recession ends, although it is being extremely cautious in its forecasts and the pressure on margins is severe. It is continuing to win good new business, so the flatness of the turnover is a little disappointing. Full-year profits of Pounds 28m this year and Pounds 30m for 1995 both translate into unexciting earnings of about 2p since the tax charge will increase.</p>

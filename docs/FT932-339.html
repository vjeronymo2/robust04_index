			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / International Company News: Argentina reaps Dollars 3bn in record oil group sell-off THE Argentine government has sold Dollars 3.04bn of stock in the state oil and gas company YPF in one of the world's largest privatisations. It is the biggest single equity offering from the developing world. With the initial public offering heavily over-subscribed, the government was able to increase the number of shares available from 125m to 160m, or to 45 per cent of the company. The stock was priced at Dollars 19, at the upper end of the previously-announced range of Dollars 17 to Dollars 20. Argentina's success will be seen as proof of its acceptance by international financial markets, and as a vital fillip to its economic reform programme. The government will use the proceeds from the privatisation to pay off debts owed to pensioners, thus giving the ruling party's fortunes a lift in the run-up to October's Congressional elections. Brokers said demand for YPF was especially high in the US, with its original allotment of over Dollars 1bn more than four times over-subscribed. In Argentina, caution turned into enthusiasm as those willing to invest more than Dollars 10,000 reportedly bid more than 10 times their allotment. The privatisation will be concluded when the government sells a second part of the company to employees and pensioners. The sale marks the first time a large Latin America country has given up control of its state oil company, traditionally seen in the region as a symbol of nationalism and self-sufficiency. Mexico and Chile, pioneers of economic reform in Latin America, have held on to their largest state companies, Petroleos Mexicanos and Codelco respectively. The transaction was co-ordinated by CS First Boston and Merrill Lynch.</p>

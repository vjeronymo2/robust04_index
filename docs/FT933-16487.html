			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / SFO raids based on Exchange material: The swapping of information - This week claim, counter-claim and hoax over the Asil Nadir affair competed for attention in parliament and the press. FT reporters look at the latest twists in an increasingly bizarre saga THE SERIOUS Fraud Squad's raids on the offices of Mr Asil Nadir's companies in September 1990 were based on information which the Stock Exchange had gathered over several years, not exclusively from information passed to it by the Inland Revenue. The Stock Exchange yesterday said it was not its policy to comment on individual cases. However, the information is believed to have related to market manipulation involving a group of Swiss nominee companies which had been under suspicion for several years before they were linked to Mr Nadir. The Stock Exchange's interest in Mr Nadir's affairs surfaced publicly on August 17 1990. This was when the exchange's quotations panel announced that it had requested advisers to Mr Nadir's Polly Peck International to explain the circumstances surrounding an attempted management buy-out of the company. It is understood that by this time the exchange's surveillance unit - then called the insider dealing group - had received corroborative information from the Inland Revenue, whose own investigative unit had been looking at Mr Nadir's tax affairs. Stock Exchange officers subsequently met with the SFO and the first of the raids on Mr Nadir's premises was authorised. The exchange said yesterday that it was long-standing practice for it to pass on information to other agencies such as the SFO if it believed a criminal offence had been committed. 'It is not just practice but a statutory duty,' the exchange said. Mr George Staple, the director of the SFO, said yesterday that it had made an informal approach to the Revenue one month after receiving a report from the Stock Exchange, hoping that the 'gateways' allowed for the exchange of information between authorities might apply in the Nadir case. The Revenue had rejected the SFO approach, however. It had explained that in this case the passing of information would have been against the rules. The Revenue stressed yesterday that it could disclose information gathered during its tax investigations to third parties only under 'very, very restrictive circumstances'. Although investigators were permitted to provide some details of their work to other authorities it could be only when there is a direct exchange of information on the taxpayer they are scrutinising. The Revenue said that it would not even permit information on one case to be transferred to another agency in exchange for information on another case. It said any exchanges of information were 'left to the discretion of investigators to decide what is proper', but that these officers were always supervised and anyone overstepping the mark would be 'in real trouble'. The restrictions on disclosing confidential taxpayer information are detailed in the 1989 Finance Act and a series of tax management acts. The only statutory guidelines on exchange of information are with Customs and Excise and the Department of Social Security.</p>

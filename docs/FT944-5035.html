			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Credit demand continues at high level Demand for credit among UK consumers eased slightly in October, although it continued to run at a high level. Official figures yesterday suggested that finance houses took the lion's share of the business. The Central Statistical Office reported that net lending to consumers by finance houses, through unsecured lending from building societies and on bank credit cards under the Visa and Mastercard systems, fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 451m in October from Pounds 479m in September but was well above the Pounds 320m of October last year. After record net lending of Pounds 632m in August, high consumer credit demand in the latest two months ensured that net lending, as measured by the CSO each month, reached a record Pounds 1.56bn in the three months to the end of October. However, yesterday's release saw the last of this 'narrow coverage' of consumer credit business. In future the Bank of England will supply more detailed lending figures, including lending by banks on personal accounts, by insurance companies, retailers and on all bank credit cards and charge cards, each month. Yesterday's figures showed a jump in net lending by finance houses to Pounds 437m in October from Pounds 381m in September, but business failed to reach August's Pounds 486m record. In the three months to the end of October, net lending by finance houses was a record Pounds 1.3bn, up from Pounds 1.02bn in the three months to July. By contrast net lending through bank credit cards in the Visa and Mastercard systems fell to Pounds 14m in October from Pounds 102m in September. Such lending was a net Pounds 241m in the latest three months against Pounds 154m in the previous period. City analysts said the October figures suggested finance houses were gaining market share, probably through providing credit for special deals in the UK car market. Although new car sales have been weak in recent months, the Finance and Leasing Association yesterday reported increased financing of used cars by its members. The increased use of bank credit cards as a means of payment lifted the amount of new credit advanced to consumers to a record Pounds 5.31bn in October from Pounds 5.28bn in September. While new credit advanced on bank credit cards increased to Pounds 3.07bn from Pounds 3.02bn, however, new lending by finance houses fell to Pounds 2.03bn from Pounds 2.04bn. Mr David Hardisty, the association's chairman, said rising credit was not feeding though into higher consumer spending. 'It just means that consumers are spreading their costs,' he said.</p>

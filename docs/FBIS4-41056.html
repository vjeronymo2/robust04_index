			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Pavel Kuznetskov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 22 Jun -- The law on the federal budget for  1994 was not adopted as a whole today by the State Duma. Before  the vote on this issue, Mikhail Zadornov, the chairman of the  Duma's Committee for the Budget, Taxation, Banks, and Finances,  said that all the amendments that had been made to it during the  second reading had been taken into account for the document's  third reading. He noted that these amendments related, in  particular, to increased spending on defense and fundamental  science and also to a 15 percent cut in spending on the  structure of state administration. The deputy stressed that the  document had undergone a final expert legal and linguistic  examination.    After this, Ivan Rybkin, the chairman of the lower house of  the Federal Assembly, informed deputies that the third reading  of this document did not stipulate a debate and he proposed that  they vote on it as a whole. However, only 194 deputies voted  for the 1994 budget, while a total of 225 votes was needed for a  positive outcome.    Deputies then left for a break, just prior to the  announcement of which Rybkin noted that deputies would resume  the debate on the 1994 budget on their return to the hall.</p>

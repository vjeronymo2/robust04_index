			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (31): Shopkeepers suffer a fall in fortunes - Europe's leading companies now face a challenge from US warehouse operators / Sector Analyses - Retailing On the evidence of the FT500, Britain really does appear to be a nation of shopkeepers. Of the 37 retailers in the table, 17 are British, and UK companies fill seven of the top 10 positions in the retail list. Next comes France with nine, Germany with six, Belgium with two, and Spain, Italy and the Netherlands with one each. That gives a slightly misleading impression of the UK's retailing strength. The reason is that several of Europe's biggest retailers, such as Germany's Tengelmann and Metro, are private companies or co-operatives, and so do not appear in the list. Based on turnover rather than market capitalisation, nine of the top 10 European companies are German or French, with only one UK company - J. Sainsbury - sneaking into the table. But the FT500 does accurately reflect the less than sparkling fortunes of many of Europe's top retailers last year, thanks to continuing recession and slow growth in consumer consumption. Some 20 of the 37 have gone down, while only 13 have gone up. The UK's Marks and Spencer, still the highest-placed retailer in the 500, is unchanged at 22. There are, however, three new entries. Highest, at 303, is Pinault-Printemps, the group formed in December 1992 by the merger of France's Pinault and Au Printemps. The UK fashion retailer Next, one of the most successful retailers of the 1980s, has re-entered the list at 445. After over-expanding and over-borrowing by the end of the decade, it is now staging a recovery, having closed some stores and cut costs, and announced in September an almost three-fold increase in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 23m. The third new entrant, at 458, is La Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, and one of the few big players in one of Europe's least-developed retail markets. It has spent L300bn a year for the past four years on expansion, and turnover in its supermarkets and hypermarkets has more than doubled, while sales in its DIY chain have more than trebled. But the main feature of the retailing list is the number of fallers. Five of the 25 biggest fallers in the FT500 are retailers. It is perhaps not surprising that two are UK food retailers. The food retailing sector underperformed the UK stock market by more than 30 per cent in 1993, amid fears that the creeping saturation of the superstore market, the rapid growth of discount retailers - several of them recent entrants from continental Europe such as Germany's Aldi, Denmark's Netto and France's Ed - and the resulting upsurge in price competition, meant the biggest players' profits growth was under threat. It is perhaps more surprising that the two chains should be Kwik Save, the UK's leading discounter, and Wm Morrison Supermarkets, the regional superstore chain voted the UK's top performing company by the Institute of Directors in 1992. Ironically, Kwik Save remains one of the most profitable companies in Europe on a return on capital employed basis, achieving 44.4 per cent. But the retailer's share price has been hit by fears that it may be squeezed between the new generation of discounters and the more price-aggressive superstores, while Morrison's shares declined after disappointing results in September and a warning that pressure on its margins meant profits were unlikely to rise in line with sales over the next year. The UK's three biggest food retailers were all affected. J. Sainsbury fell from 26 to 39, Tesco from 63 to 95, and Argyll from 73 to 114. Other large fallers include Belgium's two biggest retailers, Delhaize and GIB. The latter, which fell from 176 to 327, has suffered from the malaise affecting the Belgian retail sector. That resulted from a significant slowdown in the growth of private consumption in 1993, due to higher taxes on income, energy and stock exchange transactions. The biggest factor in the decline of Delhaize, from 300 to 437, is probably the performance of US subsidiary Food Lion, which accounts for 64 per cent of group earnings. Sales were affected by a highly negative US television documentary, which centred on the problems of food handling and sanitation in the meat area of Food Lion stores. In another recent setback, Food Lion had to pay Dollars 16.2m to the US Department of Labor for violating federal overtime and child labour laws. In addition to its fallers, however, the UK provides the only two retailers in the top 25 biggest risers: Burton, the country's second-largest clothing retailing group, and Asda, the fourth-biggest grocery superstore chain. Both  -like fashion retailer Next - are leading retailers of the 1980s which lost their way at the end of the decade through over-expanding and over-borrowing and are now staging a recovery. Another big riser was France's Castorama Dubois - a newcomer to the FT500 last year. The outlook for European retailers remains tough, however. With powerful discount formats such as warehouse club operator Costco now crossing the Atlantic, and several others likely to follow, European groups may face a significant challenge in their home markets just as they start to pull out of recession.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Leading retailers by market capitalisation  -----------------------------------------------------------------------     Company                           dollarsm   Rank  Sector  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1   Marks and Spencer                  16380.8     22     491 2   Sainsbury J                        11694.0     39     493 3   Great Universal Stores              8482.0     67     493 4   Carrefour                           7696.7     75     493 5   Boots Company                       7601.3     78     492 6   Kingfisher                          6583.8     84     491 7   Tesco                               5906.5     95     493  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 8   Argyll Group                        5035.4    114     493 9   Karstadt                            2840.8    200     491 10  Promodes                            2828.6    201     491 11  Sears                               2575.9    222     492 12  Asda Group                          2553.2    224     493 13  Ahold                               2434.2    230     493 14  Kaufhof                             2345.2    240     491  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 15  Centros Comerciales Pryca           2087.4    264     493 16  Redoute (La)                        1950.2    279     491 17  Smith (WH) Group                  1825.9    297     495 18  Pinault-Printemps                   1798.1    303     491 19  Delhaize                            1653.0    327     492 20  Asko Deutsche Kaufhaus              1647.7    329     491 21  Casino                              1646.9    330     493  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

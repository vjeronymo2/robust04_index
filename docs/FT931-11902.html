			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Broadcast straight to your living-room: the EC AMID plenty of soul-searching, the European Community will today open its doors to television cameras and allow portions of an EC foreign ministers' meeting to be broadcast live to Europe and the US. The exercise is part of the EC's effort to make the Community's business more relevant to the European citizen, but it has caused traditionalists to wonder whether Brussels risks turning into Broadway. 'It's a bit of a circus,' said one senior diplomat shaking his head at the prospect of foreign ministers abandoning behind-closed-doors diplomacy and playing to the gallery back home, at the expense of pressing subjects such as the conflict in Yugoslavia. The Danish presidency of the EC is the driving force behind today's modest experiment in glasnost, the first time television cameras have been allowed to film a meeting of the Council of Ministers in the 35-year history of the Community. The democratically minded Danes argue that too much EC business is wrapped in secrecy, couched in unfathomable bureaucratic language, and too remote from the ordinary EC citizen. By opening up parts of the two-day foreign ministers' session in Brussels, the Danes hope to set a precedent for other ministerial meetings during their six-month presidency. But critics - mainly among such EC founder-members as France, Belgium and Italy - counter that the man on the Clapham omnibus or the woman on the Munich tram will be left no wiser at the end of today's television extravaganza. EC citizens will see (it is hoped) five-minute speeches on the EC's programme delivered by each of the 12 foreign ministers, as well as a set-piece by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president. Also on camera is the ceremonial opening of EC enlargement negotiations with Austria, Finland, and Sweden, as well as the signature of a trade agreement with Romania. None of this is expected to match the intensity of a live congressional interrogation in the US or a raucous House of Commons session; but as a first step toward more transparency in EC business it has attracted the interest of Euronews, DR, the Danish TV network, ARD in Germany, and CNN, the US network, all of which will be present today. Journalists, normally confined to the smoke-ridden ground floor of the Charlemagne building, will be allowed to watch the live segments on closed-circuit television. But once the cameras are ushered out, it will be back to business as usual, well away from the prying eyes of the EC public.</p>

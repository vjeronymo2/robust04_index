			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Businessmen in Ontario dismayed at tax increases BUSINESS leaders in Ontario have expressed dismay at corporate and personal tax increases imposed by the province's social democrat government in a bid to reverse its soaring budget deficit. The New Democratic party's latest provincial budget includes a new minimum corporate tax, a broadening of the provincial sales tax, and steep increases in personal tax rates focused on middle and high income earners. The top marginal personal tax rate, combining federal and provincial taxes, will climb from 49.8 per cent to 52.4 per cent. The average family's tax burden will increase by CDollars 40-CDollars 80 (Pounds 20-Pounds 40) a month. Ontario accounts for about 40 per cent of Canada's GDP. A steep rise in its budget deficit in recent years has made it the biggest non-sovereign borrower on international capital markets. The province borrowed CDollars 15bn last year, and expects to raise another CDollars 10bn-CDollars 11bn in the current fiscal year. This will bring total debt to CDollars 79bn - double that four years ago. Mr Floyd Laughren, provincial treasurer, said he aims to bring down the budget deficit to CDollars 9.2bn in the year to March 31 1994, from CDollars 12bn in 1992-93. Besides the tax increases, he announced a 4.3 per cent cut in government operational spending. The government is also in the throes of acrimonious talks with public sector trade unions over a 'social contract' designed to cut CDollars 2bn a year from its wage bill. Burns Fry, a Toronto-based securities firm, yesterday cut its forecast of Ontario's 1994 growth rate to 3.3 per cent from 4.2 per cent, to reflect the expected impact of the tax increases on consumer spending. It also warned that borrowing requirements may be higher than expected.</p>

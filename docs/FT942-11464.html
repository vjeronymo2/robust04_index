			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Profits at Canadian Pacific disappoint Canadian Pacific, the rail, shipping, energy and industrial holding group, has reported net profit of CDollars 17.2m (USDollars 12.5m), or 5 cents a share, for the first quarter, down from CDollars 21.7m, or 7 cents, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 1.6bn against CDollars 1.47bn, with the decline due mainly to disposals. The 1994 results were lower than most analysts had expected. Contributions from many subsidiaries, including the rail system, were adversely affected by severe winter weather in January and February. Also, the first-quarter results were struck after special items. Canadian Pacific is now focused on rail, shipping and oil and gas, plus its investments in hotels, property, telecommunications and in Laidlaw, the waste management group. Operating income was CDollars 224m, up CDollars 71m from a year earlier. Mr William Stinson, president, told the annual meeting in Calgary that CP Rail recovered momentum in March, and that its operating income was CDollars 77.5m against CDollars 44.7m. CP Ships, PanCanadian Petroleum and Fording Coal all turned in solid performances. PanCanadian and Fording face lower world prices for the rest of 1994, but have the capacity to do well despite this. Telecommunications would continue to build market share, but profits will be elusive. Mr Stinson said the biggest challenge was to continue reducing costs at CP Rail. 'Its results must be brought in line with those of the best US railroads, with whom it competes,' he said. 'This is possible, given traffic growth potential, productivity gains and improved market share.' CP Rail and Canadian National Railways have been discussing rationalisation of their eastern networks.</p>

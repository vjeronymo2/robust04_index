			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The Telegraph The timing of The Telegraph's red herring prospectus had a certain piquancy, coming as it did just one day after the launch of an official investigation into last year's big newspaper flotation, that of the Mirror Group. There are many differences between Mr Conrad Black and Mr Robert Maxwell, the most important being Mr Black's unblemished reputation. In today's market, however, the sale of a minority stake in a national newspaper by a heavily indebted owner with a record of moving assets and liabilities from one part of his empire to another is bound to carry a discount. Then again, the shadow of Mr Maxwell is perhaps the best reason for supposing the flotation will prove attractive. The prospectus bulges with the great and good: a viscount, five lords and three knights among the non-executive directors, with Cazenove and Rothschild as advisers. The safeguards for minority shareholders and pensioners are set out in detail. And if Mr Black were ever tempted to pitch the price high, fellow-directors such as the chairman of Rothschild, the managing director of Hambros and the deputy chairman of Barclays would doubtless remind him that making a fast buck out of Telegraph readers would hardly promote its long-term image as a stock. The argument over price may hang chiefly on whether the valuation should be on the basis of yield or earnings. The former is suggested by a circulation figure almost unchanged since 1947, the latter by the cyclical nature of advertising revenue. Splitting the difference between a market yield and a market p/e points to a price somewhere around 310p.</p>

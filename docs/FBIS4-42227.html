			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rainer Hank: "Respectable, Firmly Rooted, Crisis </F> Hardened--the Candidate for the DGB Chairmanship--Nobody Doubts  Schulte's Election Any More"]    [Text] Frankfurt, 17 May--Officially, Dieter Schulte is  only the Metal Workers Union candidate at this point.  Officially, Hermann Rappe, the head of the Chemical Workers  Union, will still be collecting proposals until Whitsun and then  present Heinz-Werner Meyer's successor to the public. And the  official vote for the new chairman of the German Trade Union  Federatiom [DGB] will not take place until 14 June in Berlin.    The fact, however, is that no one today doubts that Dieter  Schulte will be elected DGB chairman--not even Bruno Koebele,  who heads the Construction Workers Union, the fourth largest  union in terms of membership. Though he grumbled about the  "scarcely democratic" nominating process, Koebele hastily added  that Schulte is an honorable man and that his union, too, would  support his candidacy. Objections were also raised today by  Detlef Hensche, the chairman of the Media Employees Union, who  some days ago had touted Franz-Josef Moellenberg, the head of  the Food and Restaurant Workers Union, calling him a "left-wing  pragmatist." The media employees delegate votes, however, do not  carry much weight, and Hensche himself is something of a DGB  outsider.    Many of the small and mid-sized unions are grumbling now  because it has been customary to yield the chairmanship of the  DGB to one of their own to ride herd on the high and mighty.  Heinz-Werner Meyer came from the Miners Union; Ernst Breit, his  predecessor, came from the postal workers. To be sure, the metal  workers who had not elected a chairman since Hans Boeckler, the  legendary labor leader of the postwar era, had let it be known  four years ago that it was their turn again.    Schulte, who is not too well known even inside union  circles,  is holding back for the time being. He will not be making any  statements regarding himself or his program until after the  Whitsun holidays. Metal workers leader Zwickel protested all the  more loudly today as he tried to dispel any suspicion that the  metal workers' proposal was based on an arrogance of power.  Critics who voiced this suspicion had added that the metal  workers were trying to turn their defensive bargaining tactics  or their defeat in wage negotiations into an organizational  victory which did not cost much. Zwickel turned this argument  around by saying that the metal workers' strong commitment to  the DGB was proof of the fact that his union was willing to do  its duty. Schulte's election, he said, would turn the DGB into  an "effective and universally respected employee organization"  once again, adding in a poetic vein that "a strong tree must  have strong roots if it is to grow."    Schulte is not only familiar with Duesseldorf and the Ruhr  area; he also represents employee interests on the EU [European  Union] Coal and Steel Commission. Where a market such as the  steel market is concerned whose quotas are allocated and  regulated by Brussels, the Belgian capital is by no means of  secondary importance. As a member of the administrative  committee of the Trust Agency, Schulte is also familiar with  eastern Germany. That is where Rappe got to know Schulte. The  two hold each other in esteem as pragmatists. Thus it is quite  likely that not only the metal workers but Rappe himself voiced  strong support for Schulte. There are those who object to  Schulte's selection, saying that he does not represent a growth  industry. But his supporters counter this argument by noting  that the ecology movement and the Eisenhuettenstadt experience  to the contrary, notwithstanding Germany, will continue to be a  major steel producer which will be forced to modernize in the  face of international competition.    In view of the fact that the metal workers have now come out  in Schulte's favor, that the chemical workers support him, and  that the public service employees have somewhat grudgingly  refrained from raising any objections, the majorities at the DGB  congress are assured, since the 600 delegates include 179  members of the Metal Workers Union, 110 of the public service  employees, and 46 of the chemical workers. That already  represents a majority--which is the very thing construction  workers chief Koebele feels is undemocratic. He has been arguing  for a long time that the 16 member unions of the DGB should have  the same number of votes regardless of their numerical strength.  But he stands alone in making this proposal; his critics contend  that this would amount to a return to the old guild system and,  what is more, that his union would then be constrained to pay as  much money into the DGB treasury as the metal workers.    Rappe informed the other candidates today that they no  longer  stand a chance. The only serious contenders who announced their  candidacy were chariman Arens of the textile workers and Frau  Engelen-Kefer, the deputy chairperson of the DGB. Engelen-Kefer  was said to have taken the news "calmly." She probably  overestimated her chances. Some days ago metal workers chief  Zwickel already commented on them less than enthusiastically by  saying "ah well."</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Survey of Global Custody (12): Focus shifts to hidden costs  -Unbundling For years, fund managers quietly made a tidy little business out of handling the custodial arrangements for the pension funds whose assets they invested. Then, one day, along came the Robert Maxwell pensions scandal, and all those cosy contractual arrangements were held up for scrutiny in the broad light of day. In particular, regulators and pension fund trustees wanted to know, is it safe to entrust your assets to the custodian who is also responsible for investing them. After all, it was partly because Mr Maxwell's fund management company also controlled the custodian that more than Pounds 400m in pension fund assets was extracted with such ease. To the relief of many fund managers, the government's advisory panel on occupational pension fund safety, headed by Professor Roy Goode, decided that there was nothing inherently unsafe about a fund manager using its own custodian for client funds. However, the debate has focused attention of trustees on their custodian arrangements and what they pay for them, opening the door for the unbundling of custody services. Earlier this year, the National Association of Pension Funds, in a landmark study on fee transparency, highlighted custody as one of the areas where trustees were in the dark about exactly how much they were paying for the service. And not for nothing. Mercury Asset Management, in a posture which is typical in the fund management industry, insists that its fund management fee is inclusive of custodial services. Those clients wishing to place their custodial arrangements externally will find themselves paying more for fund management. Mr Gordon Lindsey, head of custody services at S G Warburg, 75 per cent owner of MAM, says that is because the company uses a single data base for its fund management and custody arrangements. A requirement to send instructions to an independent custodian would increase costs and the customer would have to pay accordingly. Nevertheless, there is growing demand among clients for unbundling of custodial services; not just separating it from that of the fund management but for the outplacement of such services as foreign exchange, cash management and securities lending which have traditionally allowed custodians to earn a handsome return on a client's portfolio. 'Unbundling is a trend driven by best practice,' said Mr Robert Binney, business executive at Chase Manhattan's global securities services division, who notes that the trend has been under way in the US for several years. 'European custodians see this as a bit of a shock. They are losing tied business,' he said. Mr James Economides, global product manager for Citibank's global custody operations, says that clients are showing growing sophistication in selecting service providers. 'Clients are becoming more aware of spreads on things such as foreign exchange and cash balances,' he said. 'For the big ticket items, clients are likely to look to do that away from us.' That trend means that custodians are having to re-think their pricing structure which undercuts the cost of the core master custody business on the assumption that profitability will be made up by the 'turn' earned on provision of other services. At Morgan Stanley, the inclination of some clients to do forex and cash management business away from the custodian is likely to lead to alterations in the basic fee, said Mr Ross Whitehill, vice-president of European global custody operations. It has not, however, prompted the bank to try to require custody clients to do all their business with Morgan Stanley. That, Mr Whitehill argues, would be counter-productive. And indeed, pension fund clients say, the US global custodian banks are leading the way in the unbundling of their services. Mr Brian Matthews, finance director of ESN Pension Management, which manages the Pounds 12.5bn in assets of the privatised electricity companies, has been strenuously urging the unbundling of custody services. For some years, ESN itself has pursued such a policy. 'You appoint a custodian and you appoint a fund manager on the basis that you need to have clarity of responsibility and clarity of cost.' The custodians, he says, 'are right to say that they can give you added value. But they are not always entirely open about the fee structure.' For instance, clients may not always be clear on the way fees earned on stock lending are split between the custodian and themselves, with the split ranging typically from 75 per cent in the client's favour to as little as 40 per cent. The difference, over the course of a year, can mean a significant amount of income lost to the client. Also, many custodians offer interest only on balances above a minimum level. When a host of small accounts are aggregated under the control of the custodian, the interest generates some significant degree of income which clients may not readily understand is income they have foregone. In effect, the custodian's failure to pay interest on all balances represents a hidden payment by the client although it may not be readily seen that way. Moreover, some custodians arrange to perform services for clients that the client is easily suited to perform more cheaply for himself. Mr Matthews says that ESN, for instance, performs its own tax reclaim service and can achieve full tax refunds within 72 hours. Of course, such exercises are only worthwhile for the largest pension schemes but even then, surprisingly few have investigated the matter. But longer term, Mr Matthews said, unbundling is going to be a fact of life in European custody markets. The willingness of the US global custodians to unbundle fees and services will force even the most recalcitrant European providers down that route as well. 'The American global custodians will simply not go away,' Mr Matthews said.</p>

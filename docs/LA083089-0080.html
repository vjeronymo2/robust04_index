			<p><P> August 30, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWN'S LEADERS TRY TO EASE TENSIONS AFTER SHOOTING  </P> <P> Community leaders worked the streets Tuesday to defuse racial tensions that led  to the arrest of 30 black and Latino youths in a rock-throwing protest over a  white police officer's killing of a black suspected drug dealer.  </P> <P> The dead man's mother appealed for calm.  </P> <P> "I don't want nobody else's child to get hurt. I just want the kids to stay in  their houses," Lucille Williams said outside her home. "I know my son is not an  angel but I still think he should have had a chance just like everybody else."  </P> <P> Samuel C. Williams, 26, was shot Sunday while swinging an iron reinforcing bar  at a policeman. Officer Paul Letizia, a seven-year veteran, was trying to  arrest Williams on warrants for assault, weapons violations, contempt of court  and parole violations, police said.  </P> <P> Mayor Harry Curley announced at a news conference that there would be added  police patrols, but he denied there was a racial problem in the city of 54,000.  </P> <P> "I am not aware of any racial tension in Vineland," Curley said. "This is the  first time a police officer killed a suspect."  </P> <P> Authorities also set up telephone hot lines to combat rumors of additional  violence and promised that a grand jury would be asked to decide if the  shooting was justified.  </P> <P> An attorney for the state Division of Civil Rights met with Curley and minority  leaders to thwart a repeat of Tuesday's early morning violence and looting. But  tensions still seethed on the streets of Vineland.  </P> <P> "A white cop shot a black guy. It wasn't fair," said James Santalia, 14, as  merchants along the city's main street cleaned up display windows broken in the  violence.  </P></p>

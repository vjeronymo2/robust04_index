			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Asia-Pacific sees capital shortfall CAPITAL markets in the Asia-Pacific region are largely underdeveloped, volatile and ill-suited to financing the likely demands for capital in the region in the years ahead. These are the findings of a survey of more than 500 capital markets experts in the Far East, Europe and the US, undertaken by Arthur Andersen, the accounting and consulting group. Despite high domestic savings rates in most of the countries in the region, nearly 70 per cent of those surveyed expect a capital shortage in the region later in the decade. Extensive development of Asian capital markets will be needed to avoid such a problem, the study concludes. Respondents to the survey, who included capital markets practitioners, government officials and academics, pointed to the volatile nature of securities markets in the region as a cause of concern. The problems are exacerbated by the partial withdrawal by Japanese banks, which in the 1980s had provided large volumes of cheap capital to borrowers in some other Asian countries. The study found: The equity markets are expected to remain the dominant capital markets in the region, due to the high economic growth rates expected in the years ahead. The 'boom-and-bust' cycle in Japan and, to a lesser extent, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia and Thailand, will change as investors look more at fundamental value and as institutional investment develops, Andersen concludes. The result is likely to be a big increase in the demand for asset management. UK fund managers, through their historical connections with Hong Kong, have been the fastest to develop business in the region, but investors from elsewhere in Europe, and eventually the US, will also become important investors. Corporate bond markets remain underdeveloped, with the exception of Australia and the efforts being made to open up the market in Malaysia. The demand for stable long-term funds is likely to lead to greater use of fixed-income finance. Undeveloped government bond markets make the growth of corporate bond markets more difficult. In some countries, such as Taiwan, government borrowing plans are so great they are likely to squeeze private sector borrowers out of the markets.

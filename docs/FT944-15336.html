			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / Dairy industry warned of threat to investment Northern Foods, one of the UK's biggest dairy groups, yesterday said the sharp rise in milk prices that will accompany the market's deregulation next month could drive investment out of Britain. Mr Neil Davidson, group executive responsible for milk buying, said: 'The processing industry will be leaner, fitter and more focused. It may also be somewhere else.' Mr Davidson told a dairy industry conference in London organised by Agra Europe, the business information company, that domestic and foreign investment in new technology and capacity had been thrown into doubt by deregulation. This was because of the price rises being introduced by Milk Marque, the independent farmers' co-operative that will succeed the Milk Marketing Board, and because of possible challenges to Milk Marque by the competition authorities. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents milk processors, is considering a formal complaint to the European Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, claiming that Milk Marque's selling system is an abuse of its monopoly position. Milk Marque controls at least 65 per cent of supplies in England and Wales. Mr Davidson said this made it the biggest milk selling organisation in Europe. He criticised the government, saying its original plan to improve UK dairy competitiveness in Europe 'has been diluted to the achievement of a crude political objective of abolishing the Milk Marketing Board while protecting the farmer vote'. However, Mr Andrew Dare, the board's chief executive, will today deny that prices will rise excessively, saying: 'I object to Milk Marque being made a scapegoat.' He will tell the conference that dairy companies have agreed to pay less than 0.3p per pint more for fresh milk, not 3p as some claim, and that the price of milk for Cheddar cheese will increase by 13p a pound, not 50p. The milk board has still not received written loan agreements from its banks, creating further uncertainty about liberalisation on November 1. It said yesterday that the loans, which it needs to establish Milk Marque, should be finalised in the next two days.</p>

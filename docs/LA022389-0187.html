			<p><P> February 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> 5-A;  </P> <P> CAPISTRANO VALLEY STOPS MORENO VALLEY  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley High School added insult to injury in a 72-55 victory over  Moreno Valley in a Southern Section 5-A quarterfinal boys' basketball game  Wednesday at Saddleback College.  </P> <P> Chopin Scott, the Vikings' guard who was averaging 19 points a game, was  feeling the effects of a car accident Sunday that left him with a split right  eyelid, bruised ribs and minus two teeth.  </P> <P> Add Andy Bosma's stingy defense against Scott and the Cougars (22-4) easily  breezed by the Vikings (19-7) to set up a semifinal game Friday against against  Buena. The site will be determined in a coin flip today.  </P> <P> "Bosma played a hell of a game on Chopin Scott," Capistrano Valley Coach Mark  Thornton said. "We wanted to put Bosma him, deny him the ball and contain him."  </P> <P> The Cougars did that, limiting Scott to nine points and three rebounds before  he fouled out with 29 seconds left in the game.  </P> <P> Capistrano Valley's star forward, Scott McCorkle, scored 27 points, including  20 points in the second half. He also grabbed nine rebounds.  </P> <P> "He's been in a slump lately," Thornton said. "He hit a couple of big  three-pointers that put us ahead for good."  </P> <P> That was late in the third quarter, when the Cougars held a 40-34 lead before  McCorkle sank two consecutive three-pointers and the Vikings never closer.  </P> <P> But the game was much tighter through the first half. Moreno Valley fell behind  early, but found its fast break and took control of the boards to tie the  score, 26-26, at halftime.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Osamu Kubotani and Masato Ono, senior </F> researchers of Nissei Research Institute: "New Businesses Plug  Up Deindustrialization"]    [Text] Changing Social Needs  How is the Japanese industrial structure transforming  amidst the worst deflationary recession since the war? The  authors assert that new businesses, which up to now had been  jeered as "gap industries," have acquired citizenship as the  pulling force of industry amidst the clear appearance of a shift  in individual demand which has been an undercurrent for a long  time.  <H5>  Strong Individual Consumption </H5>   Debate over the structural conversion has risen like the  contention of a hundred schools of thought, but those which do  not fully grasp reality are found here and there. If you try to  get hold of the industrial structure by numbers, a structural  conversion is already proceeding steadily right before you.    It is a somewhat paradoxical way of saying it, but the  current industrial structure is again returning to a long-term  trend. The changes in the period of the bubble economy were  rather dissociated from the trends of Japanese industry. Viewing  the margin of the dissociation from the average for industry  overall in sales increase rates (over the previous year) in the  various materials, machinery, and individual consumption-related  sectors, the materials-related as a trend fell about 4 to 5  percent below increases in sales for industry as a whole with  repeated fluctuations due to economic fluctuations (including  price revolution due to the oil shocks and high yen). Even  viewing the average for some past 10 years in the  machinery-related, it has been on about the same level as the  increase in the average for industry overall. On the other hand,  growth in the individual consumption-related sector (food,  retail sales, business services, and other services) greatly  exceeds the others.    For several years in the bubble economy period, this  individual consumption-related sector fell below the materials  and machinery sectors and was dissociated from the long-term  trend, but later, in the three-year period from 1991 to the  present, it has been found to be returning again to the trend.    This change in the sales by industry is due to long-term  structural adjustments in the so-called key industries. It is  generated by most economic recession situations, and there have  been great adjustments in business sectors in this recession  also. However, these adjustments have been much more prolonged  than before, and there is a strong possibility that sales in key  industry will be stagnant over a long period.    One of the reasons is that the profit level is very low.  Considered from the rulings on ROE (rate of return on equity)  and interest, an ROE on the level of 6 to 7 percent is necessary  for stockholders. According to the calculations of our research  institute, an ordinary profit corresponding to about 2.2 times  fiscal 1993 (estimate only) in the listed manufacturing industry  average must be secured in order to obtain this ROE. Even if  sales in fiscal 1994 and thereafter take a steady pattern of  growth at an annual rate of 3 percent, it will not achieve it  until fiscal 1997, and the growth of business will decline  greatly because of the need for reduced management.    Deflation is another cause. There has been a price decrease  in unit sales prices for capital and production goods for a long  period, and a price revolution is proceeding. As a result, a  great dissociation has occurred between sales in the materials  and machinery sectors and the unit sales price in the individual  consumption-related sector mentioned earlier, causing a  disparity in sales. Of course, this does not represent  substantial scale or value added, but it is steadily changing  the sales of industry overall.    Already, such structural change is clearly proceeding in the  finance aspect as well. Table 1 is the loan growth rate by  industrial category for banks nationwide. Bank loan growth has  been largely dull for the past two or three years; however,  unlike the bubble era, loans for the service industry and  individuals have been firm in tone, and the growth in the loan  balance for both amounts to over 70 percent of the whole.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

Since that is the case, regardless of a tight  purse, demand related to consumption by individuals that are  tops in the world in income level, will have to have a role in  supporting economic growth in both market volume and growth  stability. Actual numbers also suggest that.  <H5>  New Business Ground </H5>   Already, the industry group that centers on fields related  to  individual consumption has formed a big market in the United  States. In Japan, too, a considerable number of businesses which  have scouted for new business chances under the recent  recessionary situation exist and still are continuing growth.    There are 54 companies among the listed companies that have  achieved increased revenue and profits for four consecutive  terms, including fiscal 1993 estimates. The majority of these  businesses are businesses that have succeeded with a consumption  service model closely adhered to life, requisites such as food  or medicine, or unique knowhow or strategy. The products or  services that they provide often are seen as those which add to  the pursuit of "convenience" and contribute to "comfort."    Particularly in the individual living field, food-related  (retort foods, food supermarkets), fixed services accompanying  changes in lifestyle (convenience stores, family game software,  credit cards), business conditions pursuing low prices (suburban  men's clothing stores), and medical product-related businesses  stand out. Moreover, one characteristic is the growth of  security and environment-related businesses.    On the other hand, viewing the number of new open businesses  since fiscal 1991, while service, distribution, and the  transport-related have reached close to 50 percent of the whole,  the manufacturing industry percentage is no more than a little  over 30 percent. Particularly when comparing fiscal 1991 and  1992 and thereafter, the service industry, including finance,  rapidly increased from 20.3 percent to 29.2 percent while the  manufacturing industry share dropped from 38.1 percent to 31.0  percent.    Among the newly opened businesses, businesses which have 1)  new services for the individual, 2) low prices, 3) new ideas and  4) new technology as sales items especially are noted. They are  discounters, low price dining-out chains (pubs, buckwheat  noodles, gyoza [pot-stickers]), take-out chains (lunches,  sushi), various types of information services, game software,  and mobile communications-related businesses. These businesses  are, so to speak, businesses which have broken previous  established concepts and boldly made a challenge in new fields.  It is believed that the impact of this "new business group" will  increase year by year in the future also.    In retrospect, among the industries that currently have  built  a stable position, for example, the volume sales stores that  appeared as a price-breaking business situation in the 1970's  and 1980's, or the dining-out industry where new soft service  has succeeded, roadside shops, convenience stores, home  delivery, and family game software, etc., were truly small new  businesses when they appeared. In other words, the group of  businesses which are growing in the current recessionary  situation give a hint for finding the new growth fields of Japan  in the future, and we are now in our infancy.    Industries which have advanced into territories that cannot  be covered by the major industries already established in Japan  and fields where new consumer needs or ideas have been made into  a business and there is no existing industry have come to be  treated by the somewhat jeering expression of "niche industries"  or "gap industries." However, the success of home deliveries,  family game software, convenience stores, and take-out lunch  chains exceeds a mere "gap." The new industry fields which are  now suddenly rising to power should be valued positively as  "tomorrow's industries group" that will actually shoulder the  next-generation industries, and we have been rather slow in  acknowledging their true worth.    The largest bases which produce these new businesses are the  "emphasis on individual life" and "changes of the social  environment." If the basic framework which supported the  development of Japanese industry has been for "the realization  of material, affluent life" domestically and "export promotion"  externally for acquisition of foreign currency, it is the social  needs of "aging," "health orientation," "spiritual affluence,"  and "life emphasis" which will support the businesses of the  future, and it would be no exaggeration to say that it depends  on promoting a domestic demand type of business territory.    Even in the United States, the fast growing businesses in  recent years have been concentrated in fields such as medical  care, information communications, and distribution, reflecting  changes of the industrial structure. Like the United States,  where while hollowing out of the manufacturing industry was  proceeding, computer software and entertainment industries made  inroads in the world market and established their position, it  is clear that the replacement of growth fields due to industrial  structural changes has been steadily proceeding in Japan also.  The most important point would be how the businesses will "break  groud" and "develop into business" out of territories where  growth is anticipated. In other words, there is a strong  possibility that the future will be clearly defined by  differences in strategy by individual businesses rather than  specific industrial fields like before.  <H5>  Industrial Groups of Tomorrow </H5>   Bearing in mind the fields which have been producing new  growth businesses and separating them into categories where a  high possibility of growth is anticipated in the future, they  can generally be divided into the following six: "living-related  businesses," "information communications new product fields,"  aging and health businesses," "time consumption, comfort, and  affluence businesses," "environment-related businesses," and  "low price pursuit businesses."    These new businesses are already forming large markets, in  some fields. Just in fields where it is possible to grasp or  estimate market scale, it has now reached a scale of 49 trillion  yen. Furthermore, to estimate the future market based on the  growth rate for the past several years and taking the  possibility of future market expansion into consideration, the  market is expected to expand to a total amount of roughly 89  trillion yen in 2000, including 35 trillion yen for living and  individual service-related as well as 20 trillion yen for the  time consumption and comfort field, and the percentage occupied  in Japan's industrial sector will rise by leaps and bounds.

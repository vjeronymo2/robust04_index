What President Boris Yeltsin and  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev have said is "potentially  imperialistic," said CDU foreign policy spokesman Karl Lamers on  6 January. He called upon the West, and above all Germany, "to  show" Russia that one could not only be a partner, but "also an  opponent."    Lamers accused Yeltsin and Kozyrev of exerting political and  economic pressure on Russia's neighbor states and of using its  armed forces for "intimidation" in some cases, such as the  Baltics and the Caucasus. Moscow was only interested in  "ensuring maximum influence," said Lamers. To prevent the West  from extending NATO to the Russian border, the Russian  leadership was using "the West's concerns" about a new Russian  imperialism "as an instrument," said Lamers a few days prior to  the NATO summit in Brussels on 10 January, which will discuss a  possible opening up of the alliance to the East.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> U.S. Employment Outlook Dims: Fewer U.S. companies plan to increase hiring in  the final quarter of 1989 than the previous year, largely because of softness  in the Northeast, a survey of U.S. firms has found. The survey, conducted by  temporary employment agency Manpower Inc., found that 26% of nearly 14,000  employers questioned by telephone planned to increase hiring from October  through December, down from 28% in 1988. Companies in the Northeast had the  least ambitious hiring plans, with 22% saying they would add to their staff, a  seven-year low, compared to 27% last year.  </P></p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Leading Article: Strife in Mexico The new-year rebellion in southern Mexico has subsided for the moment, but the aftershocks will reverberate beyond presidential elections due in August. Unless Mexican leaders reach the right conclusions about their authoritarian political system, the remarkable economic progress they have made in recent years will be in jeopardy. It is no accident that the peasant uprising occurred in the state of Chiapas, Mexico's most oppressed and impoverished corner where the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party regularly polls 90 per cent of electoral votes. The events are a reminder that much of Mexico is decades away from the image of a modern society that President Carlos Salinas cultivated as part of his campaign to secure the North American Free Trade Agreement. They underline that many Mexicans have been left behind by his economic reform programme and remain deeply suspicious of it. Mr Salinas must take his share of responsibility for the crisis. He ignored indications of impending insurgency, apparently fearful of drawing attention to an issue that could have affected the Nafta vote last November in the US. He tolerated one of the most autocratic state governments in Mexico, which repressed, sometimes brutally, even peaceful opposition. It was he who a year ago promoted the previous governor - the hard-line Mr Patrocinio Gonzalez Garrido - to head the country's interior ministry. The president has now sacked Mr Gonzalez Garrido. His initial response - to suppress the uprising by military force - has given way to a more conciliatory approach, encouraged perhaps by the international scrutiny that has followed his attempt to integrate Mexico into the world economy. But Mr Salinas and his designated candidate for the presidential elections, Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, need to draw more fundamental lessons from the uprising. The conditions that led to the crisis in Chiapas are to a greater or lesser extent present in the rest of Mexico. Whatever Mr Salinas's successes in economic reform, much of Mexico's public administration remains arrogant, corrupt and unresponsive to popular needs. What is more, Mexicans have few rights of redress against the excesses of government, the police or the military: the legal system is arbitrary, inefficient and under the government's thumb. Mr Salinas has tried to draw a tidy line between economic and political reform: he has embraced the former and tried to fend off the latter. But Chiapas shows economic development in Latin America cannot be superimposed on to a political system which in some ways verges on the feudal. International investors - central to Mexico's development - avoid countries riven by social strife. Mexico's authoritarian approach no longer supports the necessary task of modernising Mexico's economy - if it ever did. It has weakened the process and deprived it of legitimacy. Surprisingly, Mr Colosio, the presidential candidate, has given no indication of his views on the current crisis. He has spoken in the past about decentralising government, but - given what Chiapas indicates about the quality of Mexico's regional governments - that raises more questions than it answers. He needs to give a lead now, one that points Mexico firmly towards true democracy and respect for the rule of law. Without such an initiative, the spectre of social upheaval will continue to threaten Mr Salinas's bold attempt to modernise his country.</p>

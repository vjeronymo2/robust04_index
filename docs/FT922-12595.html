			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Major will focus on housing, schools andinner cities MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday set housing, education and inner cities as priority areas for the first legislative session of the new parliament as he continued his wide-ranging ministerial reshuffle. As the Labour party's deputy leadership race expanded into a four-candidate contest which threatens to exacerbate its internal divisions, the new cabinet met for the first time since the election. It started work on a parliamentary programme that will last until the autumn of 1993. The programme is almost certain to include a housing bill, incorporating 'rights to improve', giving compensation to council tenants improving their homes, and 'rents to mortgages' schemes which will allow council tenants to take a part share in their homes. 'Commonhold' legislation would also give residential leaseholders in blocks of flats the right to acquire the freehold of the block at the market rate. Mr Michael Howard, the new environment secretary, is also pushing for legislation on inner cities, possibly to establish an Urban Regeneration Agency to develop derelict land in inner cities. The prime minister wants an emphasis on his Citizen's Charter proposals and on education in the next parliament but legislative proposals have yet to be agreed. Other measures in the next parliament will be bills which failed to complete their parliamentary stages before the election. They include an asylum bill to tighten immigration procedures and a new finance bill. Mr David Mellor, the new national heritage secretary, will unveil legislation for a national lottery. Also in the programme will be a short bill allowing the government to start working with private sector advisers on the privatisation of British Rail - although the form of the sell-off has still to be decided. Mr Major shuffled the whips department last night. He appointed Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, the former junior energy minister, as deputy chief whip. Earlier Mr Major announced moves of senior civil servants which spread former Treasury mandarins still further across Whitehall - including to the most senior job at the new national heritage department. He has also appointed a new principal private secretary at Downing Street and replaced the soon-to-retire Sir Percy Cradock as foreign affairs adviser by Sir Rodric Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador in Moscow. Meanwhile the race for Labour's deputy leadership was joined last night by Mrs Margaret Beckett, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, and Mrs Ann Clwyd, overseas development spokesman. Mr John Prescott, transport spokesman, and Mr Bryan Gould are also candidates. Mrs Beckett appears the favourite to win as deputy leader, along with Mr John Smith, who is running for the leadership.

The vote of confidence was  revealed in a communique issued here Tuesday [25 January] on the  outcome of an emergency meeting of CD's National Coordination  Council, held at the weekend in Lagos.    Last Tuesday, CD secretary-general Chima Ubani accused  chairman Beko Ransome-Kuti of "collaborating" with the military  and "compromising" the CD, the umbrella group for pro-democracy  and human rights associations in Nigeria. Ransome-Kuti has  denied the charges.    A two-day national convention of the CD is scheduled to  begin  February 4, during which issues related to the association's  internal problems as well as its future approach to national  matters are expected to be discussed.</p>

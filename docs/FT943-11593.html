			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / People: Wilkinson is to be new managing director at Laird Group Geoffrey Wilkinson, 48, has been appointed managing director of the Laird group, the vehicle components manufacturer, with effect from October, after having joined the company in June 1993 as finance director. His replacement as finance director will be Jonathan Silver, 36, currently corporate development manager. The moves follow on the announcement in April that the current chairman and chief executive, John Gardiner, would become chairman solely, and that the current managing director, Ian Arnott, 51, would be stepping into the role of chief executive. Gardiner will retire from the chief executive role on October 1, when the other changes take effect. Laird is by no means an unfamiliar company to Wilkinson - he first became acquainted with the group when he worked for the Industrial Re-organisation Corporation more than 20 years ago. Wilkinson has been (successively) a former chief economist, financial controller, and ultimately head of corporate mergers, investments and divestments at British Steel. He left British Steel in 1987 and spent several years with US investment bank Dillon Read. In October 1991 he and David Prior established a partnership, for a time working for Garry Klesch, who put up the equity for a series of steel service sector buy-ins. Silver, a chartered accountant, first worked for Thornton Baker before joining Fisons, then moving on to Laird in 1986 as group management accountant. More than 80 per cent of Laird's profits derive from overseas markets. Its last annual results showed pre-tax profits of Pounds 38.2m.</p>

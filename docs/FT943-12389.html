			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Belgium avoids harsh measures Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, yesterday announced a relatively palatable budget for next year, which included no significant tax increases nor large cuts in public spending. Higher than expected growth this year, plus revenue from privatisations, meant that Mr Dehaene was able to present a package that he said would not take the budget deficit above 4.3 per cent of GDP, the target for next year. Last year the budget deficit was 7.2 per cent of GDP and this year it should fall to 5.7 per cent. The long-term aim is to reduce the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for monetary union by the end of 1996. The government considers that measures taken in its austerity Global Plan last November were sufficient to keep the budget deficit under control. These reined in spending on social security and froze wages in real terms for three years. The plan prompted considerable social unrest. Next year's fairly soft budget, however, seems to have been framed with October's local elections in mind. The budget was drawn up on the basis of estimated GDP growth of 1.7 per cent this year rising to 2.6 per cent in 1995.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 18 KYODO -- Eijiro Hata, minister of  international trade and industry, Wednesday [18 May] took a  cautious stance on possible implementation of measures to  safeguard textile imports.    The MITI minister told reporters that rules are necessary to  implement internationally accepted measures.    But he said it would be ideal if there is no necessity to  implement such measures.    Hata was commenting on a set of rules for the implementation  of measures to guard textile import levels, recommended by a  government advisory panel on Tuesday.    The panel proposed the step be used under certain conditions  as a way to protect the struggling Japanese textile industry  against massive textile exports by China and other developing  countries.    A discriminatory curb on textile imports under the  multifiber  agreement (MFA) will be phased out by 2005 under the recently  concluded Uruguay Round global trade accord.    Japan's implementation of such a step amid the global shift  toward free trade could draw international criticism as a return  to protectionism.</p>

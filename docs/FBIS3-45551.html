"We  never take exception to non-governmental contacts between Taiwan  and countries that have diplomatic relations with China,"  foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said.    "Recently, however, the relations between some of those  countries and Taiwan have gone beyond that limit," he said,  condemning what he described as diplomatic trickery by Taiwan in  carrying on official contacts with certain countries under the  guise of private visits. "This so-called `holiday diplomacy' is  but a new trick of Taiwan's elastic diplomacy," Wu said.    Lien visited Malaysia and Singapore at the beginning of this  month in what was officially defined as a private capacity,  although he discussed bilateral economic cooperation with both  his Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts, Mahatir Mohamad and  Goh Chok Tong. Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui is to embark on a  private visit to Jakarta next month during which he will meet  President Suharto, newspapers in Taiwan and Indonesia have  reported.    Lien's visits were seen as a political breakthrough for  Taiwan as foreign governments having diplomatic relations with  China generally refuse anything that smacks of an official visit  from Taiwan for fear of angering Beijing. Beijing and Taipei  both claim to be the legitimate government of all China, and  Beijing strongly opposes any official contact by any foreign  governments with Taiwan, which it views as a renegade province.  However, Taiwan has recently been flexing its economic muscle  to open doors in Southeast Asia and Lien's recent successes in  Malaysia and Singapore indicate that the tactic is bearing fruit.    Wu also rejected the suggestion that the attendance at last  year's APEC summit of the chairman of Taiwan's Council for  Economic Planning and Development, Vincent Siew, contradicted  China's Taiwan policy. Chinese President Jiang Zemin also  attended the Seattle summit. "China attended the APEC meeting  as a soveriegn state while Taiwan was there as a regional  economy," Wu pointed out. "You cannot confuse bilateral issues  with APEC."</p>

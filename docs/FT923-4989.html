			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Bonds: Dollar bloc finds favour amid French poll unease CONTINUED unease over the prospects for European bond markets ahead of the French referendum on Maastricht later this month again shifted attention towards the dollar bloc. Although two polls published yesterday showed a narrow majority of French voters in favour of ratifying the treaty, expectations of volatility in most European markets ahead of the vote are expected to deter banks from underwriting new issues in European currencies (except D-Marks) before the referendum. Three deals in US, Canadian and Australian dollars dominated market activity yesterday, as investors trickled back to the market after the summer lull. Toyota Credit Canada's CDollars 150m five-and-a-half year deal via Merrill Lynch International was well received by investors keen for a change of maturity after the recent spate of 10-year paper, despite the yield pick-up available at the longer end of the curve. Ten-year deals for Japan Highway and Japan's Export-Import Bank of Japan have both widened slightly to a yield spread of 40 basis points over the comparable Canadian government bond yield. The Toyota deal, priced to yield 48 basis points above the comparable government bond yield, tightened by a basis point or two by the end of the day. In the floating-rate note sector, Norway's Eksportfinans launched a Dollars 100m issue of 10-year FRNs with a minimum coupon of 5 1/8 per cent and a maximum coupon of 10 per cent. The recent deluge of so-called 'collared' paper appears to have subsided, however. The deal was arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston. In the Australian dollar market, the State Bank of Australia launched an ADollars 125m 10-year deal via Hambros Bank. A spate of new issues last month was followed by a two-week lull, broken by yesterday's offering. The break had allowed excess paper to be mopped up, and, with reinvestment flows from maturing bonds at high levels, the State Bank issue was placed smoothly. Dealers said the weakness of the Australian dollar against the D-Mark was encouraging reinvestment by German investors, unwilling to take currency losses.</p>

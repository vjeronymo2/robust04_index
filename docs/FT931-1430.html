			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Wimpey deal There was no great surprise at the placing of the majority of the Grove Charity Management stake in George Wimpey, the housebuilder and contractor. The charity's stake has long been viewed by some of the more aggressive securities houses as ripe for placing. Yesterday SG Warburg Securities and Cazenove, Wimpey's broker, jointly disposed of a 29 per cent block of Wimpey shares, via bought deal, leaving the charity with a 5.5 per cent stake in the building company. Warburg and Cazenove bought the stake of some 84.3m shares at 131p and placed them with institutions at 132 1/2 p a share. The two firms shared a Pounds 1.2m profit in the process. Wimpey shares settled 4 lower at 142p. Turnover reached 206m shares. BT was among the five most-actively traded stocks in the market, the shares closing 13 higher at 420p on turnover of 10.7m. NatWest Securities was an aggressive buyer of the stock, anticipating a positive news flow as the sale of the government's remaining 21.8 per cent stake looms up in the summer. The broker said 'with a good experience in BT 2, and a high savings ratio, the retail market is likely to be attracted to a substantial part of the offer, keeping institutions underweight and aiding the BT price.' NatWest also said it is not convinced that BT is the only potential buyer of EDS, the US computer services group, a move which hasd acted as a BT share price negative. NatWest forecast BT will grow its earnings per share by an average 20 per cent in the next two years, against a UK market average of 16 per cent and the dividend by 10 per cent, against the market's 6.5 per cent. Continued fears of increased competition in the domestic beer market hurt Whitbread, off 6 at 470p. Favourable comment on its purchase of the Sutcliffe catering group on Tuesday lifted Granada, up 6 at 391p. Thorn-EMI weathered a UBS Phillips and Drew downgrade, the broker bringing its forecast down to the more median of market forecasts. The shares lifted 12.5p to 877.5p. A share squeeze, following an upbeat analysts visit to engineering group VSEL, saw the shares move sharply ahead by 60 to 645p. Mr Clive Forrestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'Despite the recent difficulties in the defence market, the company has both strong profits and cash generation prospects.' Worries about the accountancy practices at both TI Group, and Siebe, hit the shares of the only two engineering companies represented in the FT-SE 100. The former shed 3 to 302p, while the latter gave up 11 to 449p. Nervous trading in Vickers saw the shares surrender 5 to 120p, ahead of next week's closing date for the company's Pounds 60.5m rights issue. Among motor stocks, the market continued to take a negative view on BBA Group which announced a Pounds 125.9m rights issue on Tuesday and the shares eased 4 to 166p. Yesterday it was the turn of components group BSG International to join the rights issue trail as it declared an improvement in full year profits. The shares retreated 8 to 69p. The market was cheered by the bumper profits and acquisition by Lex Service from Lucas Industries. Lex jumped 16 to 335p, while Lucas closed a penny off at 138p. Conglomerate Trafalgar House, hardened 1 1/2 to 77p, after reporting an 89 per cent take up of its rights issue. It is expected that the outstanding shares will be taken up by Hongkong Land. Results from Kingfisher caused few surpises, the headline figures having been indicated at the time of the Darty deal, the French electrical retailer bought last month. However, fresh news on B&amp;Q, Kingfisher's DIY arm, did provide some lift to the shares and subsequently depressed other home improvement groups, Boots and WH Smith. Sales at B&amp;Q in December and January were said to be up 16 per cent, with the subsidiary embarking on a new aggressive sales drive for Easter. In contrast, Boots and Smiths have had to make provisions in their most recent figures for the loss-making subsidiary, Do It All. Kingfisher shares, aided also by an upbeat post-results meeting, put on 3 to 544p in turnover of 2.4m. Boots slipped 10 to 508p in volume of 2.5m. Dealers attributed the fall in Unilever to cautious comments from Swiss food group Nestle on the outlook for the European food business with its results announcement yesterday. The shares shed 10 to 1190p. BZW were said to be keen on Cadbury-Schweppes, up 8 at 490p. Nomura and Smith New Court were positive on Northern Foods, ahead 5 at 277p.</p>

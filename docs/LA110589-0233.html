			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN BERNARDINO;  </P> <P> 52 ABORTION FOES ARRESTED AT CLINIC  </P> <P> San Bernardino police arrested 52 people at a rally called by the anti-abortion  group Operation Rescue on Saturday for trying to block the entrance of a family  planning clinic, police said. Police were called to the early morning  demonstration by employees of the Family Planning Associates clinic when many  of the more than 150 demonstrators began blocking the doors, trying to prevent  scheduled abortions from being performed, police said. During the three-hour  protest, many of those arrested offered passive resistance and were carried  away from the clinic to waiting police vans, which took them to a nearby  detention center. They were cited for trespassing and interfering with police  officers and released, police said.  </P></p>

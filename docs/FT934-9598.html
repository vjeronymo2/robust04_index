			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Tory concern at lone-parent plan BACKBENCH Tory MPs yesterday expressed concern over the suggestion in a leaked document that the government should cut social security benefits to single parents. The proposal, discussed recently by a cabinet committee, caused a storm in Whitehall yesterday after the leak of the discussion document on ways to tackle 'the burden on public expenditure caused by lone parent families'. The document, written by senior Whitehall officials, outlined possible lines of action to reduce the number of single parent families, most of which are headed by women. They included reducing social security benefit, increasing emphasis on sex education and transferring some financial responsibility for the children to their grandparents. Another suggestion was that the age of consent be reduced from 16 to 13, so that GPs could prescribe contraceptives. It emerged yesterday that the document had been discussed by EDH, the cabinet committee on home and social affairs.

A discussion at this level suggests that the government is close to making formal proposals to parliament. An official said the committee had rejected the idea of reducing the age of consent as 'nonsense'. Mr Lilley yesterday tried to defuse the row over the document, claiming that his first concern was to look after the interests of the children concerned. But he admitted that the government was looking at ways to cut some of the costs of supporting this social group. 'We believe that people should support each other, particularly that parents should support their children. The taxpayer should only become involved when they don't have the money to do so.' Some Conservative backbenchers said they would resist any proposal to cut benefit for lone parents. Mr David Shaw, MP for Dover and a member of the Commons Social Security Committee, said that this would hurt the children of the parent. Ms Teresa Gorman, Conservative MP for Billericay, and Mrs Emma Nicholson (Devon West) also criticised the targetting of single women for benefit cuts. 'It ill-behoves men to make these judgments on single women,' said Ms Gorman. 'Most of us - but for the grace of God - might have found ourselves in their position.'</p>

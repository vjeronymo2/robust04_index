			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Why Ken and Eddie need not have bothered A ghost is stalking the world's financial markets, but its identity remains shadowy. Is it the spectre of resurgent inflation? It is hard to see where it would come from, at any rate in the US, Europe and Japan. Perhaps we are seeing the unwinding of too much speculation, a spooky enough problem which was focused during the winter on the hedge funds and is currently being fleshed out by the shifts in the US mutual fund market. Alternatively, there is simply too much borrowing by governments. Consider the plight of the Bank of England, which yesterday issued its quarterly Inflation Report. Since the last one came out, the yield on 10-year UK government bonds has jumped by 2 percentage points. Can the Bank possibly consider issuing gilts at a ruinous 8.4 per cent? The publication of the February report ironically coincided with the damaging argument between Eddie George, the Bank's governor, and Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, over whether short-term rates should be cut from 5 1/2 to 5 per cent. They need not have bothered. In the event monetary policy has been crudely tightened for them by the markets (the one-year rate is already 6 per cent). Mortgage lenders, for instance, have now withdrawn most of the cheap fixed-rate offers which were fuelling the housing market's recovery. UK inflation on 'RPIY' - the Bank's preferred measure - is under 2 per cent. Yet the yield structure in the gilt-edged market appears to discount a rate of almost 5 per cent, given a real yield on index-linked gilts of about 3 1/2 per cent. However, there are other interpretations. You can argue, for instance, that there is an unusually large risk premium on fixed interest gilts. But my own view is that the real yield on linkers is being temporarily held down by the influence of the equity market, which is about 20 times bigger. Inadequate arbitrage between the UK bond and equity markets has permitted an anomaly. It seems more realistic to suppose that the real long-term gilt yield has risen to between 4 1/2 and 5 per cent, forced up by the surge in borrowing over the past two or three years (no longer absorbed by speculators) and by recent political uncertainty. But equity investors have been reluctant to sell the share market down below the current 3.7 per cent All-Share Index yield. The linkers' yield has therefore been trapped - within only about 10 basis points of the equity yield, a remarkably narrow gap which itself is a clear sign of distress. The anomaly could be corrected by a fall in gilt yields to 7 1/2 per cent - or by a jump in the average equity yield to near 5 per cent. Is there a similar anomaly on Wall Street? Albert Edwards, strategist at Kleinwort Benson, has combed through the US mutual fund statistics for March and come to some very disturbing conclusions, using words such as 'disaster' and 'bloodbath'. In March 1993 bond funds and stock funds both attracted net inflows of Dollars 12bn. In March 1994 equity fund inflows were still Dollars 12bn (though well down from the recent peaks) but bond fund net sales were down to Dollars 2bn. Worse, says Edwards, this does not allow for umbrella-type switches from bond to money funds, allowing for which bond funds suffered a negative net cash flow of Dollars 5bn. Where bond markets lead, equity markets tend eventually to follow. The problem is that equity managers do not appear to have woken up to the dangers. Whereas the bond fund managers have been battening down the hatches and raising liquidity, stock fund managers have seen the market's weakness as a buying opportunity. So if they are hit by a wave of redemptions they will be unprepared. Goose-pimply comparisons with 1987 should be taken warily: equity markets are not so overvalued as they were then, though on the other hand bond markets may be fundamentally cheaper, with returns forced up by vast government borrowing. If bonds and equities suddenly come back into a coherent relationship, the impact, if not bloodsoaked, could still be painful. Ghosts of the past may meet ghouls of the present. Putting it another way, there is an unusually attractive arbitrage opportunity between bonds and equities.</p>

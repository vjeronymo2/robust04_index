			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c) allowing the Commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the geologic drilling and the statement of the result of test borings and core samplings required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(s). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c) is substantively similar to and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(C) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> e. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d), Cultural Resource Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) allowing the Commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of the collection of cultural resource information required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;14(1)(u), any other archaeological and historical information required by the superintendent of the state historical board, and the preparation of mitigation plans necessitated thereby. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) is substantively similar to and no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(D) of SMCRA. Accordingly, the Director is approving proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> f. NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e), Preblast Surveys <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> North Dakota proposed to create new NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) allowing the Commission's possible assumption, for qualified SOAP applicants, of the cost of preblast surveys required by NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e). In addition to this proposal, and as explained in the discussion in Finding No. 2 above, OSM is approving North Dakota's proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), which requires a preblasting survey to be conducted by the permittee when requested by the resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one mile [1.61 kilometers] of any portion of the permitted area. Taken in conjunction with North Dakota's proposed revision to NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e), proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) would allow North Dakota's SOAP program to pay for preblast surveys conducted within one mile from the permit boundary. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA authorizes payment for preblast surveys only in accordance with section 515(b)(15)(E) of SMCRA. Section 515(b)(15)(E), in turn, requires the applicant or permittee to conduct a preblasting survey upon request of a resident or owner of a man-made dwelling or structure within one-half mile of any portion of the permitted area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, taken together, proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;24(13)(e) and 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(e) effectively allow the Commission to use SOAP funds to cover potentially more costly preblast surveys than would be required under SMCRA. Since North Dakota has a preblast survey program requirement (1 mile) that is more stringent than SMCRA's preblast survey program requirement (1/2 mile), small operators in North Dakota must meet the more stringent State standard. Accordingly, the additional costs associated with North Dakota's requirements regarding preblasting surveys may be paid for with SOAP funds. Finally, section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b) provide that any State law or regulation that provides for more stringent land use and environmental controls and regulations for surface coal mining and reclamation operations than do SMCRA or the Federal regulations shall not be construed to be inconsistent with SMCRA. Thus, based upon the discussion above, the Director finds that proposed NDCC 38&hyph;14.1&hyph;37(2)(d) is not inconsistent with section 507(c)(1)(E) of SMCRA and the Federal program and is approving it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> g.

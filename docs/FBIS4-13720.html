			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Anjan Ray] </F>   [Text] India's decision to resume bilateral talks with the  United States on opening up the textiles market augurs optimism  for higher trade. The U.S. announcement on withdrawal of all  restrictions on imports of hand loom exports from India is a  major gain for India. India on the other hand has agreed to  dilute tariff barriers to entry of high-valued U.S. textile  exports which will go a long way to meeting the American  sensibilities about the textile trade. For even now, the  textiles industry is a major source of employment generation in  that country. In view of the importance of textiles for  employment of U.S. labor, the United States had for the last  decade been insisting on more gradual phasing out of the  controversial Multi-Fiber Agreement -- MFA -- which tended to  depress imports of textile items into the world's largest  economy.    The MFA had imposed some arbitrary quotas on textiles  exports  from the manufacturing countries which India had always  maintained was the subtraction from the rule-based trading  regime. MFA is now proposed to be phased out in 10 years.  Although the details of India's opening up of the textiles  market to the United States has yet to be worked out, in a sense  this should be of considerable importance. Currently Indian  tariff on textile imports is around 85 percent and there are  some quantitative restrictions besides. Under the commitment  given now, India will be obliged to bring down the tariff rates  and remove some of the quantitative restrictions. The areas of  restrictions will to a large extent determine the possible  volume of imports from the United States. The withdrawal of  U.S. restrictions on Indian hand loom imports should certainly  mean a major step up in activities in some segments of Indian  hand loom industry. The textiles industry as a whole employs  about 15 millions in India. The synthetic textile industry is  capital intensive and, therefore, the employment generation in  this sector is limited. On the other hand, rough and ready  estimates indicate that the hand loom sector employs no less  than 8 to 10 million workers and any increase in exports could  bring about a significant improvement in their economic  situation. Indeed, the cotton sector alone is expected to be  the biggest beneficiary of any increase in exports since it is  this item that accounts for nearly of the hand loom sector's  exports. However, the bilateral concession to India on textiles  is a just a windfall profit and demonstrates the negotiation  skills of a team which had gone to Marrakesh for signing the  agreement on completion of the Uruguay round.    There are some major differences with the United States over  the general stand Washington has taken on multilateral issues  relating to the new order. The United States had been in the  vanguard of those developed countries which had demanded linking  of social policy issues with trade policy. In effect, these  countries are demanding that the labor standards, particularly  the wage levels in the developing countries, should be taken  into account in deciding the framework for conducting  international trade. If these developed countries succeed, this  would virtually take away the comparative advantage of the  developing countries in the form of lower wages. The United  States is advancing all this concern for labor in the name of  raising standards of living in all countries. Its effect could  be quite the contrary. The activist policies followed by the  United States to shut out imports selectively from different  countries, which it dislikes on some grounds or other, had been  noticed even by many of the developed countries. In fact, the  ministerial declaration on the accession to the Dunkel final act  is carrying an exhortation to the effect that no signatory  should take unilateral action which could jeopardize the flow of  trade among the nations. This has obviously been introduced to  discourage countries like the United States from using trade  restrictive measures under its various omnibus legislations like  Super 301 or Special 301 between now and the formation of the  World Trade Organization.</p>

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / International Company News: GCM buys rest of gold prospect Great Central Mines, the Australian exploration company headed by Mr Joseph Gutnick, is to acquire the outstanding 30 per cent interest in the Bronzewing gold prospect in Western Australia. GCM will also buy the 49 per cent interest in the Jundee tenements, north of Bronzewing. In both cases, GCM is raising its interest to 100 per cent, and buying the stakes from prospector Mr Mark Creasy. The total payment will comprise a non-refundable deposit of ADollars 5m (USDollars 3.5m) and 1m GCM shares. The company will then make a final payment of ADollars 107m within 120 days, or ADollars 117m within 12 months. GCM said that it intended to raise debt finance to fund the final payment. GCM sprang into the limelight a year ago, when New York rabbi Rebbe Schneerson of the ultra-orthodox Lubavicher sect, prophesied it would enjoy large finds, sparking a share-price surge.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Legislation was introduced, but not passed, in the 103rd Congress that would have required the publication of pending patent applications. Both S. 1854, The Patent Simplification Act of 1994, and S. 2488, The Patent Application Publication Act of 1994, had provisions directed to publishing patent applications after 18 months from an application's earliest effective filing date. Copies of these bills may be obtained from the individuals identified in the ``For Further Information Contact'' section of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The PTO anticipates that legislation with an 18-month publication provision similar to S. 1854 and S. 2488 will be introduced in the 104th Congress. In addition, the Secretary of Commerce and the Japanese Ambassador to the United States have exchanged letters in which the United States committed, among other things, to introduce legislation to provide for the publication of pending patent applications 18 months after their effective filing date. The Japanese Government also committed to significant changes in its patent system. The United States committed to begin publishing patent applications by January 1, 1996. If Congress enacts this change, the PTO will need to implement the legislation quickly to meet the January 1, 1996, date set out in the exchange of letters. In the event legislation with an 18-month publication provision is enacted next year, public comments will greatly assist the PTO in formulating any notice of proposed rulemaking implementing the legislation. Specifically, the PTO is considering ways to implement possible legislative changes which would require the PTO to publish all patent applications at 18 months from the filing date, including the earliest filing date for which a benefit is desired under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, and/or 365. The PTO would publish sufficient information about pending applications to enable a knowledgeable reader to determine whether the technology described is relevant to the reader's interest. If such legislation is enacted, certain changes will be required in the way business is conducted both with and within the PTO. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the public be given an opportunity to comment prior to any rules being proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, national patent applications are maintained in confidence by the PTO until a patent is granted as required by 35 U.S.C. 122. In accordance with 37 CFR 1.14(a), information regarding the status of any such application may be given to a third party when ``the application has been identified by serial number in a published patent document or the United States of America has been indicated as a Designated State in a published international application, in which case status information such as whether it is pending, abandoned or patented may be supplied.'' If legislation similar to S. 1854 or S. 2488 is enacted into law, all pending applications filed on or after the effective date of the legislation, except for those under a 35 U.S. C. 181 secrecy order, will be published at 18 months from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> earliest filing date <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for which a benefit is sought, unless the application has already issued as a patent. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought for purposes of 18-month publication of the application should not be confused with the filing date of an application for purposes of a 20-year patent term. The date of filing in the legislation concerning a patent term of 20-years from the date of filing, as proposed, is the date on which the application was filed in the United States, or, if the application contains a specific reference to an earlier filed application or applications under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121 or 365(c), the date on which the earliest of such applications was filed. Although the benefit of a filing date under 35 U.S.C. 119, 365(a) or 365(b), including provisional applications as provided for in the proposed 20-year patent term legislation, will not be taken into account for purposes of a patent term of 20-years from the date of filing, it will be taken into account for purposes of publication of the application at 18 months from the earliest filing date for which a benefit is sought. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to plan for implementation of publication at 18 months, certain issues must be resolved. For example: What will be published? Will access to the application file be available following publication? How will submissions of prior art by third parties be treated? Should there be a fixed time in which an applicant must claim priority under either 35 U.S.C. 119 or 120, or risk loss of priority or benefit of a previously filed application? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> PTO's current planning approach to implement early publication is to create an electronic data base which captures the content of the paper application file. This electronic data base will be used to provide a source for (a) meeting publishing requirements for the applications, (b) providing a basis for electronic searching and retrieval of applications, and (c) providing a basis for producing copies of the application file. It is currently contemplated that the publication of an application will take the form of publishing certain portions of the information in an application necessary to identify the technical subject matter of the application (a Gazette Entry) in a separate  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gazette of Patent Application Notices <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and a one-page paper document (a Patent Application Notice) containing similar information will be created for placement in the search files. It is further contemplated that public access will be provided to at least the bibliographical and technical content of the application (specification including claims and drawings) upon publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The creation of an electronic data base which mirrors the content of the paper application file will provide the greatest degree of public access to the application, while causing the least disruption to the examination process. It is the PTO's intention to have such an electronic data base in operation when the proposed legislation becomes effective. However, provisions for providing access to the paper application file may be necessary in the event that the electronic data base is not fully operational when applications are first published. Accordingly, some access to the paper application file may be necessary for a short period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Issues for Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any interested member of the public is invited to testify and/or present written comments on any topic related to 18-month publication. The public was invited to comment on the advisability of introducing an 18-month publication procedure into the patent system of the United States in a public hearing conducted in October 1993. Accordingly, the public is encouraged to limit comments to the procedures that the PTO should adopt if an 18-month publication regime is enacted. Questions included at the end of this section are intended to illustrate the types of issues upon which the PTO is particularly interested in obtaining public comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> BELLSON LEADS ALL-STAR QUINTET  </P> <P> Because most of Louie Bellson's Los Angeles appearances are made at the helm of  a full orchestra, his six-day stand this week at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill in  Hollywood is something special, with the virtuosic drummer leading an all-star  quintet.  </P> <P> For his front line he wisely chose Pete Christlieb, whose tenor saxophone has  been a vocal point of the larger Bellson groups since 1967, and trumpeter Conte  Candoli, who like Christlieb is moonlighting from the "Tonight Show."  </P> <P> Their opener was the old Charlie Parker riff "Now's the Time," not the most  demanding of themes, but a good enough point of departure for some brisk blues  blowing by all hands.  </P> <P> It was an opportunity to appreciate Bellson's rhythm section partners: Andy  Simpkins, a bass player with phenomenal technique and ideas to spare, and Frank  Strazzeri, one of the most dependable of the Southland's bop-based pianists.  </P> <P> A muted Candoli tackled "Darn That Dream" with appropriate delicacy, after  which all five men dealt with the demanding tempo of "Shaw Nuff," a tune that  virtually launched the be-bop era. Christlieb and Candoli met the challenge of  the speedway pace, limning the tricky melody as if joined at the chops. Bellson  used this as his own showcase in a fiery finale to the set, which he dedicated  to the memory of Art Blakey. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

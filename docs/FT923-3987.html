			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Gaskell halves interim to 1.5p Gaskell, the carpet and floor covering manufacturing group, is still suffering from being largely tied to the building and housing markets. In its latest results - for the half year ended July 3 - turnover has fallen 10.5 per cent to Pounds 15m while pre-tax profit plummeted 73 per cent, from Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 15,000. The interim dividend is halved to 1.5p, as earnings per share worked through at 0.2p (0.6p). Mr Edward Andrew, chairman, said costs had been reduced, enabling the group to operate profitably at lower turnover levels.</p>

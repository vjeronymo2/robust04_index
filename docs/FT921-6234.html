			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): CAC-40 confounds sceptics as it pierces 2,000 THE CONTINENT remained in an optimistic mood yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS confounded the sceptics as the CAC-40 index broke above the 2,000 mark, albeit briefly, for the first time since July 20, 1990. The index reached 2,004.18 but then dived to 1,972.77 due to the careless execution of a medium-sized sell program by a leading domestic broker. Options-related selling also pushed the market down. The index regained its composure to close 3.81 higher at 1,985.12 in volume of FFr3.2bn. Generale des Eaux was one of the day's most active stocks as Ferri put through a block of 30,000 shares, from domestic to foreign hands. The stock eased FFr4 to FFr2,253 with 83,940 shares traded. LVMH was one of the stocks badly hit by the sell program, falling as low as FFr4,540 before closing down FFr20 at FFr4,600. UAP, the insurer, was up FFr18 at FFr581 but dealers could find no particular reasons for the rise, while Total eased FFr4 to FFr248. FRANKFURT continued to gain on buying by UK fund managers who were nervous about their underweight position in German equities. The DAX index closed 12.63 higher at 1,749.90, while the FAZ index, calculated at mid-session, rose 4.47 to 708.76. Turnover rose to DM8.5bn from DM7.6bn. Dealers expected the market to consolidate at current levels during the Carnival festivities next week but were confident that the DAX index could break above 1,800 when trading returned to normal. Blue-chips were sought after, with Daimler-Benz, which has lagged behind the market, adding DM11.60 to DM761.80. BMW put on DM8 to DM566.50. Smaller stocks continued to be active. The retailer Kaufhof added DM9.50 to DM514.50 after the company surprised the market with the forecast that 1991 group earnings will rise faster than the 22 per cent increase in group sales last year. The steel and engineering group Klockner-Werke was 30 pfg better at DM124.80. After the close it announced that it was passing the dividend on 1990/91 results, due to a sharp drop in earnings. Sector analysts said the decision came as no surprise. AMSTERDAM was dominated by Philips' results and the announcement from KLM that merger talks with British Airways had been called off. The CBS Tendency Index closed up 0.2 at 126.6. Philips reported a 1991 net profit of Fl 981m, exceeding analysts forecasts which had been in the Fl 650m range. There was strong US buying in the afternoon and the shares finished up Fl 3.20 or nearly 10 per cent, to Fl 35.60. KLM's announcement took the market by surprise, although one analyst commented that a merger was beginning to look unlikely as neither side had seemed prepared to agree on the share structure. The Dutch carrier closed down Fl 2.10 or 5.2 per cent at Fl 38.20. MADRID opened strongly after the treasury cut bond yields in its latest tender, but fell back later. The general index closed at the year's high, up 2.34 at 264.68 in volume estimated at Pta20bn. Repsol, which reported a 3.6 per cent increase in 1991 net profit, gained Pta25 to Pta3,005. Valderrivas, the construction group, rose Pta560 or 4 per cent to Pta14,400 after announcing a 10.7 per cent rise in 1991 net profit. MILAN again failed to hold on to early gains, the Comit index closing 2.24 lower at 540.50. Technical problems on the telematico screen-based trading system also hindered trading. Turnover was estimated at L110bn after Wednesday's L112.9bn. Industrials were firmer with Fiat gaining L15 to L5,146 and Montedison rising L20 to L1,430. Selling pressure pushed the food group SME down by L70 to L3,350 on fears that it would be forced to buy the Standa department store group from Mr Silvio Berlusconi. STOCKHOLM rose on overnight gains on Wall Street and the Affarsvarlden General Index closed up 8.1 at 935.4 in turnover of SKr503m. Astra free shares, which had risen SKr8 in early trading, fell back on profit-taking to close up SKr2 at SKr579. BELGIAN followed Wall Street and Frankfurt higher and the Bel-20 index closed up 7.93 at 1,205.92. Solvay, the chemical group, rose BFr175 to BFr12,550, while Petrofina, the oil group, gained BFr75 to BFr10,550. ZURICH rose in quiet trading although investors remained cautious: the SPI index rose 1.8 to 1,143.6. Alusuisse bearers fell SFr20 to SFr950 on profit-taking after recent strong gains. Oerlikon-Buehrle bearers reversed earlier gains to close down SFr6 at SFr380. OSLO was lifted by firmer prices for North Sea oil and the all-share index closed up 5.31 or 1.3 per cent to 414.28 in turnover of some NKr200m. Norsk Hydro rose NKr1.5 to NKr137.5 helped by the stronger oil prices. ISTANBUL fell 104 points in early trading before strong buying in the banking sector and a weaker dollar pushed the index sharply higher: the 75-share index closed up 99.69 or 2.7 per cent at 3,755.97.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1172.63  1171.73  1171.74  1171.61  1171.63  1171.60  1169.19  1167.26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Day's High  1172.74    Day's Low  1167.26  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Feb 26     Feb 25     Feb 24     Feb 21     Feb 20 1165.89    1156.42    1163.91    1154.51    1149.62  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

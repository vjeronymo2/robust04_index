			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Observer: American hot Remember all those good old anti-communist jokes that flooded out of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary? In Budapest they're telling one about a pizzeria, its entrepreneurial owner Zoltan Czvitko and the law. Trouble is, it's a true story. Red stars and other communist paraphernalia were officially banned last year. Czvitko, 30, has responded by opening a pizzeria called Marxim, with decor best described as commie kitsch  - walls festooned with Soviet posters, barbed wire, that type of thing. The cellar boasts a five-pointed star, unfortunately also on the banned list. The Czvitko defence is that the star is stylised and irregular; prosecutors will no doubt appear armed with their protractors to measure angles.</p>

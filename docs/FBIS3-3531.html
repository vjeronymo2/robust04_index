In the past decade, the province's Scientific Research  Foundation remained weak due to its position as a frontier  region.    With recent economic development, more and more Guangdong  residents have come to realize that only on a solid basis of  scientific research will the economy keep its momentum.    In the past three years, the province invested 29.18 million  yuan in the construction of 11 key laboratories.    The province also allocated special funds for the  transformation of five scientific research institutes and the  updating of equipment and instruments in another six institutes.    Last year, the Guangdong provincial government continued to  increase investment in basic scientific research programs, and  it set up Guangdong funds for natural sciences.    The increased investment in research institutes has improved  research conditions. Statistics show that the annual income of  12 research institutes has exceeded 1 million yuan.</p>

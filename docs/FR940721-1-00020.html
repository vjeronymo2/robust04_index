			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the State's submittal meets the I/M approvability criteria for areas redesignating from nonattainment to attainment, USEPA is proposing to approve the I/M plan for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area that was submitted as a revision to the Michigan SIP. Alternatively, USEPA is proposing to disapprove the State's I/M SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area if the State's redesignation request is ultimately not approved or if the I/M Redesignation Rule is not codified as proposed in USEPA's I/M rule before the USEPA finalizes its approval of the redesignation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Redesignation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Act, nonattainment areas can be redesignated to attainment if sufficient data are available to warrant such changes and the area satisfies other criteria contained in section 107(d)(3) of the Act. On November 12, 1993 the State submitted a redesignation request and section 175A maintenance plan. If approved, the section 175A maintenance plan would become a federally enforceable part of the SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A detailed analysis of the Michigan Redesignation Request and section 175A Maintenance Plan SIP submittal for the Detroit-Ann Arbor area is contained in the USEPA's TSD, dated February 24, 1994 from Jacqueline Nwia to the Docket, entitled ``TSD for the Request to Redesignate the Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan Moderate Nonattainment Area to Attainment for Ozone and the Proposed Revision to the Michigan Ozone SIP for a 175A Maintenance Plan'' and ``Amendments to the February 24, 1994 TSD for the Request to Redesignate the Detroit/Ann Arbor, Michigan Moderate Nonattainment Area to Attainment for Ozone and the Proposed Revision to the Michigan Ozone SIP for a 175A Maintenance Plan,'' dated June 21, 1994 (Redesignation/Maintenance Plan TSD), which are available from the Region 5 office listed above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> I. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The 1977 Act required areas that were designated nonattainment based on a failure to meet the ozone NAAQS, to develop SIPs with sufficient control measures to expeditiously attain and maintain the standard. The Detroit-Ann Arbor area was designated under section 107 of the 1977 Act as nonattainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS (43 FR 8962, March 3, 1978 and 43 FR 45993, October 5, 1978). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After enactment of the amended Act on November 15, 1990 the nonattainment designation of the Detroit-Ann Arbor area continued by operation of law according to section 107(d)(1)(C)(i) of the Act; furthermore, it was classified by operation of law as moderate for ozone pursuant to section 181(a)(1) (56 FR 56694, November 6, 1991 and 57 FR 56762, November 30, 1992), codified at 40 CFR 81.323. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Detroit-Ann Arbor area more recently has ambient monitoring data that show no violations of the ozone NAAQS, during the period from 1991 through 1993. The area, therefore, became eligible for redesignation from nonattainment to attainment consistent with the amended Act, and to ensure continued attainment of the ozone standard, Michigan also submitted an ozone maintenance SIP for the Detroit-Ann Arbor on November 12, 1993. On  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> November 12, 1993 Michigan requested redesignation of the area to attainment with respect to the ozone NAAQS. On October 22, 1993 Michigan held a public hearing on the maintenance plan component of the redesignation request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

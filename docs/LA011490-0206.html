			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAPD'S BRASS PUSH GATES TO QUIT, MAKE ROOM AT TOP  </P> <P> After a failed political bid and missed appointments to top federal law  enforcement jobs, Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates is a man caught  between his own ambition and the desires of his top brass to advance in the  department.  </P> <P> Gates is concluding his 12th year as chief even as serious crimes have reached  an all-time high in Los Angeles and a major expansion and upgrading of police  facilities and manpower is under way. But he is surrounded by lieutenants,  commanders and deputy chiefs in the 8,000-officer force whose future with the  department depends on his stepping aside.  </P> <P> "It's a continuing dilemma," Gates said of the would-be chiefs who are nipping  at his heels. "I am not going to stay forever. I don't have a specific  (departure) date in mind, but clearly these concerns are in my head. I'm not  blind to them."  </P> <P> Critics, many of whom spoke only on condition that their names not be used,  said Gates' uncertainty about his own future has damaged morale and stifled  innovation in the department at a time when street crime is foremost among  problems facing the city. Department officials jockeying for the top position  said there is a new reluctance to take law enforcement risks that, if they  fail, might jeopardize their standing.  </P> <P> "There is a feeling among progressive, ambitious people in the department that  Gates should step aside," said one lieutenant, expressing a commonly held view  in the department. "There are people at lower levels who could do a great job  and may not get the opportunity unless he leaves."  </P> <P> A police commander added: "Certainly, if the chief left it would mean major  movement at the upper ranks, which would mean a lot of other (new) positions  (would become available). Career advancement? We certainly don't have much of  that."  </P> <P> Gates' reluctance to either move on or firmly declare his intent to stay has  created a "brewing frustration in the department," said one prominent city  official who asked that his name not be used. "What you are witnessing here is  promotional gridlock."  </P> <P> Others, outside the department, were more blunt in their appraisal of Gates'  status.  </P> <P> "Gates left the Police Department a year ago, only his physical presence  remains," said Barbara Schlei, a former police commissioner who has frequently  locked horns with the chief over policy. Although Schlei insisted that she  admires Gates' personal charm, intelligence and concern for his officers, she  added: "It is time for the issues to be addressed by a full-time chief whose  heart and soul and total attention is on the day-to-day workings of LAPD."  </P> <P> The problem for Gates -- a vigorous man who looks much younger than his 62  years -- is that there are few jobs to which he can aspire.  </P> <P> "What do you do after you've been marshal of Dodge City?" asked Eric Rose,  spokesman for Gates during the chief's abortive campaign for governor last  year. "It's tough and it's a question that only Daryl Gates can answer."  </P> <P> In an interview with The Times, Gates said he will stay in the department  another "five years at the outer limits" and asserted that he is being  encouraged by "some of the top people in the community" to explore a possible  run for mayor "if something happens" to embattled Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> "I haven't written it off," Gates said, "but I told them it would really take a  real strong outpouring of strength in the city for me to do it."  </P> <P> Gates was waiting for the same sort of outpouring of support last year when he  dismantled his exploratory campaign for governor. Meanwhile, speculation that  he would be offered an appointment in the Bush Administration as drug czar or  chief of the FBI remained just that.  </P> <P> "I heard it from top supporters of Bush, some people who I know are involved in  making decisions on some of those positions," Gates said. "When I would hear  those stories, I told my wife, 'You know? I'm scared to death because I can't  turn the President down.' "  </P> <P> Gates now says the only Washington jobs he would have considered under the Bush  Administration were "drug czar and head of the CIA." Yet, the 40-year police  veteran said he is keeping his options open.  </P> <P> Asked if he would consider leaving the department for a job with a major  corporation, Gates said: "Yeah, I could if it were the right kind of job, the  right kind of paycheck, that's a possibility. Somebody must offer me a job."  </P> <P> Gates' inability to chart a course and stick with it has frustrated current and  former allies. When he became chief in 1978, Gates said he told the Police  Commission that he would not stay longer than "three to four years." Four years  later, Gates told colleagues he was interested in running for mayor.  </P> <P> In 1984, Gates said he would consider leaving the force after the Los Angeles  Summer Olympics. In 1987, he suggested that he would leave after Pope John Paul  II's visit to Los Angeles. In 1988, he reversed himself and talked of breaking  former Chief William H. Parker's tenure of 16 years. Early last year, he began  his brief flirtation with gubernatorial politics, saying he would consider a  spot on the Republican ticket.  </P> <P> "I really did think very seriously about retiring after the Olympics," Gates  said. "I sat back and sat on the beach, thought about it, got cold chills,  said, 'Do I really want to leave?' and came back full of vigor."  </P> <P> Former Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis, now a Republican state senator  representing the San Fernando Valley, said of his one-time protege: "If Daryl  has made a mistake it was saying 'I'll stay until the end of the (1984)  Olympics,' then say he would stay on for a few years."  </P> <P> "If you are the leader of 10 people or 10,000 people," Davis said, "there  shouldn't be any ambiguity about whether or not you will be the boss."  </P> <P> By way of comparison, Davis said William H. Parker, who died in 1966 after 16  years as chief, "never gave any indication that he would do anything other than  be chief of police."  </P> <P> "Parker was a formidable presence and we thought he would be chief forever,  literally," Davis said. "When he died, I went over to City Hall and looked to  see whether the plexiglass (over his portrait) was fogging up."  </P> <P> In contrast to Parker, when Davis became chief in 1969, he told the Police  Commission, "I wouldn't stay longer than eight years. . . . After eight years,  I would be (creating) a museum to Ed Davis." Davis missed his prediction only  slightly, remaining chief for a total of nine years. As for Gates as a mayoral  contender, Davis said: "He's a good administrator and he's honest. But he first  must assess whether (voters) are willing to elect a conservative Republican,  Anglo, Mormon ex-cop. If they are, great, go for it."  </P> <P> Gates insisted that his own polls indicated that he would have been a  formidable candidate in the last mayoral election. "I could beat (City  Councilman Zev) Yaroslavsky, I could beat everybody. I couldn't beat the  mayor," he said.  </P> <P> "Had we known the facts of the unfolding Bradley drama I think they would have  voted me in overwhelmingly just to have integrity in government," Gates said,  calling attention to the controversy that has erupted over the mayor's  financial dealings.  </P> <P> Political insiders familiar with Gates said that a conservative Republican  would have a very tough time being elected mayor of Los Angeles because of the  city's ethnic diversity and liberal electorate, which includes large blocs of  Jewish, black and Latino voters.  </P> <P> These observers said, however, that Gates' name recognition and statewide  popularity would make him a potentially viable candidate for governor. But  publicly he has expressed little interest lately in revitalizing his dismantled  gubernatorial campaign.  </P> <P> Gates, who earns $145,846 a year and has been chief longer than any other major  city police chief still on the job, lately has curbed what was widely viewed as  his confrontational, shoot-from-the-lip style.  </P> <P> Once at loggerheads with the mayor and city officials over dwindling budgets  for police operations and with community activists over his sometimes  provocative words and actions, Gates has managed to mend fences with many of  his adversaries. The more cordial atmosphere has helped him win increased  support from the City Council. That, combined with the passage a year ago of  local Proposition 2, which provided $176 million to upgrade Police Department  facilities, has enabled Gates to make much-needed -- albeit belated --  improvements in the department's manpower and equipment.  </P> <P> "For 10 years as chief of this department we didn't move anywhere because, in  my judgment, the political leadership of this city was in a non-movement mode  -- and that clearly impacted the Police Department," Gates said. "Budgets got  to be so routine, I hardly looked at the budgets. There was no enthusiasm for  doing anything."  </P> <P> Now, Gates said, "I'm excited about some of the things happening in the  department."  </P> <P> Now, the Police Department is anticipating construction of a new academy,  expansion of existing stations, renovation of department computer systems and  the introduction of new forensic technologies such as DNA genetic printing.  Experts predict that this technology may someday supplant finger-printing as a  method of making positive identifications.  </P> <P> Among Gates' most important accomplishments in recent years, according to  Deputy Chief Glen Levant, was the creation of a gang-suppression program that  targets gang members for narcotics prosecutions. "That program has resulted in  a 98% filing rate and a 94% conviction rate," Levant said.  </P> <P> Under the same program, more than 24,000 people have been arrested for sales of  drugs since January, 1988, and "over 8,000 people identified as gang members  have had criminal cases built on them for narcotics violations, which takes  them off the streets for a long time," Levant said.  </P> <P> Gates' primary legacy, however, may be the creation of the Special Weapons and  Tactics unit (SWAT) and the widely hailed Drug Abuse Resistance Education  (DARE) program, which uses police officers to instruct Los Angeles grade school  students about the perils of narcotics.  </P> <P> But Gates also has drawn criticism for efforts such as his use of a huge  battering ram to smash through suspected drug houses and "Operation Hammer,"  which places hundreds of officers on the streets of crime-heavy neighborhoods  to exert pressure on gangs.  </P> <P> Critics say police sweeps do not really solve the problem and amount to a waste  of time and manpower. Gates said they let decent people get at least one night  of peace.  </P> <P> Even within the department the value of such operations is debated.  </P> <P> "Gang sweeps are a hokey publicity deal," said one high-ranking official in the  department. "Inevitably, they will create martyrs -- they'll pick up an Eagle  Scout on his way to a Rhodes scholarship tryout."  </P> <P> Despite all these efforts, statistics indicate that Gates may be losing the war  on crime.  </P> <P> The department's summary of crimes committed last year shows that 324,486 major  crimes were committed in the city, compared to 299,910 in 1988 -- an increase  of 8.2% spurred by narcotics trafficking, authorities said.  </P> <P> An unprecedented 303 people were slain in gang-related killings in the city in  1989, nearly an 18% increase over the record 257 slayings recorded in 1988.  </P> <P> Despite those dismal statistics, Gates remains optimistic that his programs,  along with increased public concern, heavier enforcement and stiffer sentences  for criminals eventually will turn the tide.  </P> <P> These days, in fact, Gates is talking about ambitious plans to dramatically  reduce crime across the United States by cutting down on drug and alcohol  abuse.  </P> <P> "We're always going to have crime, but I'm confident this country could reduce  its crime load by 60% to 70% to 80% -- I truly believe that," Gates said. "I  think the first step is to create a drug-free America. All you have to do is  look at the interlacing of alcohol and crime.  </P> <P> "Just look at that, and you can see that if you can raise a generation that's  drug free and abuse-free from alcohol, you'll reduce crime by 40% to 50% right  there."  </P> <P> Achieving that goal would require an unprecedented "partnership between the  private sector, communities and governments to realistically look at these  kinds of problems and come in with the organizational and entrepreneurial  expertise that we have in America."  </P> <P> Unless such a partnership is realized, Gates predicted a violent "pulling apart  as a nation of haves and have nots."  </P> <P> "And I think sometimes those have-nots are going to say enough is enough,"  Gates said. "And an awful lot of them have Uzis and AK-47s (assault rifles).  It's scary."  </P> <P> It was Gates' call for outlawing these kinds of assault rifles, registration of  existing weapons, and his denunciation of the tactics of anti-abortionist  protesters, that was blamed for eroding his natural base of support among  conservatives in the 1988 exploratory campaign for governor.  </P> <P> "That took a lot of guts," City Councilman Nate Holden, one of the chief's  strongest supporters, said of Gates' stand on assault rifles. "He said they  were weapons of war and went up for legislation to ban those things. He didn't  think about support from conservatives."  </P> <P> Now, with so many waiting and watching for clues about his future, Gates seems  to enjoy the guessing game.  </P> <P> "I have pretty (well) fixed in my mind what it would take to get me out of  here, and some sense of when I will probably go," Gates said. "But no one will  know when that is until I decide."  </P></p>

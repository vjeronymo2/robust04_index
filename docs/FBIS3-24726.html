			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Conservative Party [CP] has warned that the  constitutional negotiations between the government, the ANC  [African National Congress], and the Freedom Alliance, are being  threatened by serious obstacles and that the patience of the  Afrikaner volk [people] has been exhausted. The CP negotiator,  Mr. Fanie Jacobs, said the alliance would have nothing to do  with the six-point proposal submitted by the ANC that placed new  restrictions on exclusive powers for provinces.    Earlier, the deadline for negotiations was extended to  Monday  [31 January], and the date for the election was not promulgated  today, as was originally planned. It's not known whether these  developments will delay a decision by the Inkatha Freedom Party  on its participation in the election. An announcement was to  have been made after the party's conference at Ulundi this  weekend. Similarly, it is not known whether right-wing  Afrikaners will decide this weekend on their own transitional  council.</p>

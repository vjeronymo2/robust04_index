			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias today met his  Turkish counterpart, Hikmet Cetin, on the sidelines of the NATO  ministerial conference in Istanbul. The two ministers discussed  the issues of artificial tension in Greek-Turkish relations and  the Ecumenical Patriarchate's security.    The foreign minister described the meeting as positive and  said he hopes there will be a positive results in the future.  Papoulias added that he and his Turkish counterpart agreed that  shrill diatribes do not help to create an appropriate climate to  deal with the existing problems. He said unfounded accusations  that Greece is supposedly backing terrorist organizations in  Turkey are unacceptable. He also raised the issue of the recent  attacks against the Patriarchate. Papoulias said he was  satisfied with yesterday's statement by his Turkish counterpart  denying Turkish press reports on Turkish Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller remarks.    The foreign minister said he and Cetin agreed to promote  bilateral cooperation in combating drug trafficking and the  issue of illegal immigrants. The two sides also agreed to  promote the treaty on economic cooperation in the Black Sea and  establish a cooperation bank in Thessaloniki. Cetin described  the meeting as very useful and stressed that the two sides must  closely follow actions that undermine the common view.    Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today that  remarks by Cetin yesterday were more careful and moderate,  adding that the government considers them an effort within the  more general climate of artificial tension that is being  cultivated by Turkey. Venizelos said the Government reacted  carefully and calmly, adding that Cetin's remarks were positive.  He stressed that Ciller's statement has significance, even if  it was made in a private discussion. Greece has to ascertain  Turkey's policy.    Asked if Ciller's remarks are linked to developments in the  Cyprus issue, Venizelos said the Cyprus issue is an  international problem, not a Greek-Turkish problem. He added,  however, that Greek-Turkish relations depend on the Cyprus issue  and whether Turkish Cypriot intransigence will continue.    Thirty-five Turkish deputies submitted a question in the  Turkish National Assembly asking for an investigation into the  activities of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. At a news conference  at the National Assembly, the Turkish deputies referred to a  betrayal of the Patriarchate and asked that decisive measures be  adopted.</p>

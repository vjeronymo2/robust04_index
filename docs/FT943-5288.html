			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Outsiders in Whitehall The UK government is rightly proud of its record in bringing business executives and other outsiders into top jobs in Whitehall. The newcomers have brought fresh insights to the business of government and helped shake up civil service management. They have also contributed to improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of public services. But the debate over the wisdom of bringing outsiders into top Whitehall jobs has been rekindled by events at two high-profile agencies. On Friday, Ms Ros Hepplewhite resigned as chief executive of the Child Support Agency amid continuing criticism of the agency's role in pursuing absent fathers to pay maintenance for their children. Ms Hepplewhite was previously director of Mind, the mental health charity, and had spent most of her working life as a health service manager. During its first year of operation, the agency failed to hit almost all its performance targets - in some cases by a wide margin. Ms Hepplewhite also seemed to lack the political skills needed to deal with critics, particularly on appearances before parliamentary select committees. She has been replaced by a career civil servant who is regarded as a safe pair of hands. Fears stirred Mr Derek Lewis, chief executive of the Prison Service agency, also found himself in the news last week, over the transfer of four convicted terrorists from Britain to prisons in Northern Ireland. Mr Lewis, former chief executive of Granada, the leisure group, was accused of insensitivity and incompetence in going ahead with the moves within days of the IRA ceasefire. The transfers stirred fears among unionists of secret concessions to the IRA in return for the ceasefire. The prime minister was said to be 'livid', and demanded a speedy inquiry. Mr Lewis apologised, and seems likely to remain in post. He weathered previous storms such as the loss of seven prisoners by Group 4, the private security group, during the first two weeks of operating a privatised prison escort service. And he has successfully implemented the government's controversial prison privatisation programme, despite criticism of conditions at the first privatised prison. But last week's furore over the transfer of prisoners is the sort of political problem that a career civil servant would have spotted instantly. It demonstrates the need to ensure that those coming from outside the civil service get the advice they need for working in what Mr Lewis has himself described as 'a goldfish bowl'. More accountable However, these events clearly demonstrate one strength of the government's civil service reforms. The creation of agencies headed by a publicly-identifiable chief executive was intended to make public services more accountable. Ms Hepplewhite and Mr Lewis have both experienced the consequences of that accountability in their separate ways. Indeed, it can be argued that Ms Hepplewhite has taken the rap for others who should share responsibility for the problems of the Child Support Agency. These include the Treasury officials who imposed unrealistically high targets for savings that forced the agency to pursue fathers already paying some maintenance. The policymakers who ignored advice that would have made the maintenance formula more acceptable also have a case to answer. Anonymous civil servants inside Whitehall departments are much less accountable than agency chief executives, as the events surrounding the arms to Iraq scandal and the debacle over the pit closures illustrated.</p>

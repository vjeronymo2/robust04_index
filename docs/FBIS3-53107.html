The Monday issue of the newspaper AL-MU'TAMAR, citing Iraqi  opposition sources, adds that approximately 1,250 citizens have  arrived at the Iranian borders in extremely bad condition after  having escaped death from Saddam Husayn's attack on the southern  marshes. The same sources add that the fleeing citizens include  hundreds of children and elderly people. Some of the displaced  persons perished during the journey to the Iranian border after  being hit with large-caliber artillery shells that followed  them. The paper adds that the number of casualties is not known,  but eyewitnesses among the displaced persons have stated that  during their journey they saw many scorched and torn bodies of  defenseless inhabitants of the marshes.</p>

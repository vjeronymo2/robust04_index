			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / US plant spending to rise by 8.8% US businesses plan to increase investments in plant and equipment by 8.8 per cent this year, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The upward revision of the business capital spending survey from June is in line with economists' expectations that capital investment will continue to play a leading role in economic growth in 1994, despite higher interest rates. The Commerce Department reported that the 5,000 businesses surveyed in July and August said they were planning to spend Dollars 638bn (Pounds 411.6bn) this year, up from Dollars 587bn last year, on constructing and modernising buildings, installing new computer systems and upgrading equipment and machinery. The figures are not adjusted for inflation. The survey was in line with predictions that investments would rise for the third straight year. Business investment grew by 7.3 per cent in 1993, after a 3.4 per cent rise in 1992. If yesterday's forecast is realised it will be the biggest jump in capital investment since the 1989 increase of 11.4 per cent. The July-August report is the final estimate of business spending plans for the year and follows the June survey which forecast an 8.3 per cent rise in investment spending this year. According to the survey, manufacturers plan to increase investment by 7.3 per cent, compared to a 3.1 per cent rise last year. Non-manufacturing businesses said they would increase investment spending by 9.5 per cent, following the jump of 9.3 per cent in 1993. Industries with the largest increases planned for 1994 are blast furnaces and steel works (39.7 per cent), cars (28.9 per cent), stone, clay and glass manufacturers (21.7 per cent) and electrical machinery (11.3 per cent).</p>

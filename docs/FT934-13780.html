			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Taiwan seeks fresh start to BAe joint venture talks: UK team in effort to salvage regional jet project TAIWAN Aerospace Corporation is seeking a fresh start to negotiations with British Aerospace on their troubled and long drawn out efforts to set up a joint venture to manufacture regional jets. 'Under the structure of the original initialled agreement, there is no way for the two sides to break through their impasse. The best way would be to start new talks,' Mr George Liu, senior vice-president and TAC spokesman, said yesterday. The Taiwan side will also press its demand for a legal commitment from BAe to co-develop an advanced two-engine passenger jet when talks between TAC and Mr John Cahill, BAe chairman, begin today. Mr Cahill is leading a team of BAe technical and financial specialists seeking to salvage the joint venture proposal which is an integral part of the company's overall restructuring and recovery strategy. Collapse of the Taiwanese joint-venture project could lead to some 3,000 job losses at BAe's Woodford plant, near Manchester, if the UK group decides it has no alternative but to halt its regional jet activities. The company, however, has indicated in recent days it could continue regional jet activities in the UK even if the Taiwan deal fell through. But many aerospace industry analysts believe the future of these operations would be severely compromised if Mr Cahill fails in his effort to revive the joint-venture proposal. Mr Cahill's team yesterday made contact with Mr David Howell, chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee who also arrived in Taipei last night. Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, is also due to arrive today with a delegation of UK industrialists. Mr Cahill and Mr Earle Hou, TAC chairman, are expected to meet today to see if discussions can be resumed. Talks last month collapsed after TAC called on BAe to provide a detailed written commitment to co-develop an advanced two-engine 'RJX' regional passenger jet, in addition to the existing RJ aircraft based on the BAe 146 four-engine regional airliner. Such a project could entail research and development costs of about Pounds 1bn. BAe is also seeking assurances that the TAC board and management will be strengthened. Mr Denny Ko, who signed the original agreement with BAe, resigned this month as president. Mr Hou has also indicated he wants to resign as chairman. Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs renewed its support for TAC to continue talks with BAe in a written statement yesterday: 'The government believes this project will be beneficial in upgrading our aerospace industry. Therefore, we have provided proper assistance and necessary support. However, at present, the two sides still have a gap in understanding and need to continue to seek consensus.'

The  North Rhine-Westphalian Interior Ministry in Duesseldorf  confirmed a report in the NEUE RUHR/RHEIN ZEITUNG paper,  (Saturday's edition), according to which they will be returned  by aircraft via the Romanian town of Temesvar and thereafter  proceed by bus to the Serbian border.    Those involved numbered "probably a few thousand" refugees  whose applications for asylum were rejected. People from rump  Yugoslavia who were living in Germany illegally or who had  committed criminal offenses were also likely to be deported, the  report said.</p>

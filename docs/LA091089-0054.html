			<p><P> September 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FREQUENT FLAP  </P> <P> After reading the article "Why Frequent Fliers Are Frequently Denied" (Savvy  Traveler, Aug. 20), it strikes me as strange that you would allow such a poorly  researched and biased article to be published.  </P> <P> The article naively indicates that (Peter) Greenberg expected to pick up the  telephone and have a free seat available on the flight and day of his choice,  apparently on very quick notice, since he indicated that the response he  received from TWA was that "seats might not be available until October."  October was less than six weeks away.  </P> <P> I have accumulated in excess of 1 million miles in one airline's frequent-flier  program and also travel extensively on other airlines. I find all of the  airlines to be courteous and helpful in assisting me.  </P> <P> LYMAN J. BISHOP  </P> <P> Laguna Niguel  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Buy-out team seeks to spur sale of MGN SIR PETER PARKER, the recently appointed chairman of the management buy-out team at Mirror Group Newspapers, is planning a meeting with senior bankers in an attempt to speed up the sale of the popular newspaper group. There is growing concern in the buy-out team, which includes Mr Richard Stott, editor of the Daily Mirror, that more than three months after the death of Mr Robert Maxwell no formal data is being made available. Since the collapse of the Maxwell empire the future of MGN is largely in the hands of big banks. The banks hold the 51 per cent of MGN shares that were owned by the private Maxwell interests. Sir Peter, a former chairman of British Rail, hopes that he can persuade the banks that it is in their interests to go for a sale as quickly as possible. The buy-out team fears that delays and uncertainties, particularly over issues such as the MGN pension fund, could damage morale at the Mirror group. There is also concern about the high interest rates that the newspaper group is having to pay on the short-term funding. Sir Peter's team, backed by Electra, the venture capital group, believes that the basic numbers have not changed since early December. Enough unaudited data should now be available to enable a bid to be put together. The fear is that both Mr John Talbot, the Arthur Andersen administrator, and the banks are taking a relaxed view about the future of MGN because it is profitable. There are even signs that if no immediate buyers come forward the banks are prepared to continue running the group for the foreseeable future. The danger is that the Mirror titles could suffer in the highly competitive popular newspaper marketplace where games backed by heavy television promotion can be vital for maintaining circulation. Yesterday The Sun launched a new Pounds 1m bingo competition. The Daily Mirror is expected to launch its own bingo game soon. Meanwhile Daily Mirror journalists have discovered that despite uncertainties about the precise level of pensions in the event of their death in service their dependents will be cared for. Insurance premiums have been paid on members of the pension fund so that widows of Mirror journalists, for example, would receive a lump sum equal to three times salary plus continuing payments of a quarter of salary. An MGN executive last night challenged the view that the group might be a deteriorating asset if a sale does not happen quickly. 'MGN will increase in value and will get a higher price,' the executive said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Usti Nad Labem, North Bohemia, May 21 (CTK) --  Delegates at the first congress of the Czech Borderlands Club  (KCP) have called on President Vaclav Havel to retract his  apology for the expulsion of the Sudeten German population from  Czechoslovakia after World War Two. Havel has on several  occasions condemned the expulsions, which were the result of  decrees made by President Edvard Benes in 1945 and which  affected over 2.5 million people.    The Czech Borderlands Club was formed in 1992 in an attempt  to counter the "Germanisation" of Czech border regions and now  has 10,000 registered members.    The KCP congress sent a letter today to the Czech government  and parliament protesting against the possibility of Czech NATO  membership and involvement in the Partnership for Peace project.  The club demands Czech neutrality.    Participants applauded as they heard deputy Kvetoslava  Celisova (Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia) dismiss  parliament as a body of people enriching themselves at other  people's expense and Ognan Tuleskov (chairman of the  non-parliamentary Christian Social Movement) declare that  government coalition parties were financed by German foundations.    Speakers reviled the government for condoning Germany's  economic "Drang nach Osten' ("push to the east") and condemned  the "humiliating rate of the Czech crown in relation to the  German mark".    Among delegates were former Communist Party general  secretary  for the Usti district Vaclav Sipek, communist-era  editor-in-chief of the daily RUDE PRAVO Zdenek Horeni and other  erstwhile functionaries of the communist regime.</p>

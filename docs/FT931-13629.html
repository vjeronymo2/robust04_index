			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Mediocredito banks on new look - Robert Graham examines the Italian state entity's expanded brief MEDIOCREDITO Centrale has become the latest Italian state entity to begin the process of transformation into a joint stock company. But at a time when the Amato government is seeking to radically cut back the state's dominant role in banking, Mediocredito, which specialises in credit for small and medium-size businesses and export finance, will remain firmly in the public sector. The new-look Mediocredito has a strong capital base, and with its expanded brief is likely to become a prominent player not only in Italian banking but also on the international scene, especially raising funds on the money markets. Traditional activities in export finance and funding small and medium-size companies will be subject to greater transparency. At the same time, Mediocredito is expected to diversify more, developing its merchant banking business, beginning project finance at home and abroad and marketing new financial products, as well as playing a part in underwriting the huge privatisation programme envisaged by the government. The board approved the new statutes a month ago for the joint stock company, giving it net worth of L2,181bn (Dollars 1,581m) and L1,906bn capital. The capital essentially derives from the entity's previous endowment fund which came from direct state contributions. The board itself, headed by Mr Gianfranco Imperatori, which prepared the change during the course of the year, will remain unchanged. It is now up to the Bank of Italy to given final endorsement to Mediocredito's new status Initially, the Treasury will hold all the 190.6m shares with a nominal value of L10,000 but only 95.3m shares will be issued. All Mediocredito's previous obligations will be guaranteed by the Treasury and transfered to the new joint stock company. According to Mediocredito's projections, it anticipates a net profit of L47bn next year against an estimated L15bn in 1992. Over the next four years, it expects the use of resources to grow on average by more than 12 per cent per annum. Mediocredito is an odd hybrid - part state agency, part medium-term lending institution. In its latter capacity, it provided subsidised credit to banks helping small and medium-size businesses finance modernisation, technical innovation and expansion. Further, it distributed funds coming from the European Investment Bank and used its state ownership to raise funds at the most competitive rates, which were in turn used by a network of regional state-controlled medium-term lending institutions - the Mediocredito Regionali. In tandem, it sought to promote the internationalisation of Italian industry through export credit, development assistance funding and joint ventures. In 1991, Mediocredito's financing of small and medium-sized enterprises amounted to L2,179bn. This mainly consisted of refinancing capital investments, management of guarantee funds and the subsidy of finance to acquire or lease plant and machinery. While maintaining this side of the business - and ensuring it complies with EC competition policy rules - Mediocredito's management wants to take the initiative in easing the heavy burden of debt among small and medium-sized enterprises. At present, some 65 per cent of their debt is at crippling short term rates. The aim is to provide refinancing packages which encourage both the acquisition of new technology, better management techniques and mergers. On the merchant banking side, it can now acquire stakes in financial groups and companies with 'public interest purposes'. Through its subsidiaries, Sofipa and Lombardia Fincapital, it can promote risk capital ventures. All these latter activities as well as direct export credit financing, are regarded as non-agency work. As agent for the state, Mediocredito subsidises interest payments on loans used to finance Italian export supply contracts in non-EC countries. Last year this activity amounted to L5,327bn. In parallel, Mediocredito has since 1987 managed a special fund to finance development aid and assist Italian companies in developing country joint ventures. Such joint ventures must assist the host country's use of resources and improve the balance of payments. Italian companies for their part must, as a rule, put up 50 per cent of the risk capital. In 1991, this activity amounted to L9,694bn covering ventures especially in Egypt but also in Argentina and Brazil. This is an area Mediocredito is anxious to expand along with greater assistance in the funding of market studies, promotion of export opportunities and aid to overseas sales offices. Mediocredito sees itself as a catalyst in encouraging more small and medium-sized companies to look abroad for market opportunities.</p>

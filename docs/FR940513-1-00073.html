			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Because today's proposed regulation involves the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application of both RACT and MACT, impacts for each standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were determined separately. In order to avoid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overestimation or double-counting, and because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for RACT are more stringent than MACT, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts for facilities affected by RACT (i.e., facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with gasoline throughputs of greater than 790 million L/yr  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5 million bbl/yr) or crude oil throughputs of greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16 billion L/yr (100 million bbl/yr)) were calculated first,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and were discounted when determining the impacts for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities affected by MACT (i.e., facilities emitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater than 1 Mg/yr of HAP).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. RACT Threshold Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Administrator is proposing Regulatory Alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II as the regulatory threshold for the RACT standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative II would require controls for crude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil loadings at facilities with an crude oil marine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughput of approximately 15,900 L/yr (100 million bbl/yr)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more, and gasoline loadings at facilities with a gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> throughput of approximately 795 million L/yr (5 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bbl/yr). Approximately 25 terminals (1.5 percent of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminals) will be affected if the thresholds for Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative II are implemented. In addition, under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative, only a small volume of U.S. marine vessels will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need to be retrofitted. It is anticipated that only those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels that are least costly to retrofit would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retrofitted. Approximately 76 percent of the VOC emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from all marine terminals would be controlled at an average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost effectiveness of approximately $770/Mg of VOC reduced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Regulatory Alternative II.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Administrator believes that the incremental cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectiveness ($5,000/Mg) of going beyond Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative II is inappropriate given this standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative III was strongly considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the additional 35 terminals controlled under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative III would produce only an additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eight percent reduction in nationwide emissions. Of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 35 additional terminals, as many as 25 could be under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased competitive pressure, compared to only up to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five terminals under Regulatory Alternative II. (Increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive pressure refers to the situation where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled terminal is in direct competition with a much  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> smaller or larger terminal. The smaller terminal may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled and the larger terminal may be able to control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapors more effectively on a per-barrel basis. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled terminal could be forced to absorb some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control costs, reduce throughput, substitute nonregulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products, or close the facility.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the more stringent regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives considered involved control of commodities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which have vapor pressures much lower than gasoline and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> crude oil. Emissions generally correspond to the vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure of the commodity being loaded. Gasoline and crude  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil generally have the highest vapor pressures, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore present better control alternatives. Because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic and other environmental impacts of Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative II are reasonable and should not place an undue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burden on industry or the environment, the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected Regulatory Alternative II as representative of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RACT.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 4. Selection of Emission Control Technologies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Emission Control Standards for RACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Control of marine vessel loading emissions requires the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture of displaced vapors and efficient control of vapors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once captured. Vessels loading at facilities with controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must install a vapor collection system and pass one of three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank vessel tightness alternatives to ensure good capture of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapors. The tightness alternative may be one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following: (1) A leak check performed during loading on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components using Method 21 of appendix A of 40 CFR part 60;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) a pressure test, where the internal tanks are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressurized and the pressure drop is monitored over time to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine if the vessel is tight; or (3) for noninerted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels (i.e., vessels having tanks that are not blanketed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with nonreactive gas during loading to ensure that vapors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tanks are below the explosive range), load the vessel at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than atmospheric pressure. These tightness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives are the same as those promulgated in the NESHAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for benzene (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). The EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have sufficient data necessary to determine at what point  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel leaks affect the operation and efficiency of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control system; however, the Agency believes that the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tightness alternatives proposed are sufficient to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the collection of nearly all displaced vapors. The EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes that once assured of good capture and collection of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the vapors through the tightness tests, facilities can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrate on the operation and maintenance of the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> device as a means of ensuring compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA is proposing that vapor emissions captured from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marine tank vessel loading operations can be controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> using one of two primary methods: Combustion or recovery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary devices used for combustion of vapors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flares, enclosed flares (often referred to as thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxidizers), catalytic incinerators, and thermal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incinerators. The primary methods for recovery of vapors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include carbon adsorption, absorption, refrigeration, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vapor balancing. In States with marine tank vessel loading  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that allow both combustion and recovery, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control devices are evenly split between enclosed flares and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon adsorption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

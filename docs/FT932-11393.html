			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Levi Strauss rejects investment in China LEVI STRAUSS, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer known world-wide for its denim jeans, will not make direct investments in China and will reduce its use of contractors there because of the country's human rights record, writes Louise Kehoe in San Francisco. The company spent six months studying the issue, a spokesman said, and concluded that China's human rights record 'is not consistent with our global sourcing guidelines' adopted a year ago. These cover issues such as working conditions, contractors' employment practices, and health and safety records. Levi, a privately held company, has operations in about 40 countries and had worldwide revenues last year of Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.56bn). Although it had been considering an investment in China for a few years, there were no specific proposals, the company said. Levi will begin to cut its use of sewing and finishing contractors in China, with a phased reduction. The decision will be reviewed every six months. Levi has no direct investment in China. It uses about 30 contractors there who sew and launder jeans and other products for export, accounting for about 2 per cent of worldwide production.</p>

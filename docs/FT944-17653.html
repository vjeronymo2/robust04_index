			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Tetra Pak loses appeal against fine Tetra Pak, the Swedish packaging group, yesterday lost an appeal against an Ecu75m (Dollars 93m) fine levied by the European Commission, but said it was almost certain to contest the decision in the European Court. The Commission imposed the fine in 1991, arguing the group had abused its dominant position between 1982 and 1986 by deliberately trying to stifle competition. The fine - the Commission's biggest against a single company - was equivalent to 2 per cent of the group's 1990 turnover. The company's attempt to have the fine overturned by the European Court of First Instance has been rejected. The wrangle centres on market definitions. Brussels argues the Swedish company's position in 'aseptically filled carton packages' is too dominant. Tetra Pak does not deny this, but says the dominance - equal to as much as 80 per cent of the market - is not surprising because it invented the aseptically filled carton package concept. But it argues that its share of the wider 'liquid food' market is a more relevant yardstick. Here it only has a 15 per cent share because of competition from cans and plastic and glass bottles. Mr Christer Hedelin, Tetra Pak International general counsel, said: 'We are extremely disappointed that the court has chosen to remain with the old traditional way of looking at market forces.' The company says it is 'most likely' to appeal.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / MPs may call for Lamont inquiry PROTESTS that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might have breached rules on MPs' interests by accepting help towards the cost of evicting a tenant from his private house are to be considered by a Commons committee, Ralph Atkins writes. Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, chairman of the committee on members' interests, confirmed yesterday that complaints raised by Labour MPs at the weekend would be looked at before Christmas. If the cross-party committee decides there is a case for Mr Lamont to answer, it could launch a formal inquiry into the affair in the new year. The row is over the Pounds 18,000 Mr Lamont received from an unnamed Tory party benefactor towards the cost of evicting a 'sex therapist' from his London house last year. A further Pounds 4,700, paid for by the Treasury, is already subject to an inquiry by the National Audit Office. Whitehall officials believe the NAO will almost certainly recommend tougher accounting procedures for the recording of such payments because of their political sensitivity. The Treasury said it gave Mr Lamont help because the credibility of the chancellor, in his public functions, was at stake and that guidelines on the behaviour of ministers were followed.</p>

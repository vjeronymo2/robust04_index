			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / UK Company News: BMSS falls Pounds 16,000 into the red AN 'unprecedentedly low' level of demand from the construction industry was cited as the principal cause of a fall into losses at BMSS in the six months to July 31. The USM-quoted timber and building materials merchant reported a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 16,000, against a profit of Pounds 254,000 last time. Turnover slipped from Pounds 8.56m to Pounds 8.28m. Losses per share came out at 0.1p (2.2p earnings). In view of the uncertain climate, the directors said, it was considered advisable to conserve the company's resources. In light of this it had decided to pass the interim dividend - 2p was paid last time.</p>

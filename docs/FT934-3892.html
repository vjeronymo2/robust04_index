			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Observer: Trading places Michael Heseltine is a busy man. Not content with being Britain's secretary of state for trade and industry - where he likes to be known as 'president'  -he is also now substitute for the foreign office's centre forward, Douglas Hurd. Yesterday Hurd had to miss a European Union foreign ministers' meeting on Gatt in order to address Parliament on Hong Kong. Hurd's EU place was nobly taken by Heseltine, known as Tarzan by sections of the British media, who swung into action. The Foreign Office denies that David Heathcote-Amory, Britain's EU minister, was thereby snubbed. 'An entirely normal' switch, given Tarzan's trade interests, it says. So normal in fact that the FCO couldn't recall a previous example of it ever happening.</p>

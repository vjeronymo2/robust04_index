			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 12 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Thursday [12 May] Japan's Constitution prohibits the  country's involvement in collective security, brushing aside  concerns that his government may move toward active military  actions overseas. Hata said at a plenary session of the House  of Representatives, "I think collective security is beyond the  boundary of the Constitution, and it is in practice not  permitted."    "I have no intention to change" the conventional  interpretation of the Constitution by the postwar Japanese  Government on the issue, he said. He was responding to a query  by Yohei Kono, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, the  No. 1 opposition party.    Hata's remarks were apparently designed to dodge criticism  and ease apprehension among opposition lawmakers that his  cabinet is moving toward more active involvement by Japan's  Self-Defense Forces in international conflicts.    Although Japan, as a sovereign nation, has rights for  collective security in terms of international law, Hata argued  the war-denouncing Constitution only grants Japan the "minimum  necessary" rights for self-defense.    Hata also displayed a cautious stance toward the proposed  legislation to deal with international crises. The issue  requires a "highly political judgment" and "should be considered  cautiously," he said.    The statement is an apparent effort to distance himself from  some key cabinet members, including Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa, who recently called for early steps toward legislation  for dealing with international emergencies, such as the crisis  over North Korea's suspected nuclear arms program.    Hata noted the importance of diplomatic efforts to solve the  North Korea nuclear issue, while adding Japan should cooperate  with any UN Security Council actions "within the framework of  the Constitution."    On the question of alleged financial impropriety by his  predecessor Morihiro Hosokawa, Hata tried to avoid any  commitment to further action.    Calling it Hosokawa's "private problems," Hata suggested he  is reluctant to consent to opposition calls for the former  premier's Diet testimony over corruption charges that toppled  him from office last month.    Hata also tried to heal the emotional wounds caused by  former  Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano's recent remarks over Japan's  role in World War II. He said the outcry by Japan's Asian  neighbors over the remarks "renewed his acknowledgement that  Japan's aggressive actions and colonial rule (during the war)  inflicted unbearable pain and sorrow on some Asian people."    Nagano, who said the so-called Nanjing massacre was a  "fabrication" and denied Japan waged an aggressive war on Asian  nations, resigned last Saturday amid a diplomatic controversy  over his remarks. Hata said he handled the problem without  delay, and has sought and obtained "understanding" from  infuriated Asian countries.    In an interview published May 4 in the mass-circulation  daily  MAINICHI SHIMBUN, Nagano said, "the Nanjing incident was a  fabrication." "I think it is wrong to define the war as a war  of aggression (by Japan)...still, I doubt the Greater East Asia  War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression."    Nagano, 71, a former chief of staff of the Ground  Self-Defense Force, resigned Saturday after serving for only 10  days as justice minister. He was succeeded by Hiroshi Nakai.</p>

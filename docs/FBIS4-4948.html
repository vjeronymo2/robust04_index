			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 6 (YONHAP) -- South Korean and  U.S. officials held a trade subcommittee meeting here to discuss  pending issues on Monday and Tuesday.    According to the South Korean Embassy, the United States  expressed disappointment that no progress had been made on  Korea's opening its market to American automobiles at the 16th  working-level meeting.    South Korea, however, said that Trade, Industry and Energy  Minister Kim Chol-su and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor  can discuss the matter while in Morocco this month for the  signing of the Uruguay Round agreement.    Washington also complained about the way Seoul handles  protection of U.S. trademarks and intellectual property rights  and demanded the lifting of a regulation on importation of  frozen codfish heads and sausages.    South Korea expressed concern over the revival of the Super  301 trade provision while protesting the U.S. delay in a new  dumping trial for Korean-made color televisions and inclusion of  Korean standard pipes in a list coming under anti-dumping  regulations.    Seoul urged Washington to acknowledge its efforts to protect  U.S. intellectual property rights and drop it from the Priority  Watch List (PWL).    Moreover, South Korea voiced concern over a U.S. court  ruling  on "business secret violence" between Korea's Iljin Corp. and  America's General Electric.    The two nations also discussed ways to narrow their  differences in the investment and service sectors.    Chong Ui-yong, director-general of the Foreign Ministry's  International Trade Bureau, led the Korean delegation while  Peter Collins, deputy assistant trade representative, headed the  U.S. side.</p>

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Now comes the hard part: A look at the wider implications of the deal between the Palestinians and Israel Long after the hullabaloo surrounding today's peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians fades, one image may linger in Middle Eastern minds: that of a lonely farmhouse in the Norwegian countryside outside Oslo. It was in such a place - or a number of such places - that senior officials from Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation set out earlier this year towards their historic agreements on mutual recognition and on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, conquered by Israel in 1967. Although assisted by low-key Norwegian mediators, they did it in direct talks, without the participation or knowledge of any of the powerful outsiders, from the US, Europe or the moderate Arab states, who have expended such vast amounts of time and energy in seeking a settlement to the Middle East's most intractable conflict. Today, as the deal is consummated with a glitzy signing ceremony in Washington, the discussions in that farmhouse seem a more telling pointer to prospects for the wider region. The PLO and Israel had to look one another in the eye, essentially in solitude, to begin to overcome decades of hostility. So, too, the Israelis and the other Arab states - traditionally obsessed by internecine rivalry, manipulation of external patrons and empty rhetoric about Arab unity - are now on their own as they seek to chart a way forward to peaceful co-existence. That is the reality that underlies all the current hyperbole about a 'new Middle East', Marshall Plans, high-level western involvement in furthering the peace process, and ambitious regional public works programmes. Western political and financial support can certainly help. But in the end, it is the countries of the region that will determine whether the comprehensive peace suddenly in prospect establishes a mood of trust and mutual dependence rather than simply a grudging and irritable end to hostilities. Perhaps more urgently than at any time since the end of the first world war, when Britain and France secretly connived to carve the region's present nation states out of the Ottoman empire, these countries have to discover what they have in common, and how they can live as normal neighbours. As among the states of western Europe after world war two, the basis for their co-operation will have to be economic as much as political. As in Europe for four subsequent decades, any new order will in the eyes of Israel and of some Arab governments be constantly subject to an ideological challenge from within and without: that of militant Islam, both home-grown and fomented from the east by the Islamic Republic of Iran. The question is: are the partners really prepared for peace, for the regional integration this implies, and for the shift in strategic and economic alliances with the world at large which will surely follow? The Israeli government and business establishment evidently thinks so. Mr Shimon Peres, Israel's foreign minister who brokered the deal with the PLO in Oslo, has spoken of a 'new era' in regional co-operation with moderates on both sides joining forces to foster economic growth and combat political extremism, and is looking to the European Community to encourage regional integration in a new association agreement. Expectations of the commercial dividends peace could bring have fuelled a 10 per cent rise in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange over the past two weeks, and have prompted a renewed flurry of interest in Israel, notably on the part of European and Japanese companies. The euphoria is understandable, but premature. Today's signatures in Washington merely begin the endgame of a peace which must be hammered out in detail and sealed in treaties. Jordan, Syria and Lebanon have still to accomplish their first steps along the road: agreement on declarations of principles to guide their own talks. Even when they have done so - and the Syrian-Israeli negotiations in particular are likely to be slow and difficult - serious sources of instability in the Middle East will remain unaddressed, notably the Gulf, where Saddam Hussein's pariah state of Iraq has no part in the peace process and Iran is fiercely opposed to it. The race to acquire arms of all kinds continues unchecked all over the region, and could itself become a casus belli if Israel feels compelled to act against efforts by its enemies to acquire weapons of mass destruction. It is hardly the most auspicious climate in which to embark on an experiment in co-existence. That is, nevertheless, what Israel has set out to create. The hope must be that it can lead through example by transforming its relationship with the Palestinians. If it succeeds, change for the better could radiate into the region, underpinned by the financial might of Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and by expanding international trade. The Israelis and Palestinians are the critical test case. In agreeing on self-rule for the Palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories, the PLO and Israel have opted for a gradual separation between two peoples locked for 26 years in unhappy and unequal marriage. Provided they can keep their respective extremists in check, and provided Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO leader, can effect a rapid and visible improvement in economic conditions in the territories, there is a chance that the political separation will eventually provide for a new relationship based on something resembling mutual respect. What the Palestinians cannot afford is a complete divorce. Their lives are too closely intermingled with those of the Israelis. For the foreseeable future they will continue to depend on salaries earned by Palestinian workers in Israel, and they will need to maintain the freest of trading links with their Jewish neighbours if the businessmen of the West Bank and the diaspora are to be encouraged to invest in productive enterprises. The extent to which they see potential returns rather than humiliation in such heavy dependence on their much more powerful Israeli neighbour will in large part determine whether their experiment succeeds. The Palestinian proto-state will also be heavily dependent on the Kingdom of Jordan to the east, next in line to sign a declaration of principles with Israel. As well as establishing a free-trade zone with Israel, the Palestinians will need liberal trading arrangements across the Jordan river as a conduit to the wider Arab world. The next natural step would be free trade between all three countries - even, Mr Peres has suggested, some form of economic union a la Benelux. Such an agreement, however, will be hard to achieve. A recent Harvard University report remarks that 'broad scale free trade between Israel and Jordan would take longer, for Jordanian firms have not until now been subject to Israeli competition'. That is a foretaste of the problems ahead in dismantling the encrusted barriers between Israel and the Arab world. The Israeli economy is twice the size of that of its most powerful Arab neighbour, Egypt, although its population is only one tenth as large. The Arab world has nothing resembling the Jewish state's most dynamic companies. All Israel's relatively impoverished neighbours will be very wary of allowing their economies to be penetrated by such unsettling forces. The sole precedent, Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel, is distinctly unpropitious in this regard. Trade and investment flows since have been limited. As important, overall intra-Arab trade and investment is very underdeveloped. For decades, the Middle East has been composed of siege economies with their best talent and the best part of their national resources devoted to war. The vast majority of Arab exports - whether of oil from the Arabian peninsula or of potash, textiles and agricultural produce from the Levant and North Africa - is sold to the industrial countries of the US, Europe and Asia rather than locally. Capital accumulated in the Arab world has a habit of taking flight to western financial centres rather than being put to productive use at home. Few Arab regimes have yet got far with structural reforms aimed at invigorating their sclerotic economies. And none of their attempts at creating a meaningful regional economic grouping has long survived the political rivalries and frictions which have always eclipsed economic considerations in their minds. Arab suspicion of the Israeli embrace is epitomised by Syria, still engaged in an arms build-up and in dispute with Israel over the Golan Heights, captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel has yet to promise a complete withdrawal from the Golan as demanded by Syria's President Hafez al-Assad. He has not promised the 'full peace' - including an exchange of ambassadors and free movement of goods and people - that Israel wants in return. The danger, in Israeli eyes, is that an eventual treaty with Syria will in practice be no better than the 'cold peace' with Egypt. Mr Assad has concerns of his own: in particular, the maintenance of his own power, embodied in one of the region's most repressive regimes. He has recently shed much of his Baath party's quasi-socialist ideology to initiate a cautious programme of economic reform. But this is a far cry from the sort of economic opening that would be required under any broad attempt at regional economic integration. Anything more radical might undermine his military power base. Syria epitomises another reason for caution about the prospects for a comprehensive and durable Arab-Israeli peace: the uncertainty surrounding the present generation of one-man Middle Eastern regimes. President Assad has serious health problems, and the succession to him is impossible to predict. There is a feeling of fin de regime, too, in Jordan, whose leader, King Hussein, has recently been treated for cancer. He is busily striving to ensure he will be succeeded by a more democratic form of constitutional monarchy. But his kingdom has an unstable history and his subjects - divided along fault lines of religion and origin - have largely been held together by his personality. Since a majority of the population considers itself Palestinian, any instability in the West Bank and Gaza would immediately infect Jordan's body politic. In Egypt, the most important and populous Arab country by far, the authority of President Hosni Mubarak is not in immediate doubt. Next month, he is expected to win a referendum and sail into a third, six-year term. But there, too, stability is not guaranteed. Islamic extremism is on the march, with fundamentalist groups conducting violent attacks on western tourists, government ministers and security forces. The government's response has been heavy-handed and unimaginative, and may simply be fuelling the problem. The regime's difficulties are exacerbated by growing concern about its relationship with its crucial patron, the US, expressed in Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) a year of financial and military aid. Paradoxically, a wider Arab-Israeli agreement may diminish Washington's previous interest in Egypt as the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel. Although the Clinton administration has said it will assure this aid through to 1995, there can be no guarantee it will be held at such levels thereafter. Without the US bounty, Cairo's ability to maintain domestic stability and keep the extremists in check would be open to serious question. In these domestic political and economic problems in the Arab world lies perhaps the most important reason why it is still too early to talk of a new era of peace and economic co-operation in the Middle East. Income disparities between the states of the region, and within them, remain potent sources of conflict and provide nutrition for Islamic opposition to unrepresentative Arab regimes. Iraq, still besieged by United Nations sanctions, continues to fulminate against the wealthy, US-protected Gulf states to its south. Iran, the most populous and powerful Gulf country, is busy rebuilding its military after eight years of war with Iraq and has been identified by Israel and its Arab partners as a serious source of trouble - especially in its perceived influence over Islamic movements from Algiers to Amman. It is in the battle between such forces and the emergent Arab-Israeli 'alliance for peace' that the future of the region will be determined. Only when it has been concluded will it be possible to tell whether today's accord represents the first gasp of a new Middle Eastern order or a dying gasp of the old.  --------------------------------------------- MIDDLE EAST: THE SEARCH FOR A STABLE NEW ORDER  --------------------------------------------- Egypt Population:                              57.3m GDP:                            Dollars 29.6bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 2.47bn  --------------------------------------------- Israel Population:                               5.1m GDP:                            Dollars 58.4bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 6.76bn  --------------------------------------------- Jordan Population:                               4.4m GDP:                             Dollars 4.1bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 0.51bn  --------------------------------------------- Saudi Arabia Population:                              10.6m GDP:                           Dollars 105.2bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 14.5bn  --------------------------------------------- Iraq Population:                              18.4m GDP:                            Dollars 40.8bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 8.61bn  --------------------------------------------- Syria Population:                              13.2m GDP:                            Dollars 13.9bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 1.13bn  --------------------------------------------- Iran Population:                              55.5m GDP:                            Dollars 60.5bn Defence budget:                 Dollars 4.27bn  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), figures for Palestine (average of 1990 &amp; 1991); Harvard University  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

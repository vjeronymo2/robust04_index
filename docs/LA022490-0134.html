			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DELTA PLANS SHARP INCREASE IN L.A.-S.F. SERVICE;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: THE CARRIER HOPES TO FILL A VOID LEFT BY AMERICAN'S PULLBACK. USAIR  SAYS IT WILL END ALL LONG BEACH FLIGHTS.  </P> <P> Delta Air Lines will greatly expand its presence in the hotly contested air  corridor between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the airline said Friday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, USAir said it will abandon all of its flights in and out of the Long  Beach airport at the beginning of May because of lack of business.  </P> <P> Beginning June 1, Delta said, it will operate 16 round-trip flights a day --  more than five times the three flights it now operates on the route. The  flights will leave hourly.  </P> <P> "Western Air Lines (which Delta acquired four years ago) had similar-type  service before our merger," Al Kolakowski, Atlanta-based Delta's vice  president-sales, said in a telephone interview. "But we put it aside to  allocate our equipment elsewhere.  </P> <P> "It has been part of our long-range growth plan to get back in the market, and  the time is appropriate now," Kolakowski said. "When we go into a route, we  stay there. This is a long-term commitment. We know this is a tough market.  There is a lot of capacity, but on a level playing field we think we can have  an impact in the market."  </P> <P> The Delta action follows by a month United Airlines' announcement that it would  boost its service between Los Angeles and San Francisco to a flight every half  hour between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.  </P> <P> Observers said the added competition could mean a drop in fares. At the moment,  according to Delta, fares range from $136 one way for an advance purchase  ticket to $180 for a ticket purchased at the last minute.  </P> <P> Delta said Friday that it had not planned to announce the flight expansion yet.  However, its chief pilot, Harold Alger, "jumped the gun" in a tape-recorded  telephone message to pilots. As a result, word got out to the public about the  airline's plans.  </P> <P> The announcement was "a bit premature," Kolakowski said. "A number of  operational considerations had not been finalized."  </P> <P> Delta, according to its chief pilot's message, will operate four 107-seat  Boeing 737 aircraft on the route.  </P> <P> Analysts said Delta felt that there was a significant opportunity as a result  of American Airlines' action in the last 18 months of pulling back about 40% in  the California corridor. In addition, USAir, another major player in the  corridor, is losing money in the market. Its Chairman Edwin I. Colodny had said  in a recent interview that competition was so stiff on the corridor that no one  could make money there.  </P> <P> "Both United and Delta have watched American's presence decline and have seen  USAir as a victim, so they are turning the heat up," said Daniel I. Hersh,  airline analyst with Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los Angeles investment  firm. "United and Delta are looking for a windfall."  </P> <P> Hersh added that United and Delta are expanding their San Francisco-Los Angeles  service because "each seeks to establish itself as the top carrier for . . .  businessmen who want service and convenience and are willing to pay for it."  </P> <P> According to the Transportation Department, in the third quarter of 1989, the  latest period for which figures are available, United had a 27% share of the  market, USAir had 30.9% and American had 18.8%. Southwest Airlines has about 3%  of the market. During that three-month period, a total of 633,410 passengers  traveled up and down the corridor.  </P> <P> American's intentions concerning its future participation in the corridor  market are not known. "The entire market is under evaluation," Alton Becker  Jr., an American spokesman, said Friday. "American has not made a decision to  further increase in that market. We already have 12 (daily) round-trips between  Los Angeles and San Francisco, and we operate 13 daily flights between Los  Angeles and San Jose." USAir and United had no comment on Delta's move.  </P> <P> USAir said it was ending service at Long Beach because its flights have been  going out carrying loads of only 25% to 35% of capacity. USAir operates five  flights daily at Long Beach -- two to San Francisco, two to Las Vegas and one  to Phoenix.  </P> <P> A USAir spokesman said these routes could be adequately serviced with its  flights in and out of Los Angeles International Airport and John Wayne Airport  in Orange County.  </P></p>

Swomley.    The head of the delegation said he was deeply moved by  achievements made in Korea in political, economic, cultural and  other domains.    Pointing to distorted propaganda continued in the United  States on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, he said he  could witness with his own eyes the Korean People's Army  participating in the construction with shovels and helping  farmers in their work in countryside, not preparing a war.    He said he saw peaceful and happy Korean people's looks  through Korean visit.</p>

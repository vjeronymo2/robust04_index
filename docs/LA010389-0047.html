			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHAT'S ON THE MENU? IN CELEBRITY-CONSCIOUS L.A. IT'S OFTEN A FAMOUS NAME  </P> <P> Is Tom Lasorda fried mozzarella, escarole and beans, chopped liver or a  baseball manager?  </P> <P> It depends on whether you're seated in a Beverly Hills diner, an elegant  Westwood eatery, a Century City deli or the home team dugout at Dodger Stadium.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, a city where celebrity ranks next to godliness, fame is often  measured by the length of one's limousine. But there is also an emerging  culinary standard, a sort of adulation by mastication: At restaurants across  the city, actors, ballplayers and politicians are honored on a variety of  menus.  </P> <P> In some cases, such as the Robin Williams tongue and bologna triple-decker or  the Sylvester Stallone Italian sausage sandwich, the linkage is obvious. Some  items are named for stars because they actually frequent the joints and select  their favorite dish.  </P> <P> Other fare serves as a sign of the times, a barometer of who is hot and who is  not. Take the spicy shrimp and egg salad, served in a Century City deli. It's  otherwise known as the Tom Cruise celebrity club combo.  </P> <P> Politics can also play a part in dubbing the cuisine.  </P> <P> "We had a Mayor Yorty when we started out. But when Mayor Bradley was elected,  we put a line through Yorty and stuck in Bradley," said Bill Cullinane,  co-owner of the Substation near USC. "We eventually rotated Bradley out too. It  wasn't worth it. Some customers would say: Why Bradley? Why not someone else?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Contradictions  </P> <P> In certain cases, the naming of food items is fraught with contradictions.  </P> <P> For example, how could the egg salad and chopped liver triple-decker at the  Stage Deli in Century City be called the Cher, when it seemingly contained  several thousand more calories than the slender screen star noshes in a week?  The Cher was recently renamed the Bette Midler.  </P> <P> And how could Tom Lasorda be escarole and beans at Matteo's Italian restaurant  in Westwood but a chopped liver sandwich at the Stage? For that matter, how  could the skipper of the World Series champions be chopped liver anywhere?  </P> <P> Joe Ramboldt, local manager of the New York-based deli, isn't talking. "I don't  want to touch that one," he said. "But it certainly is not a reflection on the  Dodgers' season."  </P> <P> With little question, the bulbous baseball manager, who seems never to have met  a meal he didn't like, is the city's king of restaurant cuisine. Lasorda's name  can be found on menus from Venice to South Pasadena (including in his own two  restaurants, Tommy Lasorda's Ribs and Pasta).  </P> <P> "I'm honored to have such fine dishes named after me," said Lasorda, who often  speaks in saltier language.  </P> <P> Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Sinatra and Ronald Reagan are also popular choices  to eat.  </P> <P> The lame duck President is a baked ham and Swiss cheese triple-decker at the  Legends of Hollywood delicatessen; a liverwurst and bologna triple-decker at  the Stage; and a roast beef, ham and American cheese hero at the Substation.  </P> <P> "Most people would consider that the deluxe, a top-ender as opposed to the  bologna sub," Cullinane said. "It had been called the Ralph Nader for a long  time. But when Ronald Reagan became President, he took over the Nader."  </P> <P> Schwarzeneggers include a turkey, liver and salami triple-decker at Legends of  Hollywood; a muscle sandwich (No. 518, with avocados, veggies, cheese and  mushrooms on whole wheat) at Larry Parker's Beverly Hills 24-Hour Diner; and a  diced ham, shredded Swiss cheese and chopped tomatoes omelet at the Ocean Park  Omelette Parlor in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> "The omelet was made up by Arnold Schwarzenegger in 1979, and he used to eat  it," said Tony Casson of the Omelette Parlor chain. "But after we put it on the  menu, he stopped ordering it. I don't know if he was embarrassed about asking  for an omelet by his own name."  </P> <P> Now, Casson says, many other body builders wolf down the Schwarzenegger.  </P> <P> At C.J. Brett's, a Hermosa Beach sports bar co-owned by Kansas City Royals  third baseman George Brett, items are named after Wayne Gretzky, Wade Boggs and  the ubiquitous Tommy Lasorda -- here, it is littleneck clams in a garlic pesto  sauce over linguine.  </P> <P> Yet at Stats sports bar in Culver City, sandwiches are named after teams, not  stars.  </P> <P> "The way they trade players these days," mused chef Don Short, "you'd need to  make new menus each month. With free agency, you just can't afford it."  </P> <P> At some local hash houses, celebrity status is highly exclusive. Joe's in  Redondo Beach features only two -- the John Wayne breakfast and the Rudy's  Special, named after the diner's 15-year busboy.  </P> <P> "The John Wayne, that's it for Hollywood people," declared manager Bob Riddle.  "Basically, Joe the owner is a big John Wayne fan. He put pictures of John  Wayne on the walls, he imitates him, he claims he served the John Wayne Special  to John Wayne. He said John Wayne used to come in here. I don't know if that's  true or not."  </P> <P> For the record, the John Wayne ($4.50) is a tortilla covered with home fried  potatoes, topped with two eggs, cheese and Spanish sauce and surrounded by  sausages.  </P> <P> At Mort's Palisades Delicatessen, the sole celebrity sandwich memorializes the  late comedian Ted Knight, a longtime customer and friend of the management.  </P> <P> "Around here," said Mort's co-owner Bobbie Farberow, "we would ask if they want  to before we'd name a sandwich. Certain people we have as customers who come in  with their families would prefer to be a little anonymous."  </P> <P> Indeed, in the case of sippable consumer products, the use of famous names can  sometimes turn into a sticky issue. Last October, former child star Shirley  Temple Black obtained a court order barring Soda Pop Kids, an Encino soft drink  company, from marketing a cherry-flavored soda with the name "Shirley T."  </P> <P> Most people, though, seem thankful to be memorialized on menus.  </P> <P> At the Stage, Ramboldt said, producer Aaron Spelling personally thanked the  management. "He said having his name on the menu was the equivalent of winning  an Emmy."  </P> <P> Dick Clark -- a turkey triple-decker at the Stage -- has no complaints, either.  "Turkey is good for you, what can I say," Clark said. "I'm honored to be in the  presence of the Tommy Lasorda chopped liver, but I'm a little disappointed they  gave the peanut butter and jelly to David Letterman. It was a close race, I'm  sure."  </P> <P> Of course, none of the Hollywood hotshots have yet reached the pinnacle of  gourmet glory -- a spot reserved for the likes of beef Wellington, oysters  Rockefeller, or the sandwich itself, named after a British earl.  </P></p>

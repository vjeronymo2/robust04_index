			<p><P> July 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SWAYZE'S NEW ROLE: NOT JUST A 'GHOST' OF HIS OLD MOVIE SELF  </P> <P> Patrick Swayze hoofed his way to stardom in "Dirty Dancing" but drifted away  from his romantic image when producers cast him as a slam-bang action star in  his next two movies, "Road House" and "Next of Kin."  </P> <P> Now he's back as his old charming self in "Ghost," to be released July 13. He  says it is his best picture since "Dirty Dancing."  </P> <P> In reality, Swayze is equal parts brawn, brains and sensitivity.  </P> <P> The son of a Texas cowpoke who knew hard times, Swayze idolized his father and  is proud of his horse ranch in California and his farm in Texas.  </P> <P> He also is proud of "Ghost," a non-violent drama with comedy in which he plays  a murdered man who returns from the spirit world to communicate with the woman  he loves (Demi Moore) in order to save her life.  </P> <P> Portraying a ghost, invisible to the rest of the characters, proved  disconcerting.  </P> <P> "It was very strange to read a line and get absolutely no reaction from the  other performers," Swayze said in an interview.  </P> <P> "The character I play is overwhelmed by the feeling of being totally  ineffectual, which I felt, too. It was weird doing the special effects -- . . .  scenes like walking through walls -- all on my own with no other actors around.  </P> <P> "The descriptions were written beautifully, but it was a different matter  bringing them to life in terms of reality or playability. I'd have a five-page  scene in which the ghost was not dealt with. It was hard to play.  </P> <P> "There's a lot of excitement about this movie, which I hate to hear. In the  past I've never put too much stock in rumors about a picture's success. When a  movie is over I go on to the next one, so all my cookies aren't in one basket.  </P> <P> "But people keep telling me 'Ghost' is going to be the surprise hit of the  summer because it's a love story with great warmth that has audiences feeling  good at the end.  </P> <P> "It's the first movie I've ever felt 100% proud of. And maybe it's the first  one I've done that parents can take their kids to see. It has great heart and  good things to say about life.  </P> <P> "I sort of feel I'm at home in 'Ghost.' My insides as a human being were  screaming to do a picture where people walk out of the theater being affected  in a positive way. I needed it for myself, too."  </P> <P> While Swayze enjoys the more sensitive roles, he has not forsaken action  thrillers. The broad-shouldered actor is in production with young Keanu Reeves  in "River on the Storm," an action picture in which he will be called upon to  sky-dive and surf with expertise.  </P> <P> "Action pictures are great. I love 'em. I'm a male beast. But it seems I'm best  at romance," Swayze said. "I'm a romantic fool to the core. I'd like to play  Clark Gable kind of roles. There's a gentle part of me, and that's what my  father was.  </P> <P> "He was an intense, strong man but there was a gentleness to him, and those are  my best qualities. Like my father, I find the vulnerable side of me confusing  because that's not what we were taught a man was supposed to be.  </P> <P> "Maybe all men are trying to figure out how to handle that sensitive side of  our nature. It's a matter of not squelching the wild man -- the unpredictable  male thing we have inside us -- and at the same time to be sensitive and  gentle.  </P> <P> "It's those qualities that I try to project in my movie roles."  </P> <P> In "River on the Storm," Swayze says he plays "an adrenaline junky who will do  anything to get that 'alive' feeling."  </P> <P> "I can understand that. I go for the action and physical thrill."  </P> <P> "I'm surfing almost every day so that by the time we get to Hawaii I can be  surfing the big waves. I can't talk about sky-diving for insurance reasons. But  I'm a guy who insists on doing his own action and stunts."  </P></p>

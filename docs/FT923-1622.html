			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Maastricht - After the French Vote: Lira to remain outside EMS THE Italian government yesterday decided against returning the lira to the European Monetary System today for fear of further instability and costly interventions. The decision to let the lira continue floating was announced by Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, before returning from Sunday's meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers in Washington. It is a reversal of a pledge last Wednesday by the treasury and the Bank of Italy when the lira left the ERM, after falling through the floor set earlier in a realignment against the D-Mark. Mr Barucci refused to be tied to a timetable for the re-entry of the lira into the EMS. However, officials in Rome said this was unlikely to a matter of days or even weeks. They said the authorities would be waiting to see whether the markets stabilised, while monitoring moves by Italy's partners to reassess the workings of the EMS in the wake of the turbulence of the last ten days. The Italian government could now wait until parliament approves the 1993 budget, which was outlined on Thursday. The budget has to be approved by the end of the year and traditionally the parliamentary debate has lasted at least three months. If this is the case the lira could float until Christmas. 'It is better like this than risking a new fall (of the lira inside the EMS),' Mr Pier Carlo Marengo, managing director of the commercial bank Comit, said. However, Italian officials were anxious to distance themselves from the British stance on an indefinite float of the pound. Mr Barucci said he was aware of Italy's obligations and was anxious to re-enter the EMS as soon as possible. The Italians recognise that without such a commitment they risk alienating further the markets. Indeed, this desire to signal good intentions appears to have been behind Italy's pledge to return to the EMS today. At the time the markets were surprised the Italians could even contemplate returning so soon after the French referendum on Maastricht and when the outlook for European currencies remained unstable. Yesterday the lira was trading at L838.98 against the D-Mark, showing marginally improved sentiment following the narrow French approval of Maastricht. But this represents a 10 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark, compared to the 7 per cent realignment permitted last Monday. One economist suggested a realistic floor might be L850 against the D-Mark. The 1993 budget proposals, aiming to raise an extra L93,000bn in revenues and spending cuts, were discussed yesterday between the prime minister and representatives of the main trade union confederations, CGIL, UIL and CISL. The unions have called a series of rolling four hour strikes by regions beginning today, to protest the severity of some of the measures. They are attempting to force the government to water down its intention to freeze public sector employment, ease the cap of pension outlays and reduce the cuts in free health care. The unions are concerned that the inflationary impact of devaluation will undermine the agreement signed at the end of July with the government and the employers abolishing indexed wages. The preliminary inflation figures for September show an annualised rate of 5.3 per cent.</p>

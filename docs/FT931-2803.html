			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / OFT hits at error on travel insurance THE OFFICE of Fair Trading yesterday criticised holiday companies for incorrectly telling customers that the law required them to buy travel insurance. The OFT said it had come across several instances of travel agents telling customers that package holiday regulations which came into force at the beginning of the year made the purchase of travel insurance compulsory. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said: 'This is not the case. Although the regulations state that holiday package organisers should provide information on any optional travel insurance available to their customers, the regulations do not oblige customers to accept.' Sir Bryan said that while it was advisable to buy travel insurance, holidaymakers should shop around, looking at insurance brokers, other travel agents, or other intermediaries. However the OFT also said that while holidaymakers had no legal obligation to buy travel insurance, tour operators were entitled to make it a condition of their contracts that customers were adequately insured. The OFT said it was legal for travel companies to insist that customers who wanted to buy a holiday from them should also buy insurance from them. It is common for travel companies to insist that customers buy the company's insurance when offering large discounts on holidays.</p>

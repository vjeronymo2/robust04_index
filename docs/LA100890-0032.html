			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> First Lady Makes Pitch on Soap: First Lady Barbara Bush will appear as herself  in the Oct. 18 installment of ABC's daytime soap opera "All My Children." Mrs.  Bush will not be shown with other inhabitants of the show's fictional Pine  Valley, but rather appears at the program's end in a public service  announcement benefiting the National Bone Marrow Registry. The first lady's  brief spot complements a current story line in which the survival of a child  stricken with leukemia depends on receiving a bone marrow transplant. Mrs. Bush  outlines the simple, painless test for bone marrow compatibility and encourages  viewers to contact the National Bone Marrow Registry. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

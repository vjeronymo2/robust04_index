			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Federated eyes a bargain buy in Macy's - Merger would create retailing empire with turnover of Dollars 13bn Federated Department Stores' attempt to take over the equally prominent R. H. Macy group is unusual by even US standards. The merger of two of the world's best-known names in department stores - Federated owns Bloomingdale's and several other US chains - would create a vast retailing empire. But this is no ordinary takeover bid. R. H. Macy has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since January 1992, so its future lies in the hands of creditors rather than shareholders. Instead of bidding for Macy's equity, Federated has staked a claim on the company by acquiring Dollars 449m worth of its highest-ranking debt from the Prudential Insurance Company of America, just as Macy's prepares its plans for a capital reorganisation. If Federated succeeds in acquiring Macy's, it will become the biggest department store group in the US. Apart from Bloomingdale's, Federated owns the A&amp;S, Jordan Marsh, Stern's, Lazarus, Rich's, Goldsmith's, Burdines and Bon Marche chains in the US. Its 219 stores recorded sales of Dollars 7bn in 1992. R. H. Macy, with 111 stores in the Macy's and Bullock's chains, turned over Dollars 6.3bn in the year to last July, so the combined group's turnover of more than Dollars 13bn would put it in the number one slot above May Department Stores, which had 1992 turnover of Dollars 11bn. Nevertheless, Federated's strategy raises an obvious question. Why would anybody want to take over a bankrupt department store group - particularly when department stores are seen as the dinosaurs of retailing, losing market share to newer shopping formats such as out-of-town malls and warehouse clubs? Part of the answer lies in the fact that the death of the US department store has been exaggerated. Some of its problems were as much to do with over-leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s as they were to do with loss of customers. Most groups are now doing modestly well, especially those - like Federated - which have restructured balance sheets, improved buying, dropped money-losing lines and made their stores more attractive. Yet department stores ignore the competitive threat at their peril. Consumers want value for money, and other retailing formats are only too keen to deliver. Mr Allen Questrom, Federated's chairman and chief executive, says that if department stores are going to be around in the 21st century, they have to get their costs down to a level where they can compete. Federated - which itself emerged from bankruptcy protection nine days after Macy's went into it - has achieved an impressive financial recovery in the two years since by securing internal efficiencies. But the next step, Mr Questrom says, must be to improve competitiveness and deliver better value to customers by securing the economies of scale that come with being a bigger group - for example, by winning greater buying clout and spreading administration costs across a larger sales base. Mr Questrom may yet be thwarted. To succeed with a bid, he will have to win the support of Macy's other creditors by persuading them that his plan is in their interests as well as his own company's. The bankruptcy court judge will have to be similarly persuaded, and may also need to be convinced that a merger would not be anti-competitive. Macy's has until March 15 to come up with a reorganisation plan (though it can plead for more time). Some suspect Federated will use its position to block the Macy plan and impose its own, but Mr Questrom insists all he wants to do is put forward an alternative and let creditors decide. 'This is not a hostile takeover,' he says. 'We wouldn't do it, the courts wouldn't let us do it, and that's not our intent.' As for anti-trust issues, Mr Questrom dismisses them as irrelevant. Maybe there was a time when department stores dominated US retailing, he says, but it has long gone. The entire department store sector sells less in a year than Wal-Mart, the large discount-store group, and faces competition from an ever-increasing proliferation of formats. Nevertheless, Macy will certainly not give up without a fight. Other would-be bidders, such as May Department Stores or Dillard Department Stores, may yet enter the fray. Federated itself may walk away if, on closer examination, it decides the deal does not make sense. What of the Dollars 449m of shareholders' money that Federated has already spent? Mr Questrom says he is not worried. The debt it has bought ranks above all other claims against Macy, is secured against 70 stores, and is piling up interest at the rate of 12 per cent a year. Even if Macy were to collapse, Mr Questrom says, Federated would still get its money back when the assets were sold. 'It's a good investment. If it doesn't materialise into a combination, there's very little downside,' he says.</p>

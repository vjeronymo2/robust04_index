			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam consolidates after strong January rally - But the trend is positive After getting off to a flying start in January, the Amsterdam stock exchange has paused for breath in February to consolidate the gains which emerged so unexpectedly, and so spectacularly in the first few weeks of the year. Analysts are confident that the market will move higher again later this year, helped by a further drop in long-term interest rates which, along with the strong lead given by Wall Street, was the main factor fueling January's sharp rises. Forecasts for the timing of the next round of interest rate cuts vary from early spring to mid-summer. As usual, however, tracking the prospects of the internationally-orientated Amsterdam bourse is complicated by its heavy reliance on events outside the Netherlands. A prolonged dip in the dollar, for example, could affect the outlook for Amsterdam. Although the market's overall direction will hinge on interest rates, individual shares could well see significant movement over the next few weeks due to two domestic factors - the start of the 1991 reporting season and this month's introduction of a new law requiring investors to disclose their stakes in Dutch companies. Bond yields have steadied in February after a drop of 30 basis points in January which touched off a rally in share prices, heavy trading in equities and a series of 12 - month highs for a number of stocks. 'We've now entered a period of consolidation,' says Mr Jacques Potuijt, head of investment research at H. Albert de Bary, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank. 'But 1992 could turn out to be an excellent year for the bourse.' He believes that Amsterdam could show a total return, including dividends, of between 15 and 20 per cent for the year, but adds that a good part of this return has already been produced by January's rally. Although the bourse has managed to hold on to most of these gains in February, the CBS Tendency Index has hardly moved since January 31. On Friday, it stood at 121.9 compared with 121.7 at the end of last month. This is a far cry from its 7.3 per cent jump in January. The January rally focused at first on 'defensive' stocks. These included Elsevier, the scientific publisher, which has risen by 8 per cent to Fl 107.80 since the beginning of 1992, and Wolters-Kluwer, the legal publisher, as well as most of the food and beverages sector. Heineken hit a succession of highs, peaking at Fl 174 on February 6 before falling back to Fl 169.30 by Friday. Its popularity was due partly to the re-emergence of the perennial bourse rumour that the company may be ripe for a takeover. But with slightly more than half of the brewer's capital controlled by the Heineken family, the likelihood of a hostile bid is remote. The rally later expanded to include several cyclical stocks, particularly the chemicals groups Akzo and DSM. With the rises so far this year spread across the board, analysts recommend 'stock-picking' rather than concentrating on any one sector. Except for Royal Dutch/Shell, which publishes its 1991 results next week, the annual reporting season for major companies will occur in the final week of February or during March. Besides unveiling 1991 figures, companies will also be releasing first-time forecasts for 1992. In the case of Philips, whose 1991 results will be revealed on February 27, the two main issues will be the extent to which Mr Jan Timmer has managed to turn the company around in his first full year as president, and whether the electricals group is ready to resume dividend payments. Compared with Philips' last pay-out of Fl 2 per share on 1989 results, any dividend is expected to be limited to Fl 0.50. At the chemicals group, DSM, the question is whether management will decide to cut the dividend, following the example of Akzo which lowered its pay-out in 1990 from Fl 8 to Fl 6.50. Akzo, by contrast, has taken the unusual step of already saying that it will maintain its 1991 dividend. By coincidence, the stream of company results is timed to coincide with the bulk of new shareholding disclosures demanded by Dutch law since February 1. Investors who own stakes of more than 5 per cent in bourse-listed companies have until March 3 to make their holdings known to the businesses concerned. They, in turn, have a duty to publish the news 'forthwith' through advertisements in the Netherlands' national newspapers. Relatively few stakes were disclosed by mid-February, but the pace should pick up as the deadline approaches. 'We've been told to expect 1,200 disclosure registrations, of which only a couple of dozen have emerged so far,' says Mr Roel Gooskens, an analyst at Van Meer James Capel. So far, the handful of disclosures has hardly been startling, mainly because they have involved institutional investors. For example, news that the insurer Amev has sold its 5 per cent stake in Grolsch, the brewer, as part of its normal investment activities came as little surprise. But inter-company holdings are far more interesting. One example this past week was the revelation that Aldi, the German supermarket group, owns a 5.58 per cent stake in its smaller Dutch counterpart De Boer Winkelbedrijven. Similar disclosures between now and early March are expected to bring greater transparency to the Amsterdam bourse, boding well for its reputation in the long term.</p>

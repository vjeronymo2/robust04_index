			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REGULATORS MEET WITH BANKERS TO EASE CREDIT FEARS  </P> <P> The nation's top financial regulators held an extraordinary meeting with  bankers on Thursday to avert fears of a credit crunch and to encourage the  bankers to continue making "prudent" loans.  </P> <P> The meeting between the regulators and the board of the American Bankers Assn.  was scheduled several weeks ago at the regulators' request "to dispel a lot of  rumors" about the federal agencies' examination of real estate loans in bank  portfolios, said Lee Cross, a spokeswoman for Comptroller of the Currency  Robert Clarke.  </P> <P> Joining Clarke in a show of unity before the bankers were Federal Reserve Board  Chairman Alan Greenspan and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William  Seidman.  </P> <P> "We are hearing stories of banks overreacting," Cross said. "We're not saying  to banks, don't make loans. We're saying, make good loans."  </P> <P> Many bank customers -- notably small businesses, real estate developers and  builders -- have complained that they find it increasingly difficult to borrow  money. They complain that bankers are exceedingly nervous about pressures from  federal regulators, and have become wary of dealing with some of their oldest  customers. The bankers, in turn, say the regulators cast a very critical eye on  real estate loans.  </P> <P> The financial regulators' mission Thursday was to tell the bankers to keep the  money flowing in a judicious manner.  </P> <P> "They were carefully trying to give the message not to overreact to examination  policies, and to continue to make prudent loans," said Mary-Liz Meany, a  spokeswoman for the American Bankers Assn. "They let us know they were  listening to bankers' concerns," she said.  </P> <P> Despite the assurances, regulators are clearly worried about the real estate  market, which has suffered sharp price declines in some regions.  </P> <P> Seidman, who is also chief of the federal thrift cleanup effort, said Thursday  in a breakfast meeting with Times reporters and editors that even in California  weak real estate markets will cripple many already-troubled savings and loans  -- forcing them into government hands and driving up the cost of the massive  S&amp;L bailout.  </P> <P> Real estate prices in the San Francisco area have "topped out now, by every  indication," said Seidman. Government will be taking control of "a number of  S&amp;Ls in the San Francisco area," he predicted, without naming any  individual institutions.  </P> <P> Federal regulators have seized 400 failing S&amp;Ls and could acquire several  hundred more, depending on the health of real estate markets, Seidman said.  </P> <P> "It's a moving target all the time, which is tied into the marketplace," said  the chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the takeover of  S&amp;Ls and the sale of assets from defunct institutions. Taxpayers will bear  the burden as the government closes insolvent S&amp;Ls and pays off depositors,  whose accounts are insured up to $100,000.  </P> <P> S&amp;Ls are big construction and real estate lenders. When sales of homes and  rentals of office buildings lag, borrowers default on loans, and thrift  institutions suffer financial difficulty.  </P> <P> The real estate depression in Texas and Oklahoma, under way for years, has  spread to Arizona, and the Northeast is showing severe signs of weakness,  Seidman said. "There is not a developer from here to Maine who doesn't have a  problem on one of his projects," the RTC chairman said. "They're all under  stress."  </P> <P> Seidman avoided making any flat predictions of widespread economic trouble for  California. But he noted that people in Arizona and Massachusetts were saying  several years ago that their economies were too diversified to suffer a  Texas-type plunge in real estate values.  </P> <P> "The California economy has been very strong; real estate markets are very  strong," Seidman said. However, he said, in some areas of the state, there are  "high new-construction levels, relatively low employment gains, and high  new-vacancy rate gains." This means the supply of office space is apparently  outpacing the economic activity needed to fill those new buildings.  </P> <P> Seidman came under criticism recently after issuing a list of real estate  market indicators showing that some California cities had the highest office  vacancy rates outside the depressed markets of Texas, Oklahoma, Arizona and  Colorado.  </P></p>

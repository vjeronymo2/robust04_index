			<p>BFN     [Text] Taku Yamasaki, deputy secretary general of the  Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], who was on a visit to North  Korea, landed at Narita Airport on the evening of 18 June. He  described his talks with Hwang Chang-yop, secretary in charge of  international affairs of the Workers Party of Korea [WPK] and  other North Korean leaders to ASAHI SHIMBUN reporters in the  following manner:    My visit to Pyongyang with Mr. Yoichi Tani [another LDP  member of the House of Representatives] coincided with former  U.S. President Jimmy Carter's visit to Pyongyang. A photograph  of Mr. Carter and President Kim Il-song talking on a boat took  up considerable space on the front page of newspapers.  Newspaper reports only listed our and Carter's itineraries  without mentioning the substance of the meetings held.    However, for North Korea, which has consistently maintained  a  "hostile attitude toward the United States," the publication of  the photograph with the North Korean president itself was  extremely unusual. I felt that this was a sign that North Korea  is starting to take a more flexible line on its negotiations  with the United States.    Secretary Hwang and Secretary Kim Yong-sun, with whom we  held  talks, were reportedly also present at the luncheon meeting  between President Kim and Mr. Carter. Mr. Hwang told us, "I  have a good impression of Mr. Carter. We have expectations on  the role he will play. We are on the right track toward holding  the third round of high level talks between North Korea and the  United States."    During our consecutive talks on several days, each lasting  from three to four hours, when we told them, "We seek to become  a permanent member of the UN Security Council and if a UN  resolution on sanctions is passed, we have to cooperate,"  Secretary Hwang responded, "It is better for Japan to repent its  past mistakes straightforwardly if it wants the world's respect.  We are lenient toward those who repent their faults, and are  stern toward those who do not. If Japan conspires with the  United States and participates in the sanctions, we will not  just let that pass."    While we failed to reach agreement in all the meetings,  although the three leaders [the third one not named] all  declared that "sanctions will be met by retaliation," they never  failed to add in the end that "the only solution is dialogue,"  indicating North Korea will not opt for retaliation.    Secretary Kim Yong-sun also said, "Misunderstanding arises  if  North Korea and Japan do not meet and talk. There is a need to  deepen bilateral relations on the basis of the joint communique  issued by the WPK, the LDP, and the Social Democratic Party of  Japan in 1990." North Korea also invited the LDP to send a  delegation to visit the DPRK, indicating a strong desire to  normalize relations between Japan and North Korea.    We told them that the U.S.-North Korea talks and a solution  to the nuclear issue should come first. At the end of each  session, we always reconfirmed our common position that  "denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula is  indispensable for stability in Northeast Asia."    I remember in particular that Secretary Kim Yong-sun touched  on the political situation in Japan, saying, "We are also  concerned by the unstable political situation in Japan. North  Korea is united under President Kim Il-song. Secretary Kim  Chong-il goes to the people and shares their joy and sorrows.  The people believe that if they execute Secretary Kim  Chong-il's orders, they can have happiness."</p>

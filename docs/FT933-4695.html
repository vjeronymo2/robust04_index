			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Second crisis in Guatemala GUATEMALA has been plunged into its second political crisis in three months as a divided congress waits for a ruling from the constitutional court to determine whether a revolt against the congressional leadership is legal. The crisis was precipitated on Sunday evening when a session of congress, called to implement a purge of members accused of corruption, descended into fistfights and bottle throwing, leading Mr Jose Lobo Dubon, the Christian Democrat president of congress, to declare the session suspended. However, a group of 65 members of congress defied the suspension to elect a new congressional president and directorate after alleging that Mr Lobo had abandoned his post. Mr Alfonso Cabrera, secretary general of the Christian Democrats, called the removal of Mr Lobo and the rest of the 12-member congressional directorate 'a kind of coup d'etat within congress'. On Monday evening Mr Lobo, who still considers himself president of congress, clashed with opponents as he headed for his office. One of his bodyguards allegedly struck a congressman with the butt of his pistol. Now the congress, bitterly divided over the issue of corruption, finds itself with two presidents and two directorates. It was not clear which directorate would preside over the congressional session due to be held later yesterday, but it was expected to be unruly. The move for a congressional purge followed a call last month by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio for the voluntary resignation of all 116 congressmen. Mr de Leon, formerly a combative human rights ombudsman, was elected by congress on June 6 after a constitutional crisis triggered by a failed attempt by former President Jorge Serrano to seize authoritarian powers. Mr de Leon's election raised hopes that he would promote a clean-up of state institutions, which are generally perceived to be endemically corrupt. However, Congress divided into two camps. On one side 75 congressmen are allied to the Instancia Nacional de Consenso, a coalition of political parties, private business, and popular organisations which forced a return to democratic government in June. The Instancia has produced a list of 16 congressmen whom it considers to be most in need of purging. The list contains five Christian Democrats, including Mr Lobo, but does not include any members from the five parties in the Instancia.</p>

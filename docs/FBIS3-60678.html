			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam, a puppet, speaking about the fictitious ``nuclear  problem'' of the North in an ``interview'' with the South Korean  radio ``CBS'' [Christian Broadcasting System] on 14 December,  said ``the United States would make no concessions,'' according  to a report from Seoul.    This is a despicable attempt to frustrate the DPRK-USA talks  aimed at a solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula  and a heinous challenge to the North.    When he said ``the United States would make no  concessions,''  he probably took into consideration the ``definite answer'' of  the United States on the maintenance of an ``international  cooperation system'' which he got during his U.S. trip in  November in return for rice market opening. No one but  flunkeyist traitors could do that.    The traitor Kim again raised the questions of ``inspection  by  the International Atomic Energy Agency'' and ``North-South  dialogue,'' making quite a noise as if they were  ``preconditions'' for third round DPRK-USA talks. In the final  analysis, this was also a sinister attempt to drop the checkbar  on the way of DPRK-USA talks.    It is the biggest tragedy for the traitor Kim that he does  not know that frustrating the DPRK-USA talks means, in the long  run, cutting his own throat.    The traitor Kim Yong-sam must know this clearly and refrain  from such mean acts as imprudently poking his nose into others'  business.</p>

			<p><P> July 4, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'COMING INTO PASSION' AT THEATRE 6111  </P> <P> Jude Narita's gallery of Asian and Asian-American women, "Coming Into Passion,  Song for a Sansei," has returned to town at Theatre 6111, essentially unchanged  from its earlier, award-winning incarnations at the Powerhouse and Fountain  Theatres.  </P> <P> In a series of brief monologues, Narita plays a cheerful Vietnamese prostitute,  a desperate Filipina mail-order bride, a Nisei (second-generation  Japanese-American) woman who is learning to assert herself, and a rowdy Sansei  (third-generation Japanese-American) teen-ager. She also performs "Little Boy,"  a fairy tale about Hiroshima.  </P> <P> There isn't a clinker in the bunch. Narita's writing begins to paint remarkably  rounded portraits with a few simple strokes, and her performing completes the  picture. She goes to the heart of the conflicts brewing within these women --  and in so doing she also works on a larger canvas, covering what happens when  Asian and American cultures collide.  </P> <P> The only obvious updating in the show is a radio news bulletin about the  Stockton schoolyard shootings of Asian children, carefully timed to precede  Narita's Hiroshima piece. We're also able now, as we weren't before, to compare  Narita's Sansei sketch to "Sansei," the full-length musical extravaganza that  played the Mark Taper Forum last spring. Narita's piece is much funnier and  more pointed.  </P> <P> Narita's prologue and epilogue aren't as successful as the rest of the piece.  Her final speech about the value of the heart, offered during her curtain call,  is particularly prosaic, in comparison with what has gone before, and utterly  superfluous. She's much better at creating characters who express her feelings  than she is at stating those feelings directly.  </P> <P>  At 6111 W. Olympic Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15; (213)  466-1767.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Threat to treaty on dumping at sea A NEW treaty to ban dumping of waste in the Atlantic may be threatened by British and French refusal to agree to stop dumping radioactive waste, the Department of the Environment said yesterday. Ministers from 12 North European states - the UK, France, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden - will meet on Monday in Paris to sign a convention covering all aspects of marine pollution. It is intended to replace the existing 1972 Oslo Convention of 1972 on dumping waste at sea and the 1974 Paris Convention on discharging waste from rivers to the sea. Britain and France insist on reserving the right to dump 'large bulky items' at sea, a clause intended to cover the reactor components of nuclear submarines and power stations. The other 10 countries want a permanent moratorium on dumping of radioactive waste. The DoE said yesterday that the government wanted to wait for a study by the administrators of the London Dumping Convention, an international dumping treaty, before committing itself on radioactive waste. Mr David Maclean, environment minister, who will represent the UK in Paris, said yesterday that existing treaties had already reduced marine pollution. Levels of heavy metals in the sea had fallen since 1975, he said: copper had fallen by 70 per cent, cadmium by 23 per cent, mercury by 38 per cent, lead by 37 per cent and zinc by 29 per cent. He added that Britain would stop dumping industrial waste at sea in a few months, and would stop dumping sewage sludge by 1998. Chemical companies yesterday attacked a report by Greenpeace, the environmental group, which listed the top 50 industrial plants licensed to discharge chemicals into UK rivers. A spokesman for Glaxo, whose Cumbrian plant led Greenpeace's 'Filthy 50' table, said: 'Greenpeace have misinterpreted the figures. ' They quote the limits we are allowed to put out, not what we do put out, and much of what we discharge is simply water.' A spokeswoman for the Chemical Industries Association said: 'Greenpeace are accusing companies of polluting the North Sea when they are operating within licences. 'A great deal of money has already been spent on cleaning effluents.'</p>

			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major accepts Pounds 1,001 in libel case MR JOHN MAJOR said last night that his libel case with New Statesman and Society magazine had been settled and that he had accepted damages of Pounds 1,001. 'Having regard to substantial damages already received from the printers and distributors, I am content to accept the additional sum paid into court by the New Statesman, together with my costs as a settlement to this action,' Mr Major said in a statement from the G7 meeting in Tokyo. The statement was issued after the magazine had stated that actions by Mr Major and caterer Ms Clare Latimer had been settled, each with a payment of Pounds 1,001. The action arose out of an article published in the magazine in January which linked Mr Major to Ms Clare Latimer. Mr Major had demanded substantial compensation for libel after rejecting as unacceptable a statement of explanation published in the magazine the following month. The magazine said it considered the conclusion of the action vindicated its opinion that the article was not defamatory. It claimed that total costs to the magazine arising from actions taken over the article now exceeded Pounds 200,000. A settlement means that the prime minister will not have to appear in court in support of his action. He would have become the first prime minister to enter the witness box in a libel case. Mr Major has already concluded libel actions against the distributor of the magazine and two wholesalers. A poll in today's Guardian shows Mr Major to have the lowest-recorded personal popularity rating for a serving prime minister. The ICM poll says Mr Major is seen as incompetent with 'no clear idea of where he is leading the government'. His popularity rating - at just 14 per cent - is well below Baroness Thatcher's lowest-ever recording in April 1990 when she scored 23 per cent.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Pacific Northwest Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act of 1980 (Power Planning Act) was a recent attempt by the U.S. Congress to address the hydropower impacts on fish and wildlife in the Columbia River system. The Power Planning Act directed the NWPPC to ``*&blank;*&blank;* promptly develop and adopt *&blank;*&blank;* a program to protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife, including related spawning grounds and habitat, on the Columbia River and its tributaries'' (16 U.S.C. 839b(h)(1)(A)). BPA has been charged with funding all efforts and projects to protect, mitigate, and enhance fish and wildlife consistent with the NWPPC's Program. Ongoing efforts by various State agencies and the Kootenai Tribe, authorized by the NWPPC (1987) and funded by BPA, have been undertaken to identify environmental factors limiting the white sturgeon population in the Kootenai River, and develop and maintain an experimental white sturgeon culture facility on the Kootenai River. Despite these efforts to better comprehend the factors affecting the Kootenai River white sturgeon, a change in the flow regime associated with dam operation on the Kootenai River is still needed to enable this population to successfully reproduce and increase in size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the Corps and BPA have committed to experimental flow releases from Libby Dam for Kootenai River white sturgeon in possibly 3 out of the next 10 years. However, providing these flows is contingent upon meeting other project priority uses. The proposed action increases discharge and sustains flows in the Kootenai River at only 57 percent of the discharge the Service believes is necessary to maximize sturgeon spawning and maintain suitable larval rearing habitats. Existing regulatory mechanisms are not sufficient to ensure the survival and recovery of this species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Although not fully understood, there is evidence that the overall biological productivity of the Kootenai River downstream of Libby Dam has been altered. Based on limnological studies of Kootenay Lake, Daley et al. (1981) concluded that the construction and operation of Libby Dam (and Duncan Dam, Canada) ``*&blank;*&blank;* has drastically altered the annual hydrograph and has resulted in modifications to the quality of water now entering the lake by removing nutrients, by permitting the stripping of nutrients from the water in the river downstream from the dam, and altering the time at which the nutrients are supplied to the lake.'' Potential threats to the Kootenai River white sturgeon from declining biological productivity include: (1) decreased prey abundance and limited food availability for all life stages of sturgeon downstream of Libby Dam, (2) reduced condition factor in adult white sturgeon, possibly impacting fecundity and reproduction, and (3) a possible reduction in the overall capacity for the Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake systems to sustain substantial populations of white sturgeon and other native fishes. The British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks is currently experimenting with fertilization of Kootenay Lake to increase biological productivity and enhance native fisheries (Ashley and Thompson 1993). Beginning in 1993, BPA funded IDFG and Idaho State University to study primary productivity, community respiration, and nutrient cycling in the Kootenai River from Libby Dam downstream to Kootenay Lake (BPA 1993). It will be several years before results from these studies explain what extent, if any, reduced biological productivity has been a contributing factor to the Kootenai River white sturgeon's population decline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Poor water quality and excessive nutrients in the Kootenai River were once considered major problems for the white sturgeon and other native fishes prior to the construction and operation of Libby Dam. Graham (1981) concluded that poor water quality conditions in the 1950's and 1960's resulting from industrial and mine development most likely affected white sturgeon reproduction and recruitment. Poor water quality, i.e., heavy metals and other contaminants, may have affected white sturgeon reproductive success and impacted their prey base.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Major sources of pollution in the Kootenai River basin were effluents from a lead-zinc mine and concentrator; a fertilizer processing plant; and sewage treatment plants on the St. Mary River (an upstream tributary in Canada); and a vermiculite mine and processing plant 11 river km (7 river mi) upstream of Libby, Montana. Significant improvements in Kootenai River water quality were noted by 1977, due in part to waste water control and effluent recycling measures initiated in the late 1960's.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Transcript" of statements by Raul Malk, Estonian Foreign </F> Ministry vice chancellor, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister  Vitaliy Churkin at Tallinn airport on 8 June -- received via  Internet E-LIST]    [Text] The Russian Deputy Foreign Minister spent 24 hours  in Estonia, meeting primarily with his counterpart from the  Estonian Foreign Ministry, Raul Malk. Yesterday evening he had  dinner with President Lennart Meri and this morning met with  Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik. The following has been  transcribed and translated by Juri Arusoo and Mari-Ann Rikken of  the Press and Information Department of the Estonian Foreign  Ministry.    Raul Malk (in Estonian): Over the course of two days we have  had good talks. There is nothing concrete to announce at this  stage. We have just agreed that we will continue as soon as  possible. And now I hope you hear about the same. Meaning from  Mr. Churkin.    Vitaliy Churkin (in Russian): This is my first press  conference where I can't understand my colleague's language, but  it is not a problem because I'll say about the same. First of  all we are very satisfied with the atmosphere and character of  the discussions which took place in Tallinn and which began a  few days ago in Genevea. We are grateful to the Estonian side,  and Mr. Malk. I had an opportunity as well to have a  substantive discussion with the foreign minister and yesterday  an informal, but long, interesting, and substantive meeting with  President Meri. We are thankful to the Estonian side for  providing such good conditions, for creating such an atmosphere  of goodwill for these negotiations. It seems to me that we can  say that we didn't talk only in a spirit of goodwill, but with a  sincere attempt on both sides to solve as quickly as possible  those questions which still remain, in order that we can turn  the page, perhaps even finish an entire chapter in the history  of our relations. To begin to write a new chapter starting with  a new page, having solved completely those complicated problems  which we have spent the last few months discussing. Now,  however we have reached, as we hope, the final stage as concerns  the understandings and agreements which were achieved by Russian  Minister Kozyrev during his recent stay in Tallinn.    ITAR-TASS (in Russian): What were the concrete problems  which  were discussed?    Churkin (in Russian): The same which has been under  discussion by the Estonian-Russian state delegations over a long  period of time. First of all, the problems of the completion of  the withdrawal of Russian troops from the territory of the  Republic of Estonia and here primarily the issues which are not  yet agreed upon. The issue connected with military pensioners.  Also the issue of dismantling the installation at Paldiski.  Well, and we also touched on other questions -- general  political questions which concern Estonian- Russian relations.    Rhohtuleht, Ille Gruen-Ots (in Russian): What do you think,  is the deadline August 31 realistic?    Churkin (in Russian): I believe there is nothing unrealistic  about it. But there must be a firm basis, there have to be  agreements. And then we can energetically do that which is  necessary to complete withdrawal.    ITAR-TASS (in Russian): The Estonian side does not rule out  use of force if the withdrawal is not completed by August 31.  How do you react to this?    Churkin (in Russian): I do not think it is so. Regarding  Estonian positions, then we analyze and draw conclusions based  upon statements by responsible individuals, Estonian state  officials. And we do not have the slightest suspicion that the  Estonian position consists of the need to solve problems  politically, via negotiations. I want to emphasize that the  official position of the Russian leadership position is exactly  the same. These questions must be solved via dialogue, not in  any other way.    Q (in Russian): Did you discuss a possible meeting between  Presidents Yeltsin and Meri?    Churkin (In Russian): Concretely this was not discussed.    Rhohtuleht (in Russian): When will you meet again?    Churkin (in Russian): Yes, we invited Mr. Malk and his  colleagues -- thank you for asking this question -- to Moscow in  the near future, as soon as this can be arranged. We believe  that such a meeting may take place already next week.    Baltic Independent, Tarmu Tammerk (in English): What kinds  of  agreements should there be on military pensioners between  Estonia and Russia?    Churkin (in English): I'd rather not go into details of our  discussions because these are -- this is -- an on-going issue  between us. We hope that this will -uh- be a realistic  agreement which will remove any possibility of tensions in our  relations and - uh- would also be up to the count very high  international standards of human rights.    Lisa Trei (in English): Can you be specific about what you  mean by realistic agreement?    Churkin (in English): No, I cannot. (Laughter)    Tammerk (in English): Will it be the point of the pull-out  agreement?    Churkin (in English): I'd rather not be specific at this  time. Thank you very much. In Russian: Thank you.</p>

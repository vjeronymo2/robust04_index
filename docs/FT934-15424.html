			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Customers' needs priority in telephone banking Sir, Unusually, Lex has missed the point in the column about telephone banking (October 4). Lex raised the issue of whether 'the efficiency advantage of a low-cost transaction service outweighs the cost of foregoing some of the profits from cheap retail deposits'. To be successful in telephone banking - or the provision of any other financial service by telephone - the operation has to be built around the customers' needs, not the short-term operating needs of the bank. It is a strategic not a tactical investment. By building the service around what customers want - such as long hours, responsive service, simple products - a different type of banking will be created. This will be profitable as more and more customers appreciate its advantages and profits are generated in new ways. Direct Line and ShareLink have demonstrated this in their own market sectors. If the success of First Direct were measured in long-term value created for Midland Bank's shareholders, I suspect the picture would already be very positive. Bolting on operations, as NatWest and Barclays have done, cannot work in the long term. Bolting on such operations means that they are built from what currently exists, not from what the customer wants. As a customer of one of these operations, I was not pleased when both my personal contacts at the bank were promoted simultaneously and two anonymous people assigned to my account. This is something that could not happen in a customer-focused operation, but which could happen easily in a clearing bank. Thinking of the opportunities created by the telephone for the provision of new services in terms of the impact it may have on cheap retail deposits is precisely what has caused the clearing banks to distance themselves from real customers' needs and has created opportunities for innovative new suppliers, such as First Direct and ShareLink, to enter the market.

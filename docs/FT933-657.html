			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Clinton says US will continue to shoulder leading world role US PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday rebutted speculation that his administration might be turning to isolationism by promising that 'the US intends to remain engaged and to lead'. Addressing the opening session of the United Nations General Assembly, he also said the US would press for a strengthening of UN peacekeeping capabilities and seek to reinforce international agreements to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. But his central message was that the US would use its unique position in world affairs 'to expand and strengthen the world's community of market-based democracies'. He implied that the main instrument for this objective would be support for trade liberalisation. He said the US would seek to 'enlarge the circle of nations that live with free institutions', and promised that the administration would seek to strengthen free market democracies by 'revitalising our economy at home, by opening world trade through the Gatt and the North America Free Trade Agreement'. Mr Clinton argued that support for market democracies would serve US security interests as well as the goals of the UN. 'Broadly-based prosperity is the strongest form of preventive diplomacy,' he said. 'The habits of democracy are the habits of peace.' Mr Clinton praised the expansion of the UN's peacekeeping activities in recent years, but did so in terms which remained well short of unqualified support. 'Today there is a wide recognition that the UN's peacekeeping capabilities have not kept pace with its rising responsibilities,' he said, calling for the creation of a modern UN peacekeeping headquarters with a planning staff, access to intelligence, a logistics unit and an operations centre. At the same time, he warned that the UN should in future be more cautious before embarking on peacekeeping activities, and clearly indicated that the US had no intention of 'subcontracting' its foreign policy to the UN. In the past six years, the number of UN peacekeepers deployed worldwide had risen from 10,000 to 80,000. In future, said Mr Clinton, the UN should ask itself much harder questions before embarking on additional peacekeeping operations, such as: 'Is there a real threat to international peace? Does the proposed mission have clear objectives? Can an end point to UN participation be identified? How much will the mission cost?' Mr Clinton promised that the US would 'within the next few weeks' be up to date with its peacekeeping bills, on which it owes arrears of some Dollars 800m (Pounds 530m). But he reiterated the US demand that the UN's contribution assessment system, which has remained unchanged since 1973, should be revised to take account of the relative decline in the US share of world wealth.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SO DEPENDENT, SO POORLY CARED FOR  </P> <P> More bad news about the youngest users of the American health system:  </P> <P>  -- Progress in reducing infant mortality has virtually halted as the United  States has slipped to 20th place among the developed nations of the world,  according to the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality.  </P> <P>  -- None of the surgeon general's goals for 1990 for prenatal care and  immunization have been met, says a joint report from the National Assn. of  Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions and the American Academy of  Pediatrics.  </P> <P> In fact, matters have been getting worse: The proportion of young children  without basic immunizations has increased; the percentage of women receiving  delayed or no prenatal care has also increased.  </P> <P> "These trends provide a strong indicator that infant mortality will worsen in  the years ahead, especially as more communities feel the impact of increased  poverty among children, drugs and fewer health care providers serving high-risk  families," the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality warns.  </P> <P> Particularly troubling is the "unconscionable gap" between white and black  children. Compared with whites, black babies are twice as likely to die in  their first year and three times more likely to have a birth weight under 3 1/4  pounds.  </P> <P> The findings are not surprising, given a situation in which children are  one-third of the37 million Americans without health insurance. Half of the  children living at poverty level have no insurance.  </P> <P> And the prospects for improvement in child health in the future are dimmed by  the fact that immunization is falling behind, protecting, for example, only 57%  of non-whites from polio.  </P> <P> Nor is there an easy solution. Some in Congress have responded to the  commission report with proposals to extend Medicare coverage. California has  already done this for pregnant mothers and infants, with the promise of  improving prenatal care at least. But the Medicare system is so underfunded  that it is, in any case, an inadequate response to a problem that probably can  only be solved effectively by an as-yet undefined system of universal health  care.  </P></p>

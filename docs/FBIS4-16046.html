			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Lyudmila Aleksandrova, </F> Nikita Yermakov, Yuriy Sizov and Vladimir Shekhovtsov]    [Text] Madrid April 12 TASS -- There is a certain  renaissance in the Russian-Spanish relations, Russian President  Boris Yeltsin told representatives of the two Spanish parliament  chambers here today. The meeting was held at the Congress of  Deputies.    In the opinion of Yeltsin, intensive bilateral contacts are  very important as they enable Russia to learn the unique Spanish  experience of peaceful transition from dictatorship to  democracy. That transition required profound changes in  political, social and spiritual life of Spain, it was "a painful  but wholesome process of revival of the Spanish dignity," said  the president.    The current Russian processes are somewhat similar, he  noted.  "Practically every citizen of our state feels how tenacious is  the past and vices. Russia has covered the first, most  difficult part of this path," said Yeltsin.    When elaborating the new Russian constitution that was  adopted in universal voting, the Spanish Constitution and its  experience of the 1970s in the achievement of national  reconciliation and accord were attentively studied, said the  president. The Moncloa pact enabled Spain to avoid a collapse,  create an atmosphere of civilized interaction between major  political forces and become the basis of stabilization and  consolidation of civic peace.    "Russia needs this as well. We are working to achieve  interaction between state bodies, political parties and  movements, public organizations, all influential forces of  Russia," said Yeltsin.    The president stressed the need to develop Russian-Spanish  inter-parliamentary relations. In his opinion, it should be not  only exchange of high-ranking parliamentary delegations but also  contacts of deputies, members of committees and commissions and  experts.    The Russian foreign policy and the Russian approach to  cooperation with Spain are based on sound patriotism, said  Yeltsin. "It will do good for the countries and their peoples.  There is another important aspect -- unification of our efforts  to solve uneasy problems of modern world," said the president.  These are, primarily, joint initiatives to settle conflicts  that alarm Europe and the whole world.    In his turn, President of the Spanish Congress of Deputies  Felix Pons Irazazabal [name as received] said Spain is watching  with great interest political, social and economic  transformations in Russia and formation of Russian democratic  structures and market economy. He expressed the assurance the  reforms carried out by President Boris Yeltsin will result in  stability, consolidated democracy and economic improvement.    He called for consolidation of Spanish-Russian relations and  close contacts between the two parliaments.</p>

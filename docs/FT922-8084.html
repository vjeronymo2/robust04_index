			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar stabilises after losses THE dollar stabilised against leading currencies on the foreign exchange markets yesterday after suffering heavy losses in European trading on Tuesday, writes James Blitz. Comments about trade policy from the US Treasury Undersecretary had sent the dollar down to Y130.30 in late American trading the previous day. But in overnight trading in Asia the dollar managed to resist further falls, and by the end of yesterday's European trading it had slipped only a little further to Y130.25. The US unit was helped by a surprising 0.9 per cent rise in April retail sales announced yesterday, dampening speculation of an imminent cut in the Federal Reserve's funds rate. However, dealers said a downward revision in March retail sales, to a 1 per cent fall from a 0.4 per cent decline, had tempered dollar bullishness. The bears were also quick to point out that figures for M2 money supply growth are due out today and could force the Fed's hand on interest rates. The growth of M2 money supply, a crucial determinant of interest rate policy, has been extremely low in recent weeks. D-Mark holders had a mixed day. The German currency was unable to gain from the dollar weakness and closed fractionally down against the US unit at DM1.6220. It recouped early losses against other currencies in the European Monetary System, but was still on the defensive in late trading because of continued worries of more industrial unrest in support of pay claims. One beneficiary was sterling. In spite of the adage that a weaker dollar usually means a weaker pound, the UK currency managed to hold on to its recent gains against the D-Mark. Sterling ended  1/4 pfennig stronger at DM2.9425. The D-Mark also lost ground to the Swiss franc. Anticipation that Switzerland may link itself to the EMS this weekend pushed the Swiss unit up to DM108.40 per 100 Swiss francs from DM107.82. The French franc stole the limelight in Europe yesterday morning, continuing its upward march against the D-Mark and crossing its central rate against the German currency for the first time in 18 months. It was briefly quoted at FFr3.3535 per D-Mark, crossing the central rate of FFr3.3539. By the close the D-Mark had fought back to FFr3.3565, roughly the same finish as the day before. Analysts predict that the franc will have difficulty breaching its central rate more positively because of market fears that the French authorities will respond to this by cutting interest rates. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, tried to offset those fears yesterday by saying that an interest rate cut at the central rate was not necessary, and it would be right to encourage the franc to rise further. In New York the dollar fell to DM1.6092 and Y129.60.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Hoechst bids for stake in US generic drugs HOECHST, the troubled German chemicals group, is bidding for its first stake in the North American generic drugs market with a Dollars 550m (Pounds 364m) offer for 51 per cent of the Copley group of the US. Copley, which last year earned Dollars 12.3m after taxes on sales of Dollars 52m, is an important opening for the bidder's Hoechst Roussel Pharmaceutical Industries subsidiary, which last year reported sales of Dollars 600m in the US and claimed a 1.1 per cent market share. The share of generics - out-of-patent products - in the US prescription drugs market is expected to grow 14 per cent a year until the end of the century, according to Hoechst. It based its forecast on planned US health reforms, aimed at improving treatment for 36m Americans not covered by health insurance, partly by increased use of cheaper generic drugs. The move is also a further step in restructuring at Hoechst, which suffered a 31 per cent decline in profits in the first half of this year. At the end of May the group said it was to sell a majority stake in its viscose and acrylic fibres operations to Courtaulds of the UK. If the deal is concluded, Copley will take over the manufacture and distribution of Hoechst Roussel products as their patents expire, the German group said. Hoechst, which has no generics business in Germany, said the first drug affected would be a treatment for diabetes.</p>

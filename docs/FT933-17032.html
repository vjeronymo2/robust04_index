			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Testing times for Franco-German alliance INTEREST RATES Worried about the effect of high German rates on the French economy, Paris wants the Bundesbank council to cut rates at its meeting today. France has reduced short-term rates eight times since early April, putting its short-term rates below those of Germany's. As a result, further French cuts are becoming more dependent on Bundesbank action. BOSNIA German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's plea at last week's European Community summit meeting for the possible lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia-Hercegovina's Moslems took France, as well as other EC countries, by surprise. ERM As investors worry about the German economy and France brings down short-term interest rates below German levels, the French franc has attracted solid support on the foreign exchanges, threatening the German mark's anchor function in the ERM. BANANAS Germany, whose people eat more bananas per head by far than anywhere else in the world, is outraged by the European Community regime to restrict cheap imports. Germany blames above all the French government, which it sees as seeking to defend the interests of its foreign territories and former colonies at the expense of free trade. GATT France, which views the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as a vehicle for US trade hegemonism, finds itself at odds with Germany. On the sensitive issue of Gatt-proposed farm trade reform, France is adamant that it cannot accept the deal negotiated by the EC with strong German support. TELECOMS Germany says that its 1954 trade treaty with the US prevents it from implementing EC trade sanctions against US companies. France, supported by some other EC countries, is incensed and strongly supports the the European Commission's view that Germany is breaching community law.</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 180 DAYS ON WEAPONS CHARGE  </P> <P> A Lancaster man, whose arsenal of guns, grenades and an antitank rocket  launcher was seized in a September raid, was sentenced Monday to 180 days in  County Jail for possession of a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Chris Sundahl, 44, pleaded no-contest to the charge in a sentencing agreement  with Lancaster Superior Court Judge Charles E. Horan, who dropped remaining  weapons charges.  </P> <P> Sundahl also received five years' probation as part of the sentence.  </P> <P> Sundahl and Edward Coleman, 40, also of Lancaster, were arrested Sept. 20 when  sheriff's deputies raided a boarded-up farmhouse in Lancaster and found an  antitank rocket launcher but no rockets. They also found several rifles, hand  grenades and a large amount of gunpowder.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Ogden said Sundahl had a license to operate as a gun  dealer and possessed most of the weapons legally.  </P> <P> The trial for Coleman, who was charged with drug possession after a small  amount of methamphetamine was found, will begin Jan. 7.  </P></p>

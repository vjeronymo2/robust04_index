			<p>BFN     [Text] Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaisit disclosed that his  province and Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey Province have agreed to  sign an accord on opening the Khlong Luk-Poipet border crossing  point on 22 June. The opening will follow immediately after the  signing to allow people of both countries to cross and trade as  normal. Sa Kaeo Province closed the crossing point on 9 April.    According to the governor, the Cambodian Government approved  the points in the accord as proposed by Sa Kaeo Province for  both countries to comply. The draft accord mainly deals with  operating hours, crossing procedures for people and vehicles,  and types of goods which Thailand wants traders to give  priority, particularly goods which Thailand wants to promote in  Cambodia. Tax rates and collection procedures for goods  transiting the crossing point are also set.    The governor said the opening of the crossing point will be  temporary at this time. The Thai side wanted the opening to be  permanent, but the Cambodian side was not ready. He said the  Cambodian side assured the safety of Thai visitors in Poipet.  If the situation becomes dangerous, his province can order  closure for safety and national security reasons.</p>

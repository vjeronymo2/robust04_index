			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / BSN and Nestle agree to Czech food joint venture NESTLE, the world's biggest food company and BSN, the leading French food group, have joined forces with the intention of taking a majority stake in Czechoslovakia's biggest food producer. The pair, normally fierce rivals in Europe, have signed a letter of intent with state-owned Cokoladovny. BSN expects to receive a decision from the Prague government in July, after privatisation laws come into force. This is the latest in a series of alliances in the world food industry and, if successful, would be a rare Western acquisition of majority control of large eastern European company. It would be a fillip to French industry, following the wave of self-criticism provoked last year by Renault's failure to beat Volkswagen in the contest for a large minority stake in Skoda, the Czech car maker. Cokoladovny employs 8,000 people in 15 plants across Czecholosvakia and last year reported a turnover of Kcs4.3bn (Pounds 84.3m)on which BSN believes it made a profit. The Czech group produced 42,000 tonnes of chocolate in 1990, around the same as Nestle did in Switzerland. It made 67,000 tonnes of biscuits, the equivalent of the French production of Lu, BSN's main biscuit brand  - representing a large slice of the 400,000-tonne eastern European biscuit market. On top of this, it produced 38,000 tonnes of sweets and 20,000 tonnes of miscellaneous products, including cocoa, nougat, soya and soft drinks. BSN, leader of the partnership, aims to act as a helpful adviser to Cokoladovny rather than take full management control, said officials. The aim is to bring technology, commercial, marketing, and financial help to strengthen Cokoladovny's position on its home market, said a BSN official. BSN, Europe's leading biscuit producer, and Nestle, Europe's top chocolate supplier, decided to co-operate when they discovered they were separately negotiating for a stake in Cokoladovny, said a Nestle spokesman. 'With our expertise in chocolate and BSN's in biscuits, we felt that by getting together we could make a more serious offer to our Czech partners,' he said. If the Czech government clears the deal, the pair aim to form an equally owned holding company to take a majority of Cokoladovny, with the rest held by local investors. Full details, including the value and exact size of the stake, have yet to be worked out. BSN has followed a steady strategy of expanding in eastern Europe and Asia. Last week, it announced the creation of a joint venture with Benesov, a Czech dairy to make the French group's Danone yoghurt there. Earlier this year, BSN bought Hagenow dairy in eastern Germany and completed a joint dairy venture in Hungary.</p>

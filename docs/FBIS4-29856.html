			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 21 (YONHAP) -- Students belonging to  Namchongnyon (The Federation of Student Councils in Kwangju and  South Cholla Province) arrested in connection with violent  demonstrations in Kwangju and Seoul over the weekend, including  the forced stoppage of a Seoul-bound train near Kwangju,  increased to 109 Tuesday morning, the National Police Agency  said.    In addition, 57 were booked without physical detention and  nine others underwent interrogation to determine whether they  should be arrested or booked, a police spokesman said.    But the prosecution announced different figures -- 99  students arrested, 61 booked without physical detention and 62  under interrogation.    The number of arrested students is expected to rise sharply  as the police, estimating those involved in the forced train  stoppage at 500 to 550, have decided to arrest all of them.    Of the 109 arrested students, all but two belong to  Namchongnyon, the spokesman said.    He added that in the future Namchongnyon-led demonstrations  would not be be permitted unless peace was guaranteed, as the  violent protests over the weekend were led by the organization.    In a related development, the police are interrogating 270  farmers and students about their roles in demonstrations  opposing National Assembly ratification of the Uruguay Round  agreement in Yoido and Yongdungpo Monday.    Those found to have resorted to violence, such as wielding  steel pipes against train workers to occupy railways, during the  demonstrations will be arrested, he said.</p>

			<p>SUMMARY                                   Recent statements from both mainstream Palestinian sources and  representatives of Palestinian Islamic fundamentalist  organizations opposed to the peace process suggest that the PLO  and at least some fundamentalist groups in the occupied  territories have reached an understanding on their future  relations under the proposed Palestinian authority to be  established according to the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles  (DOP).  Both the details of their agreement and how widely  accepted it will be among fundamentalists remain unclear.  However, any reported cooperation between the PLO and  fundamentalist groups associated with terrorism--especially in  the aftermath of recent Palestinian terrorist attacks against  Israelis--is bound to heighten Israeli doubts about the PLO's  willingness and ability to control potential terrorist activities  once an autonomy regime is in place.                           END SUMMARY      Mainstream Palestinian sources have all but explicitly  acknowledged that some sort of PLO-fundamentalist agreement has  been reached.  For example:     --Orient House in Jerusalem, the de facto mainstream Palestinian  headquarters in the occupied territories, released a statement on  18 April rejecting Israeli admonitions about reported contacts  between the PLO and Palestinian fundamentalists.  Israeli  warnings "relating to coordination between Palestinians who  support and oppose the peace process," the statement said, "are  considered Israeli interference in Palestinian internal affairs."  The statement added that the PLO "has every right to strengthen  and enhance relations and ties between various sectors of the  Palestinian people regardless of their political and religious  affiliations" (Jerusalem Al-Quds, 19 April).     --The daily Al-Quds on 18 April cited Dhiyab al-Lawh, identified  as head of the Fatah media and educational department in Gaza, as  saying that the relationship between Fatah and Hamas is  "strategic and crucial."  The paper also quoted al-Lawh as  dismissing Israeli warnings against PLO-fundamentalist  coordination, saying that "when we coordinate with Hamas we do  not take into account what the Israelis say."     For their part, fundamentalist sources have been more ambiguous  and in some instances have even denied the existence of any PLO-  fundamentalist agreement.  Even the denials, however, have  implicitly indicated the conclusion of at least an informal  understanding.  For example:     --Al-Quds on 18 April cited Hamas official Mahmud al-Zahhar as  denying that any agreement had been signed between Fatah and  Hamas.  Nonetheless, al-Zahhar reportedly added that relations  between the two organizations are "normal" and that "the meetings  between the two sides are merely aimed at resolving some  outstanding problems."     --The Jordanian daily Al-Ra'y on 15 April cited a previous  statement by al-Zahhar calling for a "comprehensive dialogue  among the Palestinian forces in order to prevent internal  conflict."  As reported by Al-Ra'y, al-Zahhar denied that  "coordination between Hamas and the PLO leadership had begun" but  added cryptically that "some parties to the Oslo agreement" are  "trying to give the impression through press statements on these  meetings that there was some sort of political flirtation going  on between parties that support and parties that oppose the  present settlement."     A further hint of a PLO-fundamentalist understanding came in an  unusual report by the mainstream PLO radio Voice of Palestine  (VOP) in Algiers on 14 April.  The report cited a statement by  Abu-'Abdallah Fa'iz al-'Aswad, identified as a spokesman for the  Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine--Al-Aqsa  battalions, one of several shadowy fundamentalist factions in the  territories and thus heretofore presumably opposed to the DOP.  As reported by VOP, al-'Aswad made no reference to an agreement  with the PLO but adopted current PLO rhetoric on the peace  process, vehemently denouncing Israel but also implicitly lining  up behind the DOP.  The statement charged that "Israel's  prevarication and refusal . . . to withdraw from Gaza and  Jericho" by 13 April constitutes "a blatant breach and a  scandalous, open violation of the bases of the DOP."  VOP went on  to quote al-'Aswad as adding that "the Rabin government will be  responsible for the developments which will result from the non-  implementation of the mechanisms of the DOP."     What Kind of Agreement?     If, indeed, representatives of the PLO and some fundamentalist  organizations have reached an agreement, they have not given any  direct account of its content.  Nonetheless, recent statements  from both sides suggest an arrangement by which fundamentalists  will refrain from direct challenges to the anticipated  Palestinian autonomy regime in Gaza and Jericho while the PLO  will tacitly acquiesce in fundamentalist-inspired violence  against Israeli targets outside the territorial authority of the  autonomy regime.     Hamas spokesman Ibrahim Ghawshah repudiated Yasir 'Arafat's  cautious condemnation of recent terrorist attacks against Israeli  civilians, for which Hamas has claimed credit, but also indicated  that Hamas might be willing to limit its future anti-Israeli  operations.  Hamas, he said, believes in the principle of  "reciprocal treatment," and he specified that if Israel "stops  killing [Palestinian] women and children . . . Hamas will then  commit itself to attacking only soldiers and settlers" (London  Al-Hayah, 14 April).     Two items appearing in the 19-25 April issue of Al-Sabil, a new  Jordanian weekly apparently having close ties to Islamist circles  in Jordan, went further in implying a willingness by Hamas to  accept limited cooperation with the PLO and, in principle, an  eventual Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.     --Referring to the current peace process, Musa Abu-Marzuq, head  of the Hamas political bureau, said in an interview that "part of  the Palestinian people chose another path for reasons with which  we differ," but pledged that internal Palestinian disagreements  "will not affect the Palestinian people's resistance of  occupation."  Predicting failure for the current Israel-PLO  negotiations, he vowed that Hamas "will continue its jihad  [against Israel] but that "we will not transfer the conflict to  the Palestinian arena and will continue to deal with this  conflict as sons of the Palestinian people regardless of  differences of opinion."  Asked about Hamas' attitude toward the  proposed autonomy regime in Gaza and Jericho, Abu-Marzuq answered  that Hamas "will certainly not deal . . . positively" with the  regime and "will not participate in building institutions that do  not serve the Palestinian people," but he also said that "we will  . . . continue to be an active element in all areas of life,  including education, economy, and services, whether inside or  outside the framework of autonomy."     --A statement by the Hamas political bureau lavishly praised  recent terrorist attacks against Israeli targets and also  denounced "disgraceful PLO concessions" and the "humiliating  surrender by the PLO leadership and capitulation to the Zionist  and American terms."  Nonetheless, the statement also clearly  implied a willingness in principle to limit future attacks and to  accept Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.  Recent attacks in  Israel, the statement said, are not "a constant policy" of Hamas  but rather "an exception dictated by the enemy government," that  is, by Israeli attacks against Palestinians.  Hamas, the  statement went on, "is prepared to reconsider this exception,"  provided that Israel "stops killing unarmed civilians."  The  statement explicitly rejected the DOP but said that "Hamas is not  averse to the principle of peace," and specified that a peaceful  settlement is possible based upon "a full Zionist withdrawal from  our Palestinian land and the dismantlement and removal of the  settlements," as well as "free and fair general elections in the  West Bank and Gaza Strip, in which our people would choose their  representatives and leaders," a position consistent with current  declared PLO demands.     Predictably, mainstream PLO sources have denied any intention to  condone terrorism, but at least one recent PLO radio commentary  raised doubts about the extent of the PLO's commitment.     --In an interview with Qol Yisra'el radio, Sufyan Abu-Zayidah,  identified as a Fatah leader in the Gaza Strip, acknowledged  "serious differences" between Fatah and Hamas but said that "both  parties are not interested in a head-on collision between the two  on the ground."  Anticipating the establishment of the  Palestinian autonomy regime, Abu-Zayidah said that  fundamentalists "know they will have to go along with the new  situation, and discuss their incorporation in it," and vowed that  Palestinian autonomy authorities will not allow terrorist  operations to be mounted from within their jurisdiction.  "We  will have our laws," he said, "and it is clear that Hamas and PLO  members will be arrested if they violate them."  Specifically, he  said "there is no cooperation on terror" between mainstream PLO  leaders and Hamas and he denied that the PLO had agreed to  continued Hamas attacks inside Israel following the establishment  of autonomy (17 April).     --A commentary broadcast by VOP on 14 April, however, denounced  the continued presence of Israeli settlements in the occupied  territories and, without referring explicitly to recent Hamas  attacks in Israel, said that "the violence that is now continuing  is natural and will remain so" due to "official Israeli violence"  and "the violence of the settlers towards the West Bank and the  Gaza Strip."  VOP added that "nobody supports terrorism" but that  it is "unacceptable" for Palestinians to "remain subjected to  terrorism and the experiments of violence and racism carried out  against them."  It is also "unacceptable," VOP argued, "to expect  [Palestinians] to remain silent and calm," and the commentary  asserted that "our people have the right to resist."     Background: PLO-Fundamentalist Relations Since the DOP     The apparent understanding between the PLO and some  fundamentalist elements appears to go beyond a previous agreement  between Fatah and Hamas at the time of the DOP in September 1993,  in which the two sides reportedly agreed not to engage in violent  clashes notwithstanding their disagreement over negotiations with  Israel.  Statements by fundamentalist leaders since that time had  generally reaffirmed a commitment to avoid intra-Palestinian  violence but given little indication of any flexibility  concerning negotiations with Israel or the DOP.     --Interviewed by the Tehran daily Jomhuri-Ye Eslami during the  visit to Iran by a Hamas delegation in late 1993, Abu-Marzuq  indicated continued refusal to accept the existence of Israel and  implicitly accused 'Arafat of treason.  "Our struggles will  continue," he said, "until Palestine is liberated," and he voiced  hope that the DOP would collapse and "that unity will be achieved  among all the mujahidin, and that the plan to liberate Palestine  will materialize."  Referring to 'Arafat, Abu-Marzuq said that  "someone who implements the enemy's plans is himself an enemy" (4  December 1993).     --Discussing the same visit, Ghawshah said in an interview that  Iran and Hamas held similar views on "the plot of the Gaza-  Jericho accord and the plot of peace and normalization which the  Zionists and the Americans are trying to impose on our nation."  While reiterating that Hamas "rejected intra-Palestinian  fighting" and affirming in principle that anti-Israeli violence  could cease, he did so in a manner that seemed to imply that  Hamas would accept nothing less than the dissolution of the State  of Israel.  As an example, Ghawshah said that "if the Jews  withdraw completely from the Gaza Strip, the intifadah operations  in the Strip will completely cease," but he added that "jihad  operations [elsewhere] will not cease because the Jews would then  continue to exist in other parts of Palestine" (Amman Sawt Al-  Sha'b, 21 December 1993).     For their part, while mainstream PLO sources have occasionally  referred favorably to fundamentalist factions in the context of  appeals for Palestinian unity, their general approach to both  fundamentalist and other rejectionist factions since the DOP had  been characterized by a mixture of ridicule and exhortations to  support the mainstream leadership.  For example:     --A commentary broadcast by VOP in Yemen on 13 January ridiculed  rejectionist factions, including Hamas by name, in reference to a  rejectionist statement condemning the DOP.  Calling the statement  "ridiculous," "pathetic," "a farce," and "a disaster," VOP said  that it has "nothing to do with the age in which we are living"  and that "it is anybody's guess from which wornout, exhausted  political literature the words of this statement have been dug."     --Addressing "opposition factions," including Hamas, a VOP Yemen  commentary on 25 January said that "by now, the Palestinian  opposition factions must have realized . . . that the PLO-Israel  DOP is an established fact."  "Speaking about foiling the  agreement," the commentary argued, "is no more than talk meant to  justify avoiding the battle waged by the Palestinian people now  to establish their national entity."  The Palestinian public, the  commentary asserted, "wants the [opposition] factions to gear  their national resistance capabilities toward development by  adopting a practical approach for action, and not by escape."  While embracing rejectionists as "part of our national struggle  and entity," the commentary warned that they should not  "establish their existence on an illusory island."     --On 5 March, Voice of the PLO (VPLO) in Baghdad criticized the  rejectionist reaction to the Hebron massacre.  Apparently  alluding in particular to fundamentalist groups by adopting  Islamic phraseology, VPLO said that "they are vowing three times  to divorce the peace option" but that "they are solidifying like  fossils inside [their] slogans."  Such factions, VPLO charged,  cannot stand the peace option" but "they have no alternative."  Claiming that "the Palestinian people have never abandoned their  unity under the PLO banner," the commentary called on "the short-  sighted ones" to "understand and desist."     Israeli Warnings     Clearly alarmed by reports of a PLO-Hamas agreement, Israeli  leaders have warned that any such arrangement that included  approval of terrorist attacks against Israel would scuttle the  DOP.  For example, in a speech to the Knesset on 18 April, Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin said that "any agreement or understanding  between the PLO and Hamas on continued Hamas terror with the  PLO's approval will preclude any possibility of agreement between  Israel and the PLO (Israel TV).  Moreover, while the action may  not be directly related to the reported agreement, Israeli  authorities have in the last several days launched a major new  crackdown against Hamas, including the detention of 362 alleged  Hamas supporters in the Gaza Strip through 19 April (Qol Yisra'el  radio, 20 April).  Referring to the operation, Rabin vowed that  "we will fight those who continue terror with all the means that  are available to us," subject only to limitations imposed by law  (Qol Yisra'el radio, 19 April).     Implications     The apparent agreement between the PLO and some fundamentalist  elements, even if it holds up, does not mark an end to their  rivalry, but rather a calculation on the part of both sides as to  where their respective immediate interests lie as implementation  of the Gaza-Jericho formula approaches.  For the PLO, the  arrangement allows the organization to pursue its primary agenda,  that is, establishing its authority in the territories under the  DOP, while fending off both Israeli and U.S. pressure to  categorically renounce terrorism on the one hand and popular  Palestinian anger over the recent escalation of Israeli-  Palestinian violence on the other.  For fundamentalists, the  accord presumably reflects a conclusion that the establishment of  a PLO-dominated autonomy regime is inevitable and that  fundamentalists will have to reach a modus vivendi with it or  risk losing influence among the broader Palestinian public.     PLO leaders may regard the continuation of some anti-Israel  violence outside their immediate territorial jurisdiction as  working to their advantage, providing they cannot be directly  linked to it.  Should it be able to maintain order within the  Gaza-Jericho region, the PLO would doubtless point to the  contrast between tranquility under its authority and turmoil in  remaining Israeli-administered areas as evidence supporting its  demand for full Israeli withdrawal from the territories.  Moreover, PLO leaders would probably be privately content to see  militant fundamentalists on the receiving end of harsh Israeli  countermeasures and therefore unable to oppose the PLO as  effectively.     Were the PLO to openly endorse fundamentalist terror attacks,  Prime Minister Rabin would probably have no choice but to make  good on his threat to abandon negotiations.  However, given that  the PLO is unlikely to renounce its official rejection of  terrorism, Rabin seems more likely to continue on his current  course of pursuing negotiations under the DOP while exerting  maximum pressure on violent rejectionist factions.

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Equality law audit breaches shown Many British companies are breaking the law by failing to provide adequate information on equal opportunities policies in their annual accounts, three academics said yesterday. From a sample of 100 companies, 34 fully complied with disclosures required by law on policy towards disabled employees while 14 made no mention of the disabled at all. The findings were presented by Ms Carol Adams, Mr Andrew Coutts and Mr George Harte at the annual British Accounting Association conference at King Alfred's College in Winchester. They found that the Post Office, with nearly one page, provided the most detail on equal opportunities. The average length was just 0.13 of a page. Among businesses which provided scant information on disabled employees were General Electric, British Airways and British Telecommunications. Very few companies described issues such as career breaks, flexible contracts or paternity leave. Most did not show the composition of the workforce by ethnic background or monitoring policy. The conference heard that auditors who tender for work and are tied to a fixed-fee contract are less likely to discover material mis-statements in company accounts. The survey - based on 70 Australian auditors - showed detection rose as the length of client relationship increased.</p>

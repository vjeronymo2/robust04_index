Bowman, 46, a 21-year city employee, has been ordered to appear May 8  in Glendale Municipal Court for a preliminary hearing on the grand theft  charge.  </P> <P> City officials ordered Bowman to stay home from work pending disciplinary  action after he was arrested March 12.  </P> <P> According to court records, 1,327 concrete paving blocks missing from a city  yard were found in the rear of Bowman's home in Glendale, laid out to form a  20-foot by 30-foot parking area.

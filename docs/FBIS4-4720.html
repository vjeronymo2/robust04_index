			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "On the Level" column by Alex Magno: "Time for </F> Fateful Decisions"]    [Text] Today, the New People's Army (NPA) celebrates its  25th anniversary. In the past, this guerrilla army mounted  numerous offensives to mark the day of its birth and demonstrate  its capacity for war. Today, this is a tired army, plagued by  confusion and confronting an "enemy" that has firmly established  an ascendant moral position.    Few, if any, offensives will probably be mounted today.  Logistical exhaustion dictates that. More, the guerrillas  confront a nearly insurmountable moral wall: Government forces  have declared a long unilateral cease fire to mark the Holy  Week. The soldiers would rather pray than fight.    Last Friday, President Ramos signed the two amnesty  proclamations that were being closely studied for two years now.  The amnesty program, that shall come into effect as soon as the  proclamations are confirmed by Congress, will open the door for  six months to all rebels desiring to return to the mainstream.  Congressional confirmation is expected to be ministerial.    The amnesty program is expected to have most significant  effects on the ranks of the NPA. The ideological crisis  plaguing the communist movement has diminished the will to fight  of many guerrillas. Sen. Blas Ople surmised that the amnesty  program, when put into effect, would quickly decimate what  remains of the guerrilla "army."    A few days earlier, Sen. Rodolfo Biazon went on record  calling on the government to break off talks with the exiled  Sison-Jalandoni faction of the CPP. That faction has not only  become a minority in the movement they purport to lead. It has  also proven most reluctant in engaging government peace  initiatives.    It is not for government to initiate the break-off of talks,  contrary to what Biazon suggests. The government enjoys the  moral higher ground in the peace process. It does not have to  squander that advantage. It is for the other side to carry out  their earlier threats and disengage from talks that have not  even begun.    The exiled Maoist fundamentalist group that claims formal  leadership over the fragmented CPP [Communist Party of the  Philippines]-NPA has been dodging and feigning for many months  now. After government conceded on their demand to meet at Ho  Chi Minh City, the Sison-Jalandoni faction demanded that  "preliminary" talks be held in Europe before "exploratory" talks  are conducted in Vietnam.    That particularly crude trick, coming after many prior  bluffs, convinced the government that the Sison-Jalandoni group  has no intention at all of participating in the peace effort.    Some time ago, the exiled fundamentalist group threatened to  disengage from the peace process if amnesty is proclaimed. The  amnesty proclamation has, apparently, been indicated as the  signal to formally disengage. The mere mention of the word  "amnesty" drives their most avid local cadres into a frenzy.    The choice of disengagement point is rather curious. Amnesty  is always a unilateral act on the part of government -- never a  negotiated outcome. It is, too, generally considered an act of  magnanimity, compassion and humanity. How the CPP is going to  turn the amnesty proclamation into a demonic incident, and  indication of government's "insincerity" in its pursuit of  peace, should be interesting to watch.    Lately, Jose Maria Sison has been warning the government not  to allow bail for captured CPP leader and Sison rival, Arturo  Tabara. The right to bail, if Sison must be reminded, is a basic  democratic right. By putting petty party rivalries ahead of  basic principles, Sison ends up arguing against the government  assuring one of his own comrades due process.    It is likely that he will fall into another of his logical  contortions arguing that amnesty is a hostile act. The rest of  humanity considers amnesty a benevolent gesture.    It matters very little at this point if Sison and his  loyalists withdraw from the peace process. The prospects for  fruitful engagement have been nil from the start. The  government, by waiting for so long, has won the higher moral  ground. Sison has not only lost much of what is left of the  Left, he has also lost credibility long ago.    If he takes this benevolent gesture as his excuse for  disengagement, he scores no political points. If the prospects  for talks with the CPP are completely closed down by that  withdrawal, government loses no political points. That is the  nature of the dilemma Sison and his loyalists must now deal with  in the face of the amnesty proclamation.    For the men in the field, the simple men rebelling against  real grievances, the amnesty proclamation occasions a fateful  decision. They will have six months to decide if the course of  "revolutionary" violence that earlier seemed just is worth  continuing.    There is no debate here about the validity of the grievances  that forced many Filipinos to take to the gun. But there is  much debate about the wisdom of continuing the carnage.    The amnesty program requires, not an organizational  decision,  but an individual decision on the part of those who found  themselves enmeshed in abnormal politics during times of great  turbulence. They are offered a backdoor to normal life, freed  from legal obligations that they frenzied politics might have  caused.    As much as the amnesty program is a unilateral decision on  the part of government, premised on the higher value of  achieving peace at the soonest possible time, the decision to  avail of the amnesty package will be an entirely personal one.  What matters is that a point of exit is available. If none  avails of it, then the act of magnanimity on the part of the  government comes to naught. If the dwindling insurgencies  evaporate as a consequence of this proclamation, then it will be  the sum of personal decisions taken.    Very clearly, an amnesty program cannot be the outcome of  negotiations between movements and the government. It requires  fateful decisions at the personal, existential level.</p>

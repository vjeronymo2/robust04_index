			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow steady as IBM falls on dividend fears Wall Street US share prices were flat-to-lower in heavy trading yesterday as the market consolidated some of its recent gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.63 at 3,323.81 below its peak for the day when the index had been 13 points higher. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended its record-breaking streak with a decline of 1.33 to 435.66 while the Amex composite gave up 1.67 at 392.98 and the Nasdaq composite slipped 3.20 to 663.92, off its all-time high. Turnover on the NYSE was 231m shares, and declines outpaced rises by 1102 to 728. Blue chips opened higher amid optimism about the economy and corporate earnings but were unable to hold on to their gains in active two-way trading. The release of the Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' report on nationwide business conditions - had little impact on the market primarily because it said little new about the economy, and was consistent with recent indicators that have pointed to a moderate expansion in economic growth. The Fed's surveys found a 'modest improvement' in economic activity, low inflation, but continued weakness in manufacturing employment. Equity investors were cheered by the reaction of the bond market, which barely budged after the Fed's report was published. The bond market was pleased that the Fed discovered no signs of resurgent inflationary pressures in the economy. Investors will get a better indication of inflation today and tomorrow when the November consumer and producer prices indices are due to be released. IBM fell Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 62 5/8 as the stock continued to suffer from the predictions of two Wall Street analysts on Tuesday that the computer giant will announce further restructuring moves that could hurt its earnings. The warnings raised fears that the company's dividend might be threatened. Lockheed jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 55 3/4 in busy trading after the company concluded an agreement to buy General Dynamics' tactical military aircraft business for Dollars 1.5bn in cash.

Bradlees fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 17 3/8 , Kmart dropped Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25 5/8 , May Department Stores eased Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 68 7/8 and JC Penney fell Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 76 1/2 after the retailers, plus many others, were downgraded by Merrill Lynch, the broking house, in anticipation of a broad-based correction in retail stocks early next year. Times Mirror dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 30 after the securities house First Boston cut its investment rating on the stock from 'hold' to 'sell' because of concerns about soft advertising revenues at the group's newspapers. Dime Savings Bank rose Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 5 3/8 after the bank said the Office of Thrift Supervision had lowered Dime's risk-based capital ratio from 9 per cent to 8 per cent, which should free up some additional capital. Canada TORONTO stocks finished lower after a heavy trading session marked by the strong performance of companies with properties near the Northwest Territories diamond find. Investors flocked to junior mining stocks which hold property in the Northwest Territories after Dia Met Minerals and partner Broken Hill Property Ltd announced promising drilling results yesterday . The TSE 300 edged down 5.4 to 3,285.5 on volume of 45.9 million shares valued at CDollars 337m.</p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Travel: Nuremberg, a town that hid its shadows - Nigel Andrews searches for traces of an infamous past THE LADY at the hotel desk looked blank. 'Where were the rallies held?' I asked again, 'the Nuremberg rallies?' I felt like Basil Fawlty. I had vowed not to mention the second world war or Hitler, but had a dreadful feeling I was about to do so. Finally she flailed an arm crossly in an easterly direction - with a little coaching she could play Sybil Fawlty - and said something about a football stadium. Hopeless . . . I had driven into Nuremberg on my way from Italy to Prague. I needed a stop-over and the road signs had stirred in me a terrible curiosity. Out there on the A-bahn, Wagner floated into my head - 'O Nurnberg, die alte stadt' - and I fantasised a town full of wise old cobblers singing through mullioned windows. Then, with a change of octave, the music of evil took over, no less fascinating. This is the town where a madman licensed by 60m people barked down a banner-lined avenue while the world skidded towards Doomsday. 'Ze stadium, ja,' said Fraulein Fawlty, seeming finally to understand. 'Ze parkplatz]' She was still waving an arm at the non-mullioned window of my edge-of-town Novotel in a way that baffled me, so I decided to go for a walk and let my feet lead me. I followed a busy peripheral road that curved promisingly towards distant roofs and TV aerials. After 10 minutes I found a parking area to the left that I could cross towards the city. But there was something suspicious about this space. A mile long by 70 yards wide, it was a large rectangle paved with concrete slabs, marked here and there with formal patterns. On either side, half-eaten by time and encroaching trees, were battered stone steps that suggested bygone spectator stands. A few equally battered cars and vans were parked at the edges of this giant avenue, beside which gypsies and gastarbeiter families were cooking meals. Further down the avenue I saw the tell-tale signs. This was the site of the Nuremberg rallies, and after the shock of realisation I inwardly cheered the fact that it is now given over - by accident, if not design - to an undiscriminating inter-racial dereliction. What would that arch ethnic cleanser think of all the non-Aryans now barbecuing their kebabs on his sanctum sanctorum? Walking on towards the city, you see more evidence: the absurd and hideous Kongressbau building, a Nazi version of Rome's Colosseum (used today for little but pop concerts); further off, the Stadion, now changed from a meeting-place for the Hitler Youth into the HQ of Nuremberg Football Club; to the north, the ruins of the Zeppelinfeld, a time-warped collage of terraces and towers commemorating the glory that was Albert Speer. The ghost of Hitler is everywhere in this bombastic shadowland. As Leni Riefenstahl's autobiography lately showed us, the Nuremberg rallies were Hollywood come to Bavaria. Sixty years ago she was here with her Fuhrer: camera in hand, purring up and down the giant steel flagpole in the hydraulic lift Speer had designed specially for her. The result, Riefenstahl's feature-length record of the Nuremberg rallies, Triumph Of The Will, is still the most chilling present any city ever had from a director working hand-in-glove with a dictator. By now the casual visitor feels he has strayed into an episode of The Twilight Zone. How to return to reality? Crossing the Luitpoldhain, the city park dotted with further, more neatened remains of the Reich, I passed a big modern building with welcoming lights winking through small ground-floor windows. Ah, probably a hotel. I peered into one window. A dozen men and women in mediaeval dress were clinking goblets while a harpist strummed an instrument. Still in The Twilight Zone. But I soon discovered that this was the Mastersingers Hall, where mediaeval gear is normal. Indeed, you would probably be thrown out if you did not come dressed as Eva, Sachs or Walther Von Stolzing. Not far away, if you are a stickler for the real thing, is the gothic church of St Martha which served as the original Mastersingers Hall. By now I had had enough through-the-looking-glass experiences and was becoming interested in a through-the-restaurant-door experience. Nuremberg abounds in Bavarian eateries where steamy excess is the by-phrase. Meeting up with a German friend, I ate at a tavern where mein host piles one's plate with enough grilled meat to sink a U-boat. Sausages, chops, liver, kidneys, steaks, more sausages, all washed down with a large stein of cold Heineken. Now it was mid-afternoon: time to see the Old Town. Nuremberg was badly bombed in January 1945, so much of the 'Alte Stadt' serenaded by Hans Sachs has been restored or re-touched. This may explain its dinky feel. Contoured in little hills and dips with jewel-like Gothic churches nudging half-timbered houses, and the canal giving a winsome reflection to willow-lined mansions, it all seems too good to be true - like a theme park sector marked 'Germanyland.' But there are real jewels here among the mock-ups. Albrecht Durer's house, authentic to the last exposed beam, leans invitingly at the edge of a picturesque square, requiring you to enter and admire Albrecht's taste in severe interior decor. His paintings are in another part of town at the German National Museum. The Toy Museum is a Grade 1 disorientation experience. It transports you straight back to your childhood - or Germany's childhood - as you admire the gizmoes, follies and knick-knacks commemorating Nuremberg's history as, a guidebook tells me, the world capital of toy production. I especially enjoyed the toy horse that, when wound up, plays an excerpt from Die Meistersinger and then jumps over a large frog. As for the churches, you must not miss the Frauenkirche and Saint Sebaldus. The first was originally commissioned as a court chapel by Emperor Charles IV, but was gussied up in the 16th century by the addition of a gable, an oriel and a charming tinkling clock-mechanism. The older Saint Sebaldus houses a priceless cornucopia of carvings, sculptures and richly-wrought shrines. Though I stayed at the Novotel, simply because it was there, my German friend swears by the Zirbelstube Hotel on the Ludwig Canal: very picturesque, he insists, with one of the best restaurants in town. Finally, though, I have a few reservations about Nuremberg. No, it should not be missed, and yes, it is stuffed with sightseeing gems and relics of history. But too much of the town is sanitised in its presentation. You will not find the real Hans Sachs here: the old cobbler has fled to comfier, more mellifluous lands, far from the squawking Beckmessers of the tourist trade. Perhaps worse, you will not find the real Hitler here. A town that should exist as an Awful Warning to those who come after has largely tidied away its Nazi past: aided by hotel-keepers who do not understand their guests and gipsy families who scarcely know what ground they so heroically desecrate. It is good to put evil out of our heads; but only so long as it can be brought back whenever humanity, especially in these neo-Nazi times, needs a sharp dose of memory therapy.</p>

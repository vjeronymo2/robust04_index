			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Frank Wisner, U.S. under secretary of defense for  policy, arrived in the ROK on 14 March to discuss the North  Korean nuclear issue and measures to promote security  cooperation between the ROK and the United States.    Visiting the ROK after accompanying U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher to China, Under Secretary Wisner on 15 March will  seriously discuss the North Korean nuclear issue and other  matters with Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi  Pyong-tae, and Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential assistant for  diplomacy and security.    Regarding this issue, a government official noted that  "Under  Secretary Wisner has come to the ROK to better understand the  latest security situation on the Korean peninsula. However, the  issue of resuming this year's Team Spirit exercise, which has  been conditionally suspended, will also be discussed in the  event that no progress is made regarding the exchange of special  envoys during the seventh North-South working-level contact  slated for 16 March."    Noting that Under Secretary Wisner is in charge of nuclear  policy in the U.S. Defense Department, the official pointed out  that during the current ROK-U.S. consultations, an overall  review will be made concerning the North-South mutual nuclear  inspections, which our side will raise in the course of  exchanging special envoys, and concerning ways to resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue.    Seven members, including (Stanley Ross), deputy assistant  secretary of defense for East Asian and Pacific affairs; Michael  Ryan, assistant to the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Kent  Wiedemann, special assistant for Asian Affairs of the National  Security Council in the White House, are accompanying Under  Secretary Wisner.</p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Manufacturing output falls MANUFACTURING output fell in September to its lowest level since January, according to government figures released yesterday that showed few prospects of an early upturn. The Central Statistical Office said seasonally adjusted output fell 0.4 per cent between August and September. The fall would have been greater except for a large increase in car production in September, mainly for export markets. CSO officials believe manufacturing output is essentially flat, a slightly more pessimistic view than a month ago when they said production appeared to be rising by a year-on-year 0.5 per cent. The weak September figure contributed to manufacturing production in the third quarter of the year being 0.1 per cent down on the second quarter. That bore out fears that the improvement in the sector's output in the first six months would probably not be sustained. Manufacturing output in the third quarter was down 0.8 per cent on the corresponding period last year. It is now 7.5 per cent below the peak for the sector recorded in early 1990, just before the recession. The low production by manufacturing in September was offset by higher output of oil and gas, which rose 2 per cent during the month, mainly due to the effects of weak output in August on account of maintenance work. Production industries as a whole - manufacturing, energy (including oil and gas) and water supply - rose thanks to the good performance of the energy sector, with a 0.3 per cent increase in output in September on the previous month. In the third quarter, output for these industries was up 0.6 per cent on the previous quarter, but down 0.6 per cent compared with the same period a year ago. In manufacturing, output of motor vehicles and components increased 10 per cent in September compared with the previous month, when production was unusually low. Production for export during September rose by 50 per cent. Productivity in manufacturing continued its recent rise, with output per head showing a rise in the third quarter of 4.4 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p>

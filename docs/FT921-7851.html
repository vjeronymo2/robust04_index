			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (17): Gold-plated electronic future - There are more than 1m carphones in the UK THE MOBILE phone has become as much a fixture in the typical executive's company car as the dashboard clock or the spare wheel. Just 10 years' ago few could have predicted its impact on business efficiency and working practices. The next 10 years, however, could see a host of new communications devices introduced to vehicles. Before the introduction of cellular radio in the UK in 1985, there were fewer than 50,000 carphones in use, many of which had to be manually 'patched into' the public telephone network by an operator. Today there are more than 1.3m, an increasing proportion of which (now more than 50 per cent) are of the take-anywhere hand-portable variety and all of which are attached to fully automatic networks. Typical retail prices - even of the hand portables - are a fraction of those of a decade ago. The low cost and consequent high popularity of the mobile phone has been largely the result of new technologies which combine computing and communications to make highly efficient use of limited radio spectrum resources. The same technologies also st developments. Today's Total Access Communications System and Extended Total Access Communications System (TACS and ETACS) standards, which account for most mobile phones in the UK, are set to be replaced during the 1990s by the Global System for Mobile communications (GSM). GSM, is an all digital version of today's analogue TACS/ETACS cellular radio system. It offers the added advantages of in-built text messaging as well as the ability eventually to use mobile phones in other European countries. Services based on GSM are now being launched across Europe although, ironically, the UK's high density of users of analogue mobile phones is likely to delay its introduction in Britain. Another big advantage promised by GSM is its relative ease in handling of mobile data traffic from such terminals as facsimiles or computers in vehicles. Today's analogue systems also offer limited support for mobile data. But GSM should be able to offer five times the data rate and with greater degrees of integrity and security. A rival to GSM's data role, however, is likely to arise from dedicated mobile data service providers. In the UK, four such companies have already received licences - electronics company Dowty subsidiary Cognito, Hong Kong-owned Hutchison Mobile Data, US-owned Ram Mobile Data and semiconductor, computing and radio communications giant Motorola. Three of these have now launched services and are reporting good take-up rates. Makers of terminals also see mobile data as the way of the future. Last year US computing giant IBM landed a bombshell in the personal computing market with the unveiling of a series of laptop computers dedicated to use as mobile data terminals. It listed three new models with in-built communications facilities, two featuring wireless technologies. IBM describes the 3kg PCs as 'note-book sized, ruggedised, battery-operated computers' which allow users to access and input information from remote locations. One model is designed to communicate over dedicated mobile data radio networks. The second operates over cellular radio-based mobile telephone networks, and features an optional extra handset allowing it to be used as a mobile telephone as well as a mobile data terminal and portable computer. The third uses ordinary fixed telephone lines. However, IBM is not the only company investing in the future of mobile data. Before the IBM announcement, a number of companies had dedicated wireless data computer terminals on the market and Japan's NEC and the US's NCR even had laptop computers on the market with built-in radio communications. Satellites promise to play a significant role in mobile communications in the 1990s. The International Maritime Satellite organisation (Inmarsat) and the European telecommunications satellite organisation (Eutelsat) have launched messaging services aimed at international freight haulage companies so that truckers can keep in constant two-way contact with their bases. The messages are restricted to data/text only and the receiving equipment is relatively large and expensive, but future developments promise smaller and cheaper equipment, also capable of transmitting and receiving voice signals. Inmarsat, for instance, is collaborating with US company GE Astro to design satellites 20 times more powerful than the Inmarsat spacecraft. 'Customers will be able to travel all over the world and communicate with each other via telephone, facsimile, personal computers or pagers using terminals that are small enough to fit into business briefcases', says Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director-general. In recent years, a number of newcomers to satellite-based mobile communications have claimed they can offer full voice communications with even smaller and cheaper handsets. The first of these newcomers was Chicago-based Motorola with its Dollars 2.3bn Iridium project. Here the plan is to use 77 low earth orbit satellites to offer links for voice, facsimile and data to handheld terminals anywhere in the world. These satellites are cheaper to build and launch and do not have the great signalling distances to overcome from outer space which affect today's communications satellites. Inmarsat, France's Alcatel and Japan's KDD are also studying systems similar to Motorola's. Mr Lundberg, of Inmarsat, believes his organisation should be able to provide global voice services to hand-held terminals by the end of the decade. Compatibility with terrestrial cellular systems is a priority and should not cost more than Dollars 1,000, with service delivery costs not rising above Dollars 1 a minute, he adds. As with today's mobile telephone systems, Mr Lundberg notes that any manufacturer should be able to provide equipment for the system, providing it is type-approved. By 2000, he predicts, the worldwide mobile satellite user population could reach 1m to 2m, mainly international business travellers, justifying investments in the region of Dollars 1bn.</p>

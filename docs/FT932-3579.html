			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Yeltsin adamant on Kuriles PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has told Japanese hosts of next month's Group of Seven summit not to expect any concessions on the four Kurile Islands they want back from Russia, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow. In comments which are likely to be seen by Tokyo as insulting, he said on Saturday he felt 'a certain discomfort' as there would be a meeting with Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, and the question of the islands would come up. 'I will not be able to tell him anything new.' Mr Yeltsin, who is expected to discuss aid for Russian economic reforms with G7 leaders in Tokyo, is also likely to touch on bilateral issues in talks with Mr Miyazawa. Meanwhile, it has emerged that the shadowy security council - a committee of senior officials that deals with foreign and some domestic affairs, in addition to security - is to be headed by Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, previously head of the Commonwealth of Independent States' unified command.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Annual compliance costs as a percent of sales are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 20 percent (percentage points) higher for small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Capital cost of compliance represents a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant portion of capital available to small entities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The requirements of the regulation are likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in closures of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A ``substantial number'' of small entities is generally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be more than 20 percent of the small entities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the affected industry. Since the economic analysis deals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only with small entities (in this case, facilities), it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also an initial RFA, and conclusions about the impacts on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small entities can be drawn from what was done there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already. Each of the criteria for significant impacts will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered in turn.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The largest increase in total cost of production from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased emission control is 0.61 percent (SIC 359_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Industrial Machinery, n.e.c.). This figure is well below  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the significant-impact threshold of five percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Assessing the differential impacts, measured by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparison of compliance costs as a percent of sales for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small and large entities, is more difficult as large model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities were not analyzed in the economic impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. Treatment of this small business impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion involves creating two large model facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is assumed that large facilities use large solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cleaning machines, then compliance costs for large cleaning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> machines are negative, and are thus savings. To be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conservative, it is assumed here that large model facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possess five very large solvent cleaning machines, so that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``maximum savings'' case is modelled. This case is important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as it models the maximum cost differential between large and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Large model facilities were created for SICs 359  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Industrial Machinery, n.e.c.) and 254 (Partitions and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fixtures). SIC 359 was chosen because the small model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities in this group experience the highest cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> absorption impacts when compared with other small model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. SIC 254 was used because it had the smallest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average per-facility revenue of facilities with greater than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 100 employees. Thus, if they incur the same absolute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings as other large facilities, their relative percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings will be the highest, and they will experience the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greatest cost savings in percentage terms as a result of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. The cost differentials are in no case larger than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one percentage point. Thus, by this criterion, small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business impacts are not deemed significant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The third criterion focuses on the amount of capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to small businesses or facilities. Since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital costs incurred as a result of investment in control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment needed for small businesses to meet the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was less than 10 percent of the businesses' total assets in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all 39 affected SIC codes, it was concluded that the total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets of small facilities will not be so adversely affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as to prohibit the procurement of outside financing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Examining an increase in capital costs as a percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total assets is a measure of the ability of a firm or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to meet this capital costs increase.) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion, then, is that lack of available capital will not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be an obstacle for small facilities in complying with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Criterion number four stipulates that small business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts are significant if compliance leads to closure. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only implication of closure in the economic impact analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is found in the section on earnings impacts. Here it was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found that, under worst-case assumptions, closures might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur in only two SIC codes, 254 and 259 (Miscellaneous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furniture and Fixtures), given their low rate of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> profitability in the baseline. If this indeed occurs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> question of whether or not these closures make up a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial portion of small entities must be addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actual number of impacted facilities in the 39 impacted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SICs is unknown. If it can be assumed that each SIC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacted in the same proportion, a proxy for the share of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacted facilities represented by SIC codes 254 and 259 is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the total number of facilities in these SIC codes as a share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the total number of potentially impacted firms. SIC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes 254 and 259 hold a combined total 3,194 small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities. This makes up 3.4 percent of the total 93,121  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small facilities in all 39 SIC codes. Thus, in the extreme  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case that some closures result, the number of closures is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to be far less than the amount required to impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a substantial number of facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In conclusion, and pursuant to section 605(b) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant economic impact on a substantial number of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities. The basis for the certification is that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic impacts for small entities do not meet or exceed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the four criteria in the Guidelines to the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act of 1980, as shown above. Further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information on the initial RFA is available in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> background information package (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Background Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Document <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section near the beginning of this preamble).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 9 and 63  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection, Air pollution control, Hazardous substances,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Halogenated solvent cleaning machines, Reporting and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: November 15, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Carol M.

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Pacific Rim puts Japan in the shade Pacific Rim markets, with the exception of Japan, were strong last week as Hong Kong attained an all-time high and Singapore attracted institutional buying. However, weakness in Europe, and a listless Tokyo ahead of the Golden Week holidays, restricted the gain in the FT-Actuaries World index to 0.57 per cent in local currency terms. Hong Kong was initially boosted after a leading Chinese politician reiterated the already widely publicised view that economic reforms in China would continue. This was followed by the announcement by Lloyds Bank that it was to challenge HSBC's bid for Midland Bank, of the UK. Any signal that HSBC's bid might fail is being welcomed, says Mr David Bates of Asia Equity in London. 'The view in Hong Kong is that they would prefer HSBC to invest in China,' he added. This was demonstrated last Wednesday when rumours that HSBC might increase its Pounds 3.3bn offer knocked 50 points off the Hang Seng index in 15 minutes. However, the market rallied in the last two days of the week, on Friday climbing 2 per cent to a record level as investors anticipated the half-point cut in interest rates that was announced after the close. A buy program worth Dollars 100m by a US index fund on Thursday boosted Singapore. The program was the equivalent of an average day's turnover. Speculation that this week's first-quarter GDP figures would reveal growth of some 5 per cent, better than expectations, also helped to lift sentiment later in the week. After last Thursday's 2 per cent advance was equalled on Monday (the market was closed on Friday) the Straits Times Industrial index fell back yesterday, closing 10.32 off at 1,488.65. South Africa was lifted by the return of institutional investors, who opted for industrial and mining shares. A rise in the price of gold and platinum gave additional buoyancy to the market. A presentation by De Beers, at which the group forecast sales for the first half of 1992 15 per cent below those of the corresponding 1991 period, was seen as positive. An earlier prediction had put the fall at between 25 to 35 per cent. Some analysts, however, expect the South African market to consolidate this year after the 40 per cent rise in the industrial index last year. Mexico was depressed by Telmex's first-quarter figures showing an unspectacular 13 per cent increase in net earnings. Some analysts also noted that investors were taking profits ahead of the utility's Dollars 1.5bn offering of American Depositary Shares. The release of better than expected inflation figures gave a boost to the Australian market in the second half of the week, the index rising to a three-month high. A flat inflation figure for the March quarter has fanned expectations that the government would cut interest rates. Norsk Hydro, Norway's biggest listed company, gave a fillip to that market with the news that it returned to profits in the first quarter after a net loss of NKr498m for 1991. Another positive signal was given by Elkem, the metals producer, whose first-quarter results exceeded expectations. The company also forecast rising demand throughout the rest of 1992.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Information we received last night stated that  President Jean-Bertrand Aristide had sought military action, an  operation, as it was reported by a U.S. newspaper, to cut off  the Haitian military power.    According to the newspaper, however, President Aristide said  he would not want this force, which would come to chase away the  military, to remain in the country. Today, President Aristide  seems to have reconsidered his decision, or at least has denied  having made it. Rothschild Francois has further details:    [Begin Francois] Indeed, in a statement just made by  President Aristide on the premises of Trans-Africa in  Washington, he stated that he never asked for U.S. military  intervention in Haiti as a solution to the crisis. Mr. Aristide,  speaking before a group of reporters, following a lunch in his  honor hosted by Rindall Robinson on the premises of  Trans-Africa, stated: We are not seeking a military occupation  in Haiti, adding that if he asked for military intervention in  Haiti, the parliament would dismiss him in accordance with the  Haitian Constitution. The president said, however, some action  could help free the nation from the bandits now occupying the  political scene in favor of a return to democracy in Haiti.    The president-in-exile said some quick, determined action  could be taken to chase out the military, within the framework  of the Governors Island agreement. Aristide said he would not  give details on what he calls quick action. He says the  international community knows what to do in this case.    Mr. Aristide favors sending the UN technical mission to  Haiti, as provided for in the Governors Island agreement, and  his own immediate return. He also asks that the reform program  outlined in the Governors Island agreement be applied. How long  should the international community stay in Haiti? The  president-in-exile stated that, according to the Governors  Island agreement, the international community would spend six  months, which would be renewable. We are ready to work with the  international community to reach these objectives, he said.    He pointed out that the above four steps represent the  process for the return of democracy to Haiti. President-in-exile  Aristide indicates that following the restoration of democracy  in the country, there would be national reconciliation, which  would help establish political stability, necessary to progress  in Haiti, and also that this situation would help build a nation  based on unity and offering hope. Then Haiti would be able to  take care of its refugees and stop the boat people from going to  Miami, Florida. Aristide also said that when he was in power,  the situation in the country was correct. Let us listen to the  statements President Aristide just made in Washington, during  which he said that he never asked for a military intervention in  Haiti to solve the crisis:    [Begin Aristide recording, in English] We do not seek  military occupation. If I were to ask for military intervention,  I would be impeached under my Constitution. [In French] Be  clear, because I am clear. I did not ask for a military  intervention. I did not ask for a military intervention.  [repeats] There is my answer, after correcting your question.    We are working toward the restoration of democracy, which  implies a country where reconciliation must shine like the sun,  where justice must be the sun that without revenge, without  violence pleases everyone. Because from there, we can live in a  state of law. Everyday, during these 32 months, we have tried  our best to explore the horizons of this peaceful strategy. That  is why, while we are pleased to see the application of the  embargo, and hope it will be completely kept and respected.    We are also hoping -- within the scope of the agreement  signed on 3 July 1993 -- that some action will be taken so we do  not have to pay for the luxury of getting lost in statements  when actions are necessary and indispensable, to save the lives  of those who are eaten by pigs after being killed by the  military, the lives of those who are eaten by dogs after being  killed by the military. This was reported by those who visited  Haiti within the framework of the Inter-American Commission on  Human Rights. In this context, united with the international  community, united with the U.S., Canadian, French, Latin  American, and Caribbean friends, we would like to walk together  in order, along with the Haitian people, to save lives, the life  of every man and of every woman.

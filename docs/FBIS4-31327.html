			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 6 June (MTI) -- At the request of Gyorgy  Rasko, who ran for parliamentary deputy on the Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF) ticket in the 6th constituency --  Gyor-Sopron County -- and received 10 fewer votes than Gyula  Varga of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) in the run-off  elections on May 29, the National Election Committee checked the  342 invalid votes cast in the constituency and found 68 to be  valid.    Of these, 31 went to Rasko, 21 to Gabor Simon of the  Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), and 16 to Varga. In this way,  Rasko moved to first place with 9,417 votes, ahead of Varga, who  thus had 9,412 votes. Simon received 21 additional votes, but  even so he remained third, with 8,200 votes.    At Rasko's request, on Thursday [9 June] afternoon the  committee will re-examine all 26,000 votes cast in the  constituency. The MDF would thus send 38 and the SZDSZ 69  parliamentary deputies to the 386-seat parliament.</p>

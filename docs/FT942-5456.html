			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Conflicting signals from Dale Electric Dale Electric International put out conflicting signals to shareholders yesterday when it announced that an approach had been made which might lead to an offer for the company, but followed this up with a profits warning. The share price of the power systems manufacturer reacted accordingly, rising 12p to 79p on news of the potential offer but falling back to close at 71p. The company stated that it was preparing a restructuring which was 'likely to involve a material reduction in the value of the group's net assets as at May 1 1994' and would result in heavier losses than anticipated. This announcements came less than three months after it launched a Pounds 5m rights issue to reduce debt and improve productivity. Dale gave no indication of the nature of the offer, but it emphasised that 'discussions are at a very preliminary stage'.</p>

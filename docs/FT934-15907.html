			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness slides Strong speculation of imminent changes at Guinness produced hefty turnover in the shares, which fell sharply to close 10 down at 407p. A variety of rumours underpinned the retreat, the strongest of which suggested that LVMH, the French luxury goods group with a 24.9 per cent cross-holding in Guinness, was ready to announce a restructuring. According to gossip in both Paris and London, this could involve Guinness taking control of LVMH's wines and spirits business in return for its stake in the French group. LVMH shares tumbled in Paris on the speculation, fuelled also by reports of fund managers returning negative from a trip last week to LVMH's far eastern operations. Guinness, which also has substantial business interests in the region, weakened in sympathy too. Further damage was done by speculation that a meeting with UK analysts by Burn Stewart yesterday left the impression that Guinness was increasing its lower-margin bulk whisky presence. Guinness later denied all the stories. A spokesman said that there were no plans to change the relationship with LVMH and that the company was reducing its bulk whisky business, not the other way round. Burn Stewart shares slipped 3 to 108p on dull results.</p>

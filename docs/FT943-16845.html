			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / Master of surprise charts risky course: Arafat continues to keep world guessing Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, is proud of his unpredictability; it is a quality which for 30 years has served him well. It has kept him one step ahead of lethal enemies, out of the clutches of allies who tried to control him, and helped build the image of a man who wanted the world to believe that the fate of the Middle East's most intractable problem rested on his shoulders. The only surprising thing about the suddenness of his decision to visit Gaza yesterday was that anyone was surprised by it. Mr Arafat consults, but he alone decides. On Wednesday morning in Tunis many of his closest aides, working alongside Mr Arafat, first learned of his decision to go to Gaza through the media. They did not know then exactly what had prompted the decision, and yesterday still did not. They smile, shrug their shoulders and sigh deeply. This was the sort of surprise they had come to expect, but not to explain. By Mr Arafat's standards this was a very modest surprise, merely a matter of timing, not of strategy. He may not reap such extensive international exposure as he would like, but he will have marked another stage in the still long march towards his ambition of becoming president of an independent Palestinian state. A year ago, yesterday's events in Gaza would have seemed inconceivable. Then he was embattled by critics from within his own organisation, was failing to show any real progress in the negotiations with Israel in Washington, and appeared an increasingly lonely man whose career might have run its course. But even as his critics were writing him off, Mr Arafat was secretly negotiating the deal which would catapult him on to the lawn of the White House, and Israel into doing the one thing which successive governments swore would never happen - formally recognising the PLO. The debate still rages among Palestinians, and among those who promote their cause, about the merits of the deal negotiated by Mr Arafat: whether it is a formula for continued Israeli domination of Palestine, or the first irreversible step towards an independent state. Whatever the eventual outcome, Mr Arafat is seen as a vital component by Israel and the US, the two governments which sought longest and hardest to exclude him from the equation. To hear Israeli diplomats defending the PLO chairman against his Palestinian critics has been one of the more remarkable experiences of recent months. An even bigger surprise would be if Mr Arafat chose to remain in either Gaza or Jericho for very long. He is a compulsive traveller, in part to avoid the set patterns which favour assassins, but also to keep the Palestine issue at the forefront of world attention. Predictably, his aides have no idea where he will next set up home, and despite his formal farewell to President Ben Ali of Tunisia this week there is little evidence of Palestinian offices in Tunis preparing to close down. Quite apart from security considerations, Mr Arafat will want to keep a balance between the substantial Palestinian population in the diaspora and those living in the territories, while also maintaining a greater geographical distance between himself and Israel as talks begin on the next stage of the peace process. If those talks run into difficulties, as seems probable, Mr Arafat will be looking for the greatest possible room for manoeuvre, both in relation to Israel and to his own constituency. The fear is that such manoeuvring will be at the cost of the detailed but unspectacular work needed to establish the Palestinian self-rule authority in the liberated areas. A start has been made, but it has been slow and Mr Arafat's unwillingness to delegate has increasingly irritated the international donor governments which have contributed Dollars 2.4bn (Pounds 1.57bn) to the development of the West Bank and Gaza over the next five years. They all recognise that an improvement in basic living standards will contribute more than anything else to the acceptance of the peace process by the majority of Palestinians. However, Mr Arafat, in common with other guerrilla leaders before him, is finding the adjustment from freedom fighter to chief executive hard to make, particularly as the largest part of the territory he seeks is still under occupation. With elections to the self-rule authority due to be held after the completion of Israeli troop withdrawals, Mr Arafat is predictably also seeking to ensure that his closest supporters are in the most advantageous positions, a further obstacle to the establishment of an efficient administration. But however great the frustrations, Mr Arafat again underlined yesterday that no other Palestinian can rival his political status. 'Not everyone loves him', said a PLO official yesterday. 'Of course we know that some people despise him, even hate him. But for now, at least, he embodies the dream of a Palestinian state, of independence, and freedom for our people. Whether he will still do so in a year's time remains to be seen.'</p>

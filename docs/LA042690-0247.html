			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'AIDA' COMING TO GIANTS' TURF  </P> <P> Stone-faced Dallas Cowboys Coach Tom Landry was the closest thing to the Sphinx  ever seen in Giants Stadium -- until now.  </P> <P> A 55-foot replica of the Egyptian wonder is coming to New Jersey in June for a  spectacular $7-million production of the opera "Aida."  </P> <P> While most operas aren't over 'til the fat lady sings, this one won't be done  until 1,200 cast members, a 100-piece orchestra, a menagerie of exotic animals  and the eight-ton Sphinx are paraded through Giants Stadium for two nights.  </P> <P> Promoters are hoping for 39,000 people each night for the June 1-2 shows.  Giants Stadium is the latest stop for the opera, which is billed as the biggest  production of any opera, ever.  </P></p>

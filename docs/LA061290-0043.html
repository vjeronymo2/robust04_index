			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSINESSMAN SHOT DEAD OUTSIDE HOME;  </P> <P> CRIME: POLICE SAY THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A STRUGGLE IN THE DRIVEWAY. THEY HAVE NO  SUSPECTS AND NO MOTIVE IN SAN MARINO'S FIRST MURDER IN MORE THAN 10 YEARS.  </P> <P> A Taiwanese businessman was shot to death early Monday after a struggle in the  driveway of his San Marino home, authorities said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide detectives, who were called by local  police to investigate the slaying, said the motive for the attack in the 1300  block of Bradbury Road was not clear.  </P> <P> A neighbor heard a car drive away moments after three shots were fired,  investigators said. But no suspects were identified or in custody.  </P> <P> Detectives said the 43-year-old victim, whose name was withheld pending  notification of relatives, ran an import-export business in the Los Angeles  area.  </P> <P> San Marino police said it was the first homicide in the quiet, upscale San  Gabriel Valley community since a service station attendant was killed in 1979  during a robbery.  </P> <P> The neighbor, who asked that she not be identified, said the victim and his  wife had purchased the property about six months ago, but didn't move into the  home until a couple of weeks ago.  </P> <P> "They were very nice and friendly," the neighbor said. "They always waved  'Hello.' "  </P> <P> Police said the victim apparently had driven home, parked his car at the rear  of the house and was walking back along the driveway toward the front of the  property when he was confronted by one or more assailants.  </P> <P> The neighbor, who had gone to bed several hours earlier, said she was awakened  by the sound of three gunshots at 12:21 a.m.  </P> <P> "Then I heard the sound of a car driving away," the neighbor said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's investigators said a San Marino police officer, who happened to be  patrolling in the area, heard the shots but arrived too late to see the  departing car.  </P> <P> The neighbor said she did not see the car either.  </P> <P> Investigators said evidence indicated that there had been a struggle before the  three shots were fired. A wallet containing cash was found on the victim's  body, but detectives did not rule out the possibility of a robbery attempt.  </P> <P> They said the victim's wife was not at home at the time of the shooting.  </P></p>

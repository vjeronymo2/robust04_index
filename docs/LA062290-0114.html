			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PLAYHOUSE HOPES TO OPEN IN SEPTEMBER  </P> <P> A theater company is moving into the Encino Community Center. If all goes  according to plan, the just-founded Encino Playhouse will stage its first  production in the center's 250-seat theater in September.  </P> <P> The group's founder, Stephanie Angelini, 38, is a set designer who has produced  plays at small, local theaters. "I heard about the theater they had in the  center and knew they had not had theatrical performances there for quite a  while," she said. She made a proposal to the city's Recreation and Parks  Department, which operates the center, and it was accepted.  </P> <P> But there are restrictions, Angelini said. Because of commitments to  non-theatrical groups already using the space, the center on Balboa Boulevard  will allow the theater company to perform only on Fridays, Saturdays and  Sundays.  </P> <P> Since the theater is larger than 99 seats, the Encino Playhouse is not eligible  for a waiver from Equity, the stage actors union. Angelini is a long way from  being able to afford union wages for her productions, so she will have to use  mainly non-union actors.  </P> <P> "But the union does allow me to use a restricted number of Equity actors under  a guest contract, as long as I pay them the union wage," she said. "We would  like to use at least one name actor in all our productions."  </P> <P> She hopes that with name actors on board, she will be able to raise funds for  productions from local businesses and individuals.  </P> <P> Angelini had planned on opening her first season with "A Thurber Carnival," but  she now hopes to open with a new play. "I just got a wonderful script by a  local playwright, Frawley Becker, that I would willingly hold 'Thurber  Carnival' for if I can get the right actor for it.  </P> <P> "Opening with a new play might not be playing it safe, but it would sure get us  noticed," Angelini said.  </P></p>

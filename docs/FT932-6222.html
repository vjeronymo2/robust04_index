			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Pakistan budget likely in June THE GOVERNMENT of Pakistan's newly reinstated prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif is expected to present the country's annual budget in mid-June. The budget is seen as one of the government's most important tests after Mr Sharif, who had been sacked by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, was swept back to office on Wednesday by a supreme court decision. Pakistan's budget deficit for the fiscal year ending on June 30 is estimated to have risen to over Rupees100bn (Pounds 2.47bn) against a target of Rupees65bn giving added urgency to this year's budget. Strains on the economy have also intensified due to a fall in the country's official and private foreign exchange reserves during the past month, as businesses became increasingly nervous over the growing political uncertainty. Many companies expect that the end of the financial year will see economic growth falling to just over 4 per cent, from over 6 per cent earlier. However, the government has not given a recent estimate of economic performance during the year. The drop in growth resulted partly from lower agricultural output - last year's heavy floods caused widespread damage to the cotton crop, considered the most important among the major crops. The government is planning a conference in Islamabad soon to assure business leaders that the economic reform programme remains on track.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The first-ever pocket devices for measuring the  concentration of glucose (blood sugar) and lactate (lactic acid)  were developed in Germany and came onto the market at the  beginning of the year, and now the breakthrough for  user-freindly miniaturized biosensor devices has been made in  environment monitoring too, with the formaldehyde detector  developed by Draegerwerk AG. An air pollutant detector will  come onto the market before the end of the current year in the  shape of the highly sensitive ``Bio-Check F'' pocket meter,  which is based on biomolecular detection principles. Unlike  conventional metering methods, which are so complicated that  they can only be applied by specialists and are  laboratory-dependent, this device can be used easily, rapidly,  and anywhere by anyone, and is also reasonably priced. This  will encourage widespread use in the interests of improving  health and environmental protection.    The main factors that had to be guaranteed in developing a  reliable system that private individuals could use to measure  the formaldehyde concentration in the air indoors were high  sensitivity, easy use, and low production costs. An indicator  surface on the ``Bio-Check F'' changes color from white through  pink to red, and comparison with a color-code strip shows  whether the formaldehyde concentration in the air is below the  maximum recommended indoor level, is equal to it, or exceeds it.  It is thus just as easy to use as, for example, an alcohol  level test for drivers. The new detector also brings the cost  of formaldehyde measurement way below (to less than a third of)  that of the laboratory process needed to date.    Formaldehyde is widely used as a basic ingredient for  synthetic resins. The gas, which in its pure form is colorless  and gives off a pungent smell, is used in the production of  amino plastics and phenolic plastics, which in turn are  ingredients of products such as adhesives, synthetic foams,  insulating materials, floor coverings, and textiles (which it  renders crease-resistant). If formaldehyde is released by the  glues used in furniture, wall coverings, and chipboard, or by  furnishing fabrics, it can cause discomfort or even, in higher  concentrations, constitute a health hazard. The Federal Health  Authority therefore recommends 0.1 ppm (parts per million) as  the threshold value for air quality assessment purposes in the  home, in schools, and in other indoor environments. In other  words, the formaldehyde concetration ought not to exceed one  10-millionth by volume, for example 0.1 milliliter per cubic  meter.    The new measuring system is enzyme-based. These biological  catalysts make it possible to single out and register only the  substance to be measured. To perform the measurement, the  system is activated by pressing the base of a phial in the  measuring device with the thumb, thus breaking it. The liquid  thus released flows into a small, permeable, sintered glass rod,  where it activates the freeze-dried enzymes and the reagents.  Of the molecules that diffuse over the surface of the glass  rod, the only ones converted are those ``recognized'' by the  enzyme contained there (formaldehyde dehydrogenase). As a  result, pigment molecules form on the surface of the rod. The  color change that takes place after two hours can be evaluated  using a color comparison strip.

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Malaysia ban 'cost power contract' Malaysia's ban earlier this year on placing government contracts with UK companies has cost Parsons Power Generation Systems a contract worth more than Pounds 100m, says the company's parent, Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group. The contract, for two 500MW steam turbine generators for the new Port Klang power station, would have helped Parsons overcome the orders gap it faces. Negotiations with the Malaysian authorities were halted when the trade ban was imposed in February, after the Sunday Times newspaper alleged bribes had been offered to senior Malaysian politicians by a UK company. The ban gave Parsons' US rival, General Electric, an opportunity, and it was announced last week that it had won the contract. Mr Richard Maudslay, managing director of Rolls-Royce Industrial Power Group, said: 'We were very close to winning it. These things happen. You have to get on with it. It's unfortunate but we will still continue to be active in the Malaysian market.' He said that previously the Gulf war halted a contract with the Iraqis. The loss of the Port Klang prospect reduces Parsons' chances of clinching new orders soon enough to avoid further job cuts. Manufacturing work on existing export contracts finishes next summer. Its main Newcastle upon Tyne base employs 2,100 people, but 400 jobs are going over the next month and 200 temporary jobs are to be phased out. Hopes of avoiding further redundancies hinge on winning an order from Singapore for two 600MW steam turbine generators for the Tuas power station early next year, and reaching agreements on at least one of three Indian power station projects.</p>

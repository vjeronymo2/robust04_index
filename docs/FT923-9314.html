			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Moscow and Kiev THIS WEEK'S agreement between the presidents of Russia and Ukraine to put the disputed Black Sea fleet under joint control for three years and prepare the ground for wide ranging trade and economic agreements is a victory for common sense. Sceptics warn that the agreement reached at Mukhalatka in the Crimea could be an exercise in papering over the cracks. They point to the rapid unravelling of the previous accord between the two men at Dagomys two months ago. But this time both President Boris Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk have at least gone out of their way to demonstrate their recognition of the need for a new co-operative alliance between the largest of the former Soviet republics. Russia without Ukraine is still by far the largest and most populous country in Europe. But without Ukraine's people and resources any attempt to restore the old superpower is unthinkable. The loss of Ukraine was therefore a bitter blow for nostalgics of empire, both Soviet and Russian. But independence was achieved without bloodshed and many of the genuine reformers in the Russian government, including Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, see the end of empire as a liberation for Russians who have borne its burdens for centuries. Mr Yeltsin shares this view and has been prepared to make the cultural and political adjustment required to deal with Ukraine as an independent sovereign state of 52m people. He negotiated with Mr Kravchuk as a national leader of equal status and both sides showed their readiness to compromise. This is good news for Russia and Ukraine, and for the rest of Europe, which fears instability in the east and receives Russian oil and gas mainly through pipelines running beneath Ukrainian soil. The long-term problem of what to do with the 380-ship navy and its 70,000 officers and ratings remains. Many of the ships are obsolescent, the strategic need for the fleet has evaporated and maintenance is expensive. When it is divided in three years both halves should be much reduced. In the meantime, it is important to work out a new command structure and to replace both Admiral Igor Kasatonov, the present commander, and the more stridently nationalistic Ukrainian officers, who helped to make the fleet the subject of rival nationalisms. Defusing the explosive potential of the fleet question in this way should free the leaders of both republics to concentrate on the really important aspects of their future relationship: trade and finance. It is desirable for both countries to explore other markets and for Ukraine to introduce its own currency. But nature has linked the two states umbilically and it makes sense for both to re-establish their economic links in mutually profitable, not mutually harmful ways. Essentially this means agreeing prices which reflect the relative cheapness of Russian energy and Ukrainian grain and a payments system which allows this trade to flourish.</p>

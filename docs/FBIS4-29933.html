			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Wednesday [22 June] Japan wants to conclude the  trade "framework" talks with the United States as soon as  possible in view of the rapid rise of yen against the dollar.    Kakizawa made the remark to reporters after a 20-minute  meeting with U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Charlene  Barshevsky at the Foreign Ministry.    Barshevsky is visiting Japan to hold a subcabinet-level  meeting on government procurement with Deputy Foreign Minister  Sadayuki Hayashi later in the day and on Thursday.    Kakizawa quoted Barshevsky as saying the U.S. wants to wrap  up the framework talks as early as possible because of pressures  from the Congress and from the market.    He said he replied that considering the rapid yen's rise,  Japan also wants an early conclusion to the trade negotiations.    Barshevsky carried a message to Kakizawa from U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor saying he wants to meet the  Japanese foreign minister to discuss the framework talks for an  early conclusion, Kakizawa said.    In Washington, Kantor said Tuesday he plans to discuss  macroeconomic and sectoral issues when he meets Kakizawa this  weekend in Los Angeles, although he did not give an exact date  for the planned meeting.    Kantor said his discussion with Kakizawa will cover all  aspects of the framework trade talks with Japan.    Meanwhile, Foreign Ministry officials quoted Kakizawa as  saying in the meeting with Barshevsky that his trip to the  United States is not yet set.    Kakizawa expressed hope that the subcabinet-level talks will  make progress, the officials said.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Christopher defends China line The US will not back down from its demands that China improve its human rights record as a condition for extending trade benefits, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said yesterday. In a signed column in the Washington Post, Mr Christopher wrote that 'our specific conditions for renewing MFN (most favoured nation trading status) are reasonable and attainable. . . . We are not asking China to apply American prescriptions, only to adhere to the universal standards of human rights that bind most nations in the world today.' His unrepentant article may be seen as a clear rebuttal of critics who claim his recent mission to China was a diplomatic disaster. But it also underlines differences in the administration over whether withholding trade privileges, which may prompt retaliation against US businesses, is the best way to improve human rights in China. Senior officials of both the treasury and commerce department have argued publicly that US commercial openings should not be sacrificed to the human rights concerns of the state department. At the weekend, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury secretary, hoped 'alternatives' could be worked out. Last week another senior White House official reflected the dilemma by saying that it was 'untenable' both that MFN not be renewed and that China's human rights record be ignored.</p>

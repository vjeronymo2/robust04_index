			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Smith's muddle a sign of Labour's Euro mess Sir, Last Friday John Smith signed the Labour party up to a European manifesto which includes, among other things, a compulsory maximum 35-hour week for industry. This created uproar in the media and throughout industry in general, so much so that by Saturday morning he was saying that he did not really mean it after all. Are we to understand that Mr Smith doesn't read what he signs? Or, perhaps he simply doesn't understand what he is signing. I would be very worried if one of my Amstrad blokes did deals on that basis. I would be even more worried if he knew what he was doing when he signed and then went back on his word 24 hours later. Surely, if someone signs a manifesto they do so committing themselves to all points within it. Does Mr Smith think he can pick and choose? Maybe he read it in a hurry rushing from one strike-bound Air France flight to another. I mean, let's be fair, ground staff at Charles de Gaulle only wanted to work fewer hours, and be guaranteed jobs for life. The other 'brain wave' in the manifesto is the promise that taxes on business will be 'levelled up' across Europe. Imagine how disastrous this would be for Britain. Has Mr Smith thought of the reasons why Japanese and American industry flock to the UK? Apart from all of the advantages of grants etc that we have to offer, it is because the UK has the lowest level of corporation tax anywhere in the EC. If you make corporation tax standard across Europe our Japanese colleagues will be building factories in the sunny south of France; and if there is no tax break they might as well enjoy the weather. The level of corporation tax we have in the UK is accepted by business as reasonable and, thus, the attention of industrialists is focused on productivity and profit. It would be horrific to consider businessmen turning their attention to running three sets of books as the Italians and Spanish have done for years. Will Mr Smith please tell us whether putting business taxes up is part of Labour's European policy, or is this another thing that he did not realise he had signed?

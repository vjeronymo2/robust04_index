			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> RELATIVES OF HOSTAGES GET A BRIEFING, ENCOURAGEMENT;  </P> <P> FAMILIES: 35 OF KIN GATHER AT SESSION IN LOS ANGELES. THEY GET MORE EMOTIONAL  SUPPORT THAN INFORMATION.  </P> <P> Her married name is Davis. A native of Kuwait, she was working in a computer  firm when she met the American who would become her husband. After the Iraqi  tanks rolled in Aug. 2, she was able to get out with their two young sons. Her  husband remains in hiding in Kuwait.  </P> <P> "My husband has not seen the sun in four months," said Davis, who asked that  her first name not be used. If he is discovered, she said, he would likely  become one of Saddam Hussein's "human shields" and the Arab friends who are  hiding him could face execution.  </P> <P> Davis was among about 35 people who gathered at a Westwood hotel Wednesday for  a private briefing on the Persian Gulf crisis by State Department officials.  All have relatives trapped in Iraq and Kuwait and are wondering when and how  their shared trauma might end.  </P> <P> Elizabeth Tamposi, assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, said the  briefing was established to help officials understand "the unique personal  burdens" experienced by family members. When possible, officials said, they  would offer assistance.  </P> <P> A State Department spokesman emphasized that the meetings "give families a  chance to meet each other, to network (with) each other."  </P> <P> Participants said they largely avoided sensitive discussions concerning  military options. Some who are married to Kuwaiti nationals or have American  relatives in hiding in Kuwait spoke of the need to drive Hussein's troops out.  But others, whose loved ones are being used as human shields at key military  targets, urged patience.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles meeting was the eighth in a series of nine briefings organized  by the State Department. The consular affairs office's Kuwait Task Force,  established to aid families of Americans held in Kuwait and Iraq, had  previously briefed families in Washington, Boston, Chicago, Orlando, Fla., and  twice in Houston. Another briefing is scheduled for today in San Francisco.  </P> <P> "It was for emotional support" rather than for imparting a lot of information  to the families, said Jan Chandler of La Canada Flintridge, whose brother,  Kevin Bazner, is being held as a human shield in Iraq. "It gave us a chance to  see the faces of people whose voices we've heard over the telephone the last  few months," she said of the briefing.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles meeting, Chandler said, was largely devoid of the expressions  of anger that marked some earlier briefings. "People seemed to want to do what  they could do to make things better," she said.  </P> <P> There was wide agreement, participants said, for an effort to persuade the  Voice of America to devote more air time to messages from home for hostages,  and interest was strong in improving delivery of "care packages" via the Red  Cross.  </P></p>

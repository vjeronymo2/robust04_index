			<p>BFN     [Text] The rally started three days ago by trade union  representatives from several regions continues in Victoria  Square.    Our correspondent has informed us that at this hour only the  representatives of the Alfa Cartel Trade Union Confederation are  in Victoria Square. Mr. Bogdan Hossu stated to our  correspondent that his trade union is preparing a communique in  response to the government spokesman's communique issued last  night. The Alfa Cartel assesses the government communique as  biased and irritating, which does nothing except establish  conditions to push out demonstrators, even by force, from  Victoria Square.    Likewise, we have been informed that buses and cars that  arrived from Hunedoara, Cluj, and Vilcea Counties are currently  present in the Victoria Square. The Alfa Cartel spokesman in  Victoria Square informed us that, at this hour, representatives  of trade unions in the area of mining and metallurgy have also  been joined by employees of Bucharest enterprise who are members  of the Alfa Cartel Trade Unions.    Our correspondents also informed us that at around 1210  local  time, participants in the Victoria Square trade union rally  tried to break through the law enforcement bodies deployed  around Victoria Palace. However, as a result of repeated  appeals through a bullhorn by the unit commander and Alfa Cartel  Leader Bogdan Hossu to the demonstrators to refrain from  violence, the demonstrators gave up the attempt to break through  the law enforcement unit. Anti-government slogans are currently  being chanted.</p>

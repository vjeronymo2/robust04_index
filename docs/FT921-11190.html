			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Telephone monopolies under fire SIR LEON Brittan, the EC's competition commissioner, yesterday called for the break-up of national telephone monopolies with the aim of reducing the prices of ordinary calls in Europe to US levels. The European Commission is due to review its telecommunications policy this year. 'In my view, this will have to include giving serious consideration as to whether there is still a justification in Community terms for continuing to permit monopolies in the provision of voice telephony services,' Sir Leon said, in a speech to the Spanish Employers' Confederation in Madrid. Any move to break up monopolies in the basic call service would meet with fierce resistance from most telecoms companies and EC member states, especially if Sir Leon and Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the telecoms commissioner, were to use special legal powers to force through reforms without member states' approval. Citing research published in the Financial Times last year, Sir Leon pointed out that a three-minute long-distance call in Europe could cost four times as much as a call over the same distance in the US.</p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Council compensation 'inadequate' Government proposals for compensating council workers who lose their jobs as a result of reorganisation in England are unacceptable, the chairman of the quango charged with organising the process said yesterday. The government wants workers to be offered discretionary compensation, with a maximum of 66 weeks' pay. But Mr Alan Atherton, chairman of the Local Government Staff Commission, told the annual conference of the Association of County Councils yesterday that any scheme had to be mandatory, and the proposed level of compensation was 'intrinsically inadequate'. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's local government spokesman, told the conference his party would vote against all reorganisation orders in parliament unless the compensation package was changed. He described the local government review as a 'shambles'. County councillors said that the proposals were unworkable and barely half as generous as those offered to workers when metropolitan counties were abolished in 1986. They predicted that nobody would volunteer for redundancy, creating 'chaos'. Mr Atherton also predicted that councils would need extra government funding to deal with the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) regulations of 1981, known as Tupe. Where Tupe applies, all employees in a concern transferred from one owner to another must keep their job on identical terms and conditions. According to legal advice published yesterday by Mr Atherton, Tupe would apply to district council employees - meaning that they were guaranteed a job with newly created councils - but not to most county council employees. Councils denied this. The associations for both county and district councils, and the Local Government Management Board, which represents councils in negotiations with unions, said that this would be vulnerable to legal challenge. Tupe should be assumed to apply in all cases, they said. Mr Keith Sonnet, head of local government for Unison, the public services union, said the union would mount legal challenges if all employees were not transferred on Tupe terms. Baroness Farrington, who chairs the association, said government funds must be provided for compensating and employing existing workers.</p>

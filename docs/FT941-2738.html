			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Washington extends BA-USAir code-sharing pact for a year The Clinton administration yesterday backed away from a trade confrontation with the UK by extending for a year a British Airways-USAir ticket code-sharing arrangement. However, Washington attacked the UK government for showing 'no real interest in pursuing a new and more liberal aviation regime'. Mr Federico Pena, transportation secretary, said the US would not allow any expansion of the code-sharing pact, which allows BA and USAir, the sixth largest US carrier, to market each other's flights under the same ticketing code. The two airlines operated in partnership between 38 US cities and London. Last year the deal was given a one-year conditional approval by Mr Pena, who linked the future of the pact to negotiation of a liberalised US-UK air services agreement. Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive of USAir, last night said the administration had acted 'in the best interests of the American consumer'. At the heart of the conflict is a US demand for additional flights by its carriers to London's Heathrow airport. Under a 1991 agreement, Heathrow can only be served by American and United. The US had also sought to link the code-sharing pact to the broader renegotiation of the US-UK bilateral aviation agreement. The UK had proposed a gradual three-stage process of liberalising transatlantic air services and had insisted the US honour its obligations under the 1991 agreement granting UK carriers code-sharing rights in the US. The US, however, refused to discuss the three-stage proposal. Washington came under heavy pressure from some of the biggest carriers to renounce the existing aviation agreement between the two countries. The UK in turn threatened to retaliate by cutting US services to Heathrow if the code-sharing pact was not renewed. Mr Pena said yesterday the extension of the code-sharing pact allowed the US to 'assess all its options'. The issue has been further complicated by BA's decision last week to suspend additional investment in USAir because of the parlous financial state of its US airline partner. BA has already invested Dollars 400m (Pounds 274m) in USAir for a 24 per cent stake.</p>

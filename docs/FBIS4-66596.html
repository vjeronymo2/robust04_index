			<p>CSO     [Text] Bombay, Feb. 24--India and Mongolia have agreed on  the avoidance of double taxation. This was revealed by the  Mongolian President, Mr Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, in a reception  accorded to him at the inauguration of the Indo-Mongolian  Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Indo-Mongolian  Friendship Society.    Mongolia is into its third year of democracy and has opened  up its economy to foreign investment. Seventy years of communist  rule had isolated them from the rest of the world and the  country grew up in the shadow of neighbouring Russia and China.  Mongolia has a population of 2.2 million and a land area of 1.5  million square kilometers.    Being a rural economy with animal husbandry and agriculture  as its mainstay, it is looking for technological support from  India in mining and processing of their vast resources in coking  coal, silver, copper, gold and molybdenum, building construction  and joint exploration of petroleum and uranium, power,  communications and rail and road construction in the  infrastructure sector.    Mongolia imported over $399 million in 1992 and can form a  market for Indian tea, medicines, kerosene, automobiles,  textiles, chemicals and fertilizers. Joint ventures and projects  are still in the negotiation stage, according to a member of the  trade team and they hope to finalise them soon.    Meanwhile, the Mongolian President today visited the  century-old Bombay stock exchange and witnessed the trading  activity.    The Mongolian delegation was received by the executive  director of the BSE [Bombay Stock Exchange], Mr A.N. Kolhatkar,  and the president, Mr G.B. Desai.</p>

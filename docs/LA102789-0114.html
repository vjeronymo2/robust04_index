			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURBULENCE IN JUNK BONDS ALTERS PLAN IN TW SERVICES BUYOUT  </P> <P> Jitters in the junk bond market have forced the investment group that agreed to  buy TW Services, which owns Denny's coffee shops, to reduce the amount of these  high-yield, high-risk bonds involved in financing the deal.  </P> <P> New York-based Coniston Partners postponed the sale of $1.1 billion worth of  junk bonds to be issued as a part of its takeover of TW, which also owns the  Hardee's and El Pollo Loco fast food chains and a 42% interest in Winchell's  Donut Houses.  </P> <P> The takeover of TW is one of the latest deals hurt by a turbulent junk bond  market. In recent months, sellers have had to boost bond yields to attract  cautious investors.  </P> <P> Paul E. Tierney Jr., one of the principal partners at Coniston, said: "There is  enough confusion, shall we say, in the bond market that doing a $1.1-billion  bond financing was going to be ill advised."  </P> <P> Tierney said the $1.1-billion worth of junk bonds would be "substantially  reduced" and replaced with funds mostly from Coniston and its investment  banker, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.  </P> <P> A meeting set for today, in which TW shareholders were to vote on the deal,  also was postponed. The voting is rescheduled for Nov. 21, when a new offer  should be ready, Tierney said.  </P></p>

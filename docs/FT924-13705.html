			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Management: What price a company car? - Perks / A new series begins with John Griffiths assessing the number one benefit's real value The company car still reigns supreme as the most common perk in British industry. According to the largest-ever survey of employee benefits, published this week by the Confederation of British Industry, 98 per cent of companies offer cars to at least some staff. However, several factors are now combining which could threaten the company car's supremacy. Recession has deepened, unemployment is climbing and, for the first time, employers are having to pay National Insurance contributions on an employee's private use of the company car. Now there is also the prospect of the personal taxation burden on some car users increasing sharply. More than 200,000 UK executives driving high-specification company cars face steep increases in their income tax bills under proposals from the Inland Revenue, likely to take effect next April. For a small minority, the rise could be up to 40 per cent in the tax payable on the private benefit of their cars - although the Revenue claims that 1.2m out of a total of 1.9m company car drivers would benefit from the revised structure. A growing number of companies, particularly in the financial sector, have begun offering a cash alternative to employees' cars. Others have 'bought out' their employees' cars and will no longer offer them to new recruits. A few of the hardest pressed have even begun thinking the unthinkable - simply withdrawing cars, with only partial or even no compensation. Debate about whether the company car - introduced in the mid-1970s as a 'perk' to get round pay freezes - is still worth having has been rumbling increasingly loudly since the late 1980s, as successive Budgets have imposed sharply higher taxation on the company car. Until recession bit hard, however, the debate centred on the benefit or otherwise to the employee, rather than the employer. However, companies are now starting to look at the fleet from the perspective of potential savings to the company itself. The considerations involved are not only financial. Against all logic, company cars remain deeply emotive for many of their users at all levels. Entitlement to a car and the hierarchy of company car models - from a junior rep's basic Ford Fiesta to the chairman's Jaguar or Rolls-Royce - increasingly have come to be identified by employees as a talisman of their value to their company and their status within the pecking order. This culture is deeply entrenched in a country where nearly half of all new car sales are made to corporate buyers. In all too many cases, company car policy has become a time-consuming affair for boards of directors which, particularly in times of recession, could be better employed in more productive work. Even where a company could successfully arrive at a fiscally neutral cash-for-car compensation deal, other disincentives can come into play. (As the chart, above, on a range of deals done by nearly 220 companies so far shows, reaching a sensible figure is more likely to be by accident than calculation.) What monetary value, for example, would most employees privately put on the 'no-hassle' aspects of their company cars? Endless motor trade surveys have shown consistently that most private car buyers loathe the new car purchase ordeal and the trade-in or private disposal haggle even more. What price is to be put, too, on regular maintenance and servicing? It is considerations such as these which are giving companies such difficulty in deciding whether they should 'buy out' company cars, maintain the status quo, or seek better cost-saving alternatives. National Westminster Bank, which operates one of the UK's largest and most diverse company car fleets of 11,500 vehicles, has decided to retain its fleet but run it it more efficiently. According to Peter Parkinson, head of Natwest's group vehicle purchasing, the effect of new policies has been profound. In little more than 18 months, Natwest has saved Pounds 20m, or nearly Pounds 1,750 per vehicle, he says. Bespoke computer software has been written to help track costs. Purchasing by individual subsidiaries has been ended and, instead, the group's overall buying muscle has been harnessed. Out has gone the previously entrenched culture of allowing 'user-choosers' at all levels to pick their car from an approved list of 29 manufacturers. Now there is a list of only seven manufacturers and Parkinson and his team, rather than users, specify the model and level of equipment in the cars. The choice is determined not by initial purchase price or discounts but by whole-life costs. It has scrapped fixed replacement cycles to take advantage of market swings  -and auction companies selling Natwest's old cars no longer set the reserves themselves and simply send in the resulting cheque. Senior managers are having their Granadas replaced by Sierras. More economical diesels, with their stronger resale values, are being introduced progressively. For more junior managers, two-litre cars are becoming 1.6-litre models. Overall, 94 per cent of the fleet is now chosen by Parkinson and his cohorts. Parkinson, while admitting that there was a hostile reaction within the company, says it has not reached overwhelming proportions. Other financial companies, most with a high proportion of 'perk' cars - and many of them covering low mileages and thus subject to the highest rates of personal taxation - have decided to end car provision altogether. JP Morgan replaced its cars with allowances ranging from Pounds 4,300 to Pounds 6,700 a year, while Bankers Trust has been phasing out its 420 perk cars with cash alternatives of up to Pounds 7,480. Midland Bank has taken yet another route, offering staff a cash alternative of up to Pounds 650 a month if they moderate business mileage. Those covering high mileages - above 18,000 a year on businesses - have to use a company car. For the very highest users, paying an employee mileage can work out more expensive than supplying a car. Companies may also find themselves having to deal with an image problem if senior staff turn up at clients' premises in 'old bangers'. In seeking to arrive at a sensible vehicles policy for his own company, Tony Leigh, facilities manager for the Air Call Communications group, has become convinced that there are no easy formulas for companies to follow in trying to arrive at car policy decisions. There is no option but for each company to undertake a detailed analysis of its own and employees' positions, he says. 'In recent years,' he told a conference recently, 'a plethora of computer models have appeared to provide the ultimate solution. Many have been developed by accountants and economists. 'I am tempted to ask whether recent events have shown either to be capable of running a country's economy, let alone something as complicated as a car fleet.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    RANGE OF CASH ALTERNATIVES OFFERED                      BY COMPANIES IN LIEU OF A CAR                            (POUNDS  PER ANNUM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Model                Jaguar         BMW      BMW      Ford Granada                     XJ6 4.2        530 i    325 i      2.8 i Ghia  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price       32,000       25,000    22,000       20,000 lower quartile        5,200        5,375     5,290        4,300 Median                7,740        6,900     6,000        5,970 Mean                  7,118        6,628     5,626        5,155 Upper quartile        9,450        8,100     7,700        7,300  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Model             Ford Granada       Ford Sapphire   Vauxhall Cavalier                 2.0 i Ghia x Auto   2.0 i Ghia Auto    1.8 GLi Auto  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price      20,000              18,000           16,000 lower quartile       4,300               3,920            4,328 Median               5,970               5,207            5,060 Mean                 5,165               4,518            4,328 Upper quartile       7,300               5,730            5,590  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Model               Ford Sierra        Ford Escort        Ford Escort                       1.8 LX              1.6 LX             1.3 L  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price        12,000             10,000             8,000 lower quartile         2,900              2,240             2,220 Median                 3,817              3,486             3,105 Mean                   3,782              3,284             3,034 Upper quartile         4,725              4,000             3,655  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Wyatt Consultancy  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Arts: Shock tactics needed - Off the Wall YOU, AS a lover of the arts, are being called to the colours. In your programme at the National Theatre, at the RSC, at ENO, in theatres and concert halls throughout the land, you will find your recruitment paper, a leaflet spelling out the threat to the arts in the UK which will follow from the government's apparent commitment to cut expenditure on the arts, indeed on the entire heritage, by 2 per cent in the November budget. Already the shock troops of the arts, the supporters of the Theatre Royal in Plymouth, have taken to the streets, lobbying yesterday outside the Department of the National Heritage in London. More discreet consultations are taking place in private, with businessmen and worthies on the boards of leading arts companies seizing any opportune meeting with the Prime Minister to make the case for the arts. There is a slight element of desperation creeping into the campaign. The arts establishment is convinced that National Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, has lost his battle with the Treasury; that Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is indifferent to the arts; and that only the PM can avert a cut, perhaps even as deep as 5 per cent. This would mean a Pounds 12.5m fall in the Arts Council's grant. The leaflets in the programmes are to rally public opinion, and to persuade arts goers to lobby their MPs, pointing out the flourishing state of the arts, how profitable they are for the UK. The Arts Council intends to spread the misery of any cuts evenly around its clients. It has quietly backtracked on its plan to back winners and punish losers. Removing grants from clients hardly made the Council look like the standard bearer for the arts. Those regional theatres threatened with severe cuts in their grants will not now suffer, and the proposed reduction in the drama budget will somehow be restored. There is also an official desire to steam ahead with the completion of the British Library. If only a little of the Pounds 50m plus going each year towards its construction in St Pancras could be switched to the performing arts then a voracious lobby would quickly be quietened. The art market is still convalescent but the opening of two galleries in Cork Street suggests a new confidence among dealers. The appearance of Beaux Art on the site of the old Kasmin Gallery brings to London a leading Bath dealer. The first show is of sculptures by the late Elisabeth Frink, priced up to Pounds 56,000. The opening on Wednesday of a new David Messum gallery on the site vacated by Bill Jackson (he has moved to New Burlington Street) is fraught with irony. Messum was forced by the the art market slump, and his bankers, to close his smart St George Street shop just over a year ago. Messum had virtually created the market for British Impressionism, and his stock of Newlyn School and Scottish Colourist pictures was one of the best in the UK and valued at well over Pounds 1m. County Bank found that trying to dispose of Messum's stock at auction was a commercial disaster. Now most of it has been returned to him to sell, and to his old clients. But in these cautious times the pictures in Cork Street will be modestly priced (under Pounds 3,500). The Royal Albert Hall is the latest arts organisation to make its case for some of the Millennium money to be raised by the Lottery. It did so gracefully as befits one of the most successful arts bodies in the UK (profits last year of Pounds 1m on a Pounds 4.4m turnover). It only wants a one-off Pounds 12m to modernise the Hall and pedestrianise its site. It joins a queue headed by Covent Garden (seeking Pounds 45m); the Tate (Pounds 50m for its new gallery of modern art); and Cardiff Opera House (costed at Pounds 60m), and many more. And still no one has any idea how much the Lottery, which now looks unlikely to start before 1995, will produce. The best bet is that the Millennium Fund will get around Pounds 50m a year. But here is some good news. There will be two Millenniums, or rather Millennia. Some arts organisations will want to celebrate in their new or renovated building on December 31 1999, while others, with a stricter adherence to truth, know that the new Millennium actually starts at midnight on December 31, 2000. This gives the Lottery more time to spew forth money. But one word of warning. The mega international artistes, orchestras, dance companies, etc., have quickly realised that they can command astronomical fees for appearing on December 31 in either year, or both. Of course promoters, who are already starting to plan their programmes, are taking a terrific gamble on the state of, say, Pavarotti's voice in seven years time, but amidst all the euphoria of the occasion few will be in a state to criticise the great man, or the price of tickets at the main arts venues.</p>

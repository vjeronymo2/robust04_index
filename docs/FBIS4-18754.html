			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by George Jones and Richard Savill in Belfast: "IRA </F> Unlikely To Extend Ceasefire"]    [Text] Hopes of extending the Provisional IRA's 72-hour  cease-fire faded last night after Mr John Major rejected calls  for clarification of the Downing Street declaration and issued a  "take it or reject it" ultimatum to Sinn Fein.    His uncompromising line was made clear in a letter to Mr  Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, who had asked for direct  dialogue with the Government on how to move the peace process  forward. Earlier, Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister,  made a last minute appeal to the IRA to extend the cease-fire,  which is due to end at midnight tonight.    In a statement issued from Cyprus, where he is on holiday,  he  said that the strong momentum for peace among ordinary people on  both sides of the divide made it "essential" that the cease-fire  was prolonged.    But Mr Adams appeared to rule that out. He said that,  although his party would keep moving the process forward, he  believed it was "unlikely" that the cease-fire would be extended.    Mr Adams had sent two letters to No. 10 Downing Street  calling for clarification of the Dec 15 Downing Street  declaration in which Whitehall and Dublin set out an agreed  framework for a settlement in Northern Ireland. He had blamed  the "stalemate" in efforts to secure peace on Mr Major's refusal  to enter talks on the meaning of the document.    A letter to Mr Adams from Downing Street, signed by Mr  Roderic Lyne, the Prime Minister's private secretary denied that  the Government was to blame. "Any pause in the movement towards  peace is because of the continuing violence and Sinn Fein's  failure unequivocally to renounce violence as a means to  achieving political ends," the letter said. "It is Sinn Fein  that excludes itself from playing a full part in the political  process."    The letter reaffirmed that, if there were a permanent end to  violence and if Sinn Fein committed itself to the democratic  process, the Government would be ready to enter preliminary  exploratory dialogue with it within three months.    "The joint declaration offers the way forward," the letter  said. "Sinn Fein can take it or reject it. But if violence  continues, it will only be because Sinn Fein have spurned the  opportunity to enter the democratic process."    Last night Mr Adams described Mr Major's response as  "evasive  and wholly inadequate."    He said: "This letter is a transparent attempt to evade the  issues which I raised in my correspondence, and it is a wholly  inadequate response to the very real opportunity to move the  peace process forward that currently exists."    The IRA's three-day suspension of its activities was  "unilateral and without condition." Sinn Fein had welcomed it  as an opportunity to end the present stalemate around the issue  of clarification. "Unfortunately Mr Major does not share our  concern to move forward." Mr Adams also published for the first  time his letter to Mr Major accusing ministers of a "negative  and dismissive" response to the IRA's "significant initiative."    He urged the Prime Minister "to reflect on the seriousness  of  the present situation and on the opportunity to move out of the  present impasse, provided by the IRA. I would again urge you to  grasp this opportunity to move the peace process forward. You  can best do so by authorising a meeting with representatives of  Sinn Fein so that we can receive clarification of the Downing  Street declaration in the same manner it was provided to other  particular parties. Your refusal to do so up to now has  created the present stalemate situation. It is crucial to the  peace process that this stalemate be ended."    A call for the IRA to extend its ceasefire also came from  the  Irish foreign minister, Mr Dick Spring, who denounced the  72-hour suspension as a "pathetically brief respite."    He added: "If it is to have any potential, that can be  realised only be extending it and making it permanent."    Addressing a conference in Tralee, Co Kerry, Mr Spring said  the Irish Government had made great efforts to clarify for Sinn  Fein and the IRA "any genuine points of perplexity" in the  Downing Street declaration.    Mr Spring said he saw no difficulty in both governments  "making clear where they stand on any aspect of the declaration."    But he said the republican movement must recognise that much  of the confusion had arisen from its own failure to specify in a  commonsense way the points it wished to have clarified.    "Their failure to do so raises understandable worries that  their aim is to draw the governments into a world of verbal  mirrors and shifting goalposts so as to blur the vital  distinction between politics and violence and to enter political  negotiations on a basis of armed conflict," he said.</p>

			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / UK Company News: Ashtead seeks Pounds 5.8m and sees profit fall THE ONRUSH of equity financing in the construction industry continued yesterday when Ashtead, the acquisitive plant hire group, announced it was raising approximately Pounds 5.8m net of expenses in a 1-for-4 rights issue. The issue of 4.49m new ordinary shares at 135p represents a 15.6 per cent discount to Tuesday's market price. Yesterday the shares slipped 2p to 158p on the news. The new shares will rank for the final dividend for the year to April 30. The move is aimed at strengthening the group's financial position to enable it to take advantage of the opportunities for expansion in the wake of the recession, directors said. 'Our competitors clearly have had a horrid time, and we expect more to go into receivership as conditions improve,' said Mr Peter Lewis, chairman. Historically bankers have tended to let their troubled customers go when it looks like they are going to be able to sell their assets, he explained. Additionally, Ashtead considers that its 5 per cent share of the highly-fragmented UK plant hire industry leaves it with significant scope for further expansion. The group's strategy through the current UK recession has been to maintain its business infrastructure of 49 profit centres and increase its market share even at the expense of short-term profitability. The rights issue was announced as Ashtead forecast a near-halving of pre-tax profits for the year to April 30. In the absence of unforeseen circumstances profits will be not less than Pounds 4m and earnings per share not less than 14.3p, the company said. This represents a 49 per cent fall in profits from last year's Pounds 7.82m and a 50 per cent drop in earnings per share from a previous 28.44p. Trading conditions deteriorated in the second half, following a disappointing first half which saw profits fall 31 per cent to Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 3.6m). Operating margins, although still among the highest in the industry, slipped from 20 per cent to 18 per cent in the second half, resulting in a forecast of 19 per cent for the whole year. Pending acquisitions, the proceeds of the rights issue will be used to reduce borrowings which have risen to about Pounds 14m. Gearing, which stood at over 83 per cent at the year-end will come down to about 40 per cent, directors said. 'I think we have taken our medicine in the form of this year's results, and now we stand a better chance to benefit from any upturn in the industry,' Mr Lewis said. On the basis of its profits forecast, the group expects to recommend a final dividend of not less than 3.025p making a total of 4.125p (3.75p).</p>

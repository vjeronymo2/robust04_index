			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALS: MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> HOW SMART DEALING, BORROWED BUCKS MADE BIG PROFIT FOR BASS  </P> <P> When you're a very smart billionaire, even deals that seem a little crummy turn  out to be very, very profitable.  </P> <P> Consider, if you will, the tale of Robert M. Bass, the Ft. Worth zillionaire,  and his takeover of one of the country's biggest troubled savings and loan  associations, American Savings Bank of Irvine. American, you may remember, was  owned by Financial Corp. of America, the nation's largest S&amp;L, now a  bankrupt hulk.  </P> <P> When American disclosed its 1989 earnings, those of us in the financial voyeur  business began to worry about Bass, who has parlayed a large inherited fortune  into an enormous fortune by successfully playing corporate takeover games.  </P> <P> Bass seemed to have made less than 40% last year on his American Savings  investment. True, the bank earned a nice $215 million on its $16 billion of  assets. But because Bass owns only 70% of American -- the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corp. owns the rest -- his share of the profit was a crummy $150  million. Divide that by the $400 million that Bass invested in American, and he  made a mere 37.5%.  </P> <P> For most of us, of course, 37.5% isn't mere. But for the Basses of the world,  that's passbook savings money. Especially considering that Bass made his deal  with M. Danny Wall, head of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who was holding a  garage sale in late 1988, shoveling dead S&amp;Ls and income tax benefits out  the door.  </P> <P> Fear not for Bass. When you figure out what he really made on his real  investment, he earned more than 150% on his investment last year. That's more  like it.  </P> <P> Bass' paper profit last year, being very conservative, was $223 million to  $310.5 million on an investment of $150 million. Bass earned this bonanza  despite having been shafted by the government, which decided after he had  plunked down his dough that he would have to add $240 million to American's  capital. The government going back on its word to Bass is one reason that no  one with money has been buying dead S&amp;Ls at the government's current  remnant sale, run by the Resolution Trust Corp.  </P> <P> But despite everything, Bass has still managed to make a fortune on American.  His secret: smart dealing and borrowed money.  </P> <P> Bass, it turns out, borrowed $250 million of the $400 million that he put into  American. When you slog your way through all the numbers, you discover that  American paid out $75 million of its 1989 profit to a Bass holding company to  cover interest on the borrowed money and to give the FDIC its agreed-on 75% of  Bass' income tax benefits.  </P> <P> That left a $140-million profit. Bass' 70% is $98 million -- a return of 65% on  his $150-million investment.  </P> <P> But wait, there's more.  </P> <P> Bass, remember, owns 70% of American, which is a very profitable institution  now that the government has taken responsibility for the bad loans and idiotic  interest rate gambles that sank the old American.  </P> <P> The Bass people, who would rather the world didn't recognize how good their  American Savings deal is, didn't want to talk to me about their deal. No one  wants to be hauled in front of the House Banking Committee, which let the  S&amp;L problem fester for years, and now wants to pillory anyone who has made  a dime from it.  </P> <P> If you take the numbers that Bass' people have given members of the financial  community -- numbers that I feel are too low -- you see that American Savings  ought to net at least $125 million a year after making its income-tax-savings  payments to FDIC.  </P> <P> In today's market, the shares of such an S&amp;L should sell for at least six  or seven times annual earnings -- or $750 million to $875 million.  </P> <P> Give Bass his 70% share of that, do the math I've done in the table  accompanying this article, and you see that Bass' stock is worth $125 million  to $212.5 million more than his investment. Plus, of course, there's his  $98-million share of the 1989 profit.  </P> <P> But Bass is a piker compared to what Ronald O. Perelman, the New York-based  takeover tycoon, has made on his S&amp;L investment. Perelman made an  $800-million paper profit last year on a $160-million investment.  </P> <P> The difference involves income taxes. Because the payments the government makes  to cover losses on the bad assets that Perelman and Bass inherited in their  S&amp;Ls are tax-exempt, both of their S&amp;Ls have huge tax losses. Perelman  can use those losses to shelter income produced by Revlon and other companies  that he owns. I think Ford Motor Co.'s S&amp;L deal works the same way.  </P> <P> But Bass' deal, as best I can tell, allows him to shelter nothing but American  Savings' profits. He can't shelter Bell &amp; Howell's profits with them. So,  even though Bass racked up $1.2 billion of tax losses by my estimate last year,  he could use only $215 million of them. He may be able to use the rest of the  losses someday, but I haven't counted them in my calculations.  </P> <P> Even though Bass has made a huge profit from the S&amp;L debacle that we and  our descendants will pay for until the end of time, you shouldn't be angry with  him. He bid for American Savings, fair and square, against other potential  buyers, and no one made the government deal with him. You should remember, too,  that Bass was willing to risk taking an $8-billion promissory note -- now one  of American Savings' assets -- from a federal agency that auditors had said was  insolvent.  </P> <P> You can't blame the Basses, the Perelmans and the Ford Motors for making good  deals for themselves. That's their job. What the federal government's job is,  God only knows.  </P> <P> BASS NETS NICE HAUL  </P> <P> Robert M. Bass has done very nicely with his investment in American Savings  Bank, a big, troubled S&amp;L that he took over in late 1988.  </P> <P> American's 1989 profit was: $215 million  </P> <P> Less interest, expense and FDIC payments of: $75 million  </P> <P> Left this for Bass to split with the FDIC: $140 million  </P> <P> Bass' 70% share was: $98 million  </P> <P> Which gave a profit of: 65%  </P> <P> But that doesn't count the value of Bass' stock in American Savings. Add the  stock's estimated value and you get the following:  </P> <P> His stock is worth at least: $525 million to $612 million  </P> <P> Plus his share of 1989's profit of: $98 million  </P> <P> Less borrowed money of: $250 million  </P> <P> Less his investment of: $150 million  </P> <P> Leaves him this far ahead: $223 million to $310.5 million  </P> <P> Which gives him a profit of: 149% to 207%  </P> <P> Source: Estimates from public filings.  </P></p>

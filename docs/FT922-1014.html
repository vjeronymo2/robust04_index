			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (14): Promising British market emerges - Age Of The Diesel EXPECTED changes in company car taxation in the UK coupled generally with significant improvements in technology can open the way for diesel-powered cars to gain significantly in popularity in the executive car market. The level of diesel car sales in different European countries is determined to a significant degree by government policy, particularly in the areas of fuel taxation, exhaust emissions policy and company car taxation. In Britain, the government review of the company car taxation system should mean that the present system, which is based importantly on engine size - in particular with a break point at 2 litres - will be abandoned in favour of a system based on value. Because diesel engines have a larger cubic capacity than equivalent petrol engines, the existing company car taxation system has discriminated in particular against diesel-powered executive cars with engines above 2 litres. The review of company car taxation announced in the last UK budget was in line with the report of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report on the car industry published in February. The commission suggested that the system of banding the tax scale charges by original market value and engine capacity had caused a clustering of highly specific cars at particular tax band thresholds, in particular 2-litre cars at just under the Pounds 19,250 band. It recommended that banding should be replaced in favour of expressing the scale charge as a percentage of the car list price or cost. This would remove discrimination against those buying cheaper cars within the band. Britain is already emerging as one of the most promising markets for diesel cars in Europe, although it has a long way to go to catch up the leading diesel countries such as France and Belgium. Demand for diesel cars has continued to rise in sharp contrast to the steep fall in overall UK new car sales, while the share captured by diesel engined cars has doubled in the past two years. According to leading car producers, demand has been boosted by the introduction of a series of new diesel cars which can match the performance and refinement of equivalent petrol-engined models. Significant progress has been achieved in both diesel engine and fuel technology, and these advances have been added to the traditional attractions of diesel cars, such as greater fuel economy - diesel cars use about 20 per cent less fuel than petrol-engined cars - higher second-hand values, and greater durability and reliability. Diesel cars have also begun to make a significant break-through in the company car sector. Changes in fuel duty in the UK budget widened the favourable differential between diesel and leaded petrol prices. In the two years since 1989, sales of new diesel cars in Britain have risen by 13.3 per cent from 123,345 in 1989 to 139,810 last year. In the same period, overall new car sales plunged by 30.8 per cent from a record 2.3m in 1989 to only 1.59m last year. Peugeot, the French car maker which includes Citroen, has made the biggest gains. With its combined Peugeot and Citroen marques, the French car maker accounted for 43.5 per cent of all diesel cars sold in Britain last year. It also supplies diesel engines to Rover, the British Aerospace subsidiary, for its Rover 200-400 series. The Peugeot brand alone boosted its share of the diesel new car market to 31.2 per cent last year from 25.2 per cent in 1990 and accounted for three of the five best-selling diesel cars in the UK with its 405, 205 and 309 ranges. The European market is dominated by France, where diesel cars accounted for 38.2 per cent of new car sales last year. But in Germany the diesel share was 12.1 per cent, while diesel cars accounted for 12.8 per cent of Spanish new car sales and for 10.9 per cent of the Dutch new car market. In contrast to other markets, diesel car sales in Italy have plunged in response to unfavourable tax changes. The diesel share of the Italian new car market fell to only 5.4 per cent from a peak of 26.1 per cent seven years ago. Diesel prices vary greatly in Europe ranging from 27.5p per litre in Luxembourg - at May 1992 exchange rates - to 51.6p per litre in Italy. In France, diesel costs about 35.9p per litre, in Germany 36.4p, and in Britain 45.3p. Most importantly, however, the UK still has one of the smallest differentials between diesel and unleaded petrol prices at 0.9p per litre, compared with 16.2p in France and 11.8p in Germany. As diesel technology improves, Toyota, the leading Japanese car maker, is presently testing a prototype V6 diesel engine with a difference; it is both a two-stroke and supercharged. The advent of relatively high-speed production car diesels from manufacturers such as Peugeot and Volkswagen since the late 1970s has already helped to change the notion that diesels are necessarily slow, noisy and smelly in relation to their petrol counterparts. Toyota's S-2 diesel engine, and similar units under development by rival manufacturers, takes the process a stage further. The combination of a relatively low compression ratio - about 16:1 - with supercharging eliminates the audible 'knock' associated with 'ordinary' diesels. The fact that there are twice as many firing strokes per engine revolution compared with an ordinary four-stroke car unit makes the engine at least as smooth as a petrol unit while at the same time bringing power up close to petrol levels. The reason that Toyota is not rushing the engine into commercial production is largely a function of its inability, as yet, to coax exhaust emissions down to compliance with the tighter pollutions controls being introduced in the US and elsewhere from 1994 onwards. Toyota is confident, however, that the problem will be overcome. The S-2 diesel produces about the same amount of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulates as a conventional diesel, but only about one third the oxides of nitrogen which are linked with acid rain. The Peugeot group with its large executive-sector cars such as the Citroen XM has developed a 2.1-litre unit incorporating the world's first multi-valve aluminium cylinder head for a diesel, complemented by a turbocharger. According to Peugeot, the XM so equipped is nearly 40 per cent more economical than the 2-litre petrol version. But both top speed and acceleration figures are virtually identical.</p>

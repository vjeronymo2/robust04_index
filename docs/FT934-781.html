			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Elections weaken Milosevic's grip on Serbs: Laura Silber reports from Belgrade on the outcome of last weekend's voting Prospects for stability in the Balkans, which hinge on Serbia, looked headed for deeper political uncertainty following the results of parliamentary elections at the weekend. Despite the claims by the ruling Socialists of an overwhelming triumph, President Slobodan Milosevic has clearly failed to win an outright majority. Nearly complete results show them winning some 123 of parliament's 250 seats. However, the opposition parties have together emerged stronger. Mr Milosevic, a leader incapable of sharing power, will thus face an assembly deeply divided between Socialists and opposition parties. The latter include the Depos coalition led by Mr Vuk Draskovic, the ultranationalist Radicals under Mr Vojislav Seselj, and the Democratic party. This party, led by Mr Zoran Djindjic, runs a middle course in Serbia's schismatic political landscape and made the largest electoral gain. The opposition, however, is united only against Mr Milosevic. In the unlikely event that they managed to agree on a common platform, it would differ little from that of the Socialists on the national question. During the campaign, no political leader voiced opposition to the war in Bosnia or the 21-month siege of Sarajevo by Serb forces. When the war erupted in former Yugoslavia in 1991, President Milosevic was the indisputable leader of all Serbs. Now, he remains the most influential, but his hold over Serb politicians, particularly those outside Serbia, has weakened significantly. Since the start of peace talks on Bosnia last year, international mediators have counted on him to exert pressure on his Bosnian Serb proxies to endorse an agreement. But shrugging off international threats, Bosnian Serbs have refused to hand over enough land to give their Moslem adversaries the viable state sought by western governments. In May, they even snubbed Mr Milosevic by rejecting his attempt to strong-arm the Bosnian Serb 'assembly' into endorsing the Vance-Owen peace plan for Bosnia. Two weeks ago, in spite of considerable support from Belgrade, his protege lost presidential elections in the self-styled Serb state of Krajina, which covers a third of Croatia. The victory of Mr Milan Babic, who is politically independent from Belgrade, will make it impossible for Mr Milosevic and his Croatian counterpart, Mr Franjo Tudjman, to bypass local Serb leaders in reaching a settlement on the status of Krajina. The European Union has stressed that reaching a modus vivendi in Croatia is an integral part of the peace package, without which there will be no gradual lifting of sanctions imposed on Serbia by the United Nations 19 months ago for the violent partition of Bosnia. While western governments still pin their hopes for an agreement on him almost exclusively, the Serbian leader will be forced increasingly to devote his attention to the economic deluge in his country. Devastated by sanctions and footing the bill for nearly three years of war in neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia, Serbia has plunged into poverty. Inflation is expected to reach a monthly rate of 500,000 per cent by the end of the year. The drama of the southern province of Kosovo is also still waiting to unfold. The majority ethnic Albanian community there boycotted last weekend's election with the result that the tiny Serb population, just 7 per cent of the total, gave the Socialists one fifth of their 123 seats. There is no chance of stability in the Balkans without a solution of the status of the Albanians living in a virtual parallel state under police control. The Albanian question will draw in newly recognised Macedonia, where ethnic Albanians comprise more than a third of the population.</p>

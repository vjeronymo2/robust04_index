			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Haruo Kurahashi: "`Savior' of the Heisei </F> Recession; Looking Into Real Estate Resolution Corporation"]    [Excerpts] The Japanese economy was "advised" by the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) "to deal quickly with banks'  bad assets." The effects incurred from the bubble economy's  collapse are great, and--still gasping amidst the Heisei  recession--one can see no sign of recovery. Some even say the  problems of the financial system are hurting business  conditions; and the Real Estate Resolution Corporation [RERC],  created as a "savior" for business recovery, started operations  on 1 February 1993 with a full awareness of its heavy mission.  Yet, limitations apparently exist for that corporation, too.  <H5>  Established Subject to "Restrictions" </H5>   The collapse of the bubble economy brought on a drastic  lowering of stock and real estate prices. That caused reductions  in financial organizations' internal capital accumulations and  increases in their bad assets, and drove the financial  institutions into situations more severe than any seen since the  start of the postwar high-growth period. Since financial  institutions having a "duty" to aid businesses that have fallen  into recession have themselves suffered managerial stagnation, a  situation is even now continuing in which the bottoming out of  the Heisei recession cannot be confirmed.  <H5>  Start Was Favorable, But... </H5>   Let us look at a summary of the RERC, which started on 1  February to take requests effective for March.    The president is former Mitsubishi Bank managing director  Goto, while the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's previous chief of the  operations promotion first division, Akira Miyagawa, was  appointed executive director and former Bank of Japan inspection  division chief Masa Ando was appointed fulltime auditor. The  fulltime officers number three, but besides them there are seven  non-fulltime directors and one auditor. The organization  includes 23 persons in the lineup below the division chief  level. The entire staff below the directors is made up of  persons on loan from a variety of businesses such as banks and  life insurance firms.    The operations of the RERC begin with financial organs  bringing in their bad liabilities. The financial institutions  that can bring these in are all financial bodies that have  equity in the RERC. Also the National Federation of Trust Banks,  the National Federation of Credit Unions and those under the  umbrella of the Central Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and  Forestry. For banks not under its purview to bring in bad  liabilities, that "will be considered premised on the buying up  of such bad liabilities not running counter to the RERC's  founding precepts nor to the interests of the RERC and all its  stockholders."    As for the liabilities that special housing loan  institutions  and non-banks hold, it will be possible to bring these in  through the equity-holding financial institutions on the premise  that "a reasonable reconstruction assistance program" exists. As  for bringing them in directly, that is to be treated in the same  manner as with financial institutions mentioned before that are  not under the corporation's purview.    Liabilities that are the object of buy-ups are bad  liabilities secured by real estate, those setting up (basic)  mortgages as security for the stated liabilities, and so forth.  The current minimum buy-up unit is 10 million yen for each  individual liability (original value of said liability at time  of buy-up), with no upper limit being set.    The types of such liabilities are not limited by the  purposes  of the funds; but housing loan liabilities for residences are  excluded. In principle, limits are not set on the term, interest  or payback conditions. Such liabilities as have conditions under  which they cannot be dealt with by disputation (such as  liabilities secured by real estate under dispute in court or  liabilities subject to application for bankruptcy, arbitration  or corporate restructuring) are excluded in principle. As for  liabilities secured by real estate that is under declaration for  auctioning or under attachment or provisional attachment, they  will be included if the RERC can confirm that it will not be  drawn into any dispute.    Because trading of bad liabilities has not been done in  Japan's financial markets heretofore, neither fixed evaluative  methods nor markets exist for them. Due to that, once they have  been sold between the RERC and the financial institution  bringing in the bad liabilities at prices based on reasonable  estimates, the selling price is fixed based on the amount  ultimately recovered.    At the time bad liability is sold, the financial institution  calculates the sale loss for the difference in the sale amount  from the cost of the liability and its estimated value. However,  at the time the price is set, the institution will recalculate  the profit or loss for the portion returned to the RERC that  exceeds a "proper range" within any difference from the initial  selling price.    The most important finding on the buy-up price is the setup  adopted for a dual check: an appraisal and evaluation of the  mortgaged real estate by a real-estate inspector in order to  assure objectivity and fairness (a normal price aiming at a sale  with a real estate appraisal and evaluation), as well as  appraisal and evaluation of the bought-up liability by a  price-adjudicating committee (the rated value of the liability,  with the evaluation of the mortgaged real estate as a base,  adding in the element of the liability's estimated recoverable  value based on the situation of the debtor and the guarantor,  while excluding the costs involved in recovery).    Selection of the real-estate appraisal firm and real-estate  appraiser is handled impartially on the basis of the RERC's  selection standards. Also, the price-adjudicating committee is  made up of members with high discernment and specialized  knowledge of law, accounting, tax administration and real-estate  appraisal and evaluation.    Incidentally, the members are Gen Takahashi (former  permanent  vice minister for finance and former chairman of the fair trade  commission), Tsuneo Shirai (vice president of the tax  accountants federation), Hiroshi Kawakita (former president of  the Japan public accountants association), Ryoichi Inanohe  (managing director, Japan real-estate appraisal association) and  Shigeru Yamada (former vice president, Japan lawyers league).  This committee is independent of the structure of the RERC's  board of directors and so on.    The prices for mortgaged real estate determined in this  manner are published so as to stimulate and accelerate  disposition. With the prerequisite of agreement by those  involved, the RERC publishes such items as 1) the location (in  principle, down to the town or village name); 2) the type  (distinguishing between residence, commercial business, factory  and so on); 3) legal cubic measurement ratio (%); 4) type  (distinguishing between vacant lots, lots with buildings and so  on); 5) Size (indicating scale of land by levels); 6)  (indicating land price by 1,000 yen units per square meter,  making the unit price the "appraised and evaluated price for  mortgaged real estate" determined as proper by the price  appraisal committee, which is the RERC's advisory body); and 7)  the time of pricing (date when the appraisal and evaluation in 6  was done).    From 1 February the RERC was taking the portion of  applications for March implementation. On 25 February, it held  the first price-appraisal committee meeting and on 15 April  published the first mortgaged real estate prices. Because of the  fiscal year ending [31 March] the first fiscal year results  cover this March-implementation portion only. As financial  institutions had held up their settlements, the number of cases  of bought-up liabilities was 229 (categorized by amount per  case: 26 at 500 million yen or less, 39 between 500 million and  one billion yen, 85 between one and three billion yen, 34  between three and five billion yen and 45 above five billion  yen)--a total of 681.7 billion yen, with a buy-up price of 452.1  billion yen, making it a favorable start-up.

When we add the totals for the first half of this  year to those of the bought-up liabilities for last fiscal year,  we get about two trillion yen. This shows that deliveries by  financial institutions are being made smoothly and that  redemption of bad liabilities is progressing well. However, if  we look at the results from April through July, a mere 36  cases--98.6 billion yen in money terms--have been bought up.  Financial institutions bringing bad liabilities to the RERC are  to judge the details of their own accounts and promote  redemptions programmatically according to their earnings. In  short, after checking out the balance figures to some extent,  they bring the bad liabilities to the RERC. Thus, deliveries  would become concentrated after the March settlements and  September mid-term book closing. Due to that, some people  criticize that this is shifting bad liabilities as an accounting  measure; but we have the "major premise" of redeeming bad  liabilities based on the principle of self responsibility, so  that in some respects there may be nothing for us to do about  this.    The RERC's organization is as stated above; but under this  system it reportedly takes some two months to get a decision on  the buy-up price. We cannot deny that efficiency is low because  the office focuses on it only for certain set periods.    Also, while we say that the processing of 2 trillion yen has  gone forward, there are those in the finance industry who say,  "The fact that redemptions cannot proceed on the 7 trillion yen  in bad assets that are held by the special housing loan  institutions cannot erase the unease in the financial system."    As stated before, under current conditions the special  housing loan institutions and non-banks cannot sell liabilities  directly to the RERC. Financial institutions with equity in the  RERC will have to take them on in part and buy them. Under this  method an undue burden falls on financial institutions that take  them in. To resolve this problem, some people ask, "How about if  the special housing institutions and non-banks buy equity in the  RERC and then sell the liabilities directly?" Also, we have had  the suggestion that the securities firms suffering from the bad  liabilities of the keiretsu non-banks, too, "might as  well invest in the RERC."    Somehow this seems like useless advice. Many special housing  loan institutions and non-banks are firms whose earnings are  actually in the red. Considering the functions of the RERC,  there is no value in those financial institutions not making  enough profits to be bringing in bad liabilities. In the red  even if that were free, they cannot take on the further burden  of the sales losses. That would merely mean further deficits  being be piled onto them. For example, firms like the Nihon  Housing Finance Corporation have problems with both their parent  banks and the farm banks; and there would seem to be no value in  their bringing in bad liabilities so long as those are not  resolved. Of course, there would be no problem if the special  housing loan institutions had the strength to make profits, but  under current conditions they are not in such a stage.    One cannot deny that at the stage when the induction public  funds became a blank sheet, expectations of the RERC fell. Most  bad liabilities are held by non-banks in banking systems,  including the special housing loan institutions and, as already  stated, there is little sense in their being brought in under  present conditions. In order to have strong financial  institutions bring in bad liabilities and for the RERC to buy  them up, the RERC brings much effectiveness to bear; but under  current conditions it would be difficult for financial  institutions with poor earnings to bring them in. In the eight  months that have elapsed since we started business, 2 trillion  yen in bad liabilities have collected in the RERC. On the other  hand, it is hard to say that we are progressing with the  disposal of mortgaged real estate, given the impact of  stagnation in the real estate market.    In the RERC's founding guidelines it is stated, "It will  have  a pump-priming effect in activating real estate dealings," but  we cannot say it is fulfilling that function under present  circumstances. Of course, the RERC will not trade in real estate  contrary to its initial plans. There naturally are limitations;  but it would be good now to be probing for ways to make it  easier to dispose of the bad liabilities being brought in. The  problem is that, while these are piling up, the RERC is making  strenuous efforts under the restriction imposed on it. As there  reportedly are over 10 trillion yen in bad liabilities, it seems  that the time of crisis is yet to come.</p>

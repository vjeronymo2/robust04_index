			<p>BFN     [Text] Pietersburg April 13 SAPA -- The Electoral Appeal  Tribunal in Pietersburg on Wednesday [13 April] interdicted the  African National Congress from intimidating National Party [NP]  members or supporters in Venda and impeding NP meetings or its  canvassing and campaigning.    The Appeal Tribunal sat on Wednesday after the ANC appealed  against a decision of an electoral tribunal in Dzanani, Venda,  on March 30 at which a formal warning and fine of R100,000  [rands], suspended for four months, was imposed on the ANC.    At the time, the tribunal found that ANC members were  responsible for disrupting a National Party meeting at the  Makhado shopping complex in Dzanani earlier in March and had  prevented the meeting from taking place.    The ANC was ordered to pay the costs of the appeal.</p>

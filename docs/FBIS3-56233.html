			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Riga, Jan 13, BNS -- Latvian local governments will  be elected in a direct and proportional ballot for an office of  three years, under the law on local elections, passed Thursday  by the Latvian Saeima (parliament).    Lawmakers fixed May 22 the date for the elections. Electors  are all Latvian citizens, which have full 18 years of age on the  election day.    Persons serving their term or waiting for a sentence in  places of detention are barred from the elections, under the  law. Persons recognized as irresponsible also should not  participate in the local elections.    A deputy candidate is a Latvian citizen, over 21 year of  age,  a permanent resident of the electoral district for at least  twelve months. Knowledge of the Latvian language is another  prerequisite for being elected a local deputy.    Persons serving their term or waiting for a sentence in  places of imprisonment, as well as irresponsible persons, are  barred from being elected to local governments. The ban also  refers to persons convicted for grave crimes and persons having  collaborated with foreign reconnaissance services.    The Saeima voted down a proposal by the Democratic Party and  the National Independence Movement to bar double citizens from  running for the local governments.    Lawmakers also rejected a proposal by Homeland and Freedom's  Janis Straume to bar former functionaries of the Communist Party  and Komsomol from the elections.    There was no separate vote on the participation of  non-citizens in the elections. This issue may be approached only  after the adoption of the law on citizenship, the deputies said.</p>

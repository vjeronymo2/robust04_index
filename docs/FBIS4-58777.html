			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)--The Arab League Council held an  emergency session in Cairo today. It called on Yemeni leaders  to work harder to resolve their differences and cement Yemeni  unity, pointing out that Yemen's unity is linked to the region's  stability and security. This was declared by Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid at a news conference  following the end of the session.    Yemen's unity is a "pan-Arab achievement and asset" that  must  be protected and maintained, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said. The  secretary general said that the Arab League Council instructed  him to get in touch with Yemeni leaders to seek an immediate end  to the fighting and to keep the League's member states informed  about his efforts.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Council will consider itself  in a state of permanent session to follow up the efforts that  various Arab leaders are exerting to end the Yemeni crisis.    Answering journalists' questions, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said  that  the dispatch of Arab troops to separate rival forces in Yemen  "was not discussed" in today's session.    Asked to comment on the news that Yemen is not enthusiastic  about the holding of this particular meeting of the Arab League  Council, the secretary general said that any two League member  states have the right to request a Council meeting. Today's  session was at the request of Egypt and Libya, he stated.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the Arab League Council does not  interfere in the internal affairs of Yemen or any Arab country.  The Council respects the sovereignty of all Arab countries, he  added.    The secretary general pointed out that the Yemeni leadership  received an Arab League delegation on 4 March. Dr.  'Abd-al-Majid pointed out that the other Arab leaders attended  the signing of the Pledge and Accord document in Amman, on 20  February, a matter which, the secretary general added, confirms  Arab interest in the situation in Yemen.</p>

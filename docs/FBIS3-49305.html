			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] We had to explain to our partners in Warsaw that the  Czech Republic intends to join NATO as soon as possible. It does  not really matter whether this happens jointly or on an  individual basis. This is what Czech Deputy Defense Minister  Jiri Pospisil said shortly after his arrival by air from Warsaw.    He also explained to the Visegrad defense ministers in the  Polish capital that our side regards the "Partnership for Peace"  plan as the maximum of what NATO is able to grant to us at the  present time. It is also regarded as a minimum designed to  ensure that security requirements are met.    The sides that attended the Warsaw meeting expressed their  unequivocal consent with Partnership for Peace. However, Deputy  Minister Pospisil admitted that there are differences as regards  the considerations regarding the possible coordination of a  joint approach to NATO. While Poland and Slovakia favor this  option, Hungary's stance appears to be closer to the Czech  stance.    Polish President Walesa, who met the ministers, pointed out  that, first and foremost, it should be the Czech Republic that  should make use of the historical opportunity of joining NATO.  If it does not do so, Poland will reportedly look for new  partners. But I do not know which countries he meant, Jiri  Pospisil said.</p>

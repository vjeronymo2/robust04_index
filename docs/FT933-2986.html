			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Directors trail in Euro pay league UK EXECUTIVES are still among the lowest-paid in Europe in terms of gross, net, and cost-of-living adjusted pay, a picture little changed since last year, the latest report by pay analysts PE International shows, David Goodhart writes. Swiss, Austrian, Spanish and French executives are the top four in both gross pay and purchasing power. The report, which finds that executive pay practices are slowly converging across Europe, places the British managing director in tenth place (out of 12) on gross pay of Pounds 107,417. Only Ireland and the Netherlands are lower. After tax the British managing director earned Pounds 64,342 and moved up to eigth place ahead of both Belgium and Denmark. Remuneration in Europe.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Edner Jean on Commerce Minister </F> Jean-Robert Delsoin's appearance before the Senate headed by  Senator Bernard Sansaricq in Port-au-Prince on 9 June; passages  within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] [Jean] Economic sanctions have reduced the Commerce  Ministry's duties to having to supply the local market with  essential foods -- such as rice, sugar, and flour -- and  medicine on a regular and permanent basis.    Rice: Delsoin pointed out that it is important not only to  supply the local market with quality rice in sufficient amounts  but also to protect and encourage national production while  assuring a reasonable retail price. To help bring down the  retail price of imported rice, the commerce minister suggests  luring traditional importers into ordering in groups and urging  them to apply to the Finance Ministry for customs rights on an  inclusive basis of 12.50 gourdes per sack instead of the ad  valorem tax of 40 percent currently in effect.    Sugar: One of the Commerce Ministry's major difficulties in  regulating this market lies in the 6 December 1990 decree that  created CONASUC, the National Sugar Council, thereby granting  the sugar factories a de facto monopoly on sugar imports. While  continuing to allow importers and nonmanufacturers to import  sugar, the minister announced that he would meet the concerned  parties in the coming days to discuss restructuring and would  then proceed to price revisions.    Asked about the Jonassaint government's real commercial and  industrial priorities, Delsoin said he will attack the  nongovernmental organizations [NGO] first in order to control  their actions.    [Delsoin] "The NGOs are not obliged to trade, by definition.  We notice nowadays, however, that they control businesses.  Three ministers have committed themselves to the struggle for  strict control of those NGOs. Press releases have been issued,  so everyone knows that the government is studying the matter.  Using someone else's words: We are serious about this.    ``There is a third area that we are very concerned about,  but  confidentiality is required.''    [Jean] Another confidential area involves fuel controls. He  said he refrained from making public statements so as not to  annoy some friends:    [Delsoin] "Given the current circumstances, the Ministry --  meaning [word indistinct] of oil embargo -- the Ministry lost  its authority in this area. Officially, we do not receive oil.  Officially, we do not have oil. Thus, it is impossible for a  state institution to have any control over this area. It would  be like denouncing friends. In brief, I think the state is  unable to intervene directly in this area."</p>

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Bonds: Ecu sector gets a boost from the EC THE EUROPEAN Community threw its weight behind the Ecu bond market yesterday with the launch of its widely-expected Ecu1bn offering of seven-year Eurobonds. Mr Paul Goldschmidt, director at the EC's credit and investment division, said the issue underlined the German constitutional court's ruling in favour of the Maastricht treaty on European union. 'The EC is making a political statement with this offering,' he said. The other aim was to attract institutional investors who had avoided the Ecu market after Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in June 1992. As a result, the bonds were generously priced to yield 12 basis points less than the French government's 9 1/2 per cent Ecu-denominated OAT due 2000. Once freed to trade they rose from a fixed re-offer price of 98.97 to 99.05, to yield 14 basis points below the OAT. The EC plans to raise an equivalent amount in D-Marks in the Eurobond market before the end of the month. The Ecu2bn raised through both issues will make up the second tranche of the EC's Ecu8bn lending programme to Italy. Turkey is expected to go ahead with its Pounds 100m offering of 10-year Eurobonds today, even though Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has placed its long-term rating under review for possible downgrading. The bonds, via SG Warburg, are likely to be priced to yield 230 basis points over UK government bonds. Before the Moody's announcement, the market had expected the spread to be close to 200 basis points. Household Mortgage Corporation (HMC), the centralised mortgage lender, is also expected to raise Pounds 100m through an offering of mortgage-backed notes via CSFB. There will only be one tranche and the notes are likely to have an average life of five years. The yield on HMC's notes is expected to be well below the yield on NatWest's Class A2 mortgage-backed notes issued at the end of September. At launch, NatWest's notes yielded 40 basis points over three-month sterling London interbank offered rate and the spread has since tightened to 37 1/2 basis points. The market expects the spread on HMC's notes to be in the low 30s. CSFB is also arranging a Dollars 100m seven-year Eurobond issue with a put option after five years for Trinidad &amp; Tobago. The offering is expected tomorrow or Monday.</p>

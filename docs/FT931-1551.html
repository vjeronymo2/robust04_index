			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Bombay police find arms cache: Sixteen held since bomb attacks INDIAN police investigating the bomb blasts which rocked Bombay earlier this month yesterday discovered a huge cache of arms including 600 detonators, 195 hand grenades, rifles and ammunition. The discovery is the latest development in a wide-ranging probe involving the Indian intelligence service, as well as Interpol and anti-terrorist experts from the US and other countries. The Bombay police have detained 16 people in connection with the blasts, which left about 250 people dead and over 1,000 injured in the biggest terrorist attack in Indian history. The explosions followed riots in Bombay and other cities which came in the wake of the destruction of a mosque in the holy town of Ayodhya by Hindu militants. However, those detained by the Bombay police are seen as minor participants in the attacks: they include men who allegedly drove bomb-laden cars to blast sites and dealers who supplied the vehicles. The police have yet to arrest anybody thought to be an organiser of the attack; norhave they publicly identified any group as a possible party to the incident, though they strongly believe that the explosives used were supplied from overseas. Police officials have declined to comment on the suspicion - widely held in Bombay - that an Islamic fundamentalist group could have organised the attacks in revenge for Ayodhya. However, the police want to question two Indian Moslem brothers, the alleged leaders of smuggling rings, who left the country just before the blasts. They are Mr Mushtaq Memon, known as 'Tiger', and his elder brother Yakub. The two flew with their families to Dubai. From there they have fled to another Moslem country, believed to be Pakistan. In New Delhi, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, prime minister, yesterday beat off a challenge to his authority from Mr Arjun Singh, minister for human resources. Acting before a national conference this weekend of the ruling Congress (I) party, Mr Singh had questioned if Mr Rao was being aggressive enough against the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata party, whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque.</p>

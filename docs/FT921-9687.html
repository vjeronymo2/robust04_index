			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Letter: Union restrictive practices as part of UK tradition 'offensive' Sir, As a Briton I find it offensive to read of trade union restrictive practices described as a part of our tradition. Ken Gill's letter (February 7) is tinged with racism; he understands the provocative insinuation of the word 'alien' well. It is insufficient to reject Japanese work practices merely because they are foreign. They have worked extremely well in Japanese car factories in the US. I am sure many British workers would be glad to show they could compete unshackled by the chains of British unionism. And that is the real point: what kind of dignity have the trade unions provided for British workers? Unemployment, low living standards, and a work environment that no Japanese worker would put up with. Stephen Lord, Bankers Trust Company, Minami-Aoyama 4-13-1 No 201, Minato-ku, Tokyo 107, Japan</p>

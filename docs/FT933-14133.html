			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse income falls 18% WESTINGHOUSE Electric, the US conglomerate trying to recover from poor property investments, yesterday reported an 18 per cent drop in second quarter income from continuing operations, which it acknowledged was below its expectations. The company blamed the drop mainly on the performance of its environmental business, which it said had been hit by 'weakness in the US environmental remediation market and the poor European economies'. Mr Michael Jordan, chief executive, said Westinghouse was in the 'midst of a great transition'. Westinghouse reported net income from continuing operations of Dollars 84m, or 20 cents a share, compared with Dollars 103m, or 30 cents, in the same period of last year. Revenues were Dollars 1.98bn, compared with Dollars 2.18bn. The company is gradually getting out of financial services, and in particular property investment. It said that in the second quarter it had sold Dollars 2.3bn in assets, for cash, from its financial services business and more than Dollars 3bn in the first half of the year, and this essentially eliminated the company's exposure from commercial property assets. For the six months, Westinghouse reported income from continuing operations of Dollars 148m, or 35 cents a share, compared with Dollars 168m, or 68 cents, in the same period of last year.</p>

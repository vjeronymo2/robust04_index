			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BB&amp;EA Pounds 1.4m in the black BRITISH Building and Engin-eering Appliances, the enlarged building related equipment and services group, returned to the black and to the dividend list in the six months to December 31. With turnover up from Pounds 1.68m to Pounds 21m, reflecting the acquisitions under the new management which took over in June 1992, the group turned in pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.41m for the period compared with Pounds 397,000 losses last time. Mr Graham Brealey, chairman, announced that in difficult trading conditions the group achieved all its targets in the period - accordingly, it is paying an interim dividend of 2.5p (nil). Earnings per share were 8.4p (22p losses). Mr Brealey said that enquiry levels for the second quarter showed a considerable upturn and if the rate of conversion to orders remained at present levels, then the second six months should see an upturn in the level of work achieved. Interim results were after a bad debt write-off of Pounds 234,000 which arose from one of the group's customers being forced into receivership. Net assets at end-December were Pounds 26m with cash balances of Pounds 500,000. Total borrowings were Pounds 2.9m - including finance leases - giving gearing of 11 per cent.</p>

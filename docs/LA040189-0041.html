			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WINDMILLS AND WILDFLOWERS: DEBATE OVER GORMAN HILLS  </P> <P> For at least 40 years I have passed the Gorman muffin-shaped hills that  Barnbaum wrote about. Each spring I, too, have marveled at the color which  seemingly couldn't have been trapped for a year beneath the surface of the  earth.  </P> <P> I feel Barnbaum's column was too soft -- environmentalists, for the most part,  are that way. We must not question our anger about the wind turbines. If you  don't believe me, just take a drive over the Tehachepi pass to the east and  then tell me you love the view.  </P> <P> We don't have much time. Somehow, even with the cattle munching on those  rounded hills, the flowers still spring forth each year. The short-term view is  easy, but wind turbines are permanent with their pads and access roads. We must  make an effort to protect these hills or the land will be gone with the wind.  </P> <P> KEITH AXELSON  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

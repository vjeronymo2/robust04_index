			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Return of lira turns into game of chance THE return of turbulence in the currency markets has forced Italy to reconsider the timing of its re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. Until this week, the Italian government consistently stated it was anxious for the lira to rejoin the ERM as soon as possible. However, the devaluation of the peseta and escudo, together with continued pressure on other EC currencies, has brought home the advantages to Italy of sustaining the lira in a free float. The government of the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, did not spell out a timetable for re-entry when the lira was forced to leave on September 17 along with sterling. The public commitment to returning was a statement of faith in the European Monetary System. It was also intended to convince the markets that Italy would not allow a free floating lira to become an excuse for relaxing fiscal policy or the fight against inflation. Nevertheless, an unofficial timetable had been mapped out. This hinged on parliament's approval of the 1993 budget, completion of negotiations with the EC on an Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.5bn) stand-by loan, agreement with the Bundesbank on repayment of the heavy obligations incurred during the September defence of the lira, and a period of reasonable calm on the foreign exchanges. On this basis officials were considering rejoining during December or January at the latest. The budget will be approved by early December and the Bundesbank is reportedly willing to roll over if necessary the still unspecified sums lent in defence of the lira which are due on December 16. But the stand-by loan is now unlikely to be agreed before January. Added to this, it suits Italy not to have to defend the lira, which this week has weakened slightly against the D-Mark, hovering around L865. Deciding the correct level for re-entry is complicated. The French for one are concerned by the competitive edge acquired by the lira's 14-15 per cent devaluation since September. But equally, if the lira were not permitted to devalue on this scale on re-entry, the markets would put immediate pressure on the Italian currency - once again forcing costly intervention, or a second exit which would be even more damaging to the credibility of the system.</p>

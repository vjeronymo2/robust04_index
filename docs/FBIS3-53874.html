			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi report from Tunis, accompanied by </F> other unattributed reports]    [Excerpts] Tunis, Cairo, Tehran (AL-SHARQ-AL-AWSAT and  agencies) -- Fatah Central Committee Member Muhammad Ghunaym  (Abu-Mahir) has denied that the Palestinians viewed with concern  and anxiety the results of the summit meeting held between  Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and U.S. President Bill Clinton  in Geneva last Sunday [16 January]. He stressed that the PLO  welcomed the results of that summit.    Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa called the summit  "successful." [passage omitted]    In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Abu-Mahir  said  that all the rumors about Palestinian fear of that summit were  personal views which did not reflect the PLO position. Contrary  to what is being said, Abu-Mahir added, the PLO welcomes the  al-Asad-Clinton summit results because they point to progress in  the negotiations in general. President al-Asad's statement  insisting on a comprehensive solution and on the implementation  of Security Council resolutions 242, 338, and 425 indicates that  Syria wants a comprehensive and just solution in the region, he  said.    Abu-Mahir emphasized that progress on the Syrian track would  serve all other tracks including the Palestinian track.  [passage omitted]    Since the signing of the [Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of  Principles] agreement, Syrian-Palestinian relations have been  very cool, reaching a freezing point because Damascus did not  approve of the agreement.    Despite statements by some Palestinian officials that the  Palestinians welcome the summit results, the truth is quite  different. The Palestinian leadership, combining PLO Executive  Committee members and Fatah Central Committee members, has been  in continuous session since last Saturday, that is, one day  before the al-Asad-Clinton summit, but so far no official  statement or explanation has been issued. [passage omitted]    According to highly placed Palestinian sources, the reason  for the delay in announcing the Palestinian position on that  summit is the ambiguity surrounding it, insofar as it was not  perfectly clear if al-Asad sought to reactivate the negotiations  to serve only Syria's interests or to serve all the tracks,  particularly the Palestinian track, in harmony with Syria's  pan-Arab line.    The sources added that the PLO fears that, after the summit,  Syria might revive its attempts to contain the Palestinian  element and the independent Palestinian decisionmaking which the  PLO has over many years paid a high price to maintain.

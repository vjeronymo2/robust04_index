			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Accounts guidelines 'must be balanced' Industry bodies developing specialist accounting guidelines must demonstrate that their views are balanced and representative, under new rules unveiled by the Accounting Standards Board yesterday. Their ideas must be developed with due process and will be examined to ensure that they do not contradict any fundamental points of principle in current accounting standards or principles, said the standard-setting body. Many organisations may be able to write so-called statements of recommended practice (Sorps) which are not mandatory and are in too narrow an area to justify formal standards. Sorps must be ratified by the Accounting Standards Board, which said in its guidance that it would provide a 'negative assurance statement' if it was satisfied with new proposals. The board has introduced two new committees to ratify the Sorps: the financial sector and other special industries committee, and a second specialising in the public and not-for-profit sectors. Those independent bodies already recognised by the board to develop Sorps include the Association of British Insurers, Association of Investment Trust Companies, British Bankers' Association, Charity Commission, Finance and Leasing Association and Oil Industry Accounting Committee. The Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals of the universities of the UK yesterday issued its revised proposals for accounting guidelines in the higher education sector. The new Sorp recommends that land, buildings, equipment and furniture be capitalised and included in the balance sheet at cost and valuation - in contrast to the current practice in universities of immediately writing off this expenditure. The change will affect balance sheets, boost information on assets and introduce depreciation against the assets in the profit and loss accounts of the higher education institutions. The practice has long-standing precedents among UK companies and other organisations but has traditionally been resisted by universities. Institutions will be advised to disclose provisions for long-term investment.</p>

			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / People: BM picks Bespak's finance director BM Group, the engineering company which fell heavily into the red last year, yesterday announced the appointment of Alun Hicks as group finance director. Hicks, 44, leaves Bespak, the medical equipment manufacturer, having served as finance director for six years. BM has been without a finance director since the resignation of Carl Young in September. The group almost collapsed last year when it breached covenants on interest cover and net assets; it had built up substantial debt following a series of acquisitions. BM has subsequently sold most of the Blackwood Hodge businesses leaving the group with process engineering operations and a product manufacturing division. In March, after reporting further write-downs and losses of Pounds 14.2m pre-tax for the first half, the company said it expected debt to represent less than 90 per cent of the Pounds 58m (Pounds 60.2m) in shareholders' funds by the end of the year. Shares, which closed at 34p yesterday, have fallen sharply from a high of 863p in 1991. Cliff Walker, BM's chief executive, says Hicks was joining the company as its restructuring neared completion and would 'participate in BM's continued recovery'. Hicks has overseen a difficult period at Bespak, which saw a 38 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 11.5m to Pounds 7.1m last year. Shares, which closed at 265p yesterday, were trading at over 500p a year ago.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TYSON IS A NEW FATHER, PAPER SAYS  </P> <P> Boxer Mike Tyson became a father this week when a baby boy was born to his  24-year-old girlfriend at a hospital in the Catskills, the New York Post said  today.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy to be having a family," Tyson told the Post.  </P> <P> The newspaper said the child, as yet unnamed, was born Wednesday to Natalie  Fears of Los Angeles. The name of the hospital was not given.  </P> <P> The report also said Tyson has no plans to marry Fears but will buy a house in  Los Angeles and support the child.  </P> <P> Tyson brought Fears from Los Angeles to the Catskills several months ago, and  she has been staying with the woman who helped rear Tyson, Camille Ewald.  </P> <P> Tyson has not seen his son yet because he's training for a June 16 fight with  Henry Tillman in Las Vegas, the newspaper said, quoting unidentified sources.  </P> <P> The newspaper said a Los Angeles dancer, Trena Archie, 22, said in February  that Tyson is the father of her infant son. Tyson has not acknowledged  paternity in that case, the Post said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 26 (XINHUA) -- Members of the  California business and agricultural communities today called  for unconditional renewal of most-favored-nation [MFN] trade  status for China and urged President Clinton to establish  "stable and predictable U.S. trade relations" with it.    In a letter to President Clinton this morning, the  California  business and farm leaders said that California exports more than  1.7 billion U.S. dollars to China [as received], which support  about 35,000 California jobs.    With California's economic outlook still grim, "We are  deeply  concerned that revocation of MFN tariff treatment would have a  disastrous effect on the economy of our state and jeopardize  thousands of high-wage, high-skill jobs, which are vital to  economic recovery in California."    The letter said, "We agree with you that America's  prosperity  in the next century rests on expanding our trade and economic  ties with the Pacific Rim. Accordingly, our companies strongly  supported your path-breaking initiative to refocus U.S. foreign  policy on this dynamic and expanding region of the world."    They expressed the fear that revocation of MFN or other  trade  sanctions against China would trigger retaliation by the Chinese  Government, damaging U.S. exports and investment, and  endangering hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs.    The letter was signed by representatives of over 440  business  organizations ranging from high-tech manufacturing and light  industry to agriculture, financial and entertainment services,  and toy, footwear and apparel retailing and importing.    While these companies are engaged in different sectors of  the  U.S. economy, "they are united in their conviction that  continued U.S. trade with China is vital for America's future  and that revoking or conditioning MFN trade would have a  disastrous act on American jobs, economic growth, and national  security," the Washington-based Business Coalition for  U.S.-China Trade noted in a press release on the letter.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Lawyer details Maxwell assets: No 'pot of gold' in Liechtenstein operations, warns foundation chief THE LAWYER heading the secretive Maxwell Foundation in Liechtenstein yesterday pledged to exert his control over Maxwell companies beyond the reach of British administrators to try to provide funds for Maxwell pensioners. Mr Werner Keicher, who controls one of the key holding companies of the Maxwell empire, told a press conference in Vaduz: 'The problem of the pension funds and the fate of the (Maxwell) pensioners disturbs me greatly.' Although he warned that there was no hidden 'pot of gold' in the Liechtenstein operations, Mr Keicher said the foundation had been set up for charitable purposes: 'Why should they (the pensioners) not receive money'? He wants the companies under his control to continue to operate and to pay dividends. He will seek to have these paid to benefit pensioners. In a rare example of openness in the secretive world of Liechtenstein stiftungs (trusts), Mr Keicher detailed the foundation's assets and objectives. He also promised to co-operate with investigators seeking to trace the movement of assets throughout the Maxwell business empire. At the same press conference, Dr Kamil Braxator, legal representative of Allgemeines Treu - unternehmen - which employs lawyers as trustees to many funds - said trusts he represented that had been named in connection with Mr Robert Maxwell included Alandra, Baccano, Kiara, Jungo, Corry and Akim. He said he was investigating their assets, which included more than 10m shares in Maxwell Communication Corporation and Mirror Group Newspapers, the two publicly-quoted companies in the Maxwell empire. Trading in both of these companies' shares is suspended and their value is likely to be minimal. He said none of the trusts had any cash, and the shares registered to them were held outside Liechtenstein. They had been 'donated' through Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank used by the late Robert Maxwell to purchase shares as part of an alleged share price support operation. Dr Braxator was still trying to determine other assets. Mr Keicher said current charitable beneficiaries of the Maxwell Foundation did not include any members of the Maxwell family. 'Mr Kevin Maxwell will never get a cent out of this foundation,' he said. Yesterday's press conference was a strange gathering for Liechtenstein, which derives business from its reputation as a secretive haven for assets. Mr Keicher answered questions from journalists in English and German for more than two hours. He said the Maxwell Foundation held about SFr3,000 (Pounds 1,100) in cash, an unspecified number of shares in MCC  - currently in administration - and 100 per cent of the shares of Swico Anstalt Vaduz, another Liechtenstein holding company. Swico, in turn, owned 89 per cent of Sphere, a Californian computer games company, as well as 100 per cent of PH (US) Inc, an American investment company now under investigation for receiving money from Maxwell public companies. It also owned Yakosa Finanzierungs AG, a Swiss trust under investigation for part of an alleged MCC share price support scheme. Swico also has minority holdings in Robert Maxwell Group, parent of MGN, Headington Investments, the ultimate UK holding company, and PHA Investments, a secretive investment company. Swico held about Pounds 4,000 in cash. Mr Keicher said he had refused requests to use MCC shares held by the foundation as collateral for loans. Requests came in the last two years from Mr Werner Rechsteiner, a Swiss lawyer who controls Servex, a trust which received MCC shares that have been linked to alleged share support operations.

			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMNIST'S VIEWPOINT IS WAY OFF THE MARK  </P> <P> Has anyone asked what happens when these unprepared kids get into the  classroom? I have sat in class with them. Most are so intimidated that they  dissolve into the floor. Soon it's as if they weren't even there.  </P> <P> But something worse happens when the unprepared student tries to learn. Caught  between his lack of preparation and the demands of his sport, he can't keep up  with the class. The harder he tries, the more questions he asks, and the whole  class bogs down. When that happens, it is not fair to the students who have  paid and worked to earn the right to be in that class.  </P> <P> Proposal 42 may be unfair, but it is necessary. I am not suggesting that those  students who are affected by Proposal 42 be sacrificed. However, I believe the  answer lies in preparing them before they get to college.  </P> <P> What really bothers me about the reaction to the proposal is that its critics  are implying that these kids are too stupid to meet the requirements. I refuse  to believe that.  </P> <P> ROBERT JONES  </P> <P> San Pedro  </P></p>

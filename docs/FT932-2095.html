			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Bosses adopt more green policies BRITAIN'S boardrooms are devoting an increasing amount of time to environmental issues, although they are still given relatively low priority in many businesses. A survey conducted among 325 UK companies on behalf of the Institute of Directors shows that, in spite of the recession, directors are paying more attention to the impact which their businesses have on the environment. Nearly one third say they have adopted a formal corporate environmental policy but the report also concludes that most continue to address the issue 'as a threat and not as an opportunity'. A rising number of directors acknowledge that environmental considerations are being driven primarily by the need for compliance, rather than by broader social considerations. Nearly three quarters have yet to operate any form of environmental audit and only 1 per cent of businesses have a manager with specific responsibility for environmental issues. In most companies the managing director is still held to be responsible. The survey shows that 65 per cent of company directors say the environment featured on their board's agenda last year, up from 53 per cent the previous year. Predictably, companies in construction, mining and manufacturing regularly featured the environment on the board's agenda, while service and distribution operations were less concerned. But the survey also shows that few companies spend more than 10 per cent of boardroom time on environmental questions. Nearly half the companies surveyed reported that they were undertaking investment to meet environmental obligations. More than one third said action was being taken in response to laws either planned or already imposed by the UK and EC, while the balance cited social responsibility, 'corporate citizenship' or market forces as the impetus. Only 6 per cent of the directors questioned rated themselves very knowledgeable about their companies' legal environmental responsibilities, and 44 per cent thought they were quite well informed.</p>

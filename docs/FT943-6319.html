			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / China cracks down to protect Sega copyright Chinese authorities have ordered an electronics company in the south of the country to stop making video games machines with programmes identical to those marketed by Sega Enterprises of Japan. The victory for Sonic the Hedgehog and other Sega characters represents what is believed to be the first Chinese administrative measure against a local manufacturer over infringement of a foreign computer company's software. It comes not long after a Beijing court ruled that Mickey Mouse's image could not be used without the US Walt Disney group's permission. China's National Copyright Administration has ordered the Shenzhen Shenchu Electronic Equipment Factory (Shenchu) immediately to stop manufacturing and selling game consoles with programmes which it ruled infringe Sega's copyright. Shenchu has also been ordered to deliver all offending games cards to the government authority, and a fine of Yuan 30,000 (Pounds 2,270) has been imposed. Sega filed a suit against Shenchu in May and an investigation by Chinese authorities found that 15 out of 20 games incorporated in Shenchu's machines were identical to games developed and manufactured by Sega. The investigation led the Chinese earlier this month to rule that Sega's game cards should be protected as computer software under the country's copyright laws. The latest move comes as China faces increasing international pressure to enforce its copyright laws. The US has urged the Chinese government to take action against audio and video software pirates, and Beijing's willingness to pursue those who breach copyright coincides with its campaign for readmission to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which it left more than 40 years ago. Sega welcomed the Chinese decision which, it said, would be helpful in considering whether or not to launch marketing operations in China, where infringement of its copyright has been rampant. While reluctant to market its games, the company already manufactures video games consoles in China for export markets.</p>

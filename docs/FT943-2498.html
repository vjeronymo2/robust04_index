			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Observer: Homely assignment Birgit Breuel, 57, head of Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency, must be hoping the media will finally stop pestering her, now that she has been appointed head of Expo 2000, the world exhibition beano to be held in Hanover at the turn of the century. It might be thought an odd move for her. Breuel's experience at privatising the east German economy - and not suffering fools gladly in the process - surely could have opened up any number of top political jobs after October's federal elections, assuming Helmut Kohl wins again. After all, she was finance minister of Lower Saxony from 1986-1990. Then again, there's been talk that she would be snapped up by industry. No one is suggesting Expo 2000 won't be challenging. But it could not be as exhausting as the effort to get the east German economy back on its feet. Still, Breuel, who leaves the Treuhand next April after four years in Berlin, always said she wanted to spend more time with her family. No doubt she will pursue that course industriously.</p>

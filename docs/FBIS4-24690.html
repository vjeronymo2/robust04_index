			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Niu Hui Shuan (3662 2585 2633) and Su Shumei (5685 3219 </F> 2734): "The Social Safety Situation of the Whole Province is  Basically Stable"]    [Text] In order to realistically guarantee political and  social stability in our province, the Provincial People's  Congress standing committee organized a law enforcement  inspection group with Li Yongjin as the leader and Zhang  Zhenhuan, Gao Yongtang, and Zhou Xinren as the deputy leaders to  travel to Shijiazhuang city, Baoding city, Tangshan city, and  Qinhuangdao city on 5-13 May to respectively inspect their  situations in implementing the "decision of the National  People's Congress standing committee on strengthening  comprehensive management of social safety," and the "Hebei  Provincial regulation on comprehensive management of social  safety."    The inspection group held that our province has done much  work in implementing the "decision" and the "regulation," and  achieved noticeable results in the comprehensive management of  social safety. The whole province, from the urban to the rural  areas, has witnessed a basically stable social safety situation  and the masses of people have generally enhanced their sense of  safety, and promoted the sound development of reform, opening  up, and economic construction. The main expressions are: first,  leaders at all levels have paid great attention to social  safety, and all localities have conducted activities aimed at  social safety comprehensive management work every year, thus  promoting the progress of the comprehensive management of public  safety work. Second, we have established and improved the  social safety comprehensive management organs and  conscientiously implemented the system of having leaders assume  responsibility. The system of having leaders assume full  responsibility over comprehensive management of social safety  work has been basically implemented in most localities. Third,  the work of "dealing strict blows" and improving social safety  has been unceasingly deepened and noticeable results,  particularly in this year's "spring offensive" on dealing blows  to all sorts of crimes, have been achieved. Fourth, all  departments and all sectors have jointly grasped and managed  this work, and the committees and units for comprehensive  management of social safety have given play to their functions  and roles, particularly the various public safety organs have  played a key role in the comprehensive management of social  safety work. Fifth, fairly big progress has been made in the  basic work of the grass-roots level. We have reshuffled and  replenished the safety and people's mediation organizations and  established security joint-defense teams, patrol teams, and mass  safety organizations in line with the needs. Many localities  have formed mass safety management networks.    Through law enforcement inspection, the inspection group  pointed out: At present, some destabilizing factors have still  existed, and the social safety situation has remained severe.  Criminal cases, particularly major criminal cases, are still in  an upward trend in some localities and some repulsive phenomena  and law-breaking acts, such as abducting and selling women and  children, prostitution and patronizing prostitutes, and  manufacturing and selling obscene articles, have appeared  despite repeated prohibitions; "hot topics" which the masses  have complaints have increased in number, and accidental events  have occurred frequently. The problems of being "tough with one  hand and soft with the other hand" and failing to effectively  crack down on serious criminal offenses have still existed in  some localities. Some localities are fairly weak in their basic  work at the grass-roots level, and some of their social safety  comprehensive management measures are not implemented well.  According to the situation revealed in the inspection, the  Provincial People's Congress standing committee called on all  localities to act in line with the demands of the "decision,"  conscientiously implement the "regulation," comprehensively  strengthen social safety comprehensive management work, and push  it to a new stage.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A secret military document could be the key to new  disclosures for the prosecutors investigating the corruption  scheme set up by the numbers game kingpins.    The first probe into the numbers game-drug trafficking link  was conducted in 1982 by the Military Police intelligence  service itself. The Army and the now-defunct National  Intelligence Service, SNI, received copies of the report.    It was in a meeting held then that the numbers game leaders  decided to invest in drug trafficking because they considered it  a promising business. The numbers game kingpins then allied  themselves with drug trafficker Antonio Jose Nicolao, aka  Toninho Turco, who started to serve as a liaison between the  numbers game and the drug trade.    General Newton Cerqueira, who was commander of the Military  Police [PM] at that time, confirmed the report's existence:    [Begin recording] PM officers, who at that time helped us  considerably in that specialized sector, drafted documents and I  became firmly convinced that there was a close connection  between the numbers game bankers and the drug trade. [end  recording]    The prosecutors want to compare the information contained in  that report with both the documents seized from Toninho Turco's  house during the Mosaic Operation and with the accounting books  and diskettes seized recently from the numbers game operations  center. They believe that by comparing all these documents, they  will be able to prove for the first time the numbers game  kingpins' involvement in the drug trade in Rio de Janeiro.    The prosecutors do not know, however, that that report --  which they describe as being highly significant -- has  disappeared from the PM intelligence service's files.</p>

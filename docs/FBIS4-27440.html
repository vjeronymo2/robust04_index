			<p>BFN     [Text] Included on a "list of recommendations" for  deregulation is the suggestion that if liquor sales were shifted  from the current licence system to a reporting system, it would  hold down the prices of liquor, increase the variety of liquor  on the shelves of supermarkets, and benefit consumers. The list  of recommendations is stirring controversy within the  Administrative Reform Promotion Headquarters (headed by Prime  Minister Hata) and government ministries and agencies. The  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has compiled  the list of deregulation recommendations, taking into account  trade requests from European nations and, according to a  government source, many people rate the list highly as "an  effective way to open the Japanese market."    The list of recommendations for deregulation, however, fails  to include any matters under the jurisdiction of MITI and,  according to a source in the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry  and Fisheries, other government ministries and agencies have  therefore reacted to it, saying, "At a time when we are  struggling to come up with our deregulatory measures, MITI is  interfering in the affairs of other ministries and agencies and  leaving its own untouched by derregulation."    The battle over measures to relax bureaucratic regulations  has begun to seem less like a "confrontation between government  and the private sector" and more like a "confrontation between  government ministries and agencies."    The list of recommendations for deregulation consists of two  documents -- one for the deregulation of distribution and  another for the deregulation of logistic distribution  [butsuryu], standards, certification, and import procedures.  The list of recommendations cites problems with regulation in  16 areas, points out which areas should be deregulated and notes  the effect this wi;; have.    The deregulation list proposes changing the current license  system for liquor to a sales reporting system. It is currently  under the jurisdiction of the Finance Ministry. To help  importers, a similar change is proposed for perfume, a move  which would follow the system widely adopted in the United  States and Europe. Cosmetic sales currently fall under the  authority of the Health and Welfare Ministry.    The list stresses that price differentials between Japan and  other nations should be narrowed, claiming that prices of goods  in Japan are two times higher than in the United States and  Europe.    Commenting on the deregulation list, a businessman said it  was a bold one and "contains some deregulatory steps that go  beyond requests made by the private sector."    The Hata cabinet is pressing government ministries and  agencies to map out a package of deregulatory measures by the  end of June, a commitment made by Japan to the United States.  Ministries and agencies, though, see the Hata administration as  a minority government, and they are continuing to resist  pressure to relax current regulations.    The same agriculture ministry source said: "The Hata cabinet  believes that if it asks government ministries and agencies to  shift to the reporting system, they would propose no  deregulatory measures. It is, therefore, allotting a quota of  deregulatory measures to each government ministry and agency  saying, 'We hope your ministry will include this deregulatory  step in the package'."    Such action shows the Hata cabinet is taking a tough stand  on  the government ministries and agencies as part of its efforts to  push for deregulation.    The prevailing view is that MITI has secretly compiled the  list of deregulation recommendations with the aim of using the  current deregulation drive as an opportunity to instantly  heighten the mood for deregulation in specific areas.    MITI Minister Eijiro Hata said the list would play a  "pivotal  role in relaxing Japan's bureaucratic regulations.".    The list, however, does not mention relaxation of the  Large-Scale Retail Store Law nor the Provisional Law on the  Import of Specific Oil Products, both of which are under MITI's  jurisdiction.    For that reason, other government ministries and agencies  are  irritated by "MITI's attempts to win high marks" as the deadline  looms for drawing up the deregulation package.    Officials in other government ministries are concerned that  "the prime minister's official residence, which is looking for  key areas for deregulation, may pick up ideas from the list of  recommendations."    A senior MITI official does not deny compiling the list of  recommendations, stressing: "If Japan fails to work to build  new industries by correcting the price differentials between it  and other nations, it will lose its international  competitiveness."</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Motoring: Where big is best its biggest, dearest car for a generation - just as Europe moved into recession. Sales may not have lived up to the most optimistic expectations but all makes of large luxury cars have had a tough time recently. However, the S-Class Has not been the disaster some commentators would have you believe. As Helmut Werner, Mercedes-Benz president and chief executive officer, said at Frankfurt show last week, it is still several lengths ahead of the competition with a 27 per cent share of market segment. The S-Class, like Rolls-Royce's off-the-peg models, is being promoted as a tool for high-mileage business professionals, not a status symbol. Can this be justified? Having driven one to Frankfurt and back last week, I think it can. For me, there is a direct relationship between car size and relaxed comfort. On long motorway journeys, there can be no question that big and spacious cars are best. S-Class buyers drive larger than average annual mileages, which rather proves the point. The model I drove was a sign of the times; a six-cylinder, 2.8-litre engined S280, budget priced at Pounds 37,500; the multi-cylinder versions cost between Pounds 51,400 (S400 saloon) and Pounds 97,400 (S600 coupe). Compared with the S-Class V8s' 286 or 308 horsepower and the V12's massive 389 bhp, the 197 bhp output of the S280's multi-valve six may seem modest. But it is marginally more than that of the 3-litre engine of the former 300S. In the real world, the S280 does not feel underpowered. A 0-100 kph (0-62 mph) time of 10.7 seconds and a maximum speed of 130 mph (210 kph) are claimed. It has to be fairly low geared but it swooped along the autobahn at a legal 100 mph (161 kph) and 4,000 rpm in doubled-glazed near-silence. The only time the engine raised its voice was when I kicked down from top to second for sharp acceleration when baulked on a hill. A heavy-footed driver who expected the S280 to go like an S500 would fare worse but I averaged a very reasonable 22.45 mpg (12.58 l/100km) and had no need to tank up between Dover and Frankfurt. The S280 is no stripped-out shell of a car to keep the price down. It comes with driver and front passenger airbags, ABS brakes, automatic transmission, walnut trim, tinted glass, outside temperature gauge, anti-theft system including engine immobiliser and power-adjusted, heated mirrors that fold flat at the touch of a button. The main casualty is air conditioning and there is no radio. Mercedes always lets customers choose - and pay for - their own. For an extra Pounds 1,500 buyers can have an electric tilt / slide sunroof (still usable at 60 mph/96 kph), power-adjusted steering wheel and headlamp wash/wipe. Alternatively, Pounds 4,655 extra buys computer-controlled air conditioning, leather seats and eight-hole alloy wheels. There is a huge amount of room for up to five people inside an S-Class, with boot capacity to match. Buyers probably fly first class just to get the same amount of space around them. Understandably, its bulk is unwelcome in town and fitting it into a multi-storey may call for some nipping and tucking. But on open roads and motorways the S-Class is supreme. The loudest noise was tyre whine on some autobahn surfaces. I forgot how good the suspension was until I noticed other cars bobbing up and down on ill-maintained surfaces while the 280S rode flat.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (3): Hive of electioneering - Mark Nicholson examines politics in the emirate ELECTIONS for a new Kuwaiti National Assembly do not take place for another eight months, but you would scarcely know it. The emirate is already a hive of electioneering. Opposition groups, seeking to revive the momentum they enjoyed immediately after Kuwait's liberation, hold regular combined meetings attracting more than 1,000 people. More than 40 members of the National Council, the interim consultative assembly reconvened by the Emir last year, have declared their candidature and some have already enjoyed lusty public exchanges with opposition figures. Diwaniyas, Kuwait's unique home-based discussion groups, are more numerous and politicised than ever. And the government scarcely appears to twitch without thinking first of the electoral consequences. In part, the buzz surrounding October's poll manifests political ambitions pent up since the Emir dissolved the last full National Assembly in 1986 - and with it selected paragraphs of the country's 1961 constitution - citing security reasons for suspending a forum which was offering increasingly bitter and troublesome opposition to the government's policies and some of its ministers - none of whom the Assembly had powers to appoint. The excitement also reflects a broad will, most vocally put by opposition groups, to get to grips with the governance of the new post-war Kuwait. But as to whether, finally, the war has substantially altered the real issues of Kuwaiti politics, or the political alignment of its limited electorate, opinions are mixed, and firm judgments are probably premature. One certain change since Kuwait's last poll will be the size of the electorate, which is limited to Kuwaiti males over 21 who can trace family lineage back to Kuwait City in the 1920s. Due largely to the youthful profile of Kuwait's population, by October more than 90,000 Kuwaitis will be on the electoral roll. This is a rise of 30,000 on the number eligible to vote in the June 1990 election for the interim, and purely consultative, National Council - of which half of its 75 members were government appointees. Women and 'second degree Kuwaitis' - Kuwaiti citizens not so tightly defined by reference to their 1920s forbears - will not vote in the 1992 poll, although Sheikh Jaber al Sabah, the Emir, has promised to 'study' their eventual enfranchisement and the next assembly is sure to have this issue near the top of its agenda. Campaigning proper cannot start formally until three weeks before the election date, which remains to be set. From that time, candidates will be allowed to raise tents outside their homes to entertain election gatherings  -not the least attractive feature of which are some candidates' efforts to compete in providing the most lavish cuisine. The social onus laid on Kuwaiti election meetings is characteristic of the emirate's brand of 'democracy' which traditionally places heavy stress on the achievement of consensus - very often through the institution of the Diwaniya, itself a fundamentally social gathering. Diwaniyas, hosted by and open to members of the ruling family and ordinary Kuwaitis alike, are a highly efficient grapevine in what is essentially a cosy, if clannish, city state. 'We grind and grind, and eventually reach consensus,' says Mr Jasem Qabazard, a member of the National Council, both of its own decision-making process and that of Kuwait overall. Mr Qabazard and other members of the National Council, which is condemned by the main opposition groups as being unconstitutional, claim this consensual system is the defining point of Kuwaiti politics - of which the written constitution is merely a reflection. 'There is an unwritten constitution that balance should always be maintained among the main families here,' says Mr Ibrahim Shehabi, another National Council member. The opposition, particularly the Democratic Forum, a grouping of largely western-educated leftists and liberals, disputes this strongly, claiming Kuwait's political structure should flow from the constitution, and that any political decision made since parts of it were suspended in 1986 is illegitimate. 'Any government without constitutional control risks becoming a corrupt government,' says Mr Mohammed al Ghadiri, a Democratic Forum spokesman. For the opposition, both secular and Islamic, the National Assembly is the means by which Kuwaitis can keep the rule of the al-Sabah family accountable. Although the 50 elected members of the assembly cannot pick government ministers, 16 of whom also sit on the assembly, it can constitutionally demand their appearance to justify policies and it has a limited veto on government legislation. The strength of the opposition's challenge in the October elections is difficult to assess - although it is already clear that it will fight energetically for seats. The Democratic Forum, which declared itself a political party late last year in defiance of an unwritten prohibition on such, says it will field 10-15 candidates and expects to win at least five or more seats. Of the various Islamic groups, the Sunni fundamentalist Islamic Constitutional Movement, which wants to see Sharia law enacted in Kuwait, says it will field 15, while the Islamic Alliance, another Sunni group, will field a further 10. The main Shia group, the National Islamic Coalition, says only that it will field 'many' candidates. Shia Moslems comprise some fifth of Kuwait's population. The opposition groups will command considerable domestic news coverage, not least now that the government has formally lifted censorship in local papers, and there will be much western interest during the campaign. But many observers suggest that voters will return essentially the same interest groups which have dominated Kuwait's representative assemblies in the past - a mix of merchants, Islamic groups, leftists, bedouin and western-style liberals - and that the conservatism of Kuwait's voters should not be underestimated. 'In practice,' says one diplomat, 'it will be the same parish pump politics it has been since the first national assembly in the 1960s.' Moreover, despite the prominence of opposition spokesmen immediately after liberation, many observers suggest that the government has gone a long way towards quieting the vehemence of post-liberation demands for democracy by realising its promise of holding elections, by not tampering with constituency boundaries - a trick opposition groups had feared - and, perhaps most important, by offering most Kuwaitis a good deal of pre-election largesse. The government has not only raised the salaries of civil servants - up to 90 per cent of whom are Kuwaitis - by 25 per cent, but it has also written off all Kuwaitis' pre-war housing and consumer loan debts. Moreover, some suggest that the preoccupation with achieving consensus in Kuwait offers the country a political self-righting quality. 'There are people rocking the boat,' says a western diplomat. 'But when the deck gets too near the water, people tend to rush over to the other side to balance it.' However, the real test of this self-righting will come immediately before the elections. If opposition groups find themselves able to command large and raucus gatherings at their campaign tents, some diplomats fear the government could lose its nerve and call in the security forces - much as it did during pro-democracy demonstrations in Spring 1990, the last time Kuwait's political season was in full swing.</p>

			<p><P> June 5, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> SERVING SUSHI AT BASEBALL GAMES? SAY IT AIN'T SO, JOE  </P> <P> There has been considerable hand-wringing in recent years about America losing  its competitive edge to the Japanese. We invent it, they make it. Cars, TVs,  VCRs, computer chips, farm equipment, high-tech gizmos of all sorts.  </P> <P> The Japanese are even gobbling up huge chunks of swank real estate, movie  studios and other symbols of Americana.  </P> <P> Well, maybe all that was inevitable, interest rates, labor costs, and  free-market competition being what they are. But its time to take a stand.  They're threatening to horn in on something that strikes at the very heart of  our culture. We're talking social significance. We're talking moral outrage.  We're talking baseball.  </P> <P> Baseball may be the only hallowed American institution untouched by Japanese  influence, the only one they've copied and still not been able to beat us at.  In fact, its even good for the balance of trade.  </P> <P> Every year, Japanese teams import a few dozen nearsighted sluggers and  sore-armed pitchers, the real meatballs of the national pastime. No longer  terrorized by the likes of a Roger Clemens on the mound or Dave Winfield at the  plate, even the American rejects start banging and bopping the ball like  all-stars and ship back a few million dollars apiece for their troubles.  </P> <P> Now this last vestige of American dominance may be crumbling. Japanese  influence is starting to trickle into major league stadiums. This season for  the first time ever, they're selling sushi -- that's right, those dainty little  globs of raw squid, grouper, shark, fish eggs and what have you -- at the old  ballpark.  </P> <P> Think about it. You're sitting in the grandstand on a sweltering summer day.  It's the bottom of the ninth, a tense, scoreless pitcher's duel on the field,  and that empty, gnawing feeling rumbles up from the pit of your stomach. You  turn to your buddy in the next seat and say, "Gee, you know what would really  hit the spot at a time like this? An ice cold brew and a hunk of eel, that's  what."  </P> <P> Ridiculous, right? Well, the San Diego Padres have been selling crab rolls  along with the peanuts, popcorn and Cracker Jack ever since opening day this  season. And fans have actually been snapping them up.  </P> <P> What's worse, the Angels are slated to be next. Ed Elias, the general manager  of the catering firm that runs concession stands at the Big A, says he hopes to  offer sushi later this season or early in 1990. If that sounds unpatriotic, get  a load of this: The sushi shack is going to go in where an ice cream parlor now  stands.  </P> <P> Why would any red-blooded fan nibble on slimy, uncooked seaweed at the ballpark  when they could choose from a virtual cornucopia of all-American favorites to  munch on, dishes like nachos, tostadas and bratwurst? "Why do they eat baked  potatoes, fish and chips or cinnamon rolls at a ballpark?" asked Elias,  rhetorically. "I think the fans will eat about anything you offer them. We're  even going to build a pasta house."  </P> <P> Just because they'll eat it, Ed, doesn't mean you have to give it to them. I'm  all for change, innovation and variety, but some things are sacred. With domed  stadiums, artificial turf, designated hitters and mascots parading around the  park in chicken costumes, hasn't the game already been perverted enough?  </P> <P> Ever since Abner Doubleday kicked dirt on his first umpire, generations of  American youth have been raised to believe that a balanced ballpark diet meant  a hot dog in one hand, a beer in the other and maybe a bag of peanuts on their  lap. But these days, Angel fans are already munching on wilted seafood salads  and sipping on sweet frozen daiquiris. No wonder snobby Easterners resisted  letting the game move West for all those years.  </P> <P> If fans here want the privilege of watching Big League games, the least they  could do is eat like Big Leaguers. You think Joe DiMaggio or Babe Ruth ever  slurped up a plate of raw mackerel on rice?  </P> <P> No, the Babe had an appetite and thirst that was legendary. When the Yankees  played in Chicago, for example, he would sometimes duck out between innings to  McCuddy's Tavern across the street from the stadium.  </P> <P> And you can bet it wasn't to order a watercress sandwich and a white wine  spritzer.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SIERRA UNIVERSITY ACCUSED OF FRAUD  </P> <P> A psychology student who says she spent two years and $12,000 to get a master's  degree from Sierra University -- "A University Without Walls" in Costa Mesa,  has sued that school, alleging fraud and breach of contract.  </P> <P> Laurean Tahl, 30, of South Laguna goes to court Tuesday for a hearing in her  suit, filed after state licensing officials told her the courses she took were  inadequate and denied her a counseling license.  </P> <P> Upon her graduation in 1987, the state granted Tahl a temporary counseling  license and allowed her to work as a therapist for a year under supervision,  she said. Then in 1988 state officials revoked the permit, explaining that  whoever had processed the forms had been improperly trained, Tahl said.  </P> <P> "It really shattered me. I've lost two years of my career."  </P> <P> According to a catalogue from the correspondence school at 2900 Bristol St.,  Suite D-207, students meet weekly with tutors who review their progress and  critique their written work. In addition to psychology, the school offers  undergraduate and postgraduate programs in business, health, public  administration, communications, computer science, criminal justice, education  and human behavior.  </P> <P> Sierra University is not accredited, but it is approved by the state to issue  degrees in those fields, according to the state Department of Education.  </P> <P> At the time Tahl attended, she said, about 30 other students were enrolled in  the clinical psychology program. The school was then headquartered in Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> Richard Bibeau, the university's president, could not be reached for comment.  An answering service said he was out of town. The school door was locked and  bore a note reading, "Please do not enter unless you have an appointment."  </P> <P> Bibeau's attorney declined to comment on the case, but has said in papers filed  in court that Tahl was adequately supervised and that the university had  provided a program that met minimum standards set by the board of examiners,  the state's licensing agency.  </P> <P> Tahl said she will act as her own attorney at the hearing next week in Orange  County Superior Court because she can't afford to hire counsel.  </P> <P> Five similar complaints have been filed against the school with the Department  of Education, said Mike Castro, a complaints coordinator the department.  </P> <P> But Castro said the state is not investigating Sierra University because "five  complaints is not an unusual number to receive against any private university."  </P> <P> But aides at the office of state Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach)  said they are investigating Sierra, having found instructors with only  community college experience teaching post-graduate classes.  </P> <P> "Sierra's administration has obviously gone beyond their responsibilities,"  Ferguson aide Mildred Murray said. "The question is why are these schools being  approved or accredited?"  </P> <P> Richard Leslie, an attorney for the California Assn. of Marriage and Family  Therapists, said the association has received several complaints about Sierra  University. He also is critical of the state approval process.  </P> <P> "Many schools can't meet the strict requirements of accreditation, but some get  state approval anyway," he said.

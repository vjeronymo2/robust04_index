			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REACHING THE TOP;  </P> <P> FAIRFAX, WASHINGTON WIN BASKETBALL TITLES AS L.A. GAMES END  </P> <P> There certainly were taller teams than the Fairfax High School boy's basketball  team. There were even stronger teams, faster teams and flashier teams.  </P> <P> But over the course of a 128-team tournament at the L.A. Games, no team was  better.  </P> <P> Fairfax defeated Dorsey, 46-45, in Sunday's final at El Camino College behind  11 points by Ryan Hickman, who was named the tournament's most valuable player.  </P> <P> The Lions defeated two-time defending champion Cleveland on Saturday to advance  to Sunday morning's semifinals against Fremont, which was playing with all its  starters from the L.A. City 3-A championship team.  </P> <P> Fairfax held Fremont to 11 points in the first 31 minutes of the 40-minute  game, and won, 34-22.  </P> <P> Fairfax relied on a stifling man-to-man defense and precision passing to win  the championship of the L.A. Games, a 12-sport festival for 10,000 Southern  California high school athletes that concluded Sunday.  </P> <P> "I think we could show flashiness, but we like a controlled flashiness,"  Fairfax Coach Harvey Kitani said. "Our type of play demands a lot of focus and  concentration. It's like the kid in the classroom who is going to Harvard and  can never daydream."  </P> <P> In the girls' competition, Washington won four of its six games by more than 20  points, and Sunday defeated much-taller Morningside for the championship,  70-56.  </P> <P> In a game that was called with 41 seconds to play because of a bench-clearing  fight, Washington finally defeated Morningside, the state champion which had  defeated the Generals twice last season.  </P> <P> Despite losing their tallest player, 5-foot-11 Angelina Adams, because of a  knee injury, Washington dominated the Monarchs with 6-5 Lisa Leslie, 6-3 Janet  Davis and 6-1 Rachel Gardner.  </P> <P> "They were like enormous," said Washington's Charisse Sampson, who scored 19  points and was named tournament MVP. "But I was just telling myself to go for  it, to take charge. This was revenge time."  </P> <P> The Generals also were led by Remitha Houston and Detra Lockhart, who  Washington Coach Phil Chase calls the country's best high school backcourt  tandem.  </P> <P> Houston scored a game-high 21 points and Lockhart had 23 assists.  </P> <P> Tempers flared with two minutes left when Leslie threw an elbow at the 5-10  Sampson, and was called for a foul. She then threw the ball at a referee, who  caught it and called a technical.  </P> <P> The game was called with less than a minute to play after two players got into  a fight on the court, prompting both benches to clear.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Pavel Bogomolov: "Baku Envoy on </F> the Thames"]    [Text] London, 5 Apr -- Makhmud Mamed Guliyev, Azerbaijan  ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Britain, has  presented his credentials to Queen Elizabeth II. The process of  establishing bilateral diplomatic relations has thus officially  been completed. Following the embassies of the Russian  Federation, Ukraine, and Armenia, the embassy of the Caspian  state becomes the latest full-scale diplomatic mission of the  CIS countries on the banks of the Thames.    Baku is now linked by a weekly direct flight by the  Azerbaijan Airways company with London's Gatwick Airport. This  helps to activate bilateral business relations within whose  framework mutually advantageous agreements and contacts have  recently been signed between Transcaucasus enterprises,  associations, and firms, and well known companies like "Kayzer  [name as transliterated] Engineers," "Morrison Construction,"  "British Telecom," "Datacom," and "GPT." Talks are continuing  on the forthcoming conclusion of a "deal of the century" aimed  at the participation of a consortium of Western oil giants in  the development and export of the Caspian's fuel and energy  resources.</p>

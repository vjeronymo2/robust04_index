			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES OF NEW HOMES UP 2% IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> New-home sales in Orange County rose a modest 2% this summer from a year  earlier, but were up a sharp 19.5% from the spring, according to a real estate  research and consulting group.  </P> <P> The report by the Meyers Group said 2,970 new homes were sold in the  three-month period that ended Sept. 30, up from 2,901 homes sold in the  previous summer and the 2,486 homes sold last spring.  </P> <P> Forty-eight new projects opened for sale in the latest quarter, compared to 29  in the spring and 22 in the summer of 1988.  </P> <P> The median price of a new single-family home in the county stood at $350,000 in  the July-September period, down 5.4% from the $369,000 median in the spring but  up 12% from the previous summer.  </P> <P> The price decline from the previous quarter was blamed on competition caused by  the sharp increase in new housing projects and the fact that many of the homes  that were sold during the summer were smaller and had fewer costly amenities.  </P> <P> The lowest-priced new house in Orange County sold for $159,900 this summer, the  report said. Homes in the most expensive non-custom new tract were $1,150,000.  </P></p>

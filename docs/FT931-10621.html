			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (3): Playing the game - Mr Javad Larijani, special adviser to President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani on foreign relations, talks to Roger Matthews On the improvement of Iran's relations with the west during the Kuwait crisis and the subsequent deterioration: I was not much impressed by the kind of overtures that came from the west when Iraq invaded Kuwait. Nor am I much disturbed by recent political unhappiness. It is better for us to stick to our principles and come to terms with our external environment rather than trying to calculate when the world is happy with us and when the world is not happy with us. The relevance of Iran's 'Neither east nor west' policy following the collapse of the Soviet Union: It is still a relevant policy but maybe the way we express it should be changed. Its main purpose is to convey the idea that we decide in Tehran what our interests are and that we should not be expected to kneel down in front of foreign powers. It is part of our sense of national sovereignty. It does not mean we should be antagonistic towards anybody outside Iran. We are a member of the international community. In the international community you cannot do whatever you like, or whatever you think is right for your own interests. There is a sort of game which we should start to play, and we are playing it. Whether US and British ambassadors might return to Tehran: There is no big obstacle preventing better relations with the west, other than political attitudes. This is mainly the responsibility of our western partners. There is still a cultural barrier, a sense that someone can dictate to other parts of the world about how they should behave. Economically, relations are beneficial for both sides. But politically the international situation is still not mature enough, especially with the type of disorder now affecting the world community. The laws of the new game are not well defined. We have a game in which the rules are changing and the players also are changing. So anyone can claim victory, even though they may not be winning. We should just stick to our principles and when the fruit is ripe then it could be picked from the tree. We should not rush. Is foreign policy still guided by the desire to aid oppressed Moslems anywhere in the world? This is a fabulous principle that anyone in the world should help the needy, the oppressed and the poor. This does not mean we are going to topple the governments of other countries if we think that they do not behave according to our standards. It does not mean that we are going to interfere with their daily affairs. That is the way the west behaves towards us and to other countries. In practice the basis of our decisions is our national interest. To rebuild the country we have a long way to go. We are determined to convert Iran into a prosperous and advanced country. We are putting all our efforts into that. The ideas which guide our country are attracting followers in many Islamic countries. In Egypt, there is a movement which they branded fundamentalism. We like the word fundamentalism. It shows that people are concerned with the deep issues and fundamental truths. This movement is like a renaissance. It is true that it started from Iran and the waves are spreading. It is disturbing a number of governments in Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt. But it is simplistic and naive for those governments to blame Iran because our ideas have followers. We are pleased that what we do is admired in the Islamic world but this is not something we can be blamed for. The Islamic world is undergoing a deep change and our revolution played a major role in expediting this change. The more suppressed it is, the greater momentum it will have, and the more it will become radicalised. This is the source of suspicion about Iran. Politicians in America think it is like a commodity which we export to other countries. But this is not the reality. US paranoia about Iran stems from such very simplistic views. Role of the armed forces: We must calculate the threat and consider what would be a reasonable defence. We have been the victim of a notorious aggression after the revolution. The mastermind of this aggression is alive and is still in power in Baghdad. No reasonable person would be willing to be caught again by surprise. On the southern flank of the Persian Gulf billions of dollars have been invested in armaments. We worry about this. Who is going to be the target for all this? Can the Kuwaitis by buying arms defend themselves again against Iraqi aggression? We doubt it. We see ourselves as a country surrounded by turmoil and tension and potentially threatened by a neighbour with a proven appetite for aggression. So we need a reliable defence facility. Unfortunately, from the point of view of the generals, our priority is the construction of the country. So we are working towards an army which is small but efficient. We think that the best thing that Iran can offer the Islamic world is its global ideas and this is already taking us into the hearts of millions of Moslems. We do not need to send troops. Our troops are our ideas, and we are very proud that our ideas are getting through. People like us throughout the Islamic world; the intellectuals admire us, and we feel very happy about that. There is not a single politician in Iran contemplating expanding Iran's geography. Iran's attitude to nuclear weapons: We have no nuclear ambitions. It is neither feasible to invest huge amounts of capital in it, nor would it be effective in our defence. But I do think it is the right of Iran to have access to nuclear technology for totally civilian and peaceful uses. Like any other major area of science and technology, no-one should deprive us from acquiring that possibility. But we will not be pressing too hard because we do have alternative sources of energy. The Middle East peace process: Our opposition to the process is twofold. First, on its feasibility, and second on issues of principle and ideology. The idea of this peace process is that it should begin to resolve the problems of Israel with its neighbouring countries, one by one. If that is done we are left with the helpless people of Palestine. What can they do? We think this is very unfair to them and that the resolution of their fate should precede any other discussion.</p>

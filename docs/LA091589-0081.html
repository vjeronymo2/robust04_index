			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Thirty-four white men turned down for firefighting jobs in Boston even though  they had perfect scores on a civil service exam sued to force the department to  adopt a color-blind hiring policy. Spurred by a recent U.S. Supreme Court  decision paving the way for such lawsuits, the plaintiffs said they were  seeking a court ruling allowing them to be hired. "We're not trying to deprive  anybody," said plaintiff Larry Mackin. "We just want the best man to win."  Boston has long been under a federal consent decree requiring it to hire one  minority for every white to ensure the police and fire departments reflect the  city's ethnic makeup. But Mackin said the policy has foiled his efforts for 12  years, and that he has always scored well on the civil service exam.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Abd-al-Muhsin Salamah: "Plan to Control </F> Shantytowns Evaluated; Two Stages of Development Completed in 11  Governorates; Further Shantytown Development Requires 3.5  Billion Pounds in Total Allocations"]    [Text] With the completion of the third stage of shantytown  action in the various governorates, it would be useful to pause  in order to evaluate the plan to control shantytowns and  determine whether it has been successful. How well did the  governorates implement their shantytown control plans? What  difficulties did they encounter?    Shantytowns are largely found in 11 Egyptian governorates  but  are at a maximum concentration in Cairo, Giza, al-Qalyubiyah,  and Alexandria. There are 434 shantytowns throughout the  governorates. They need 3.485 billion pounds even though 290  million pounds was expended on the first stage of improvements  and enhancements. The second stage has been allocated an  additional 183.9 million pounds in the current fiscal year    Cairo accounted for the lion's share of total expended  allocations. Expenditures on the first stage alone amounted to  10 million pounds in addition to 50 million pounds in the  current fiscal year.  <H5>  84 Percent </H5>   The Ministry of Local Administration conducted a performance  evaluation of the first stage of the shantytown action plan in  order to improve the efficacy of subsequent stages of  development and to overcome obstacles encountered in removing  the shantytowns.    The focus of the Cairo governorate in the first stage was on  zones fraught with tension, specifically al-Zawiyah al-Hamra'  and 'Ayn Shams. The first stage of allocations of 10 million  pounds were spent on sewers and street paving.    In 'Ayn Shams, 13 streets were paved and the water system  was  improved. Needed cleaning and beautification equipment was also  purchased.    Al-Zawiyah al-Hamra' had its main streets and lanes paved,  its sewer system completed, and its water system overhauled. In  addition, cleaning equipment was purchased and al-Zawiyah  al-Hamra' hospital was refurbished.    The first stage of shantytown development in Cairo  accomplished 84 percent of its goals and expended 8.4 million  pounds of its total allocation.  <H5>  Self-Help </H5>   Al-Qalyubiyah, according to a Ministry of Local  Administration report, achieved 100 percent of planned  objectives and expended all its development allocations on  street paving, sanitary sewers, and potable water systems in its  various towns.    Al-Qalyubiyah began shantytown development on its own,  according to its governor Dr. 'Adil Ilhami, by allocating 10  million pounds of its local resources to deal with the problem,  resolve the predicament of shantytown residents by providing  them with alternative housing, and develop existing shantytowns  in 'Izbat-al-Zira'ah, Manshiyat-al-Nur, Tarrad al-Nil, and  Shubrah-al-Khaymah. After the shantytowns were surveyed and a  plan devised for their development, they were allocated a  two-tier allotment of 27.5 million pounds supplemented by an  additional allocation of 4.5 million pounds under the  governorate's emergency plan to initiate shantytown control--a  plan approved by the Ministry of Local Administration.    The governor pointed out that the emergency plan was fully  implemented in all the shantytowns of its various towns, but  that still to be completed is the governorate's comprehensive  plan, once the shantytowns are surveyed and their needs for  projects and services ascertained. This comprehensive plan is to  cost about 279 million pounds for school and hospital  construction, street paving, sewer systems, electric grid  projects, and other basic services in the deprived areas.    The governor explained that it will take 18 additional  shantytown schools to solve the three-shift problem in certain  areas. More police stations and youth centers also need to be  built, he added.    Ten million pounds were allocated for the first stage of  shantytown development in Alexandria governorate, of which 86  percent, or 8.645 million pounds, has been actually spent on  development.    Shantytown development in Alexandria targeted street paving  and sewer projects. Five million pounds ware spent on paving and  the remaining 3.645 million pounds went to sanitary sewer  projects.  <H5>  Before the Assembly </H5>   The Housing Committee of the People's Assembly, in order to  field monitor shantytown development, visited some of the  governorates afflicted with shantytowns in order to evaluate the  progress of the work in the field, ascertain the objectives  accomplished, and prepare for the Assembly a special report on  the government's shantytown development plan, according to  Housing Committee chairman al-Sayyid Sarhan.    The Committee noted that shantytowns continue to spring up  and grow, laying to waste all efforts expended on that problem.  This is attributed to development-stunting "bureaucracies" in  the governorates, lofty fees and costs for approved land  divisions, and the failure of certain towns over 60 or more  years to modify their perimeters in accordance with their  natural expansion.    The Committee chairman emphasized that new housing divisions  should take the form of urban communities in the sense that they  should be complete with the basic services that their residents  need, such as schools, hospitals, and police and fire stations.  Only when such facilities are planned should a division be  approved and issued its permit by the authorities.    It is also necessary, he added, to protect state-owned land  from squatters in order to ward off the formation of new  shantytowns. State-owned land should be used for building  planned urban housing communities that would be self-sufficient  in public services and utilities.  <H5>  Support by the State </H5>   He said: "It is mandatory for the state to prevent the  formation of any more shantytowns. It is obvious that those  communities sprang-up under the noses of various state agencies  which lacked the wherewithal to do something about them. It is  important to ward off future shantytown formation by supporting  local governments and other agencies that could play a role in  challenging them."    I asked him: "How about the shantytowns that must be  removed?"    He answered: "The Committee visited a few of those. They  will  never respond to development and improvement efforts and need to  be totally removed. However, we must first provide their  residents with alternate housing. We may be able to accommodate  them in vacant housing units in new communities and build them  integrated communities there.    "Land reclaimed from shantytowns could be incorporated in  local city planning and utilized in accordance with city needs  in a manner that would prevent them from supporting shantytowns  again."    The Housing Committee concluded in its report that local  governments and the Ministry of Public Works and Water Resources  should coordinate with each other in order to prevent the  formation of new shantytowns in susceptible locations such as  canal and river banks, under bridge superstructures, and along  major roads. The Committee also underscored the value of  reducing costs and easing permit requirements for new land  developments as part of orderly urban development in the cities.  <H5>  An End to Shantytowns </H5>   Dr. Mahmud Sharif, Minister of Local Administration,  believes  that rural areas must be developed and helped to grow in order  to ward off the formation of new shantytowns by containing  outward migration. He also believes that planning should  out-pace shantytowns by developing new plots suitable for  residential use and selling them to individuals and  cooperatives, and by coming down hard on building code, zoning,  and city planning violations. There must be coordination in that  regard between local governments and various agencies of the  Ministry in order to quickly spot the violations and remove them.    He pointed out that the Ministry has set priorities in  approaching the problem since it would be difficult to deal all  at once with all shantytowns throughout the governorates.  Topping the list of priorities are Greater Cairo and Alexandria  as well as nine other governorates in Upper Egypt. Shantytowns  in the 11 governorates have been surveyed and the cost of their  development estimated at 3.48 billion pounds. The governorates  have proffered projects that are already planned and therefore  could be tendered in two months. Outlays of 106 million pounds  have been allocated for this stage and the governorates have  selected projects that could be completed during the current  fiscal year. This puts shantytown development allocations at 290  million pounds so far.    Requests from the governorates for the cleaning equipment  they need are being received and reconciled as to costs and  specifications. This equipment, estimated to cost 162 million  pounds, will be supplied in two stages. Equipment supplied in  the first stage will cost 51.9 million pounds.  <H5>  Grassroots Solutions </H5>   Minister Mahmud Sharif emphasized that only with grassroots  participation can the shantytown problem be resolved once and  for all. He cites the good example of al-Nahdah City which  absorbed a large number of quake and shantytown victims and  where The Red Crescent Society implemented a specific plan to  involve inhabitants in the management of their city. Each  apartment building elects one of its tenants to represent it,  and five such representatives are elected to represent all  residents on the city's administrative council. This indicates  that it is possible to modify citizen behavior and to implant  the values of respect for public property and interest in the  environment as well as develop neighborliness and the spirit of  belonging.    Several agencies helped with that plan in cooperation with  UNICEF. Preliminary results are very encouraging.    The Ministry is reinforcing that experiment by introducing a  new plan to help alleviate unemployment in that society by  training youths in the various trades and giving them preference  in obtaining small business financing from the Social Fund and  others.</p>

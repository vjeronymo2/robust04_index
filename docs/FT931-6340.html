			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Breaking up British Gas THERE IS a strong prima facie case for some form of break-up of British Gas, and the current Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation provides an opportunity to do so. Whether the radical dismemberment proposed yesterday by Ofgas is the right way to go remains unproven. The underlying principle behind the industry regulator's plan is right: competition wherever possible, and monopoly and regulation only where necessary. Ofgas convincingly argues that British Gas's transportation business is the only part of the gas supply market to constitute a 'natural monopoly'. It would be wasteful to build duplicate pipelines into customers' premises and, provided rivals can get fair access to these facilities, there is no reason why the rest of the gas market should not be competitive. But is forcing British Gas to sell off 14 different companies necessary to achieve competition? The case for creating a separate transportation company is compelling. The current integrated structure has made it difficult for competitors to get fair access to British Gas's pipelines. Divestment would ensure fair treatment, as the transportation business would no longer have an incentive to show favouritism to British Gas's marketing arm. There is also something to be said for breaking the marketing business into 12 competing companies. A more modest proposal would be to remove British Gas's de jure monopoly to supply domestic customers. But the group's de facto monopoly would be eroded more quickly if it was split into regional companies able to make raids into each others' territories. More competition would create a greater incentive to improve efficiency, expand the market for gas and deliver a better quality of service. The main objection is political. Competition might lead to prices for some customers going up as cross-subsidies inherent in the system were eliminated. The least convincing part of Ofgas's plan concerns a separate gas purchasing company. British Gas's dominant position in this part of the market is largely due to long-term contracts signed before privatisation. It is already being forced to sell on some of this gas to competitors and it is not clear that more should be done. Moreover, most of Ofgas's arguments are theoretical. Before embarking on big structural changes to the industry, it is important that hard figures on the costs and benefits of a break-up are produced. So far the only published figures are a Pounds 3bn estimate from British Gas and a Pounds 250m one from Ofgas for the break-up costs. No attempt has been made to explain where these numbers come from, although the MMC has been given more detailed figures. British Gas and Ofgas must now make more financial information available to the public. The issue is too important to be decided behind closed doors.</p>

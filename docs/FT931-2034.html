			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei boosted by reports of larger fiscal package TOKYO was firmer on reports that the ruling Liberal Democratic Party is considering an economic fiscal package of some Y14,000bn, boosting hopes of an early economic recovery, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average closed up 247.22 at 18,784.39, the day's high, having opened at the day's low of 18,559.85 before rallying throughout the day on buying by foreign investors. Volume fell to 300m shares from 630m, due to subdued activity by dealers who are reluctant to build up positions before the March 31 financial year end. Gains led losses by 626 to 386, with 162 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 7.01 to 1,413.70 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index 2.52 to 1,126.48. Investors were also encouraged by a rise in last month's money supply: M2 plus certificates of deposits, the country's money supply aggregate, rose 0.2 per cent from the previous year, its first rise in six months. Traders said that lower interest rates had pushed more liquidity into the economy, including financial markets. Reports over the weekend that the new fiscal support package would be far larger than the Y10,700bn package formulated last August also added to the optimism. Steels and shipbuilders were stronger with Nippon Steel, the day's most active issue, rising Y3 to Y340, followed by Kawasaki Steel, which gained Y8 to Y323. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the leading shipbuilder, advanced Y11 to Y548. Sankyo, a leading pharmaceutical company, lost Y50 to Y2,360 on reports of alleged side effects of one of its products. Other drug makers were firm, with Takeda Chemical rising Y10 to Y1,350 and Dai-Ichi Pharmaceutical up Y50 to Y1,540. Construction companies, which were raided by tax officials over the weekend on alleged links with Mr Shin Kanemaru, the former kingpin of the LDP, lost ground. Nishimatsu Construction fell Y30 to Y1,150 and Tobishima retreated Y12 to Y539. Brokers, which rose last week on hopes that the recent market rally would help earnings, fell on profit-taking with Nomura Securities losing Y40 to Y1,850 and Daiwa Securities down Y20 to Y1,080. In Osaka, the OSE average rose 106.24 to 19,562.82 in volume of 61.2m shares. Roundup THE political turmoil in Russia weighed on some of the region's markets yesterday. TAIWAN closed higher as financials regained Saturday's losses, the weighted index closing up 100.70, or 2.2 per cent at 4,674.28. Turnover was TDollars 55.1bn. Some brokers commented that the financial sector will face profit-taking in the coming days although they expect support to remain for banks. Hua Nan Bank put on TDollars 9.50 to TDollars 157.00. BANGKOK was led down by banks and property groups with some observers commenting that political worries, with rumours of an impending cabinet reshuffle, may have led to the change in sentiment. The SET index lost 12.77 or 1.4 per cent to 899.23 in turnover of Bt3.2bn. Declines led advances by 205 to 34 with 53 stocks unchanged. HONG KONG fell back in the absence of further developments in the dispute between Britain and China over the future of the democratic process. The Hang Seng index closed 28.30 lower at 6,060.04 in turnover of HKDollars 2.25bn, down from Friday's HKDollars 3.88bn. Jardine Matheson slipped 50 cents to HKDollars 47.00 while its affiliate, Hong Kong Land, which was due to announce its final results after the close, lost 10 cents to HKDollars 13.00. AUSTRALIA lost ground throughout the day; investors were upset by developments in Russia. The All Ordinaries index dipped 12.9 to 1,664.3 in turnover of ADollars 226.8m. Great Central Mines was lifted by ADollars 3 to ADollars 11 on reports of increasing US support for the company's West Australian diamond operations. Foster's Brewing dropped 4 cents to ADollars 1.19 on continuing speculation that Asahi Breweries intends to sell part of its 17 per cent stake. SEOUL eased for the first time in four trading sessions, on profit-taking. The composite index shed 10.00 to 658.75 in turnover of Won330.3bn. SINGAPORE also suffered profit-taking following a recently strong performance. The Straits Times Industrial index fell 12.52 to 1,652.26. Carnaud, which last week reported healthy profits on lower turnover, rose 60 cents to SDollars 10.40 in volume of 25,000 shares.

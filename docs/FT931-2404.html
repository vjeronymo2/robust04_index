			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Virgin may sue BA as talks fail: Branson threatens to produce fresh courtroom evidence of 'dirty tricks' VIRGIN ATLANTIC abandoned talks aimed at settling the 'dirty tricks' dispute with its larger rival British Airways yesterday, and threatened to produce new evidence against it in UK or US courts. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, also called for an independent investigation into the dispute by the Department of Trade and Industry. He said an official request would be made next week. The DTI can investigate companies and take civil action against them. Weeks of tense and often sour negotiations almost led to a settlement at one stage. The draft agreement would have seen BA pay Pounds 9m compensation to Virgin. The talks foundered on a clause limiting discussion of the case. Virgin said the clause would 'gag' it, 'restricting (its) ability to refer to the case in any further actions or to provide information to anyone else in a similar dispute'. Mr Branson said: 'We should have the right to refer to matters of historical record.' BA denied it 'sought to 'gag' Virgin'. Mr Robert Ayling, BA's group managing director, said: 'We have simply asked them to agree not to rake over the events of the past. The fundamental point on which we cannot agree with Virgin is their requirement to be able to reopen past events.' The talks were set up after BA publicly apologised to Virgin in January and paid it Pounds 610,000 in libel damages following revelations that BA had been engaged in covert operations to undermine Virgin's business. Last week, Virgin said it was ready to settle if BA dropped the clause forbidding it from referring to the matter in future. But yesterday's Virgin statement said: 'British Airways have sought from Virgin onerous and impractical undertakings including silence over matters of historical record.' It accused BA of 'consistently refusing to acknowledge the full nature of the extent of the activities which have taken place over the past three years'. The company yesterday ins-tructed its UK lawyers to consider 'all the remedies available' including civil cases in the UK under misuse of computers legislation, in the US courts under anti-trust rules, and in Brussels under the Treaty of Rome. 'There's a great deal of material in our possession (that has not yet been made public),' warned Mr Branson. He said court orders could force BA to release yet further evidence of 'dirty tricks'. Virgin said it had been advised that it could recover tens of millions of pounds of compensation in an anti-trust action in the US. Such laws in the US are complicated and action could take years with no guarantee of success. The UK government is likely to be unhappy if the case goes to the US courts. It has put pressure on the two companies not to go to court because adverse publicity might hurt its position in sensitive talks with the US government over aviation deregulation. Mr John Prescott, opposition transport spokesman, called on Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, to intervene. 'There could be considerable implications for British aviation policy if this matter is now pursued in the American courts as Richard Branson intends,' Mr Prescott said in a letter to Mr MacGregor.

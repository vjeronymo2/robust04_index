			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Observer: Rings a bell Any reader who senses a familiar ring in the name of Stephen Mitchell - the lawyer who claims he has met the two Libyans charged with blowing up Pan Am flight 103 - is probably not mistaken. An insurance specialist, he has worked on many of Lloyd's of London's celebrated cases, including the Savonita and Sasse affairs as well as the corporation's computer-leasing debacle. Moreover, a Lloyd's member himself, he surprised friends and foes alike by joining the board of the embattled Richard Outhwaite agency. Mitchell is no stranger to tragedy either. His fiancee was one of the 346 victims of the 1974 Turkish Airlines DC10 disaster, after which he successfully fought for compensation from McDonnell Douglas in the US courts on behalf of 100 British families. He apparently has no axe to grind in the Lockerbie case. He says his meeting with the Libyans' lawyer was arranged through a mutual friend.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Engineering earnings beat settlement rate THE RISE in earnings in the engineering sector may be running at nearly twice the level of recorded settlements, due to 'pay drift', an unpublished study by the Engineering Employers Federation says. The latest settlement figures show a further fall to an average rise of 2.29 per cent for the three months to May. A total of 71 of the 290 deals were 'zero' settlements. In January, the busiest settlement month with 516 recorded, the average rise was 2.5 per cent. But the federation's study found that, even when output was static, pay drift  - which takes into account bonus payments, overtime pay and piece-work  - usually accounts for an extra 2 per cent on top of settlement levels. The study covered 1985 to 1991 but federation officials say there has been no significant change since then. The extent of pay drift may be on the increase as output rises. The report says: 'When output is growing rapidly, pay drift is high. In deep recession pay drift is low. With engineering output static, pay drift appears to amount to over 2 per cent a year.' Pay drift is one of the reasons that the rise in average earnings in the economy as a whole, now running at 4 per cent, tends to outstrip settlements. The other main reason is that earnings are backward looking over 12 months, so when inflation is falling earnings figures will include higher settlements agreed several months ago when inflation was higher. Mr Neil Johnson, federation director-general, welcomed the downward settlement trend as 'encouraging' and said that average settlements have been below 3 per cent for the past eight months, with freezes accounting for 24 per cent of the 1,210 settlements. But he added: 'We have to continue to control our costs strictly even as we begin to come out of recession. Nothing illustrates more starkly our need to remain competitive than the huge trade deficit.' In the three months to May, apart from the 71 zero settlements there were 143 at 3 per cent or less, 44 at between 3.1 per cent and 4 per cent and 32 at more than 4 per cent.</p>

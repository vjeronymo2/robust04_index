			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Scharping appeals for amnesty on Stasi links Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, has called for a partial amnesty for those who co-operated with former east Germany's Stasi secret police. The plea re-opens an issue that has divided east and west Germans and has pitted east Germans against one another as they come to terms with one of the most hated and insidious institutions of the communist period. Mr Scharping said it was time to grant some partial amnesty for former Stasi employees on the grounds that it was preventing 'inner unification' and it was time to rehabilitate some of these people. An amnesty might also have the affect of diluting some support for the PDS, the successor to the former east German Communist party, which contains former Stasi members. More than 109,000 people are estimated to have collaborated with the Stasi. A law was passed in December 1991 enabling east Germans access to their files. It also allows public and private institutions access to screen employees. Mr Scharping's plea was supported by Mr Stefan Heym, the east German writer and member of the PDS who was recently elected to the Bundestag, or lower house. But Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democratic party and senior members of the Gauck Commission, the institution responsible for supervising the files, have opposed any amnesty. 'The time has not yet come, either for an amnesty or to close the files,' said Mr Hansjorg Geiger, deputy to Mr Joachim Gauck, the former east German Lutheran pastor who heads the Commission. Mr Geiger said there were still more than 400,000 outstanding requests by individuals wishing to see their files and the commission was receiving about 500 requests a day. By last April more than 720,000, most of them east Germans, had applied to see whether their names had appeared on any of the files. The files are located in the giant former Stasi headquarters in east Berlin. Although the Stasi tried to burn or shred as many files as possible in late 1989, the Gauck commission still has over 180km of files containing 6m names  -about 4m east Germans and 2m west Germans. The material remains politically explosive. Prominent east German politicians, including Mr Gregor Gysi, the parliamentary head of the PDS, is alleged to have collaborated with the Stasi but he has vehemently denied any of these allegations. Opinion among east Germans remains divided about keeping the files open. Mr Jens Reich, a physicist and member of the former east German opposition, believes the files should be kept open to show the psychological and political nature of totalitarianism as well as the nature of collaboration or resistance under such a system. But other prominent east Germans, including Mr Friedrich Schorlemmer, a Lutheran theologian who opposed the former communist government, wants the files closed because they impose a permanent burden of guilt on east Germans.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Voters hold key to lifting sanctions SERBS yesterday voted in a referendum on whether to hold early elections - the outcome of which will play an important role in determining whether United Nations sanctions against Yugoslavia will be lifted. Confusion yesterday appeared to grip Belgrade, the Serbian capital, because many people were uncertain whether to vote in the snap referendum called by Serbia's ruling Socialists under the control of Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic. Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav federal prime minister, and Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, both favour early elections to get rid of Mr Milosevic, who is seen by the international community as most responsible for the war in Bosnia. Yesterday Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, and peace negotiators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen said in Moscow that UN sanctions could be lifted if Mr Panic gained the upper hand against hardline Serbs. They also indicated sanctions might be eased to help people survive the winter. Mr Kozyrev said: 'We discussed the possibility of some lowering of sanctions against Yugoslavia in connection with the coming winter, first of all to ease the humanitarian situation.' If the referendum fails, Mr Milosevic could remain in office for three more years. The Socialists called the referendum in the belief it would fail and enable them to remain in power. The rules require a majority of registered voters to vote Yes. This was unlikely after Serbian television, under Mr Milosevic's control, had denied publicity to the referendum. Turnout was reported to be moderate.</p>

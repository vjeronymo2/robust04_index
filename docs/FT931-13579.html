			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets: Taiwan cautiously greets the Year of the Cockerel - Simon Davies reviews prospects for the market The Year of the Cockerel is being greeted by many in Taiwan as the year which will see the stock market finally rebound from its 73 per cent slide over the past two years. But there are growing signs that it will open with further falls. The government has finally made it clear that it is keen to support share prices and it has proposed long-awaited concessions, such as halving the stock transaction tax and easing restrictions for foreign institutional investors. As a result of these measures - which have yet to be approved - the Taiwan Stock Exchange index rallied 8 per cent to 3,420.62 in the last seven trading days before the Chinese New Year holiday. In a market which has historically shown little interest in fundamentals, there are brokers who suggest that the 0.3 percentage-point tax reduction could be the sign local investors are looking for to return. The economy is still seeing reasonable growth of around 6 per cent a year and company earnings are expected to recover in 1993 after declining in 1992. However, the market still looks fundamentally expensive by comparison to others in the region. HG Asia Securities in London expects company earnings in 1993 of 8.5 per cent, putting the market on a price-earnings ratio of 21.8 times. This compares with a p/e of 9.4 in Hong Kong and 13.7 in Thailand. Politics will remain a focus of attention when trading resumes next week. February will bring to an end the sensitive debate over who will replace Premier Hau Pei-tsun - one of the last key members of the mainland-born old guard - following President Lee Teng-hui's unconvincing victory in December's legislative elections. 'This market gets upset by political instability, because it is not used to it,' says Mr Peter Kurz, senior representative of Baring Securities Taiwan. He predicts that the weighted index will fall below 3,000 during 1993. The political news is not entirely negative. President Lee's mainstream faction of the ruling Kuomintang party encountered a substantial protest vote in the recent elections, but it still controls sufficient power in the legislature to suggest that there will be no significant change in its market-oriented policy. Fundamental restraints remain. The government is projected to raise TDollars 100bn (USDollars 4bn)from privatisations this year, while brokers pre-dict a further TDollars 60bn from private sector capital raising. This could create a substantial drain on liquidity, although the government plans may prove over-ambitious, after the TDollars 2.8bn China Airlines public offer was only 11 per cent subscribed. More competition for liquidity will come from 15 new banks that opened last year and which are keen to expand their deposit base. Also, the level of Taiwanese investment into mainland China is showing no signs of abating: provisional estimates suggest Dollars 3.5bn was invested last year. Counteracting this liquidity drain will be the capital invested by 11 proposed investment trusts, each of which has 45 days to raise TDollars 4bn. The first companies started fund raising shortly before the Chinese New Year and this should provide some support for blue chip companies. Overall, the Year of the Cockerel appears unlikely to bring initial joy to Taiwanese stock speculators. However, there are some attractive sectors within this gloomy picture, such as electronics companies. Brokers still hold out the distant hope that the prohibition on direct air and sea links, and investment, with the mainland will soon be lifted, allowing Taiwanese companies to gain the full benefits from China's expanding economy. Mr Graham Ormerod of head of research at Jardine Fleming Taiwan Securities, says: 'It is a risky market, but with high risks come potentially high rewards.'</p>

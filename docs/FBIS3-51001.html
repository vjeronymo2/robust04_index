The ANR  [National Republican Association -- Colorado Party] therefore  reshuffled its Executive Board after [former party President]  Blas N. Riquelme's resignation.    In descending order, the post of first vice president went  to  Juan Manuel Cano Melgarejo, the post of second vice president  went to Enrique Gonzalez Quintana, and the post of third vice  president went to Juan Carlos Galaverna, who was supported by  the majority of the 64 members present.    In addition, the post of political secretary went to  Cristina  Munoz, who is the first woman to occupy this post.    The session was held in a calm atmosphere and most  secretaries of state participated. [passage omitted]</p>

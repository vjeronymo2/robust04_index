			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> STATE FUNDS COULD PAY FOR SAFE WATER  </P> <P> The 10,000 to 15,000 low- and middle-income residents of the El Rio and Nyeland  Acres areas could get state help to pay for new safe water supplies, a state  health official said Thursday.  </P> <P> A state grant of up to $400,000 could save the residents the estimated $2,000  per household needed to solve the area's nitrate contamination problem, said  Daniel Carrigan, the state Department of Health Services worker who arranges  for state funding.  </P> <P> The 20 small water districts serving the area must join together and form a  public agency with an elected board of directors to qualify for the funds,  Carrigan told district representatives meeting in El Rio on Thursday.  </P> <P> But there are no guarantees, Carrigan said.  </P> <P> "They have a better-than-average chance of being funded," Carrigan said of the  districts. "But we only have $20 million left in the 1988 bond-law money and we  have $900 million in requests for funding."  </P> <P> The districts could also be eligible for $5 million in loans from the state.  </P> <P> Nitrates are found in human and animal waste. They leach into ground water from  back-yard septic tanks and agricultural field runoff.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) has proposed a law to make $75  million available to correct drinking-water problems. If approved by the  Legislature, it would become a bond initiative on the November ballot.  </P> <P> Representatives of the districts made no decisions Thursday, but county  officials pressed them to act quickly.  </P> <P> Nitrate contamination, which has already forced health officials to close wells  in seven of the districts, could hit the remaining wells any time, said Robert  Quinn, manager of the water resources division of the County Public Works  Agency.  </P> <P> The seven affected districts now receive emergency supplies from the city of  Oxnard and the United Water Conservation District. Wells in the other districts  contain nitrates but at levels low enough to meet state health standards, he  said.  </P> <P> "The whole area has a problem with nitrates," Quinn said. "They need to  recognize that it's going to happen to their wells sooner or later and that  they need to look for a regional solution."  </P> <P> The county recommends that the districts consolidate and join either the United  Water Conservation District or the city of Oxnard. The cost per connection is  about $2,000, whether the districts join a larger agency, dig new wells into  deeper water supplies or blend their well water with other water, Quinn said.  </P> <P> James Burke, a member of the board of directors of the Vineyard Avenue Estates  Mutual Water District, said a consensus among the groups may be impossible.

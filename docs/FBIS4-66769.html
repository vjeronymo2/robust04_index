			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi Radi, Egyptian </F> minister of public works and water resources, by Salah Bidaywi;  in Cairo, date not given--first six paragraphs are AL-SHA'B  introduction]    [Text] A few short months ago, Dr. Muhammad 'Abd-al-Hadi  Radi was put at the head of the Ministry of Irrigation [title as  published]. He stated immediately after assuming his duties that  Egypt does not have one spare drop of water it can give to the  Zionist entity. He also launched extensive dialogues with  Egypt's African partners in the Nile basin in order to realize  his long-stated objective of cooperation among those nations.    Dr. Radi spent his youthful years conducting studies at  water  research institutions. Two years before he was given the  [Irrigation] portfolio, he was given responsibility for the  Encased Drainage Agency [title as published] and was selected to  be deputy minister of irrigation.    The minister of irrigation told AL-SHA'B that he will  provide  water for only 2,500 feddans in Sinai through the year 1997 when  work on digging the Peace Canal would have been completed. This  means that in the absence of an alternative to absorb the  present inhabitants of central Sinai, they would have to be  evacuated, leaving the area as a ready-to-serve meal, which the  enemy may readily gobble up. Studies, on the other hand, confirm  that central Sinai holds enough subterranean water to irrigate 1  million feddans annually and to settle hundreds of thousands in  dozens of new urban communities in central Sinai.    The minister reiterated his unwillingness to supply the  Zionist enemy with a single drop of water and denied that it  poses any threat to Nile sources or that it has attempted to  pilfer Sinai water.    The minister said that the public interest of the motherland  requires him to stay clear from the details of cooperation with  the Africans [as published] and their relationships with the  Zionists because all those concerned would get upset and do not  believe that opposition media should exist in the Third World.    In point of fact, the minister was congenial to the extreme,  but congeniality is not what national interests are about. I  interviewed him twice for one and one-half hours, but he  ultimately preferred to respond to written questions. I wrote  the questions and left them for him. He answered and I left his  office with his answers, but I was not totally happy with [his  response]. I believe that his actions belied the esteem he  professed for AL-SHA'B.    [Bidaywi] We were delighted by your recent statement that  you  refuse to allow one drop of water outside Egyptian [borders].  Would you elucidate for us the scope of the current Zionist  strategy to envelope the sources of Arab water in southeast  Anatolia and in the Ethiopian plateau? And what about Ethiopia's  dams, foreign bureau studies in their regard, and their funding  by international institutions? What are your views on the  al-Salaam [Peace] water pipeline proposed by Turkey for the  Middle East? What is new with regard to Zionist cooperation with  Ethiopia and other nations of the Nile Basin?    [Radi] In all aspects of water resources Egypt focuses on  the  Nile as its main artery of water. Egypt's primary orientation,  of course, is to foster constant and constructive cooperation  with Nile Basin nations and to seek a suitable format for  comprehensive cooperation in order to maximize the benefits of  that river to all its peoples. We felt during our numerous  meetings with Basin countries that all of them are likewise keen  on the same objective.    In light of that keenness, the various countries of the Nile  Basin have adopted positions rooted in non-interference with the  strong fraternal relations that presently exist. Therefore, as  far as we know, there is no foreign intervention with impact on  the Nile Basin. We have no fear of that because our confidence  in ourselves and in our brethren propels actions rooted in  constructive cooperation that would serve mutual interests  without abridging the rights of any party or undermining any of  those rights.    As to Arab waters, the precept is that everyone should  receive his entitlement and that occupation does not justify  usurping the rights of owners of motherlands.    None of the studies and other research by foreign bureaus  and  others are mandates. They are merely personal initiatives by  their sponsors. The basic notion is respect for rights,  commitment to principles, and organized recognition of water use.    The previously proposed al-Salaam Turkish pipeline project  is  a political project in the sense that we don't believe in its  technical or economic feasibility. Desalinating sea water is  more feasible technically and economically and can be done  within a state's borders and would therefore be easily  controlled.    [Bidaywi] Your studies published under the title "Water and  Peace" discussed cooperation between Egypt and Nile Basin  countries. Have you translated them into reality? How do the  Africans justify their cooperation with the Zionists? What  progress has been made in making water projects more productive  in the Upper Nile? Also, what about the High Dam project, the  removal of silt from its reservoir, and the true nature of  refurbishment there?    [Radi] The primary objective of the "Water and Peace"  studies  originally published in 1985 was to alert domestic and regional  public opinion to the urgency of water issues and to the value  of organizing, developing, and safeguarding our water resources.    The studies also advanced a collection of strategies  proposed  by their author. We seek, within a context of integration and  coordination with all the other agencies, to implement those  strategies that are appropriate at this time.    We have already begun to move in that direction in Ethiopia,  and we hope that such moves will be fruitful.    As to the question of silt in the High Dam reservoir, this  is  a matter currently under study by the Ministry's research  agencies. Experimental projects will also explore uses for that  silt and, once their viability is proved, will be implemented on  a wider scale. It will be four or five years, however, before  these experimental studies are completed.    We have talked a lot about the High Dam, which will ever  remain the center of and the basis for development in Egypt. It  has been proved beyond doubt that its negative impact, decried  by some, has been very limited and is fully under control.  <H5>  Important Issues </H5>   [Bidaywi] How do you assess Libya's Great Manmade River  project and the dam that Sudan is building across the Nile? Do  these two projects threaten Egypt in any way?    [Radi] The Libyan river is a project that the Libyan  Government finds necessary to deal with water shortages and has  therefore allocated for it all the funds it takes, without  regard to economic value. Continued development and life require  a shift of focus from economic feasibility alone.    The Nile Water Organization had previously debated the  proposed al-Hamdab Dam project in the Sudan and concluded that  it would be beneficial for the Sudanese people. The project does  not abridge Egyptian rights as long as the amount of water  utilized for it does not exceed Sudan's assigned water quota  under its 1959 agreement with Egypt.    [Bidaywi] How do you plan to provide water for reclamation  and agrarian development projects through the year 2000? What's  new with the project to collect water at the northern lakes? How  about the reservations expressed in that regard?    [Radi] The expansion and reclamation plan through the year  2000 calls for reclaiming some 1.6 million feddans, which would  require some 8.8 billion cubic meters annually. Irrigation water  will consist of drainage water, mixed with some 5.3 billion  [cubic meters] of fresh water annually.    [Bidaywi] There has been a lot of discussion about the Peace  Canal and its current track. Do you have confidence in that  course and why? Also, how will it be possible to irrigate  al-'Arish and central Sinai lands whose area is said to exceed 5  million feddans? What have you done about well-digging projects  in central Sinai? What have you done with plans to dig wells in  central Sinai and build dams so that the population is not  forced out by the Peace Canal in the north? Is it true what  expert studies have confirmed that the enemy pilfers 50,000  cubic meters daily of Sinai's subterranean water? How can this  be dealt with and utilized to the benefit of Egypt? Do the  Zionists have a role in the system for designing [as published]  al-Salaam Canal and its networks? What exactly is the Ministry's  role in that regard?    [Radi] Plans for Peace Canal to be built east of the [Suez]  Canal were drawn by the Ministry of Water Resources in 1975.  Another study followed in 1978 titled "Horizontal Expansion in  an Area of 2.8 Million Feddans; Planning for the Canal." This is  considered to be the optimum plan and [calls for] terminating  the Canal at al-'Arish City.    As to Ministry plans for wells and holding dams in order to  develop the region, 52 wells are being dug across central Sinai  and will be completed over a five-year period ending in 1997 and  will perennially irrigate some 2,500 feddans. The settlement of  habitants have actually begun in al-Magharah, Jabal-al-Halal,  Umm-al-Shahhan, and 'Arid-al-Naqah. We have also completed the  construction of six underground reservoirs, with a capacity of  600 cubic meters each, in al-Jurafi Valley (al-Kantalah) in  order to store rain and torrent waters for drinking purposes.  Presently under study are 14 dams in al-Jurafi region which  would make it possible to utilize rain and reservoir waters for  irrigating certain areas and for feeding the underground  reservoir instead of being lost to the sea.    About enemy exploitation of subterranean water--studies  proved that there is no extraction across the Sinai border.    [Bidaywi] The International Monetary Fund is maintaining  intense pressure on our country to exact a price for irrigation  water, and the government is using all kinds of pretexts to  delay action on issue. What are your views and why do Ministry  of Irrigation agencies insist on metering the wells being dug on  new lands? Are there plans to charge a price in the future?    [Radi] There are no current or future plans to charge for  water, and this is final. Metering wells is an operational  procedure to control water extraction and avoid depleting the  wells or salinating their content. This in no way means a charge  for the water. Let us emphasize once and for all that irrigation  water will not be subject to a charge of any kind, now or in the  future.    [Bidaywi] How about the development of irrigation networks  in  older lands? What system will be utilized? What will the costs  be and how will they be covered? What progress has been made in  the construction of encased drainage networks and in the  agrarian utilization of encased drainage water and subterranean  water?    [Radi] The main objective of developing irrigation networks  in older lands is to reduce water loss and consequently raise  the efficiency of irrigation systems.    Some 390,000 feddans are undergoing development, and the  project will save some 3 million cubic meters of water by the  end of plan when the development is completed of about 4.7  million feddans in Lower Egypt and al-Fayyum. The cost of  developing the 390,000 feddan area is estimated at about 1,800  Egyptian pounds per feddan.    As to encased drainage networks, the Ministry's plan hopes  to  supply some 5.6 million feddans of farmland with encased  drainage networks at a cost of 875 million Egyptian pounds.  Public drainage facilities will also be deepened and enlarged at  a cost of some 820 million Egyptian pounds.    [Bidaywi] Do any relations exist in any manner between  Ministry of Irrigation agencies and the Zionist entity? If so,  what are they and what are their purpose and objectives? Were  any mutual cooperation projects brought to your attention?    [Radi] The relations between counterparts anywhere in the  world are based on mutual interests and the realization of  assured benefits, provided there are interrelated interests and  also interrelated circumstances.    Egypt's water systems are different from all other such  systems in the region and consequently no areas of potential  cooperation currently exist.    [Bidaywi] Farmers were surprised at your cooperation with  the  Ministry of Agriculture and we were all happy as a result  because of the benefits that would accrue to our beloved Egypt  as it suffers a severe irrigation water shortage that has  already caused great harm to wheat crops in Lower Egypt and  Bani-Suwayf. What is the real cause of the crisis? Has it  dissipated?    [Radi] There were two main reasons for the water crisis that  occurred. The first was that the country's weather was unusually  warm this year and temperatures were higher than their mean. The  second was that the customary amount of rain did not fall on  Lower Egypt this year. Meteorological measures indicate that  rain fell considerably short of its mean. The two factors  together caused a considerable and unusual depletion of farmland  soil moisture, causing farmers to double the amount of  irrigation water used in previous years. Add to this the  psychological state of farmers, which also led then to higher  water consumption.    [Bidaywi] Does the Ministry of Irrigation have any fiscal  problems in funding the al-Salaam Canal project?    [Radi] Funding for all irrigation projects in general is  adequate for the time being and will be increased in the future  as our needs increase. The al-Salaam Canal has no funding  problems.    [Bidaywi] How about Ministry of Irrigation relations with  the  Sudan and with other Arab states?    [Radi] Ministry of Irrigation relations with the brotherly  Sudan have since the dawn of time been fraternal and based on  mutual benefits linked by Nile waters. As to the other Arab  states, technical cooperation exists at the highest levels of  various Ministry departments as do exchanges in the fields of  training and technical expertise.</p>

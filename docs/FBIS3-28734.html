			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 10 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] has prepared a pamphlet in which various examples of  successful business operations by foreign companies in Japan are  introduced. This pamphlet, written in English and aimed at  promoting the advance of foreign companies into the Japanese  market, gives examples of successful operations by 20 foreign  companies, including Bayerishe Motoren Werke AG. [BMW],  Coca-Cola Japan Co., Ltd., Mobil Oil Corporation, and American  Family Corporation.    The brochure, which is entitled: "An Invitation to the  Japanese Market," describes various facts such as changes in  each individual company's sales as well as the factors for their  success. For example, regarding BMW's success, the pamphlet  cites the following factors: 1) Improvement of the  implementation of a sales strategy befitting the market  situation; 2) introduction of products conforming to market  characteristics such as right-hand drive models; and 3)  establishment of a network of dealers specializing in its cars.  In this way, MITI explains that strategies befitting the  Japanese market have resulted in successful operations.    Many factors cited in the pamphlet as accounting for  successful operations seem to be based on the argument  maintained by Tokyo at the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.  The pamphlet appears to have been designed to promote Japanese  refutation of the United States' criticism that "due to the  closed nature of the Japanese market, it is impossible for us to  join in."</p>

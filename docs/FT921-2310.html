			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Coming clean on spreading waste problem - The thinking behind Caird's pioneering environmental audit NEXT MONTH, Waste Management Inc of Chicago, the world's largest refuse collection and treatment group, is to float off part of its international operation on the London market. It is a move eagerly anticipated by UK waste management companies which have had to weather a bruising recession that last year checked the sector's rapid advance. If the US' largest waste company with 20 years' experience, is raising about Pounds 250m to invest in Europe, the argument goes, then the market must again be ripe for growth. At the other end of the scale, a handful of smaller UK groups is preparing for this growth which is likely to spring from a much tighter regulatory environment. The first task of these companies is to clean up the image of an industry that has long been fragmented and poorly regulated in Europe, especially in the UK. One of the stiffest self-imposed tasks has been set by Caird, the waste management group built at breakneck speed since 1987 by ex-stockbroker, Mr Peter Linacre. It has adopted a novel approach to the environmental problems it inherited on some of its 30 sites. It has opened the gates of its landfill sites in the UK to independent environmental auditors and allows public scrutiny of the auditors' unedited reports. 'The environmental audit underwrites our strategy, the way we look forward and the way we view our potential liabilities on our sites,' says Mr John Phillips, Caird's senior operations director. The auditors, Gibbs International, not only monitor gas emissions and leaching, but also inspect Caird's management systems and its methods of mapping where the most hazardous waste, like asbestos, is buried. Now in their third year, the audits have already highlighted some incidents and practices that Caird might have wanted to gloss over but instead has made no effort to suppress. Last June, for example, two hazardous liquids were accidentally mixed at Caird's Minworth special waste disposal site, creating a gas that exploded, killing one worker. Caird was in the process of securing Health &amp; Safety Executive approval for modified operating practices when what Mr Linacre called 'the tragic rogue incident' occurred. The accident will be reported in this year's audit. Last year the audit also highlighted a problem with open trench disposal of waste liquids at the Rotherham landfill site. Mr Geoff Mills, the Gibbs auditor, felt this was potentially dangerous, even though it complied with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution guidelines. Caird now mixes the liquids with solid waste. Caird is not the only waste management company to audit its impact on the environment but it is the only UK company to publish an unedited report. Cleanaway and Shanks &amp; McEwan, for example, use internal environmental advisory boards. The Shanks board includes such luminaries as Lord Cranbrook, chairman of English Nature, and Mr Graham Searle, the founder of Friends of the Earth who is also a Rechem non-executive director. Shanks is also the most advanced of the UK waste companies in accrediting its sites under British Standards Institution 5750, the 'kitemark' which demonstrates good management practice. Leigh Interests is also developing this approach, as is Caird, which has so far accredited three of its 15 working sites. Caird's Minworth plant, however, was not BSI 5750 accredited at the time of last year's accident, an event which in turn delayed application for a BSI audit, Mr Linacre says. By contrast, Biffa  - acquired by Severn Trent last year  - has neither an external audit nor an environmental advisory board. It says internal teams constantly monitor the organisation but that Biffa is too big to allow an external audit. Within the last month, however, it has appointed a manager to seek BSI 5750 accreditation for its sites. With the Environmental Protection Act taking a grip and EC legislation slowly catching up with what has long been in place in the US, the new skills waste management companies are developing are likely to be assets in their own right. Companies will increasingly need to clean up contaminated land and local authorities are likewise going to need help clearing old rubbish sites. In spite of the government's recent decision not to form a register of contaminated land following pressure from the property lobby, waste companies feel it is only a matter of time before such a register is set up, creating further demand for waste management companies. For Caird, this contracting-out of services is likely to have begun to feed through to the bottom line when it reports for 1991 today. Pre-tax profits, estimated by brokers to rise 40 per cent to about Pounds 7m, are likely to include a sharp increase from the special waste division.</p>

Chairman Kpomakpor made the call  yesterday in an inaugural address delivered shortly after his  induction as the chairman of the council. He said the task of  rebuilding Liberia is an enormous one but said that it could be  done once all Liberians are willing and committed in rebuilding  their country. He expressed his deep appreciation to the ECOWAS  [Economic Community of West African States] and the entire  international community for their assistance to Liberia in its  hour of need and pledged the council's commitment to an upright,  (?democratic) government.</p>

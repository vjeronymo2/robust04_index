			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / As they say in Europe: Faraway troubles 'WE'RE not that worried by the war in Bosnia,' said a colleague from Slovenia the other day, 'After all it's 400km away.' A paradoxical rule of life, which journalists refuse to accept, is that the greater the distance, the worse the trouble. There were no anti-Vietnam war demos in southeast Asia in the 1970s because nobody there cared. In suburban Belfast they say that strife-torn Shankill is a world away. On the other hand, anxious parents in London fret for their daughter in Madras when an earthquake hits the Himalayas. Confirmation of this came when I tried to make sense of events in Bosnia by looking at them from just up the road rather than through the British media. Slovenia's leading daily, Delo, shows that familiarity breeds nonchalance: it carries less news about the fighting than does the FT. But nonchalance does not make anything easier to understand, witness the editorial, mainly about Croatia, in Delo headed 'The forgotten war.' The writer, Goran Moravcek, does not like Lord Carrington. He 'very often equates the aggressor with the victim so it is no wonder that Lord Carrington is still pursuing his catastrophic peace policy. The war in the states of former Yugoslavia is very probably seen by major western countries as a local struggle between frenzied tribes who do not know what they are fighting for.' Contradictions emerge, not just over poor Lord Carrington, who is expected to find a peaceful solution when the writer evidently believes there is not one. The south Slav story is hard enough to follow even without well-informed observers like Moravcek. He approvingly quotes the statement of the Croatian leader, Franjo Tudjman, that he is not supplying weapons to Bosnia, while a paragraph later it is said that vast amounts of material are flowing from Croatia to Bosnia. Moravcek also asserts that Croatia is in a position to expel the invaders without outside help, and any external intervention such as a UN peace force would be counter-productive. A central figure is the Bosnian President, Alija Izetbegovic. Moravcek maintains he owes his position to the local Croats - if they had not risen against the Serbs, he would have been out. If being more confused means one is better informed, then I had benefitedf from reading this account. But the Germans would be more helpful, I thought. After all, they know the Balkans better than the rest of us. I relied on Die Welt's Vienna-based expert, Carl Gustaf Strohm. From him I learned that the Bosnian leader has a local critic - 'the President of the Moslem National Council of the Sandjak, Sulejman Ugljanin.' This highlights the hitherto unreported row (yes, another one) between the Moslem population of Bosnia and that of the Moslem enclave in Serbia, the Sandjak. Ugljanin says he admires the will of Izetbegovic to settle things peacefully, 'But it is madness to think that all this can resolved in a peaceful manner.' Maybe the trouble is that 'all this' is a local struggle between frenzied tribes who do not know what they are fighting for. Which brings us naturally to the German strikes. The attitude of the press seemed to harden last week. Writing of the piles of rubbish, Bernhard Blohm, also in Die Welt, said: 'The strike stinks in the truest sense of the word, and ever more those struck against, the citizens of this land, are in a stinking rage over this half-witted strike for a few tenths of one per cent . . .' The Suddeutsche Zeitung compared this strike with that of 18 years ago, but did not share the sense of public 'rage': 'The difference between now and then is that today the public coffers are empty . . . That means that citizens will be hit twice by the current strike . . . the one hand there is the collapse of public services which, so far, has been taken lightly, in an almost sporting manner. But also the citizens as taxpayers will have to pay the costs.' This statement of the obvious appears because it is not obvious in Germany. So once again, those on the spot often find the affair less dramatic than observers from afar who are thrilled to bits by the German strikes. As the Suddeutsche unsportingly points out, there is as yet no chaos in Germany. ***** Tuesday was an interesting day in the Moscow press. Pravda celebrated its 80th anniversary by making one of its occasional appearances in a special four page birthday issue. It described the occasion as a 'joyous red letter day.' And the paper of Moscow city council, Kuranty, wrote about the link between the Los Angeles riots and Russia which lately, in the US, 'has become a major source of irritation. This is probably linked with the recent visit of the deputy prime minister Yegor Gaidar to the USA and the endless debates on the Dollars 24bn aid to be offered to Moscow . . . The 'not guilty' (Rodney King verdict) seemed to be the last straw for the American underclass . . .' James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

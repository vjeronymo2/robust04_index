			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, China, June 23 (AFP)--Disease has broken  out in flood-ravaged southern China where relief workers are  battling to contain rising waters, officials said Thursday.    Cholera, typhoid and dysentry have been reported in the city  of Qingyuan, in northern Guangdong province, which has been  hardest hit by the two weeks of flooding, a provincial  government health official revealed.    The official, who refused to be named, said 15 people in the  city had contracted cholera, while an unspecified number had  been affected by typhoid and dysentery, following the worst  flooding in the area for a century.    Drinking water in the area is contaminated, polluted by the  rotting corpses of drowned livestock, he said. But people are  still using the water for cooking and washing.    But he insisted: "The outbreak is not serious, and we are  monitoring the situation closely and taking additional measures  to combat the spread of any disease."    Another health official said bottled water, food and medical  supplies were being rushed to the area from the provincial  capital, Guangzhou, to alleviate chronic shortages in the  worst-hit areas.    He said a severe shortage of medicine had forced the  authorities to raid warehouses and shops in search of extra  supplies.    Relief workers have called on both the provincial and  central  governments to ship in more emergency supplies to the disaster  area, the official added.    Meanwhile, soldiers continued to reinforce an embankment  built to keep flood waters off the main Guangzhou and Sanshui  railway line, by building a second line of defence at the point  between the two cities where the Beijiang and Sijiang rivers  meet.    Provincial Communist Party secretary Xie Fei visited the  Beijiang embankment where 500,000 soldiers and relief workers  have been battling against the rising flood waters for the past  week. He praised soldiers for their relief work.    Sanshui is a strategic point as if it is overrun by the  water, large parts of the prosperous Pearl River Delta will also  be at risk of inundation.    Rail services on the line were suspended indefinitely on  Wednesday, cutting off a vital supply line to the flooded  region, although roads to the area still remain open.    Xie is expected in another affected city, Shaoquang, on the  northernmost point of the province.    Guangdong governor Zhu Senlen told reporters Wednesday the  death toll in the province stood at 210, but government  officials said Thursday it would rise further as relief workers  reached villages marooned by floodwater.    Zhu said 61 people were reported missing, 4,054 had been  injured, and that direct economic loss in the area was estimated  at more than 10 billion yuan (11.6 million dollars)    In Guangzhou Thursday, the Pearl River continued to swell  and  overflowed its banks in some low-lying areas of the city as  seasonal tides set in, forcing flood waters back into the city.    City officials expected the tide to continue for a further  three days, and are monitoring the level of the murky water in  the provincial capital.    Guests of some hotels in the city are meanwhile being warned  not to drink tap water in case it is contaminated and carrying  disease.</p>

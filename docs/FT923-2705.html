			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling at record ERM low BOTH STERLING and the Italian lira came under intense pressure against the D-Mark yesterday as dealers had second thoughts about the weekend realignment, writes James Blitz. On Monday, foreign exchange dealers had been impressed by the Bundesbank's cut in interest rates and the suggestion that they may have peaked. But there was a conviction yesterday that the 7 per cent devaluation of the lira had been too small and that a No vote in Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht would trigger another cut. The lira took a 2 1/2 per cent fall against the D-Mark, dropping through its central rate and bottoming out at L811. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in London, said: 'Big investment funds were hit by the devaluation and said to their banks: just get me out of Italy at any price.' The lira closed in London at L805.8 per D-Mark, against a previous L793. Its drop was echoed by the Spanish peseta, which fell through the central rate of Pta65 to the D-Mark that the Bank of Spain has been defending aggressively for months. There was similar pressure on the Swedish krona, which ended at SKr3.685 to the D-Mark from a previous close of SKr3.662. Particular uncertainty hovered around sterling, which fell to a new low since Britain joined the ERM in October 1990 of DM2.7800, just 0.2 pfennig above its floor. The pound was initially undermined because the fall of the lira, technically the strongest ERM currency on Monday night, lowered the floor to which the weakest could fall. As so often in recent months, this triggered selling, not by interbank speculators, but from big institutions such as pension funds that are hedging themselves against a possible devaluation. The impact of this hedging may be less detrimental for sterling in the longer term because there is far less hot money invested in the pound than there is in high-yielding currencies such as the lira and peseta. But the announcement that the UK prime minister was cancelling a planned trip to Spain and newspaper reports that the German government had put pressure on Britain to devalue shook sterling further. The Bank of England intervened covertly in the market, with one analyst saying his bank had seen around Pounds 50m bought. The pound closed 3 1/4 pfennigs down at DM2.7800. In marked contrast to the EMS currencies, the dollar fared relatively well against the D-Mark. It was hit at the start of US trading by a fall in US August retail sales of 0.5 per cent, the largest in five months. But July's rise was revised upwards by 0.5 per cent, cancelling this out. The dollar was unchanged on the day in London at DM1.4855. In New York it rose to DM1.4915.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CASTRO'S CUBA  </P> <P> In response to "Castro Embattled," (Opinion, Dec. 9):  </P> <P> Having read both Wayne Smith and Tad Szulc's column ("Reform: Change Is  Overdue"), as well as Jean Edern-Hallier's copies of Fidel Castro's 1962  letters to Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, I'm left wondering how anyone in  his right mind could conceive the notion that Castro -- the man who urged the  Soviets to nuke the United States and was thus willing to annihilate Cuba in a  nuclear confrontation for the sake of Communist dogma -- should be the same man  entrusted to bring about political change on this embattled island.  </P> <P> I also find it amusing how Castro's apologists (Smith and Szulc among them) are  scrambling to cover their tracks by continuing to blame U.S. policy for  Castro's sins and attempting to give this 63-year-old megalomaniac an easy way  out of the socioeconomic abyss he himself dug for the Cuban people.  </P> <P> As Lech Walesa, Poland's newly elected president, might say, the party is over,  boys!  </P> <P> MIGDIA CHINEA-VARELA, Glendale  </P></p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / People: Lancer rides off with new chief executive Lancer Boss Group, the Leighton Buzzard-based lift truck manufacturer, has strengthened its senior management by going outside the industrial truck industry to appoint Ludwig Schneider as its first group chief executive. The appointment is an important move for Lancer Boss, one of Britain's biggest privately-owned manufacturing companies. Lancer Boss is 100 per cent owned by Sir Neville Bowman-Shaw, the chairman, and his brother Trevor Bowman-Shaw, vice-chairman. Schneider's appointment to the company is the clearest sign yet that Boss is preparing the ground for a new generation of management, 35 years after the two brothers founded the company. Sir Neville, who is 63, has previously combined the chairman and chief executive's roles, but will now concentrate on broad strategic issues as chairman. Sir Neville, said the matching of senior management skills to one of the most modern, comprehensive and internationally attractive product ranges would give the group the 'drive and management resource it needs well into the next century.' Boss said Schneider would bring his wide experience in the automotive and related industries in Europe and elsewhere. Schneider is in his mid-40s and holds German and Brazilian nationality. Besides his automotive experience, Schneider has also held senior positions with major consumer goods companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>

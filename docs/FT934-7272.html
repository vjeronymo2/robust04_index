			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Solvency test needs support Sir, The Goode Committee has proposed that in future occupational pension schemes should be required to hold a minimum level of assets to back the pension promise given to members. This has generated considerable discussion among pensions professionals. Some alarmist claims have been made to the effect that the solvency test will cost individual companies tens or hundreds of millions of pounds. As a result, pressure seems to be growing from some quarters for the proposal to be either abandoned or substantially watered down. We believe this would be a pity. A solvency test would do much to improve benefit security in the minority of schemes which are currently not adequately funded. What is needed is a cool-headed analysis of how the proposed test could be fine-tuned so that it brings the recalcitrant schemes into line, without jeopardising the position of the majority of UK pension funds which are already soundly funded and invested. Some alarmist claims appear to be based on the assumption that many large schemes would currently be either barely 100 per cent solvent or indeed below that level. However an analysis of the solvency position of 20 of our largest pension scheme clients showed they are currently all more than 100 per cent solvent on the proposed basis, and the vast majority are comfortably above 120 per cent. This is because, like most UK pension schemes, they are funded on sound bases allowing for projected final pay benefits. The solvency test is designed to ensure that schemes should at all times contain enough assets to meet members' accrued benefits based on current pay. This is a laudable aim. A number of practical issues need to be addressed during the consultation stage, such as the introduction of some smoothing to make the test less susceptible to daily fluctuations in asset values. There also needs to be discussion about the treatment of very large mature schemes and whether remedial action should always involve a three-year funding plan rather than the current proposal for immediate cash injections from the employer when solvency falls below 90 per cent. These are details which can be sorted out and are not reasons for rejecting the substance of what has been proposed.

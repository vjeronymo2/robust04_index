			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Clash on council reforms grows The Local Government Commission yesterday intensified its opposition to the government over local authority reform by proposing that the two-tier system of districts and counties should remain unchanged in Gloucestershire. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, rejected this proposal when it was first made, and said he would prefer to create new unitary all-purpose authorities, which combine the functions of districts and counties. But the commission, chaired by Sir John Banham, said it had found 'no substantial new evidence' to alter its views. It had received only 111 submissions since the second review for the county was announced, 'many of which repeated earlier representations'. Sir John had already retained his proposals to keep the status quo in Durham and Derbyshire, the other two counties where Mr Gummer called for a further review. The commission now seems likely to leave the two-tier status quo intact in most of England. It has attempted to strengthen its opposition to the government's agenda by holding 'advisory referenda' - as Sir John describes them - in which all households in the counties concerned have been sent a leaflet laying out a range of options. Sir John made clear when announcing the first referendum, in Leicestershire, that the commission would not recommend change if it was not strongly supported. 'If there is not a clear message, our duty is to recommend no change,' he said. 'We are not in the business of changing for its own sake - nor is parliament.' Results from Leicestershire, published yesterday, showed that only 2.3 per cent of residents returned leaflets to the commission. Of these, 35 per cent supported the commission's favoured option, which would give unitary status to Leicester and Rutland while leaving two tiers for the rest of the county untouched. At the same time 34 per cent expressed a preference for the status quo, even though this was not an option formally presented by the commission. However, 60 per cent of Rutland residents who responded supported unitary status for their district, which was an independent county until the last local government reorganisation in 1974. Results for 11 more counties will follow in the next few weeks. Under the legislation which set up the review, the government has the power to reject Sir John's recommendations, but it cannot order a change in structure unless it has first been proposed by the commission. This means the commission can block a unitary structure in England, even though such systems have already been imposed on Wales and Scotland. The commission has now made provisional recommendations for all the 39 counties in shire England. In 14 its preferred option is the status quo, while in another 13 it has proposed unitary options while presenting the status quo as an option.</p>

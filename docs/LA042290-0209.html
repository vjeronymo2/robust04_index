Teri Peppi had two hits, drove in two runs and  stole a base for Cal Lutheran (25-10-2, 14-2 in District 3).  </P> <P> Cal Lutheran's Dani Piotrowski stole four bases, bringing her season total to  19.

Right-handed reliever Pat Bennett (5-1) earned the victory, pitching two  innings of no-hit shutout ball.  </P> <P> Gahr 5, Notre Dame 1 -- Although each team had five hits, Gahr utilized its  speed, stealing six bases in the seventh-place game of the Redondo-Palos Verdes  tournament at Notre Dame.  </P> <P> Vinnie Orlando singled, stole second and third and scored Notre Dame's lone run  on an overthrow.  </P> <P> Eric Vellozzi, who struck out four and walked five in 5 2/3 innings, was  charged with the loss.  </P> <P> "Every one of their guys is really looking to run," Notre Dame Coach Bob  Mandeville said. "When we walk a guy or they get a base hit, it's almost like a  double."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Quito, 4 Feb (DPA) -- The general strike against the  economic policy of the liberal government of President Sixto  Duran-Ballen ended at 0600 (1100 GMT) with very modest results  because it was limited and incomplete. Nevertheless, street  demonstrations have continued.    In Quito and Cuenca, the two cities where the strike was  felt  the most, labor and student groups held demonstrations for the  fifth consecutive day today, while Indian leaders reiterated  their call for a peasant uprising next week.    Nevertheless, yesterday's unusual strike, smaller than  previous strikes, evidently weakened the position of the labor,  peasant, teacher, government worker, and student organizations  that called the strike. Signs of division appeared among them  today.    The United Workers Front claimed sole responsibility for the  "complete success" of the strike today, disregarding the  existence of a "national coordinating board" with leaders from  other sectors, sparking angry protests from several  organizations.    This week's demonstrations left an official toll of 21  injured, including 13 policemen, and 163 people arrested. Losses  are estimated at approximately $200 million.    Today, at the end of the strike, the government stated the  increase in fuel prices, which caused the strike and several  days of disturbances, is "completely irreversible" because, as  Energy Minister Francisco Acosta said, "there is a fiscal  deficit that must be covered and this is the way to do it."    Nevertheless, today, the opposition political parties which  control Congress insisted the Constitutional Court should  declare the increase illegal, and they should suspend it. They  also said the energy minister would be called to a political  hearing, and Social Democratic leader Andres Vallejo said "we  will remove him if the government does not repeal the measure."    The fiscal deficit, which reportedly amounts to $600  million,  was caused by the drop in international petroleum prices, which  earns more than 40 percent of Ecuador's revenue.</p>

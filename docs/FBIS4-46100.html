			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Kim Yong-sam Group's Criminal Act of Throwing People Into </F> `Nuclear Hell'"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF]  in a protest message to the traitor Kim Yong-sam May 23 accused  the traitor of his treason in doing harm to the fellow  countrymen and working overtime to develop nuclear weapons and  provoke a nuclear war for destroying the nation in league with  outside forces, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National  Salvation reported.    Referring to the treacheries committed by Kim Yong-sam  against the fellow countrymen, hand in glove with foreign  forces, the message said the present regime had tried hard to  strengthen an "international cooperation system" designed to  stifle the North, where fellow countrymen live, and made the  Korean peninsula a theatre of scramble of nuclear powers by  taking the unfounded "nuclear issue" of the North even to the  United Nations, regarding the "system of cooperation with the  U.S. and Japan" as the main axis.    Criticizing the traitor Kim Yong-sam's perfidious acts of  reversing the North-South joint declaration on denuclearisation  and racing headlong along the road of nuclear armament, the  message said the present "civilian" regime is not only  extracting a large amount of nuclear materials from the Wolsong  heavy water reactor and Taedok multi-purpose research reactor,  plutonium-yielding reactors built by the preceding military  regimes, but also promoting even the development of a fast  breeder reactor, openly crying for "nuclear sovereignty" to  justify its development of nuclear weapons.    Kim Yong-sam's criminal acts to stifle the fellow countrymen  and throw the people into a "nuclear hell" cannot be tolerated  any longer, the message said, and added: In case one of the  nine atomic reactors operating in South Korea and nuclear waste  accumulated there should explode in actuality, they would emit  radioactivity that may cause a hideous pollution more than  10,000 times as great as the total pollution at the time of  A-bomb dropping on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>

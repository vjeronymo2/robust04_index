			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Extra space boosts Storehouse An increase in selling space helped Storehouse, owner of the BHS and Mothercare retail chains, to lift interim sales by 7 per cent and operating profits from retailing by a third. The dividend is raised for the first time in seven years. Mr Keith Edelman, chief executive, said the group had added 80,000 sq ft to its BHS sales space in the half, equivalent to adding three stores. The group was aiming to add at least 20 new BHS stores to the present 125 in the next three years, including nine this financial year. While the spread is national, the group feels there is potential for at least 200. Sales for the 28 weeks to October 15 grew from Pounds 484.9m to Pounds 519.2m. Like-for-like sales were up 5 per cent. At the pre-tax level, profits doubled to Pounds 24.2m, against Pounds 11.6m struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 6.4m. Operating profits from retailing rose from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 22.8m. Earnings per share increased from 1.4p to 3.9p, and the interim dividend is 2.7p (2.5p). The shares closed yesterday down 5p at 214p. The group is cash positive, with Pounds 29.5m. Mr Dick Steele, who joined as finance director from Lloyds Chemists early this year, said it was the first time the group had not had net borrowings in the run up to Christmas. Total costs rose by 5 per cent. 'We could have held the increase below 5 per cent, but we are in an investing phase,' said Mr Steele. The group has reduced the number of its suppliers from 1,000 in 1989 to 300. At BHS, which has benefited from a TV advertising campaign, operating profits rose from Pounds 15.4m to Pounds 18.8m and sales from Pounds 337.2m to Pounds 356.9m. BHS retail margins improved from 4.6 per cent to 5.3 per cent. The Mothercare stores, which are rapidly being converted to a new format, doubled operating profits from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 4.2m on sales ahead from Pounds 140.9m to Pounds 155m. Margins improved from 1.5 per cent to 2.7 per cent. The loss at Blazer was halved from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 200,000 on the back of a sales increase from Pounds 17.1m to Pounds 22.8m. COMMENT The fall in the share price probably reflects disappointment that the results were a little below the market's best hopes. Nevertheless, these are encouraging figures, showing that the recent good housekeeping is starting to pay off. Both BHS and Mothercare have a lot of catching up to do in the retail sector, but the returns are improving and the balance sheet is good. Better buying and better stock management are being coupled with rebuilding the strong Mothercare brand and sorting out a firm identity for the BHS brand as a value-driven family clothing chain. Pencilled in profits of Pounds 105m for 1995-96 put the group on a prospective multiple of 12.5 - not that demanding for a retailer with the rare combination of both growth and recovery prospects.</p>

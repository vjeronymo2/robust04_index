Kiselev, </F> SIBRAE, RNTs [expansions not given] Kurchatov Institute]    [Abstract] Bending of reinforcing cables is found to have a  substantial effect on the stressing of the jacket in the driving  zone, and this must be considered in the design of this zone.  Particular attention must be focused on sections where  stretching stresses caused by bending are not compensated.  Analysis of the stressing of the driving zone must also consider  the effect of all bent reinforcement elements using programs  that consider their actual trajectories and friction. Figures 3.  &lt;graphic&gt;     &lt;capt&gt; Figure 1. Graph of radial  stresses in the aperture zone due to prestressed curvilinear  reinforcement cables.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: solid line, experimental data;  dash line, finite elements calculation; dot-dash line, Melan  solution calculation.&lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;graphic&gt;     &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Graph of circular stresses in the aperture  zone due to prestressed curvilinear reinforcement cables.  &lt;annot&gt; Key as in Fig. 1.&lt;/graphic&gt;   &lt;graphic&gt;     &lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Graph of circular stresses obtained using  the Aksikon-2 program.  &lt;annot&gt; Key: solid line, not considering  friction; dash line, considering friction, m = 0.1; dot-dash  line, the same with m = 0.2.&lt;/graphic&gt;</p>

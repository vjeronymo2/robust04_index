			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH IS SLAIN NEAR HOME, 4 WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING  </P> <P> A 16-year-old boy was killed near his home and four youths were wounded in a  drive-by shooting in Paramount late Monday, authorities said.  </P> <P> The apparently gang-related shooting occurred in the 13900 block of Downey  Avenue at about 8:20 p.m., Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said.  Investigators at the scene said shots were fired from a small red sports car.  </P> <P> "I heard about 10 shots as I was driving up," said Jim Hughes, a drug counselor  at a Fountain Valley hospital who was driving by on his way home at the time of  the shooting. "I saw two guys drop right to the road.  </P> <P> "This is what happens when you give these kids automatics," Hughes said. "It  all starts with drugs."  </P> <P> John Adrian Borrego was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting, his body  lying in the gutter three doors from his home. About a dozen family members  gathered around the body as a priest administered last rites, illuminated by  the flood lights of television news cameras.  </P> <P> "This shooting . . . has been going on for about two weeks," said a teen-age  boy at the scene who did not wish to be identified.  </P> <P> He said he was Borrego's friend and that all of the victims were members of  "Dogpatch" a local gang.  </P> <P> Four other victims were taken to area hospitals.  </P> <P> A 14-year-old boy was in very critical condition at Charter Suburban Hospital  in Paramount with a gunshot wound to the head and four wounds to the leg and  back.  </P> <P> Three other teen-agers were hospitalized with less severe wounds.  </P></p>

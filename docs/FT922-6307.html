			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Economy-watchers turn their attention to a week of data AFTER last week, when hopes for an interest rate cut were apparently dashed on the rocks of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, trading in the US Treasury markets should settle down to a less stressful pattern over the next four days. Nevertheless, the economic calendar this week provides plenty for investors and economy-watchers to chew on. On Tuesday, April existing home sales data are released. Salomon Brothers in New York is forecasting a modest decline because of the cold weather during the month and the effect of the back-up in mortgage rates since mid-January. On the same day, the Conference Board publishes its closely followed Consumer Confidence Index for May, and the consensus on Wall Street is that the index will rise to its highest level since late last year. Wednesday kicks off with durable goods orders for April, and a fourth consecutive monthly increase in orders is expected. While Thursday is full of secondary data, the most important news of the week arrives on Friday in the shape of the revised (real) first quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures. Economists now expect first quarter GDP to show an increase of 3 per cent. The solid output growth in the first quarter which should be confirmed by Friday's data probably played an important part in persuading the Fed last week not to cut interest rates. At the FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Fed's policy-makers were reported by inside sources to have voted to keep monetary policy unchanged and to drop their bias toward easing until the next scheduled meeting in late June. The immediate reaction of the markets to the news was to sell Treasuries, which had been bid up over a period of several days in anticipation of an interest rate cut by a Fed supposedly worried about the sluggishness of the economic recovery, and by weakness in money supply and labour market conditions in particular. The market, however, may have overdone its reaction to the FOMC's reported move from a bias toward easing to what is known as a 'symmetric' policy guideline (neither biased toward easing or tightening). As Mr Richard Trainer, chief economist at the Bank of Tokyo in New York points out in his most recent circular on Fedspeak, the Fed has a reputation for often doing exactly what it says it is not likely to do. He backs up this view with an examination of Fed actions between the end of March 1991 and the following August. During that time, policy was also symmetric. Yet over the five-month period the Fed reacted to evidence of economic weakness by cutting the discount rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent and the Fed funds rate target by 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent. Mr Trainer's conclusion is simple: 'policy symmetry does not preclude the Fed from easing policy'. In other words, do not rule out the possibility of another interest rate cut just yet. The market may have to wait for an easing until June 5, when the Employment Report for May is published.</p>

Petrella emphasized this statement by reminding the  journalist that the United Nations has expressly banned the sale  of arms to the currently conflict-torn former Yugoslavia.    According to the DYN news agency, the United Nations  "thwarted a deal through which Argentina would sell arms to  Liberia, although the shipment's final destination was to be one  of the countries of the former Yugoslavia."    The DYN report added: "According to information on hand, the  Foreign Ministry cleared the initial request and granted the  appropriate approval for the deal. The Defense Ministry is no  doubt involved as well."    According to DYN: "Official sources acknowledged only that  Liberia was the intended destination of the arms and that the  United Nations objected to the sale; however, the request for  information that Radical Civic Union legislators submitted to  Congress made it obvious that the deal had aroused strong  suspicions."    Argentine Defense Minister Oscar Camilion told DYN it is  impossible to sell arms to the former Yugoslavia because there  is a UN embargo on such deals.</p>

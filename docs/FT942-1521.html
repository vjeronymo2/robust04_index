			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Clinton drops threat of N Korea sanctions: US agrees to talks after assurance on N-programme President Bill Clinton yesterday announced that the US had agreed to high-level talks with North Korea in Geneva next month, after receiving assurances that Pyongyang would halt its nuclear programme and allow international inspectors to monitor the freeze. The announcement followed days of diplomatic uncertainty as the US sought to verify that the offer relayed by former US president Jimmy Carter last week from North Korean President Kim Il-sung met the US's conditions. 'Their definition of freeze was the same as ours,' Mr Clinton said. North Korea had confirmed that it would not attempt to reload its nuclear reactor nor to reprocess any of the spent nuclear fuel it has unloaded in recent weeks, Mr Clinton said. It would also allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to keep inspectors in the country to verify that the promised freeze was in fact being carried out. The US, meanwhile, will suspend its efforts to persuade the United Nations Security Council to vote for economic sanctions against North Korea. Mr Clinton said the moves were 'not a solution to the problem but they do mark a new opportunity to find a solution'. He hinted at the possibility of economic assistance and normal diplomatic relations as the US sought 'to give North Korea a way of moving with dignity into the international community'. In the days since Mr Carter returned from Pyongyang, US policy has appeared to be in some disarray. While the White House cautiously sought formal confirmation from North Korea through the slow channels of diplomatic communication at the UN, the former president appeared to undercut his successor's position by announcing on television that the crisis was over and that the US had abandoned its sanctions drive. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said that the apparent confusion had been exaggerated. 'I don't see any incoherence about this. We cannot allow North Korea to manufacture nuclear weapons; that is an absolute. But they don't have to stop by teatime today,' he said during a visit to Washington yesterday. In Seoul earlier yesterday, South Korean officials expressed optimism that an unprecedented summit meeting with North Korea would take place, after Pyongyang agreed to discuss arrangements.

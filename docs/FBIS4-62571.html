			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "New Plan for Territorial Division </F> of Bosnia: 51-49. Will Serbs and Muslims Accept Initiative by  Russia, United States, and European Union?"]    [Text] The Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of  Russia, the United States, and five European Union [EU]  countries at the end of last week enabled the "great powers" to  overcome for the first time in a long time the differences in  their approaches to the Balkan crisis and come up with a joint  initiative on the settlement on the conflict in Bosnia.    The Russian and West European diplomats' main achievement  was  the change in Washington's stance: Overcoming their original  skepticism, the Americans accepted the initiative proposed by  the EU and backed by Moscow on the division of Bosnia and  Herzegovina. In accordance with it, 49 percent of the republic's  territory will pass to the Serbs and 51 percent to the Muslims  and Croats.    The most difficult question now is how to implement the  plan.  Both the Serbs and the Bosnian Government have their own views  of the territorial rearrangement of the republic, and neither  side is in a hurry to support the "51-49 option." The leaders  of the Muslim-Croat federation are insisting on the transfer of  58 percent of the territory to them. As for the Serbs, at  present they control more than 70 percent of Bosnia and,  naturally, they do not have a burning desire to return the  captured territory to their enemies.    Will Moscow, Washington, and the EU be able to make both  sides consider their opinion? There will be no big problem with  the Muslims and Croats, apparently. In claiming 58 percent of  the teritory they were presumably well aware that this proposal  would not be seriously considered either by the Serbs or by the  international mediators. The Bosnian Government is following  the classic rules of haggling: First name an unacceptable  price, and then gradually lower it.    Unlike their enemies, the Serbs will have to make not  imaginary but very real concessions and surrender more than 20  percent of the territory they control. According to the Geneva  meeting participants' plan, the compensation for this would be  the gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. The  question is: Will this compensation be sufficient from the  Serbs' viewpoint. For Slobodan Milosevic and the other Belgrade  leaders the prospect of emerging from isolation and averting the  looming economic catastrophe is certainly attractive. But many  Bosnian Serb leaders are radically inclined: Radovan Karadzic's  latest pronouncements about the unacceptability of significant  territorial concessions do not breed optimism.    The Geneva talks did not clear up what is perhaps the most  delicate aspect: Will the "great powers'" diplomatic initiative  be backed up by military arguments in the event of either side's  refusing to implement it.    The United States, Russia, and the European Union evidently  have yet to agree on the severity of their present and future  joint actions. If they do not do so, the "51-49" option could  be just an empty declaration, as has happened with innumerable  peace plans put forward by the United Nations, the CSCE, and  international mediators in the two years of the Bosnian war.</p>

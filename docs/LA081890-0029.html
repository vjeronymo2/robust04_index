			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY IS ONE THING, BUT GIVE FANS SOME GOLF  </P> <P> Trying to watch golf on ABC during the PGA was futile.  </P> <P> The most important aspect of this tournament to ABC was obviously the  controversy about blacks not belonging to country clubs. I have never been so  sick of a subject. They beat it to death Friday night instead of showing the  tournament; they beat it to death Saturday and Sunday. It would be nice to be  able to watch some of the tournament.  </P> <P> JAMES ASHBY  </P> <P> Palos Verdes Estates  </P></p>

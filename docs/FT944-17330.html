			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets: Profit warning hits dealers where it hurts - London People in the City of London are much like those anywhere else: bad news seems worse the nearer to home it strikes. This was apparent in the reaction to developments which brought the recent weakness of the bond and equity markets all too close to their trading screens. The FT-SE 100 fell 42.8 points on Monday after SG Warburg, the UK's largest investment bank, warned that its interim profits would be more than halved because of a plunge in profits from trading in bonds, equities and derivatives. The next day another rival merchant bank, Hambros, said it had also suffered losses on the bond market and would make only about half of last year's interim profits. Traders were suddenly faced with the worrying thought that highly-paid jobs might be at risk in the Square Mile, which last year enjoyed a bonanza from the surging equity market. There appears to be little immediate prospect of widespread lay-offs, but bonuses seem certain to be a pale shadow of the previous year's bounty. One merchant banker commented: 'After the party of '93, comes the hangover.' And indeed the chart shows that the merchant banks sector has outperformed the market in the past two years, even after this week's downward correction. However, it is easier to take such a philosophical stance if - like the banker in question - one is not too directly exposed to the bond and equity markets. Warburg has followed the example of the big US investment banks, which offer clients trading services as well as fee-based advice. These US banks have also recently suffered big losses on the trading side, and greater volatility in profits seems an inevitable consequence of adopting such a strategy. There remains plenty of corporate activity around - not least new issues. KPMG Peat Marwick forecast that this year was still set to break records for flotations, in spite of issues being pulled and a disturbing level of profit warnings from recent candidates. So far this year, KPMG estimates that a total of Pounds 7.8bn has been raised from 182 new issues, and it expects that a pick-up in activity before the November budget will put the final tally comfortably ahead of the 1986 record of Pounds 9bn. KPMG said investors who had had their fingers burnt would be particularly wary and some companies would face an uphill struggle to convince investors that they were of a suitable size and quality to join the main stock market. One company that will easily overcome the scale barrier is British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television company which confirmed that it plans to stage a share issue on the London and New York markets. The issue, provisionally programmed to take place before Christmas, is expected to involve the sale of up to Pounds 1bn of new BSkyB shares, or 20 per cent of its enlarged equity, valuing the company at just under Pounds 5bn. Meanwhile, the equity market's movements continued to be dominated by bonds. As well as the Warburg announcement, Monday's plunge was attributable to weakness in gilts after worryingly high UK money supply figures and the increased concern over inflationary pressures in the US. An unconvincing 18-point rally in thin trading on Tuesday was followed by a 45.5-point downward lurch on Wednesday, when strong growth in US factory orders heightened fears that US interest rates would have to rise soon. The FT-SE did regain 28 points on Thursday, mainly because a dip in UK manufacturing output in August suggested there was less pressure to raise to raise UK interest rates again. Yet traders are fixated by Wall Street. Only when yesterday's US payroll and unemployment data were received without the feared rise in the Federal Reserve's interest rate did the market relax, to close 14 points higher  - down 27.6 on the week. The uncertain outlook is best illustrated by the huge range of year-end forecasts for the FT-SE. James Capel, the UK's biggest broker, downgraded its target to 2,840, but some brave souls are still sticking by 3,600. Robin Aspinall, Panmure Gordon's bearish analyst, started the week boasting that his year-end forecast of 2,800 was the only one in the City not to need changing this year, but after Wednesday's rout was reminding institutions of his 'ultimate target' of 2,200. Aspinall points to the UK car sales: 'While consumers have stopped buying cars (personal purchases were 4.5 per cent lower in September than a year earlier), companies are still buying enough for their fleets to boost total sales by 6.5 per cent. Companies' finances are in better shape than consumers', but that cannot last for long without the consumers' help. We are heading for a consumer-led recession.' J. Sainsbury, the UK's largest grocery retailer, would not subscribe to such a gloomy conclusion but nevertheless continued its diversification away from the UK food retailing market by taking a Pounds 205m stake in Giant Food, a Washington DC-based supermarket chain. The deal is Sainsbury's second move into the US, after taking control of the Shaw's supermarket chain in the north-eastern US in 1987. It gives the UK retailer a strong position on the eastern seaboard. A City crash would also be bad news for Vendome, the luxury goods group, which this week paid an undisclosed sum for James Purdey &amp; Sons, Britain's most famous sporting gunmaker. In spite of prices which range up to Pounds 40,000, there is an 18-month waiting list for the shotguns, which Purdey has been making for 200 years at its premises in London's Picaddilly. Given the febrile state of the financial markets, perhaps even unemployed stockbrokers would prefer to blow some of their pay-off on blasting at birds . . .</p>

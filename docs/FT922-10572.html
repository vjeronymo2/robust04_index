			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Midland softens support for Hongkong takeover MIDLAND BANK softened its support for Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's Pounds 3.3bn takeover bid yesterday in the wake of Lloyds' Pounds 3.6bn offer proposal. As the battle for control of Midland gained momentum, it also emerged that National Australia Bank (NAB), which owns the Yorkshire and Clydesdale banks, has told Lloyds it would be interested in buying several hundred of Lloyds' and Midland's branches if Lloyds succeeded in buying Midland. Lloyds was encouraged by the first official announcement from Midland since it made its offer proposal. Midland's board said it 'intends . . . to recommend Hongkong Bank's offer, provided this would not conflict with the ability of Midland shareholders to consider a firm offer from Lloyds which secured demonstrably greater value for their shares'. Under the terms of the takeover code, this does not constitute a firm recommendation in favour of Hongkong Bank's bid. A Midland director said: 'The recommendation is slightly on the shelf.' The Midland statement was approved by the board after a two-hour meeting with the bank's advisers on Tuesday evening. Directors felt they could not dismiss Lloyds' offer because it was proposing to offer more than Hongkong Bank. Mr Brian Pearse, Midland's chief executive, said the board had to take into account the interests of the bank's shareholders. But he pointed out that Lloyds had not made a formal bid and would do so only if it was not obstructed by the EC and UK competition authorities. Meanwhile, it also emerged that NAB's merchant bank adviser, Lazard Brothers, has told Lloyds' chief executive, Mr Brian Pitman, that NAB would be interested in buying Midland and Lloyds branches. NAB has already acquired several hundred branches from Midland, having bought Midland's Clydesdale and northern subsidiaries in 1987. Lloyds is considering the NAB approach, but is unlikely to begin detailed negotiations for several weeks. It has been considering whether it would avoid having its proposal to acquire Midland being being referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, the UK competition authority, if it were to agree to sell branches. Lloyds believes an MMC reference is probably inevitable and is concentrating on persuading the Department of Trade and Industry to also refer Hongkong Bank's bid to the MMC. However, Lloyds may try to do a deal with NAB or another bank at a later stage, during the MMC investigation, to persuade the MMC not to block a Midland takeover. In a separate development, it emerged that there is considerable legal uncertainty over a key article in the EC Merger Regulation, which will determine whether Hongkong Bank's bid falls under the jurisdiction of UK competition authorities or the EC authority. The article refers to the location of bank assets. EC regulations could halt Lloyds bid, Page 24 Sale of many branches likely to be difficult, Page 24 London stocks, Page 44</p>

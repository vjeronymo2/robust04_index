			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: BPM plunges after provisions Banca Popolare di Milano, one of Italy's larger retail banks, yesterday blamed past management errors for exposing the bank to heavily indebted Italian companies such as Ferruzzi, the large holding company. Mr Francesco Cesarini, chairman since the spring, said the bank had to provide for bad credit risks in its first-half accounts, plunging BPM into a loss of L352bn (Dollars 220m), against profits of L17.7bn in the equivalent period. About L429bn was provided against bad loans, compared with L152bn in the first half of 1993, but Mr Cesarini said this would not affect the solidity of the bank, or its ability to compete in the overcrowded Italian market. BPM, which has paid heavily in the last few years following the collapse of its leasing operations, will concentrate on providing service to 'economic players of small dimensions,' Mr Cesarini said. In 1993, BPM had to renounce about L63bn of credits to Ferruzzi-Montedison, the industrial group which came close to collapse last year, but Mr Cesarini said the bank had also suffered from its exposure to other indebted Italian companies. Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, another of Italy's biggest banks, announced first-half results yesterday which were affected by the less favourable market conditions. Profits reached L90.3bn for the first half, up only L2bn on the equivalent period, after tax, writedowns, depreciation and provisions of L323bn against L242bn.</p>

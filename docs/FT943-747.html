			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / World Trade News: KLM seeks boost in India KLM Royal Dutch Airlines yesterday said it had applied for approval to start flights to Madras and hoped to launch services from next spring as part of its attempt to open up a southern India gateway and expand services to existing destinations. At present KLM flies four times a week to Delhi, three times to Bombay and once to Calcutta. KLM needs extra capacity as load factors have been at 95 per cent for nine months of the year on Indian routes. In the cargo market, KLM is seeking to build up freighter flights from Dubai to Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore and Madras.</p>

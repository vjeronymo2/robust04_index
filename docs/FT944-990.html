			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / International Company News: Airgas makes offer for industrial gas unit Airgas, a Delaware-based gas distribution company, has made an unsolicited offer for the industrial gas business of CBI Industries, valuing the unit at Dollars 680m, writes Richard Waters. Airgas also offered to take on all of CBI's debt, which amounts to a further Dollars 770m. CBI dismissed the offer as 'inadequate' and said it had no intention of selling the unit, which raised the prospect of a bidding war for the whole company and pushed up its shares when the offer emerged on Tuesday. The gas unit, Liquid Carbonic, has a strong presence in the international carbon dioxide business, making it potentially attractive to other bidders. CBI, which bought Liquid Carbonic in 1984, is also involved in construction and engineering. These businesses have been depressed in the face of weak capital investment by many US companies, leading to disappointing earnings so far this year. The gas business accounted for 44 per cent of the group's Dollars 1.7bn sales last year.</p>

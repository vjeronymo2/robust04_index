			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAY HIKE: AN UPSIDE-DOWN WALK NEAR LAKE ARROWHEAD  </P> <P> Little Bear Valley was its name before the dam was built in the 1890s. Then it  was Little Bear Lake until the 1920s when Los Angeles investors bought it and  changed the name to Lake Arrowhead.  </P> <P> By whatever name, the Lake Arrowhead country is the prettiest alpine area in  the San Bernardino Mountains. And the nicest place for a stroll when you're  visiting Arrowhead is the tranquil canyon cut by Little Bear Creek. Shaded by  sugar pines and Jeffrey pines, oaks, sycamores and incense cedars, the canyon  is a tranquil, woodsy retreat from metropolitan life.  </P> <P> The waters of Little Bear Creek feed Lake Arrowhead. The creek is actually a  tributary of Deep Creek, a significant San Bernardino Mountains watercourse and  itself a tributary of the Mojave River.  </P> <P> North Shore Trail is the name of the pathway that follows Little Bear Creek.  The trail name is a bit misleading. Although the path begins above the  northeast shore of Lake Arrowhead, it goes nowhere near the lake and, in fact,  does not even offer a view of the lake.  </P> <P> This is an easy hike, suitable for the whole family, but keep in mind that it's  an upside-down walk; the elevation gain occurs on the way back. Pace yourself  accordingly.  </P> <P> Directions to trailhead: From Interstate 10 in San Bernardino, take the  Waterman Avenue/Highway 18 exit and wind 20 miles north into the San Bernardino  Mountains. When California 18 junctions with California 173, take the latter  highway and proceed 3 1/2 miles to Hospital Road and turn right.  </P> <P> Almost immediately, you'll spot the entrance to North Shore Public Campground,  where the trailhead is. The Forest Service campground is open weekends, from 2  p.m. Friday to 2 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Later in the year, when the snow sticks, the Forest Service closes the  campground until spring. However, day hikers may park in the upper lot at  Mountains Community Hospital and walk the short distance into the campground.  There is a Forest Service day-use fee.  </P> <P> The trailhead is just off the campground road between Campsites 10 and 11.  </P> <P> The Hike: Head downslope, where you'll briefly sight the untidy remnants of a  logging operation, then continue straight at an unsigned four-way junction and  drop to a dirt road. On the other side of the road you'll join signed Trail  3W12, pass by a seasonal creek and descend into the handsome canyon of Little  Bear Creek.  </P> <P> Shading the trail are some magnificent specimens of Jeffrey pine and incense  cedar. Autumn leaves -- mostly from the stately sycamores -- carpet the trail.  Bracken ferns line the trickling creek. Keep an eye out for the wild turkeys  that patrol the canyon.  </P> <P> Enjoy the sounds of the wind blowing through the pines, the murmuring creek. Of  course, Norman-architecture Arrowhead Village and a shopping mall are just over  the next ridge, but the resort might as well be a hundred miles away.  </P> <P> North Shore Trail sticks to the north bank of Little Bear Creek. (Should we  rename the path North Bank Trail?) The trail leaves the creek, humps over a  knoll, then rejoins it after a quarter mile.  </P> <P> Hang out along one of the bends in the creek before returning the way you came.  If you want to walk every last foot of North Shore Trail, continue to a creek  crossing, boulder-hop over Little Bear Creek and soon come to the trail's  inglorious end at Hook Creek Road and an area popular with three-wheeler  off-highway vehicles.  </P> <P> North Shore Trail  </P> <P>  North Shore Public Campground to Little Bear Creek  </P> <P>  5 miles round trip; 600-foot elevation gain  </P></p>

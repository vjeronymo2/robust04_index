			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] </F>   [Text] Vladikavkaz, 13 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- Issues relating  to settling relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia and  the return of refugees to their previous residence were  discussed at a meeting in Vladikavkaz today between Akhsarbek  Galazov, president of North Ossetia, and Shmidt Dzoblayev,  secretary general of the Assembly of Democratic Forces of the  Northern Caucasus. The latter briefed Akhsarbek Galazov on his  meeting in Nazran today with Ruslan Aushev, president of the  Ingush republic, during which the issue of seeking a path to  peace and accord in the region was discussed.    The leader of the movement proposed that a conference of the  elders and religious authorities of the region on reconciliation  should be held soon within the framework of stabilizing the  situation in the conflict zone with the mediation of the  Assembly of Democratic Forces of the Northern Caucasus. In his  opinion, this would make it possible to create real  prerequisites for implementing the 30th May decree of the  Russian president "On Introducing a State of Emergency on Part  of the Territories of the Republic of North Ossetia and the  Ingush Republic."    The Assembly's secretary general also discussed with  Akhsarbek Galazov the issue of relations with the Chechen  republic, of involving its leader in the work of the commission  to regulate Ossetia-Ingush relations and also of his plans  connected with the forthcoming meeting with Dzhokhar Dudayev,  leader of Chechnya.    Shmidt Dzoblayev said that Groznyy intends to examine  relations between Chechnya and Russia, relating to regulating  talks with its leadership and to the role of Chechnya in  establishing law and order, peace, and calm in the region.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Kuwait tells banks to lift capital base KUWAIT said yesterday its banks must either merge or raise their capital to internationally required levels after the government clears them of about Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11bn) worth of bad debts, Reuter reports from Kuwait. 'Although the solution to the problem of difficult debts will ease burdens. . . this on its own will not be sufficient to achieve reform in the banking and financial system,' said Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Saud al-Sabah, the central bank governor. 'Merging appears to be necessary. . . the units that do not favour merging will only have the option of increasing their capital base to required levels in conformity to international requirements,' the Kuwaiti News Agency quoted him as saying. Economists in the emirate said the step would force its eight commercial banks to merge because most of them were undercapitalised before Iraq's invasion on August 2 1990. Sheikh Salem did not say what capital adequacy requirements Kuwait would set for its banks. But economists believe Kuwait and its partners in the six-nation Gulf Co-operation Council are likely to adopt the 8 per cent capital-to-assets ratio required by the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Since US-led forces liberated it from Iraqi occupation last February, Kuwait has frequently said it would merge its banks into four bigger institutions to help them operate profitably. The scheme has been held up because of delays in implementing a government plan to buy their debts by issuing bonds with a maximum 20-year maturity.</p>

Tomanek: "Three Research Institutes and Six </F> Enterprises Have Been Privatized"]    [Excerpts] Bratislava--Following yesterday's 86th Session  of the Slovak Government, there can be no doubt that  privatization is picking up pace. The Cabinet yesterday  discussed and approved nine privatization projects. A report on  establishing a City University in Kralovsky Chlmec and a draft  law on certain measures concerning state supervision of security  work were withdrawn from the agenda. Material on the Foundation  for the Development of the Regions in the Slovak Republic  suffered the same fate. Moreover, three documents--a draft law  that alters and supplements the law on income tax and two draft  privatization projects--came onto the agenda.  <H5>  Approved </H5>   The following documents were among those approved at  yesterday's government session: a draft law on conducting  business; a report on the fulfillment of the Slovak Government's  policy in the struggle against crime, including its prevention;  a report on the activity of the joint Slovak-Czech Border  Commission; a proposal on the appointment of the members of the  Slovak Forestry Commission Preparatory Committee; and an  analysis of the current situation with regard to the upbringing  and education of physically handicapped children and young  people.    The government also approved other important materials  yesterday, including an addendum to the proposal on providing  guarantees from the state budget for credit from a foreign bank  for the North Slovak Pulp and Paper Mills, a report on the  disposal of radioactive waste, and a draft agreement between the  Slovak Government and the Government of the Kingdom of Denmark  on succession to bilateral agreements. The government also  approved a proposal to conclude an agreement between the Slovak  Government and the Russian Federation Government on cooperation  in culture, education, and science.  <H5>  Into Private Hands </H5>   The government approved nine privatization projects  yesterday: the Trnava Nuclear Power Plants Research Institute;  DATA-STAV Presov; the Bratislava Research Institute for  Engineering Projects; Stavex Humenne; CHEMVAP Kosice, an  enterprise providing services for cement plants and lime works;  the Bratislava Institute for the Economy and Organization of the  Construction Industry; the Lucenec Civil Engineering Works; the  Humenne Meat Industry plant; and Vino Kosice. [passage omitted]  <H5>  The Popularity Stakes </H5>   Slovak Statistical Office Chairman R. Krc gave a report on  the trends in support for politicians and parties. At the  beginning of February, respondents placed most trust in Prime  Minister Meciar. President M. Kovac came next. The Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia was the most popular party. On the other  hand, the Democratic Party-Conservative Democratic Party and the  Social Democratic Party of Slovakia were among the parties whose  support declined to below 2.0 percent. Surprisingly, the number  of citizens who reject the screening law has declined.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / People: Daly grasps competitive nettle Alec Daly was a founding member of the Confederation of British Industry's National Manufacturing Council so it is only fitting that he should now be asked to run it, following the departure of Mark Radcliffe. Daly, who is 58, will take over responsibility for the council in September on his appointment as the CBI's deputy-director general. A main board director of GKN from 1986, his career at the sharp end of manufacturing industry includes a spell with International Computers in the 1960s and 14 years with Ford, where he ended up as head of truck manufacturing operations in the UK and on the continent. He joined GKN in 1978 as chairman of GKN Sankey and leaves as managing director of GKN's Engineered and Agricultural Products business. Daly confesses to having harboured early reservations about the value of a body formed to help put some competitive bite into British manufacturing but says he has been enormously encouraged both by the enthusiasm of council members and by the government's new commitment to the competitiveness issue. 'The political climate is right and there is an absolute need for British companies to grasp the nettle and establish the highest standards so that they can compete with the world's best. I hope to help ensure the message is taken on board and turned into success.'</p>

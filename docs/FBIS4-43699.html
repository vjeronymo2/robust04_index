			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Michele Salvati: "Weight of Roots"] </F>   [Text] The major newspapers and principal political forces  have responded to Achille Occhetto's resignation with respect  and approval: approval because it is right for the leader of a  defeated party to resign; approval because Occhetto's  resignation could rouse the opposition, which in the  two-and-a-half months since the 27-28 March elections has seemed  either dazed or resigned, disorganized or excessive in its  reactions.    The country needs a good opposition, if it refuses to be  satisfied with that conducted by [League Secretary] Bossi within  the government. It needs one both because we have a government  composed of very diversified forces that has to carry out some  enormously difficult tasks: This also makes the opposition's  task more difficult, since it will have to wisely alternate  stances of strict monitoring and counteraction with open  cooperation. It also needs one because we have two oppositions  now, one of which has by no means accepted the realignment of  our political life between two poles. Therefore the part of the  opposition that has accepted (and, indeed, stimulated) this  realignment bears an even greater mission. Will Occhetto's  resignation succeed in stimulating within the PDS [Democratic  Party of the Left], and the Left as a whole, a response equal to  this mission?    Those who, despite the evidence of the facts, still hope for  an evolution of our political system toward a normal and  civilized democracy of rotation can now only hope for this.  However, there are two major difficulties. The first concerns  the opposition that refuses to accept bipolarism -- the PPI  [Italian Popular Party] and the Pact.    The PDS and the left-wing forces can do little about them,  since the responsibility and the decisions are not theirs. But  this little is important: They can adopt a profile and a  strategy which (while safeguarding a democratic left-wing  identity and, indeed, making it clearer) will make an alliance  of the center and left- wing forces desirable and beneficial.    This leads us to the second difficulty, the internal one  within the PDS. Leaving aside wrenches and splits, the PDS as a  whole has not changed much, either with regard to the people  that lead it or with regard to its organizational structure.  And these two things go hand in hand, since the leaders are the  expression of this organizational structure; it is they, with  the federation and section secretaries, with officials,  activists, and party members, who maintain the relations of  acquaintance, trust, and mutual loyalty. But this weighty  organization, the fact that it is part of a long history,  constitute both an asset and a drawback. They are an asset  inasmuch as they grant the PDS social and regional roots that  not even the Berlusconi hurricane has managed to dismantle, just  as Craxi before him failed to do so. And now, as almost the  whole of the Left of noncommunist origins has disappeared, these  roots are all the more valuable. They are a drawback inasmuch  as they make the PDS very cumbersome in its movements -- a party  which, even more than in its adversaries' eyes, is (formerly)  communist in the minds of its members. Being aware of this,  Occhetto tried to impart a greater element of leadership to his  secretaryship: The rejection of this approach was due much more  to the nature of the party (which is neither Forza Italia nor  Craxi's Italian Socialist Party: superlight parties) than to  any personal shortcomings on his part.    This is why we must not expect too much from the debate that  will begin and from whichever leader is elected. In its own  way, the PDS is too "democratic," too responsible to the  opinions and feelings of its activists and members to be able to  introduce any drastic innovations. And in any case, why should  it do so? Would it not thus risk losing a precious heritage?  So it is entirely unrealistic to expect that the PDS could  elect as its secretary a liberal such as [Venice Mayor] Cacciari  or others like him, virtually unknown to the party structure.  Rather, it is permissible to expect a step forward in the right  direction. First, an in-depth debate on party strategy, on the  election defeat, and on the tasks that the PDS must perform as  an opposition force. Next, the choice of a leader who is both  accepted by the organization and the members but nevertheless as  little imbued with communist tradition as possible, and as open  as possible to modern cultural tendencies, and who is capable of  thoroughly renovating the organizational structure that is now  paralyzing the party.    There are not many candidates. And there is a strong fear  that we will miss the innovative capacity and the courage of  Occhetto, with all his defects and weaknesses.</p>

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Tax): Incentives aim to boost private investment  -Venture capital A new investment vehicle designed to encourage up to Pounds 2.5bn of private investment in unquoted companies was greeted with enthusiasm by venture capitalists as a measure that could substantially increase the flow of capital to small companies. The tax incentives attached to the Venture Capital Investment Trusts went significantly further than most venture capitalists expected. The chancellor did not, however, raise the maximum size of any single investment that the Venture Capital Trust managers will be able to make beyond the Pounds 1m level set in a consultative document published earlier this year. Investors will be able to claim 20 per cent up-front income tax relief on the purchase of shares in the trusts. But they will also be able to roll over capital gains realised through the sale of almost any other asset which are then re-invested in the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) shares. While this latter relief is in effect only a deferral of a capital gains tax liability, the effect of the two incentives is to make up to 60 per cent of any investment in the Venture Capital trust shares eligible for some form of tax relief. Investors will be limited to investments of Pounds 100,000 a year and the trusts will not be able to invest in property companies. Any capital gains or dividends made on the venture capital trust shares will also be free of tax, giving the Venture Capital Trusts a status equivalent to Personal Equity Plans. Mr Michael Walton, managing director of Gartmore Venture Capital, said the chancellor had 'really pushed the boat out' in an effort to attract investors. The only constraint would be on finding investment opportunities. Many venture capital houses that might consider launching venture capital trusts will not have focused before on making investments as small as Pounds 1m and in companies with less than Pounds 10m in assets, as the trust rules require. Mr John Orpen, partner at accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, said the measures would bring investment in private companies within the grasp of many ordinary investors. The chancellor also extended capital gains tax roll-over relief to the Enterprise Scheme which replaced the Business Expansion Scheme last December but which has attracted very little investor interest. The chancellor is understood to be particularly enthusiastic about the potential for Venture Capital Trusts to attract private equity into dynamic smaller companies that do not have access to capital markets and may not have enough security to raise bank debt. He believes these companies are crucial in the drive to increase the pace of job creation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Este, Uruguay, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Uruguayan  Defense Minister Daniel Hugo Martins held a reception for his  visiting Chinese counterpart Chi Haotian today in the country's  famous resort of Punta del Este.    Chi arrived in Uruguay Sunday [10 April] for a four-day  official visit after concluding an eight-day visit to Brazil.    At the reception, Martins said that Uruguay and China have  many points in common, the most notable of which is that both of  them are working for peace in the world.    Chi expressed satisfaction with the development of the  bilateral relations in various fields and the beginning of  successful cooperation.    He praised the social stability and sustained economic  growth  in Uruguay, which has won international respect for its non-  intervention, support for the peaceful solution to disputes and  active participation in regional and global issues.    Chi's current three-nation South American trip is the first  by a Chinese defense minister since the founding of the People's  Republic of China in 1949.    After the visit to Uruguay, Chi will also travel to Chile to  continue his South American tour.</p>

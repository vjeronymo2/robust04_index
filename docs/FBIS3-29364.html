The ministry plans to change the current indirect trade with  the North to direct trade as well as encourage South Korean  enterprises to invest in North Korea if the nuclear problem is  cleared up. An official at the ministry said, however, that  economic cooperation will have to start with projects which need  little capital, low-level technology and a short start-up period  because of the difficulty in predicting North Korean policy.    Even though the nuclear problem is nearing resolution,  follow-up measures to improve inter-Korean relations including  exchanges of special envoys will not necessarily be taken by  North Korea, according to the official. The ministry thus plans  to sell light industry goods first, which can contribute to an  improvement of living conditions among North Koreans.    In the event that full-fledged investment in North Korea was  realized, initial projects would focus on joint production of  light industry goods including footwear, shirts and blouses, on  which Daewoo Group Chairman Kim U-chung reached agreement when  he visited Pyongyang in 1991.    Kim agreed to undertake construction of plants to  manufacture  nine items, including a knitting mill capable of producing up to  2.4 million knitted goods a year.    A ministry official said, "The most difficult project to  push  ahead with is development of Kumkang Mountain, which Hyundai's  Honorary Chairman Chong Chu-yong agreed to push during his visit  to North Korea, because it requires much capital and a long time  to complete."    Meanwhile, if the government allows businessmen to travel to  North Korea, many are expected to visit for discussions on  direct trade and investment. More than 40 businesses have  already received invitations from North Korea or submitted  applications for visits to the National Unification Board (NUB).</p>

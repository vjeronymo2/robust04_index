			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Luko Brailo: "Montenegro Without `Black Gold'"] </F>   [Text] Regarding the power industry, Montenegro has  demanded that the joint state function on the federal principle  -- that is, that Yugoslav oil and petroleum products be divided  between both republics according to their needs and not just  given to one republic. Yugoslav oil practically belongs to just  Serbia, as it is produced only in Serbia -- Vojvodina -- so all  products have previously ended up exclusively in Serbia. As the  production in Serbia (in addition to stealing Croatian oil from  Djeletovci) is considered Yugoslav in the federal balance of  energy supply and consumption, the Montenegrins hold that this  Yugoslav production must be divided as such.    "Montenegro did not get a single drop of oil or any other  energy product from the federal balance of energy supply and  consumption, so the Government of Montenegro has reiterated the  demand for solving the problem, which was presented to the  Federal Executive Council a long time ago," said Montenegrin  Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic. Miodrag Gomilanovic,  Montenegrin minister of power industry, says that the situation  regarding oil and petroleum products threatens to block the  economy and lives since all reserves on all levels have been  exhausted. He added: "We demand joint criteria for the  distribution of oil -- that is, a priority list. The so-called  first priority group should have the same criteria for consumers  in Serbia and Montenegro."  <H5>  Petrol Stations Instead of Pillboxes </H5>   It is obvious that the federal Yugoslav balance of energy  supply and consumption exists only on paper and is applied  solely to priority consumers in Serbia following the old saying:  "Near is my shirt but nearer is my skin." In other words, all  petroleum products in "the FRY [Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]"  are produced by the "Serbian Oil Industry of Nis" and it is all  distributed to priority consumers, except for some symbolic  amounts for free sale, by the republic (Serbian) emergency  committee. The so-called federal committee is only informed  about the amount that is to be divided by the Serbian republic  committee. Montenegro, therefore, requested (demanded) the  right to buy a certain percentage of total production on the  basis of former consumption ratio.    And while "the shirt and the skin" are not being treated as  equal, Kotor "Jugopetrol" published the information according to  which three metric tons of gasoline and eight tons of diesel are  being delivered to the Montenegrin market daily, so that the  present monthly balance of Montenegro amounts to approximately  100 tons of gasoline and 250 tons of diesel. However, priority  consumers need about 300 tons of gasoline and 1,800 tons of  diesel.    The amount needed is acquired on the black market under the  auspices of the state. For example, it is an open secret that,  at the Bozaj border crossing toward Albania, Montenegrin customs  officers charge one dinar per liter of gasoline to truck drivers  whose trucks have additional, so-called expanded fuel tanks.  Indeed, it is only done a couple of days each month, while  "expanded fuel tanks" are usually tolerated the rest of the  month. Otherwise, oil and gasoline are most often transported  illegally by water, especially across Lake Skadar, which forms  most of the borderline between Montenegro and Albania. Oil  fever has spread to villages on both sides of the lake. In "the  land of eagles," gas stations are being built along the borders,  replacing the string of pillboxes. Researching those oil roads,  correspondents of the Montenegrin independent weekly MONITOR  found out that about 200 boats cross the imaginary borderline  between Montenegro and Albania every day. The boats are used  for smuggling everything from cigarettes to satellite dishes,  but mostly for oil and gasoline. The profitability of the  entire operation is substantiated by the following data: The  Albanians are paid 0.7 German marks [DM] per liter of oil, which  is later sold for DM1.2 -- the equivalent amount in Avramovic's  dinars. Consequently, the profit is about half a German mark  per liter, but since the state takes 70 percent of that,  black-marketeers are left with about DM30 (dinars) per barrel.  (It has become customary in these transactions to use standard  "Skadar barrels," which contain 210 liters each.) In this case,  a recently founded firm "Transport" of Podgorica presents a kind  of authority, according to MONITOR, as it issues permits for  black-marketing on behalf of the Government of Montenegro. Just  as every other official document, that permit has serial number,  name, surname, and photograph of the person to which it is  issued. Black-marketeers point out that, on the arrival to the  Montenegrin side of the lake, they can only deliver oil to  certain authorized persons, otherwise the permit "is gone." The  permit means so much, among other reasons, because its holders  enjoy the protection of both the police and the army.    The busiest spot on the Montenegrin side of Lake Skadar is  at the "Plavnica" motel. The former favorite weekend resort of  Podgorica inhabitants, which, in the past couple of years, has  been more frequently closed than open, has taken on a new life  thanks to oil. The motel was leased for DM1,200 per month. The  lessee rigged up a wharf and every cistern's approach to the  so-called loading pad is charged DM200. Motel "Plavnica" also  has an entertainment program featuring Russian strippers. As  many as 10 cisterns with Serb and Bosnian license plates are  filled up here every day. Some of them belong to a Belgrade  firm "Pizon," whose owner is famous former soccer player for  "Zvezda" [Belgrade soccer team] Vladimir Petrovic Pizon. Oil is  being smuggled on the Bojana River, which connects Lake Skadar  with the sea, as well as in Ulcinj, by means of a specially  designed raft cistern that is towed by boat along the sea border  between Montenegro and Albania.  <H5>  Plastic Tube at the Bottom of the Bojana </H5>   However, the oil warehouse at Plavnica has recently burned  down. Some five acres of land was burned then, two cisterns,  several hundred tons of oil, a dozen cars, and two tractors were  destroyed. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Soon after  that, the Albanian police, in collaboration with the World  Organization of Customs Officers, discovered a plastic tube at  the bottom of the Bojana River that was used to carry oil from  Albania to Montenegro. The Ulcinj connection was also  "unearthed." All those events, just as the recent confiscation  of a tanker transporting oil for Montenegro, which was  redirected to Brindisi by NATO and Western European Union  forces, indicate that the "Skadar connection" is slowly running  dry. Among others, the Albanian police have also been  instructed by the international community and organizations that  supervise the embargo imposed on "the FRY" to cover the entire  area of Skadar and prevent further black-marketing of oil. It  is an open secret that Montenegrin and Albanian black-marketeers  have easily found a common ground in the business, and we must  point out that every black-marketeer caught on the Albanian side  had to pay a fine of DM10.    Those relations were soon strained as a result of the  mentioned haggling over the federal balance of energy supply and  consumption between Serbia and Montenegro, and there is no doubt  that Montenegro will be getting the worst of it for a while.  And so, the Belgrade economic circles will again start working  on "dividing Yugoslav petroleum products from Serbia," but  according to the already known principle. In other words,  Montenegro should offer a certain amount of money to be used for  research and production "of the very Yugoslav oil in Vojvodina."  The thesis says that at least one part of the Montenegrin  tourist pie will have to end up in the oil fields of Vojvodina,  for it is senseless to demand federal rights without accepting  federal obligations. Alleged equal status of Montenegro in the  joint federal state is, therefore, still an ideal and the cry of  Milo Djukanovic, one of the architects of "Zabljak Yugoslavia,"  [the meeting in Zabljak was held to confirm the preservation of  Yugoslavia] does indeed seem grotesque. Oil problems are just  the tip of the iceberg of the "joint" economy. The Serbian idea  of a joint market is described by the case of importing 50,000  tons of salt for the needs of Serbia. Meanwhile, there are more  than 35,000 of tons of salt at the Ulcinj salt-works, so the  amount of unsold salt threatens to have serious repercussions on  the harvest this year.... In a nutshell, Montenegro is  suffocating more and more every day.</p>

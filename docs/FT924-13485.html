			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: DM up on Bundesbank report STERLING and the dollar lost ground against the D-Mark yesterday as the markets leaned increasingly towards the view that there will be no cut in official German interest rates today, writes James Blitz. The number of dealers betting on a rate cut has dwindled this week. Yesterday, the Bundesbank injected DM16.1bn into the money market, once again at the reduced rate of 8.9 per cent. But the central bank's monthly report contained another aggressive commentary about the need to curb inflation. 'The Bundesbank must endeavour further to maintain its control over monetary expansion and continue its stability-orientated policy,' the report said. The announcement that there will be no press conference after the council meeting today also helped to push the dollar down to a close of DM1.4630. However, the currency stabilised following US retail sales figures for September which rose 0.3 per cent against forecasts of a 0.5 per cent gain. Although this does not dispel the view that growth in the US remains sluggish, there is a growing belief that the dollar will strengthen sharply against the D-Mark after the US presidential election. Sterling's weakness was compounded by newspaper suggestions that the deepening gloom in UK industry may force the UK government to cut base rates. The Bank of England's operations this week imply that policy will remain tight for the rest of the month, but the pound still lost two pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at DM2.5000. Assuming that there is no change in German rates today, the immediate prospect for the currency market depends on two factors. First, dealers will be looking for an indication of when the German rate cut will come. A widely-held view is that the Bundesbank will ease the discount rate before the end of the year. But, according to Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, turbulence could sweep currency markets again if the impression is given that a cut will not materialise in the near future. ERM currencies will also be affected by the outcome of the extraordinary summit of EC leaders in Birmingham tomorrow. Until the end of last week, the weaker ERM currencies - the peseta, escudo and Irish punt - had been heavily sold because dealers believed that their formal devaluation was imminent. The market has given politicians the benefit of the doubt in recent days, believing that they may move to a more flexible form of ERM. European leaders could acknowledge the need for regular currency re-alignments or a two-speed Europe. 'But if the leaders do not agree on it,' says Mr Lyons,'then the market will provide it for them.'</p>

			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Arts: Air of limbo in Munich After a year on the move, while algae were removed from the expensive new hydraulics system in Munich's National Theater, the Bavarian State Opera is back in its home for the July opera festival, specially extended this year to six-and-a-half weeks. Wolfgang Sawallisch has gone, Peter Jonas has yet to arrive. Despite the pleasure of being back in familiar surroundings, there is an air of limbo. That much was clear from Die Frau ohne Schatten and Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, which - along with La traviata, to be staged later this week by the avant-garde director Gunter Kramer - are the festival's new productions. The Strauss was new to Munich, but was first seen last November during the company's tour of Japan. Its prime motivator was Sawallisch, whose long association with Japan and admiration for its culture prompted the idea of a Kabuki interpretation - at first sight quite plausible, given the opera's pseudo-oriental setting. By the time the production reached Munich, however, it had lost Sawallisch and two members of the original cast, and the Kabuki actor-director Ennosuke Ichikawa was not present to restage it. The result had the taste of a poorly reheated meal. The visual language of Kabuki (designs by Setsu Asakura and Tomio Mohri) produced some striking stage pictures in the naive fairy-tale world of the Emperor: ceremonial costumes, gilded head-dresses and exotic back-cloths, including an awesome Buddha-like image of the Emperor turning to stone. Most eloquent of all was the pagoda-setting for the Empress's dream in Act 2, haunted by a red-plumed human Falcon whose preening gestures would have done credit to an oriental aviary. True to Kabuki style, the action had a ritual mime-like quality, and there was some authentic stage magic. But when it came to characterising the more mundane surroundings of Barak's world - a mosaic of strip-curtains and the headscarf-and-smock costumes of central Asian nomads - the Kabuki experiment began to founder. Now needing to animate the stage according to the rules of European theatre, Ichikawa had nothing to say. Barak and his entourage had about as much expressive vitality as paper cut-outs, while the Empress scuttled around like an outsize, out-of-place geisha. Unlike Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's Cologne production of the late 1970s, which also took Kabuki as its reference point, Ichikawa's Frau showed no synthesis of theatrical traditions. At best, it taught Munich's opera-goers something about Kabuki; at worst, it was an expensive gimmick, which failed to scratch the surface of this problematic work. The cast, dominated by Americans, was unable to make up the deficit - or justify festival seat-prices. The Kabuki style gave Luana DeVol's Empress little scope for personality, and she lacked the vocal radiance for the part. Kenneth Garrison's Emperor, looking like a mobile museum dummy, had a wretched time with Strauss's awkward tenor writing and was mercilessly booed. Despite their hamstrung impersonation of Barak and his wife, Alan Titus and Janis Martin sang well - particularly Miss Martin, who is in better voice than ever. Reinhild Runkel missed the witch's venom which has distinguished her Nurse on previous occasions. In the pit, Horst Stein proved a reliable guide to Strauss's musical architecture and instrumental delicacies - without matching the fluidity and sense of inexorable sweep that lifted Sawallisch's performances. The Shostakovich production, sung in German, at least had in Hildegard Behrens a singer-actress capable of carrying the show alone. Katerina Ismailova is a part to which Behrens's talents are perfectly matched: here was the personification of human vulnerability and frustrated sexuality, every note and gesture wedded to the heartfelt emotions being expressed. But what a shapeless, mediocre staging] Too blunt for satire, too superficial for tragedy, the action unfolded like a cheap catalogue of bonk and bestiality, punctuated by moments of unintentioned comedy. The German film director Volker Schlondorff made the fatal mistake of 'choreographing' Shostakovich's brilliantly descriptive interludes, for some of which the brass section of the orchestra trooped on stage like a village band - undermining the already fragile technical control of the conductor, Peter Schneider. There was no hint of the grotesque, no sense of the epic course of destiny, no engagement with the work's radical film-like quality - nor any compensating atmosphere in Viktor Volsky's grey geometric ramps and gauzes. Kenneth Riegel proved that Sinovy need not be a wimp to be credible. Donald McIntyre, with what voice that remains, captured the geriatric randiness of the despotic Boris. Alfred Kuhn gave a delicious cameo as the degenerate priest. Kurt Schreibmayer, a handsome blonde Sergey, demanded more of his light tenor that it had to offer. In all, a limp, misdirected evening.</p>

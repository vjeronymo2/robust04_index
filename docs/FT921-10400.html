			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: South Africa JOHANNESBURG gained some ground in thin afternoon trading after a listless morning session. The late rally mainly reflected a renewed weakening in the financial rand after Tuesday's modest recovery. The all-gold index ended 10 higher at 1,270, while the industrial index crept up 29 to 4,436. The overall share index closed slightly higher at 3616, up 22. In the gold sector, Vaal Reefs rose R3 to R225 and Driefontein 50 cents to R42 despite slightly lower world gold prices. In diamonds, De Beers rose 50 cents to R93.50.</p>

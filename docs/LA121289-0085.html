			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEW;  </P> <P> TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF 'CHAOS' IN MANAGEMENT  </P> <P> What do you do if you're a fabulously wealthy author looking for new horizons  to conquer?  </P> <P> Well, if you're Tom Peters, author of "In Search of Excellence" and other  best-sellers, you become a one-man TV gang, producing and hosting specials  that, oddly enough, feature the ideas in your latest book. "Thriving on Chaos:  Handbook for a Management Revolution," airing tonight at 10 on Channel 28, is  Peters' latest PBS venture. And, like last season's "Excellence in the Public  Sector," "Chaos" is an entertaining if uneven mix.  </P> <P> First and foremost, "Chaos" is a showcase for Peters, a whirl of energy who  comes across as the Robin Leach of marketing. Peters is the star of this  freewheeling celebration of the power of information technology -- he works a  Dallas audience, the framework of the show, like Oprah Winfrey facing down a  group of Harvard MBAs, setting up interview segments and visits to innovative  companies. He gets laughs -- and he makes his points.  </P> <P> The main points:  </P> <P> * The business world is moving at warp speed, benefitting those who are  constantly improving and changing.  </P> <P> * The information revolution is powering this dramatic change, enabling even  tiny companies to compete with and win against Fortune 500 behemoths.  </P> <P> * Those who don't join in will be left in the dust.  </P> <P> "Chaos" profiles some of the winners, including an advertising group that uses  computer disks as a sales tool, pioneering a new form of marketing; and a  clothing retailer who has shrunk its ordering cycle from nine weeks to three  days, enabling it to cut inventory substantially while ensuring that every item  is always in stock.  </P> <P> Even with Peters' hoopla, "Chaos" ultimately is thought provoking -- a show  with ideas worth examining. It is Part 1 of a three-part series by Peters'  company. Other segments are scheduled for next Tuesday and Dec. 26.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Replies by Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for a </F> Democratic Slovakia, to questions from PRAVDA correspondent  Marian Lesko during the "Thirteen Plus One Debate" organized by  the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK in Bratislava on 8 June: "I Envy You  for Knowing What I Know"]    [Text] The guest of yesterday's "Thirteen Plus One" event,  which was organized by the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK [FREE FRIDAY]  by the Danube, was Vladimir Meciar, chairman of the Movement for  a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and deputy to the National Council  of the Slovak Republic. During the debate, the PRAVDA  correspondent asked him the following questions:    [Lesko] Mr. Deputy, there have not been many opportunities  to meet you since March; therefore, I would like to return to  some older affairs. In the television program "Kroky" [Steps]  about two months ago, you said that the fundamental change of  your stand on the Tatragate affair [involving the alleged "sale"  of the right to commercial use of the Tatra mountains to a U.S.  company] was linked to a certain document you had obtained only  a few weeks before and that you did not have at your disposal  earlier. I would like to ask you what kind of document this is  and why it has not been published to date. And now my second  question: At about this time last year, [Deputy Prime Minister]  Mr. Roman Kovac said under the chestnut trees [in the garden of  the Slovak Government building in Bratislava] that he had  received some $5 million. How is it possible that you did not  file a lawsuit against him at that time, and how is it possible  that he kept executing the post of deputy prime minister for a  few more months?    [Meciar] It is fairly easy to respond to the first question.  We discussed in the government a report on a trip to the United  States by [then Deputy Prime Minister] Mr. Kucerak, [then  Finance Minister and present president] Mr. Kovac, Mr. Rakicky,  and perhaps there was also a fourth member of the delegation.  We approved that report and considered the matter closed. We  did not know at that time that there existed yet another signed  document. Subsequently, a commission of the National Council  carried out an inquiry, but, as you know, the commission of  inquiry was practically recalled before it reached any  conclusions. The commission was chaired by a Green Party  deputy, whose name was Huba. This commission never completed  its work. After we went over to the opposition, one citizen  came to see me and brought a copy of documents that he called  the fourth part and that carried the signatures of Mr. Kucerak,  Mr. Kovac, and Mr. Rakicky and showed that an agreement had been  concluded in the United States. I then had a talk with Mr.  Rakicky, in which he confirmed this act, when it happened, and  under what circumstances. I was not the only person before whom  Mr. Rakicky confirmed this. Even before that, he had confirmed  it to another member of my government. I therefore believe that  these matters have been proved and that parliament should take  them and investigate them.    As far as Mr. Roman Kovac is concerned, the situation was  somewhat more complicated. He really admitted this fact [the  acceptance of a $5-million bribe]. Quite a few of us were  present when he said it, and we remember it well. Should it be  necessary to remind him, we will do so one more time. As for  the conclusions, what options and possible solutions were open  to me? The option of asking the president of the Republic to  recall him was not feasible. At that time, the president had  already considered Roman Kovac as my successor for the post of  prime minister. The option of asking parliament to pass a vote  of no confidence in him was equally unfeasible because some  [HZDS] deputies from Zilina district had already announced that,  should anything be done to remove Kovac, they would leave the  [HZDS] club of deputies. The third option, that of filing  criminal charges, was also unfeasible because Roman Kovac, in  his capacity as deputy to the Federal Assembly, enjoyed immunity  and there was no one to strip him of this immunity. There was  an analogous case involving Duray; the Mandate and Immunity  Committee of the National Council of the Slovak Republic  declared that it did not have the authority to strip him of  immunity. We therefore thought we would drop Roman Kovac from  the government in the process of concluding a coalition  agreement with the Slovak National Party. This resulted in a  very strong internal misunderstanding, with Keltosova,  Gasparovic, Roman Kovacj, and me present. Following talks with  the president, it was impossible at that time to put forward a  proposal that Roman Kovac be recalled. I more or less announced  to Kovac that he could not be in the government and called upon  him to resign from the government, which he did not do. At that  time, he had simply already worked differently, and the  alliances were different. You know well that, from  approximately March 1993, there were efforts on the part of the  Castle to recall my government, and, from approximately August,  the president was proposing Roman Kovac for my post to HZDS and  National Council functionaries. This was announced to me  personally. That was simply the limit, and nothing could be  done at that moment. That is why we did what we did. By making  it possible for him in that television program to sue me, I  actually gave him the chance to clear his name. This was also  discussed in the National Council, which is easier for him than  to prove now that I was not speaking the truth. [sentence as  published] If what I said was not the truth.    [Lesko] Judging from what you said, everything you know  about Tatragate has been actually known to you since 1991. You  have had plenty of opportunities since then to present your new  standpoint and did not have to wait until March 1994. As for  the second case, if you really lost trust in Roman Kovac in the  summer of 1993, why did the HZDS authorize him to conduct  coalition talks with the Slovak National Party, which, as is  well known, took place in September and October 1993? He must  have enjoyed your trust; otherwise, he would have scarcely been  authorized to conduct these talks on behalf of the HZDS....    [Meciar] Regarding the first question, I envy you for  knowing what I know. These documents were not known to me in  1991. There were two agreements. The first, which was known to  me, was acknowledged by the government. The second was not  known to me. As for the talks with the Slovak National Party,  it is true that they were conducted also by Roman Kovac. But  they were conducted also by Ivan Gasparovic and me. The  conclusions from the talks were made by me. Roman Kovac was  responsible only for the final legal formulation, or, to be more  accurate, it was done in his office because there was a meeting  in mine. He was not the only person present at these talks, in  which there were many other participants. You know that the  talks with the Slovak National Party were very complicated and  took place concurrently along several lines. Apart from talks  with [then Slovak National Party Chairman Ludovit] Cernak, there  were also talks with a number of other Slovak National Party  functionaries.</p>

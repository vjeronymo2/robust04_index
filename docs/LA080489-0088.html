			<p><P> August 4, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: ROSE'S LAWYERS WILL APPEAL RULING KEEPING LAWSUIT IN FEDERAL COURT  </P> <P> Pete Rose's lawyers said Thursday in Cincinnati that they will appeal the  decision to keep Rose's suit against baseball Commissioner Bart Giamatti in  federal court.  </P> <P> The lawyers want the case returned to Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in  Cincinnati, where Judge Norbert A. Nadel issued a temporary restraining order  June 25. The order prevented Giamatti from conducting a hearing on gambling  allegations involving the Cincinnati Reds' manager.  </P> <P> The case was transferred to federal court July 5 at the request of baseball's  lawyers. On Monday, U.S. District Judge John Holschuh of Columbus denied Rose's  motion to return the case to the state court system.  </P> <P> Rose's lawyers said they will appeal Holschuh's order next week in the 6th U.S.  Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati. Holschuh said there was "substantial  ground for difference of opinion" on the jurisdiction questions and allowed for  immediate appeal.  </P> <P> Baseball agreed that no action will be taken against Rose until an issue of  jurisdiction is decided. On Monday, Holschuh extended that agreement until Aug.  14, when he has scheduled a hearing on Rose's request for a preliminary  injunction against Giamatti.  </P></p>

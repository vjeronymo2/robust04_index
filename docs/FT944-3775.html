			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Swapo ahead in Namibia voting Namibian President Sam Nujoma yesterday pledged to consult the nation before changing the constitution, as his ruling Swapo party began to look assured of a two-thirds majority in parliament after the first post-independence polls. The two-thirds parliamentary majority, if confirmed when final results are announced today, would give Swapo the right to amend unilaterally the constitution, which it believes favours opposition parties. With more than 70 per cent of the vote going to Swapo, compared to 22 per cent for the opposition Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA), the ruling party's grip on power had tightened. Swapo, which fought a 23-year guerrilla war against South Africa for control of Namibia, was expected to have 51 seats in the new parliament, compared to the 42 it now holds. Commonwealth observers and those from the Association of European Parliamentarians said the poll had been fair.</p>

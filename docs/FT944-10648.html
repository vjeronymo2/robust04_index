			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Survey of Bolivia (18): Investor interest appears keen - Entel telecommunications With fewer than four lines for every 100 inhabitants, Bolivia has one of the lowest indices of telephone provision in Latin America. But, as Peru proved earlier this year when it sold off a controlling share in its state-owned telecommunications industry for more than Dollars 2bn, it is growth potential which counts with investors. Bolivia's long-distance carrier Entel is second on the list of six state companies headed for capitalisation. Mr Doyle Gallegos, an independent consultant with previous experience in the Argentine, Venezuelan and Peruvian sell-offs and now retained to advise on the Bolivian process, describes Entel as a 'relatively sophisticated' company. Over the past five years, it has invested some Dollars 150m in satellite and digital equipment  -40 per cent of that coming from multilateral credits. Entel's revenue has grown about 70 per cent over the same period, with international traffic expanding 30 per cent and national long-distance 20 per cent. Rates are near to or slightly lower than the Latin American average: international calls are Dollars 2.25 per minute plus 13 per cent tax. Entel billed Dollars 101m in 1993, producing cash flow equivalent to about 33 per cent of revenue. The new operator will enjoy an 'exclusive concession' on long-distance traffic for five years, after which the Bolivian telephone business will be thrown open to full competition. Capitalisation is complicated by the fact that on-the-ground service has for more than a decade been in the hands of 22 co-operatives nationally. The Santa Cruz co-operative has been in existence for 25 years. In general, the co-operatives have lagged behind in infrastructure investments; many are alleged to be both inefficient and corrupt, 'administered by people who know nothing about telecommunications,' according to a local expert. At present, Bolivians wanting a telephone must pay a discouraging Dollars 1,500 installation charge to their local co-operative. Finding sources of financing is generally difficult for co-operatives so they are unable to meet demand: the average waiting time for connection is a year. Following the Peruvian privatisation model, Bolivia's capitalisation team is setting specific conditions for Entel's 'strategic partner'. Existing telephone density is to be doubled within five years, with a target of 12 lines for every 100 inhabitants by the year 2005. That would mean investment totalling some Dollars 1.6bn. A simple price cap formula will be applied, diminishing gradually on a real-terms basis to oblige the operator to increase efficiency. Currently low local monthly tariffs will have immediately to be raised while international rates will gradually fall. By late October, it was not clear how much resistance was to be expected from certain co-operatives. Government strategy seemed to focus on reason and persuasion, with the back-up legal provision that Entel's new partner will have the right to install parallel infrastructure if local co-operation is not forthcoming. 'Most likely, co-operatives will transform themselves into limited companies,' says Mr Gallegos. 'Otherwise, their chances of expanding will be slight.' The co-operative snag notwithstanding, investor interest appears keen. Leading international operators such as GTE, American Telephone and Telegraph, Telefonica and SouthWestern Bell - who recently participated in the Peruvian telecommunications sell-off - have attended Entel information seminars. Brazilian and Mexican companies are also reportedly interested in forming consortia with larger operators. Seven investment banks have been short-listed for the job of promotion and a decision is expected by late November. Pre-qualification of operators is scheduled for January.</p>

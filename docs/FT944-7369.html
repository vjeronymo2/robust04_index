			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Turkish sell-off law approved Turkey's parliament approved a framework privatisation law yesterday, opening the way to sell off nearly all the country's loss-making state companies. Approval of the law by 193 votes to 25 was a welcome political victory for Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, whose fractious coalition government faced collapse in recent weeks. The law gives broad authority to sell over 100 companies without obtaining prior parliamentary approval for each sale. The Erdemir steel company and the Petrol Ofisi chain of petrol stations and oil refineries are expected to be among the first companies to be privatised. Officials expect to raise Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.4bn) from privatisation next year. This is the first structural reform measure parliament has approved since Mrs Ciller in April adopted an emergency package of tax increases and spending cuts after a balance of payments crisis. Last year, state companies contributed one-fifth of the public sector borrowing requirement of Dollars 29.72bn. However, Mrs Ciller now faces mounting opposition from trade unions. On Wednesday, demonstrators paralysed the city of Zonguldak, home to the Demir Celik steel company, to protest against privatisation, which is likely to cost 80 per cent of the company's 8,700 jobs.</p>

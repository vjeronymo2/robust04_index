			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guido Moltedo: "Clinton in the Fininvest Show"] </F>   [Text] As he spoke to the press yesterday evening, standing  on the small platform raised in Palazzo Chigi's [government  seat] courtyard, [Prime Minister] Silvio Berlusconi seemed  almost as tall as Bill Clinton. Who knows if some indiscreet  camera may not have revealed the platform intended to add a few  inches to Fininvest's owner. A show business expert, a manic  perfectionist when it comes to framing TV shots, Berlusconi  tried to cash in as much as possible on Bill Clinton's  visibility. And he succeeded by playing the game on the most  favorable field to him, namely that of images and communication.  Undoubtedly, the abundance of TV images of Clinton's Roman  tour, with Berlusconi acting as ever-smiling host, has impressed  the general public as a sort of blessing of the government on  the part of the first -- and nowadays sole -- world power.    However, what is the truth behind glamorous TV images? By  the very fact that it took place, Clinton's visit politically  legitimizes the Fininvest government. This, however, is only  true to a certain point, if we want to give an objective report  on yesterday's events. The U.S. President's words did not sound  like an unconditional approval. They included reservations and  undertones of concern. On the other hand, the press conference  itself gave a measure of the extent of the problem posed by the  fascists' presence in the government. Many of the questions  concerned this topic. Clinton was able to gauge, first hand,  the seriousness of this issue, and he seemed to behave  accordingly, within the limits imposed by circumstances. He  seemed to be in some Latin American country or other, in which  an exceedingly fragile democracy is at risk, and whose rulers  must, in the first place, give assurances as to democracy and  human rights (the latter were in fact mentioned), with the  American leader of the moment listening and giving out marks,  and reserving the prerogative to judge on the basis of facts.  This is how Clinton behaved, and it amounts to an unspoken  admission that a problem does indeed exist, and that it is not  one which can be easily surmounted.    In his global, strategic outlook, Clinton may, cynically,  deem it expedient to support a government like the present one  in order -- among other reasons -- to win over an area of Europe  -- whose remaining, and largest, part is moving further away  from him every day -- rather than merely out of a noble and  genuine antifascist feeling. However, he must also take very  much into account public opinion at home -- a public opinion  which continues to feel growing concern at the absurd escalation  of Italian politics, including a whole series of facts (Nazis in  Vicenza), threats (scraping the Osimo Treaty), and statements  (gay people should be interned in concentration camps).  Yesterday THE NEW YORK TIMES's editorial highlighted the  "historical irony" involved in the fact that the President found  himself commemorating Europe's liberation at the same time as  fascist exponents were returning to government.    Is it only the past that is involved? Are today's fascists  not the same as yesterday's? Berlusconi assures us they are  not. However, a more skeptical THE NEW YORK TIMES warned  Clinton: "The 50th anniversary of the offensive against fascist  Europe is the occasion to commemorate the heroic crusade for  freedom undertaken by America and her allies. But it is also an  occasion for remembering the damage fascism inflicted on Europe  in a not-too-remote past. When `postfascist' parties speak of  scrapping treaties and sending people to concentration camps,  they must be taken seriously and called to account."</p>

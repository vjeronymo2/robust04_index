During his conversation with journalists Chernomyrdin  pointed  out that as of today Ukraine's debt to Russia for fuel and  energy is about $1 Bn [Billion]. To this effect Chernomyrdin  expressed his concern over this fact. "We make many concessions  and await that Ukraine's leadership will start to act but not to  talk," he said. According to Chernomyrdin, other consumers of  Russian natural gas suffer because of Ukraine's debt.    Meanwhile, Chairman of Gazprom's board Rem Vyakhirev  declared  in his interview with Interfax that if Ukraine fails to fulfill  the agreement signed on March 10 in Moscow then Russian  deliveries for the republic's inner consumption will be entirely  stopped. He underlined that this issue would be finally solved  before April 11, the time of the next talks on Ukraine's debt  for fuel and energy delivered from Russia.    On Saturday in Helsinki, Vyakhirev signed two agreements  with  the leadership of the firm Neste, on deliveries of Russian gas  to Finland for the next twenty years and on procurement of  25%  of shares of the Finnish gas company by Gazprom.    In Vyakhirev's words, the document stipulates that in 1994  Russia is due to supply 3.2 Bn cubic meters of natural gas to  Finland.    In the course of his visit to Finland Chernomyrdin signed  several bilateral economic agreements and a document on  deliveries of Russian armaments to this country.    Viktor Samoylov, general director of the state company on  armaments and military equipment export and import  Rosvooruzhenie, reported to Interfax that Russia would deliver  to Finland armaments amounting to $100 Mn [Million] to  compensate its foreign debt. As he said, these are air defense  weapons, spare parts for military equipment, ammunitions for  artillery, and small arms.    Samoylov pointed out that Russia sells weapons to Finland  since 1959.    Russia's debt to Finland is $1.3 Bn.</p>

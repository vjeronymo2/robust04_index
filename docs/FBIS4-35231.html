			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 29 May (INA)--AL-THAWRAH stresses that the  impulsive decision that has been made against the Iraqi employee  responsible for looking after the Iraqis' interests in the  United States is unmistakable evidence of the weak U.S. position.    In its "Window" column today, the paper says that the United  States fears that this lone Iraqi may influence congressmen,  something which would embarrass the U.S. Administration in its  attempts to justify the continued imposition of the blockade  against Iraq.    The paper asks: How then does the U.S. Administration view  the moves made by the Iraqi delegations, led by Tariq 'Aziz,  that visit the UN headquarters every two months, especially  since it is aware that such moves have substantial effects, even  among its allies at the UN Security Council?    The paper adds: We are certain that Washington's impulsive  stands are a reaction to its loss of confidence in its ability  to convince the American people and their law-makers of its  policy on maintaining the blockade imposed on Iraq. This is  evidence of the success of the Iraqi move. Only further  patience and steadfastness is required, for the American side  has begun to stagger, and its arguments will inevitably be  defeated.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / 'Good news' for darts maker: Leisure EDDIE and Peter Norman annually notch up more than Pounds 1m in worldwide sales of darts and dartboards. They intend to use the fall in sterling to improve their score. Business was already buoyant for the Bristol-based House of Darts, which sells 98 per cent of its product overseas and recently found itself starring in a Christmas speech by the Queen for its exporting prowess. But the cheaper pound has given a noticeable boost to orders from wholesalers in some of the company's biggest European markets: 'It is good news and we are going to make the best of it,' says Mr Eddie Norman. Sales in Germany have been 'shooting up'. He is not so sure, however, that the price advantage of buying British is being passed on to customers, with many wholesalers themselves pocketing improved margins. Even so, that prospect alone should encourage wholesalers to push the British company's products. 'Our best markets have been thriving in any case,' Mr Norman says. 'But we will try and use the cheaper pound to step up sales in those countries where breaking into the market has been more difficult or where opportunities are now opening up. France is the tough one and we have been stepping up efforts to crack it. The fall in sterling should help back up our sales effort.' One problem is the difficulty which some overseas customers claim they are having in promptly paying their invoices from House of Darts. According to Mr Norman, 'we have had customers in Denmark and Finland saying they cannot pay on time because their banks won't sell them sterling. That sort of confusion we can do without.'</p>

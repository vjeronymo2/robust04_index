			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Aden, Yemen, Jan 19 (AFP)--A key player in the  Yemeni crisis on Wednesday cast a shadow over a peace accord to  settle the country's political dispute, saying he demanded  guarantees for his security before signing it.    Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, a southerner and leader of  the Yemen Socialist Party (YSP), said he was satisfied with the  agreement reached Tuesday but said he wanted to be briefed on  security arrangements for the signing ceremony before committing  himself.    Al-Bid has since August been embroiled in a dispute over the  running of the country with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, a  northerner and head of the ruling General People's Congress  (GPC).    The agreement on a range of reforms reached by  representatives of Yemen's major political forces, notably the  YSP and GPC, specifies in Article 7 that a committee be created  to "establish security conditions required for the signature of  the accord," by Salih and al-Bid.    "The committee must first present the required program for  implementation of Article 7 and then we'll offer our point of  view," al-Bid told AFP.    More than 150 YSP officials have been killed in attacks  since  North and South Yemen merged in May 1990. Al-Bid's party has  blamed several of the attacks on the Islamic Jihad organization  which it says is protected by the northern Al-Islah Islamic  party.    A GPC spokesman meanwhile said Salih had unconditionally  accepted the agreement "and is ready to sign, on the date and at  the time specified, the accord he considers a good step emerging  from the current crisis and that he is ready to translate it  into action."    The GPC's political bureau voiced the party's commitment to  compliance with all the accord's clauses, notably those on  security arrangements and administrative decentralization.    Al-Bid, the president of the former south, left the capital  for his home in Aden on August 19, demanding political and  economic reforms. Earlier this month he refused to attend a  reconciliation meeting with Salih.    The vice president's comments Wednesday were in reply to a  statement by Hammud Hashim al-Dharahi, a representative of the  Islamic Al-Islah party and a member of the security committee,  who told AFP that al-Bid was "prepared to accept the date and  place proposed by the committee for the signing of the accord."    The accord was drawn up during two months of tough  negotiations and calls for the withdrawal within one week of  forces deployed along the former border between North and South  Yemen.    The cabinet, meeting Wednesday in Sanaa under First Deputy  Prime Minister Hasan Muhammad Makki, voiced satisfaction with  the accord.    Announcement of the agreement came only hours after the GPC  charged that a southern Yemeni warplane had bombed a northern  army brigade. GPC and YSP officials had accused each other of  massing troops along the former border.</p>

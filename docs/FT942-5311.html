			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Horn set to become Hungarian premier Mr Gyula Horn, a long-time Communist party functionary and now leader of Hungary's Socialist party, is set to become the country's next prime minister. The reformed communists, newly assertive after gaining an absolute majority in last month's parliamentary elections, named Mr Horn at a special congress at the weekend. The party gave overwhelming backing to the 61-year-old Mr Horn, a former foreign minister, and brushed off a challenge from Mr Laszlo Bekesi, the party's economics spokesman. At the same time the Socialists also offered to begin coalition talks this week with the Alliance of Free Democrats, the liberal party which came second in the vote. The Socialists had held off from designating a candidate for the premiership because the liberals regard Mr Horn as a 'divisive figure'. The Socialist leader was a volunteer in the 'padded jacket' workers' militia that helped put down Hungary's 1956 uprising against Soviet and communist rule. But the unexpected scale of the former communists' election triumph - the party won 209 of the 386 parliamentary seats - has changed the political balance of power. Free Democrat leaders had vowed never to serve in a government dominated by the Socialists and led by Mr Horn, and even last week were holding out for a compromise. The liberals nevertheless agreed yesterday to begin talks on joining the next government after coming under strong pressure from intellectuals and the business community to bolster Socialist technocrats and dilute the influence of the traditionalist and trade union groups among the former communists. The Socialists' outright election victory has emboldened the party's left wing and the weakness of the party's technocrats was further demonstrated by the 96 per cent vote of Socialist congress delegates for Mr Horn.</p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / International Company News: Conrad Black wins more time in Daily News talks THE STRUGGLE to find a new owner for the Daily News, the New York city tabloid, intensi fied yesterday afternoon when a bankruptcy court judge essentially extended the negotiation period to allow unions to try to reach agreements with Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian publisher whose offer has received management backing. In the absence of a consensus among the paper's nine unions, Daily News management voted to accept a bid by Mr Black, who controls The Daily Telegraph of London, as part of its reorganisation plan presented to the bankruptcy court yesterday. Yesterday Judge Tina Brozman gave the parties until September 8 to reach a firm agreement. Although Mr Black's proposal has met with management and creditor approval, it also calls for agreements with all of the News unions, which may prove impossible. Other terms of Mr Black's offer include Dollars 75m for all of the Daily News business assets, including Dollars 22m for administrative claims and creditors, and the construction of a Dollars 200m colour printing plant in New York city. Mr Black would also advance up to Dollars 3m in financing to forestall a cash crisis, provided he reaches agreements with at least six of the unions. Before yesterday's hearing, the bulk of the unions were believed to favour a competing bid from Mr Mortimer Zuckerman, owner of US News and World Report magazine. Mr Fred Drasner, president of US News and World Report, said the court hearing was 'largely a non-event. Whoever wins an agreement with the unions will be the owner of the Daily News. We will continue our discussions and remain cautiously optimistic'. The Daily News, which celebrated being rescued by Mr Robert Maxwell early last year, has been operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code since shortly after Mr Maxwell's death. Ms Brozman, who has grown increasingly frustrated with the continued impasse at the Daily News, earlier chastised unions and management for 'jeopardising my ability to keep this newspaper alive'. Hollinger, the fast-growing newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, lifted net second-quarter earnings almost sevenfold, thanks to the proceeds of the recent sale of shares by the UK's Telegraph group, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Earnings for the quarter, including extraordinary items, were CDollars 85.8m (USDollars 72.1m), or CDollars 1.50 a share, up from CDollars 12.3m, or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Net earnings for the first six months climbed to CDollars 54.1m, or 87 cents a share, from CDollars 29.7m, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues rose to CDollars 436.6m from CDollars 398.9m. The company said that higher taxes stemming from the rise in operating earnings and last year's application of loss carry-forwards resulted in a fall in first-half operating earnings to CDollars 24.1m from CDollars 27.5m. Operating earnings before income taxes and minority interest rose to CDollars 57m from CDollars 46m. The company said that 'other items' in the first half consisted almost entirely of the CDollars 38.4m write-down taken in the first quarter relating to the sale of its investment in United Newspapers, and the second-quarter gain from the Telegraph sale.</p>

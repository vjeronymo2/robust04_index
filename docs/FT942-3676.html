			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: The Daily Telegraph - Editorial performance Everybody's luck has to turn sometime. In so far as Mr John Major, the prime minister, can be said to have pursued a coherent political strategy over the last year that adage, in a nutshell, has been it. The question his demoralised party is now asking itself is whether its rout in the European elections finally marks the nadir of its fortunes? Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was yesterday emphatic that it did. The prime minister, at least, is likely to survive the debacle if only because . . . there is no obvious successor in sight. Before he can again consider himself secure, however, his party will require better evidence that their fortunes will at last improve than Mr Hurd was able to proffer yesterday. In this endeavour Mr Major might be helped by a fresher cabinet. The present team have had their day, and should make way for newer blood.</p>

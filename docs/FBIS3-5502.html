The government will not send election monitors under the UN  umbrella because local circumstances portend danger such as  terrorist attacks, the sources said.    Instead, the government will dispatch a dozen or so people  to  monitor the multiracial polls set for April at the request of  the South African Government, they said.    The decision will be made by the end of this month, they  said.    In January, the UN General Assembly unanimously endorsed a  resolution calling for the sending of an 1,800-member mission to  South Africa to monitor the elections. The United Nations has  asked if it could join the mission, Foreign Ministry sources  said.    Prior to the UN decision, Japan's parliamentary Vice Foreign  Minister Syozo Azuma traveled to the country in early January  and proposed to Pretoria that Japan dispatch election monitors  to the region.    Foreign Minister Pik Botha pledged to Azuma that the South  African Government will guarantee the security of Japanese  election monitors during the election period, officials said.</p>

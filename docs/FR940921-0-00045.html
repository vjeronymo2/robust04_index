Refueling Emission Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Natural Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the proposal:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM the Agency proposed that, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case of natural gas refueling facilities, no refueling hoses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which need to be vented down prior to disconnect shall be vented to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the atmosphere. Rather, as is the case with many current natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas refueling facilities, EPA expects that such vent-down gases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be routed back to the compressor inlet rather than being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vented to the atmosphere. The timing of this requirement was not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explicit in the NPRM preamble. However, the regulatory text stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the provisions would take effect with the 1994 model year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Summary of the comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In general, the comments received in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> response to the issue of natural gas refueling hose venting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opposed, to some degree, the proposed prohibition on venting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. Some commenters suggested that this requirement is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed at all given the extremely small contribution to total  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methane emissions that vent-down gases represent. Several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters pointed out that the upcoming ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would address EPA's concerns about refueling emissions from natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas refueling stations. One commenter pointed out that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed requirement could be interpreted as a zero-emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard and questioned the feasibility of such an approach. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters suggested that more leadtime was needed than was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed. Several commenters pointed out that the cost of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling these emissions varied quite a bit depending on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inlet pressure of the compressor. In cases where the natural gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supply line is at fairly low pressure ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 15 psi or less) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas could be routed directly into the compressor inlet at low cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, in cases where the gas supply pressure is higher,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional compression equipment would be needed to compress the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vent-down gas in order to route it back into the compressor,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> raising costs substantially. Also, the cost of such controls would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be much higher for existing installations than for new stations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because existing stations would likely require excavation for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return line plumbing. Finally, some commenters stated that EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should not control natural gas refueling emissions since they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primarily methane, and the Agency only proposed NMHC standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tailpipe emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the NPRM the Agency mentioned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the natural gas industry was moving toward the establishment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard refueling equipment specifications. That effort, known as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ANSI/AGA NGV1 standard, was recently adopted by the American  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> National Standards Institute (ANSI) as the standard for natural gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle fueling connection devices. While in its various draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms, this standard contained a provision limiting the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> natural gas that can be vented due to nozzle disconnect. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was based on the proposed onboard refueling vapor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery (ORVR) standard for gasoline-fueled vehicles of 0.05 grams  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per gallon of dispensed gasoline. <FOOTCITE>15</FOOTCITE>  As indicated in the draft ANSI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard contained in the public docket for this rule, the venting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision was deleted from the final ANSI standard since, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time of final balloting on the standard, the ORVR rule had not yet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been promulgated. The ORVR final rule was recently promulgated and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included a gasoline-fueled vehicle refueling emission standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.20 grams per gallon of dispensed gasoline. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 52 FR 31162, August 19, 1987. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 59 FR 16262, April 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency agrees that a zero-emission standard for natural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas vehicles is not reasonable and believes that, in its draft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form, the NGV1 standard addressed EPA's concerns with natural gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle refueling emissions. Thus, the Agency is using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodology in draft NGV1 standard to apply the 0.20 gram per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gallon refueling standard to natural gas vehicles. Using this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach, natural gas refueling stations will be allowed to vent no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more than 1.2 grams of natural gas due to nozzle disconnect. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard is based on the ORVR standard of 0.20 grams per gallon of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel dispensed and a nominal fuel tank capacity of six gallons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline equivalent natural gas, as was assumed in the draft NGV1  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard. For a more complete discussion of how this standard was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> derived please consult the summary and analysis of comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> document for this rule. This requirement will take effect January  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1, 1998 for high volume stations, with a two year extension until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 1, 2000 for small volume stations (those which dispense  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than the energy equivalent of 10,000 gallons of gasoline per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> month based on the AMFA fuel equivalency factor).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

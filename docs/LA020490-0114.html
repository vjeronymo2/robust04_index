			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO LEADING LADIES OF THE SCREEN LEAVE BEHIND SWEET MEMORIES  </P> <P> At a 1947 forum at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, a brash young friend asked me to  keep his seat while he was off being brash.  </P> <P> A woman, almost formless under layered sweaters, approached to ask me if the  seat was taken.  </P> <P> I replied, "Yes, I'm sorry," and I've been sorry ever since. Because when I  looked at her face, I saw it was Ava Gardner.  </P> <P> If I had allowed myself a quota of mistakes, turning down this glorious beauty  surely would have used up my quota far into the future.  </P> <P> MARK NICHOLS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

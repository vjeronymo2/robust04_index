			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Brown warns of cut in spending on unemployed ANNUAL EXPENDITURE on the unemployed is due to fall to Pounds 565 per capita in 1993-94 or less than half the Pounds 1,188 a head spent when Mr John Major took office as prime minister in 1990, according to Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. Mr Brown told Labour's finance and industry group that the early release of the 1993-94 Supply Estimates, usually published on Budget day, had revealed a Pounds 100m cut in schemes to assist the unemployed and business. Among the cuts were a 7 per cent reduction in the Training for Work initiative and a 14 per cent cut in the One Stop Business Services scheme. Other savings include a Pounds 10m cut in regional assistance and 15 per cent reduction in funding for business start-ups, now expected to total Pounds 133m. Mr Brown's calculations on spending on the unemployed are based on adding the total allocations made through the Training and Enterprise Councils (Tecs) to special initiatives for the unemployed. According to his figures, calculated at 1992-93 prices, the outturn in 1990-91 was Pounds 2.38bn compared to a forecast Pounds 1.69bn in the coming fiscal year. Over the period, total unemployment has risen by about 1m. The Department of Employment last night said it had been unable to check Mr Brown's figures, but added that expenditure on the unemployed was due to rise by Pounds 177m - or 1 percentage point - in real terms in 1993-94. Mr Brown was winding up Labour's three-month campaign for a 'Budget for jobs'. Restating Labour's goal of full employment, he used a leaked trade and industry department report on industrial competitiveness to underscore the need for intervention. 'Any Budget that does not begin to reverse that industrial decline by a long-term plan to tackle the critical failure to invest in people in industry and in our social and economic fabric is a Budget that will fail Britain,' he said. Earlier, Mr Brown forecast that today's Budget would include another 'underfunded' temporary jobs programme, the 'reannouncing' of the Heathrow rail link, the sale of a further tranche of BT shares and the masking of petrol tax rises as 'help for the environment'.</p>

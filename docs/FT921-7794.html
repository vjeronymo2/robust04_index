			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / London health care seen as costly and flawed HEALTH PROVISION in London is relatively expensive, but the capital's residents are denied essential elements of an adequate service, according to research published yesterday by the King's Fund health policy analysis centre. The findings will be taken into account by the government's inquiry into London's health provision which began work in October. Future health care, including whether all the London teaching hospitals should be kept, will be one of the first politically sensitive health decisions for the next government. The King's Fund research concludes that London uses far more resources than would be justified purely on population grounds. That is largely because of a decline in the number of people living in the capital over the past 50 years. The decline has been considerably offset by patients from outside districts using the inner-London teaching hospitals. The fund says, however, that this 'pattern of provision of expensive services to non-residents is unlikely to be sustainable in the long term'. The King's Fund says that Pounds 2.9bn is spent on hospital and community health services in London. That is 20 per cent of the English budget for those services, although Londoners represent only 15 per cent of the population. However, it says that Londoners frequently experience problems in gaining access to health care and there is evidence that specialist services have developed at the expense of local ones. During the 1980s plans were advanced to disperse some specialised medical services away from the capital, but the report says that 'a further expansion and concentration of most specialist services has taken place in inner London between 1980 and 1990'. The overall health of people living in London is found to be no worse than those in other parts of the country, although poor health is strongly linked to areas of deprivation in the city.

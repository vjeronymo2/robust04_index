			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses concentrate on individual issues SECOND THOUGHTS on the German steel pay settlement were no more bullish yesterday than Monday's reaction, and senior bourses tended to concentrate on individual issues, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw a big rise in Continental, the tyremaker, and an even bigger fall in Lufthansa, the state-controlled airline whose shares had been one of the bourse's star performers in 1991, and early 1992. Conti rose DM5.80 to DM230.50, against the trend in the market which registered a 4.96 decline to 683.73 in the FAZ index at midsession, and a 12.61 fall to 1,676.40 in the DAX at the close. Volume fell from DM7bn to DM5bn. The UK broker, BZW, said that it was recommending Conti as a 'buy' after a meeting with the company, noting that the tyremaker expected to halve losses in the US to Dollars 50m this year and eradicate them in 1993. The company raised replacement tyre prices by 12 per cent last October and saw 2 to 3 per cent growth in global tyre sales in 1992. Lufthansa reacted a day late to Monday's story in the German newspaper, Augsburg Allgemeine, that the airline would report a DM400m loss for 1991 after earlier hopes of breakeven. After hitting a new 1992 high of DM181.50 on Monday, the shares dropped DM8.50 to DM172.50 in yesterday's official session, and were quoted DM4 lower after hours. Mr Mark Simpson, of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said that poor results at Lufthansa were usually offset by second half aircraft sales, and write-backs from reserves. Last year, disposal revenue was small and there seems to have been a conscious decision not to write back reserves. However, he said, the company was still cheap, trading on a prospective 1992 cash earnings multiple of 2.9, compared with 6 times two years ago at the start of the recession in the industry. PARIS recovered from the day's lows but failed to move into positive territory. The CAC-40 index ended 0.50 lower at 1,856.48 after a low of 1,840.30 in thin volume of Fr1.8bn. Elf depressed the market at the start as its fall in 1991 net attributable profit of FFr9.8bn from FFr10.6bn disappointed the market's most optimistic forecasters who had expected FFr11bn. The stock fell FFr2.80 to FFr363.50 on 410,700 shares. Eurotunnel was the day's most active share, falling FFr2.80 or 1.3 per cent to FFr44.50 with 904,500 shares traded, on a report in a French newspaper that the company would offer shares to the TML, the consortium building the tunnel, to settle their dispute over costs. After the close, Eurotunnel called the report speculative. Alcatel weakened for the second day, closing down FFr8 at FFr566 in unexceptional volume of 312,040 shares as some brokers downgraded their forecasts. County NatWest has reduced its 1992 net profit estimate from FFr6.4bn to FFr6.1bn, citing the company's high exposure to the European public switching market which is expected to see a decline in spending. MILAN opened weak but saw a burst of domestic demand late in the session. The Comit index rose 0.57 to 545.26 in turnover estimated at L110bn after L92bn. Renewed speculation that Olivetti was about to merge with another company lifted the share price by L81 or 2.9 per cent to L2,813. Another riser was the insurer Fondiaria which added L1,150 or 2.9 per cent to L40,130 but dealers could find no reason for the move. Fiat, which after the close announced plans to reduce its workforce by 10,300 this year, dropped L64 to L5,037. Among smaller, cyclical stocks, Cogefar and Falck were in demand, rising L100 and L170 respectively to L3,551 and L6,100. AMSTERDAM fell on afternoon profit-taking as the CBS Tendency Index edged up 0.1 to 122.4. Tulip Computers rose Fl 0.10 to Fl 24.70 after reaching a high of Fl 25.40. The group reported that 1991 first half sales fell 8 per cent but expected growth of 15 per cent in the second half. Philips shed Fl 0.70 to Fl 30.8 on worries over fourth quarter figures, due on February 27. Profit-taking hit Elsevier after hitting a new high on Monday: it fell Fl 0.70 to Fl 108.40. STOCKHOLM was relieved that Electrolux was holding its dividend in spite of a 27 per cent drop in profits. Electrolux B climbed SKr11 to SKr247 in turnover of about SKr40m as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 6.9 better at 969.6. Volume was moderate, although it nearly doubled from SKr220m to SKr420m. MADRID rallied with the general index up 1.73 to 257.15. Turnover improved to Pta14bn from Monday's low of Pta8.5bn. Shares in Cofir, the holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo De Benedetti, and Macosa, in which Cofir has a 25 per cent stake, were suspended on merger rumours. OSLO steadied after Monday's 2 per cent fall: the all-share index rose 1.91 to 440.48 in turnover of NKr207.18m. Norsk Hydro gained NKr2 to NKr146.5. BRUSSELS closed lower: the Bel-20 index ended 7.25 down at 1,170.57.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Hourly changes    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1129.23  1129.02  1130.47  1130.78  1130.70  1129.82  1131.07  1132.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High  1132.79      Day's Low  1128.71  ----------------------------------------------------------------------      Feb 3       Jan 31       Jan 30       Jan 29       Jan 28     1134.04     1137.97      1131.87      1132.85      1143.22  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

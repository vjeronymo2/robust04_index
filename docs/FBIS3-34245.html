			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by brother leader of the revolution Colonel Mu'ammar </F> al-Qadhdhafi in Misratah on 2 February--recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God. May God make your evening a  good one. I would like first of all to thank you for providing  a second chance to meet in Misratah. I am very grateful to you  for your invitation, which I received when I was in Sirte the  other day. [passage omitted]    We are now in a new confrontation. Confrontations are the  same, but the means and weapons may vary. Today, as we were in  the recent past, we are confronting the same enemy. We have the  same people, the same nation, and the same religion confronting  the same enemies, which are the West, Christianity, imperialism,  colonialism, whether it was in 1912, 1911, 1915, or now. We are  in a new confrontation. It is beneficial to browse through our  history and pause before the sacrifices made by our forefathers  and our families. [passage omitted].    Brothers, it is very important to stop before these lessons,  the lessons of our past history and the heroism of our  forefathers and their sacrifices, because they represent our  provision to face up to the new confrontation. It is very  important. Important in the Libyan information approach,  important in the Libyan educational curriculum and important  even in family discourse and the club chatter and everywhere we  are. [passage omitted]    Until now [al-Qadhdhafi pauses, interrupted by crowd  chanting] ...look at the Americans and the West. Their  calculations now are based on that the Libyan people have been  spoiled and their demands have increased; luxury goods have  become necessities. The Libyans have become accustomed to  things they did not know before. They have become used to  canned food and fashion and European and Western things. Now  when oil exports become less and imported things decrease, the  Libyans will comply with our [the West] orders and accept the  new world order, what they term as international legitimacy,  which is the legitimacy of force: the West is strong and the  others should comply. This is impossible. [passage omitted]    Before the battle, the enemy carries out preliminary actions  to weaken his adversary. When there are two armies fighting  against each other and two countries fighting against each  other, before the firing of machine-guns and the use of aircraft  (?which may be easy for the braves) begin the battle, there is  another action which is the dangerous action -- an action that  paves the way for victory in the military battle. It is a  psychological, propagandist, economic and political action.  This is a dangerous action, because you have to gain spies from  the enemy; you have to recruit them. You have to infiltrate the  enemy's front. You have to weaken the morale of the enemy. You  have to run bad propaganda which the enemy may believe; your  agents have to spread that. This is very dangerous. You have  to be aware that you are facing this weapon.    Now we are not facing aircraft or missiles, etc. This may be  easy; it could possibly be easy. No matter how many missiles  may be launched, an aircraft carrier cannot enter our desert; it  will stop when the water ends. Missiles constitute a terrorist  action which has never forced a people to leave their land; it  never put an end to a nation. The important thing is that we  should understand this. I know that your morale is high, and  that you are ready; this is great. But the important thing is  that we should understand at this meeting some of the important  things.    You are not facing aircraft carriers, or missiles, or guns.  What I want to say is that a battle could be better. A  military battle must come to an end; it does not last long.  They cannot land on our territory. No matter how long the  battle may go on, we have the fate of our land in our hands. In  the end we will evict them. But the battle which is being  fought now and the weapon which you are now facing -- the weapon  which the enemy has begun to use -- is neither the machine gun  nor the rifle. It is silent weapon. It is a weapon which  targets morale. I will tell you what these weapons are.  [2-minute break in audio reception].    Heresy is another weapon, like recruitment and treason. Now  we hear about the Takfir and Hijrah group, the Da'wah, the  Jihad, and al-Fatah -- and so on and on. Everything invented in  religion is heresy, and every heresy is a deceit, and those who  adopt deceit will rest in hell. [passage omitted] This is a  dangerous weapon; this is a dangerous stratagem to destroy the  Arabs and Islam -- these Islamic parties.    The plan was hatched in India, Afghanistan, and Iran. They  taught people and recruited them and established schools. They  called one Da'wah, another was called The Jihad, another they  called The Takfir and the Hijrah, another they called The  Tahrir, The Brothers, etc. They told them to enter the Arab  countries and cause the Muslims to blaspheme and fight each  other. [passage omitted]    Heresy is a weapon useful to America, the Israelis and  Europe. They are all hoping that the Arab nation will be  fragmented and that the Arabs will fight each other using heresy  -- Muslim brothers, the Atonement and Flight, the Islamic Call  and the Muslim Vanguards -- exactly as you have been witnessing  in Egypt and Algeria.    Some three thousand have died in Algeria. Every day  somebody dies exactly like it used to be during the war of  liberation, when the Algerians were fighting the French. Even  the policeman who used to protect you in the street can no  longer do so. Someone might just come up to him screaming: There  is no God but Allah; God is great, before knifing him. How can  anyone say such and do such a thing to a soldier who is a  Muslim. But if you ask, however, why did he have to do it, he  will say this is what he was taught. And if you ask him who  taught you this? He will say: I was taught by a Muslim who  came from Sudan or from Jordan. But when they arrest the  teacher, who is from Sudan or from Jordan, and ask him how did  you learn this? He will say I was taught by an Afghan, an  Iranian, or an Indian Muslim. Therefore, this must be a  conspiracy and a foreign invasion.    Heresy is something hard to comprehend. You should, O  brothers, warn your children against it. And in this you must  not show any compassion, because it is a very serious matter  indeed if the number of those people gets bigger. They might  then arm themselves with knives, swords, and weapons and begin  to slaughter anyone who happens to be in their way.    One of them has killed his uncle, the brother of his father  who was taking care of him. They told him: In order to prove  that you are with us you must kill your uncle because he is an  unbeliever and a police officer. You must kill him to prove to  us that you are one of us. They gave him a hunting rifle; he  waited in darkness for his uncle and shot him dead. Is this  Islam? No, this would be madness if everyone has to kill his  father, brother, and neighbor. But such a thing is taking place  in Egypt and Algeria every day. People are killing their  brothers, fathers, uncles, neighbors and sons.    We must be vigilant to this Zandaqa [Islamic movements --  the  current fundamentalism]. This is a dangerous weapon. The  Americans said that the Arabs would be fragmented from inside.  [passage omitted] They have tried it, and in Algeria people are  killing one another, and in Egypt people are killing one  another, while the West and the Jews laugh at this Islam, this  kind of Islam that has succeeded in dividing people. They have  succeeded in mobilizing an Islam and are using it to fragment  the Arab nation and destroy the real Islam. You must be aware  of this. You must be conscious of this conspiracy.    This is yet another weapon. When they recruit somebody to  the  Zandaqah movement, they have recruited a spy. What is amazing  is that they do not come to you and say: We want you to  fragment the Arab nation, to be against pan-Arabism, to fragment  Islam. They do not say to you: We are recruiting you;  Afghanistan is behind the Zandaqah movement, and America and  Israel are also behind it. No. They come to you and use Islam,  in the mosque and say: There is no God but God and Muhammad is  his prophet. They say to you: This is wrong, little by little,  until they bring you under their control and make you capable of  killing your own uncle.    Thus the battle now begins at home as I have already said.  You must be vigilant, starting at home. Everyone must watch  his children. Their teacher could be a Zindiq [an Islamic  fundamentalist] who has come from abroad; a doctor, if he has  come from abroad. You know he has treated your child, your  neighbor, your kinfolk. Perhaps while treating them he gave them  information little by little. Search and examine any books  brought home by your child or somebody else, see whether they  are very old books on Zandaqah or not. [passage omitted].    When faced with a Zindiq, have no pity or mercy toward him.  He must be finished, really. The Zandaqah is an extremely  serious sickness, and he who carries this disease must be  finished. For he who likes Islam, Islam is clear: Read the  Koran, give us a lesson from the Koran, a lesson in religion, in  morals; lead us in prayers, call for prayers, teach us and you  are welcome. But if you set up a party among us, in secret, and  you say: Kill each other, and others are infidels, then never.  [passage omitted]    From now on, everyone must be vigilant to their families,  their children. Islam is clear. If somebody wants to observe  religious rules, he is free to do so. But the movements I have  mentioned to you, they have knives, guns, pistols, bombs and  America is behind them. All the leaders of the Zandaqah  movement are to be found in Germany, America, Britain, and  France. All the movements you are hearing about in Egypt,  Algeria, Syria, and Tunisia, and those who were members of the  Libyan Islamic Brotherhood movement, you have seen them, they  are all in America, Britain, France, and Germany. Western  intelligence is funding them.    What kind of Islam is an Islam funded by Christianity, the  Christians, and the West? Is this Islam? Is this reasonable  Islam, funded by the West, funded and encouraged by their  intelligence services? Is this Islam? We do not want an Islam  whose paymaster is America. We do not want this sort of Islam.    Another weapon is drugs. Orders were given by America and  the Western states to the Israelis to plant hashish in occupied  Palestine, export it secretly to the Arab countries, dump it on  the shores of the Arab countries from Egypt to Morocco in return  for billions of dollars paid by America and the Western states  as a compensation to the Israelis for planting hashish. America  is however fighting hashish everywhere in the world, and is  prepared to go to war against any state planting hashish, except  the Israelis. Why? Because the hashish in occupied Palestine is  meant for the Arab youths, for the Arab countries, to lull the  Arab nation. You must be vigilant to this. Brothers, this is  not a matter for the law or the police. It is a matter for the  family, a matter of education. You are all shepherds and every  shepherd is responsible for his community. Every one must look  after his children and family. [passage omitted]    As I have said, if tomorrow something wrong appears in  Misratah, it will affect the morale of us all, it will affect  the morale of Libya and the Arab nation. They will say here is  an important city, a Mujahid city upon which we rely that has  come out in angry demonstrations about the sewage, for example,  or angry about housing or angry about petrol, or heresy appeared  in it. You must be conscious of these things. I have spoken to  the people in Tripoli, al-Zawiyah, Misratah, Benghazi and  Darnah. There are some cities that should be jealous about the  reputation of Libya. Be aware and do not let the enemy gloat  over our misfortune. Persevere. If the electricity supply is  interrupted for a time or public utilities or transportation are  disrupted in a city such as Misratah, you must persevere and do  not complain, because this will be very important to Libya's  reputation before the West. [passage omitted]    People in places and cities other than those I have  mentioned  can be cross. If something is in shortage, they have the right  to be cross. However, we in the cities I have mentioned have  obligations to avert the enemy's gloating over our misfortune  and because of our past history and our reputation we have to  endure. However, first of all nothing wrong will happen, God  willing. I am telling you this only to remind you. May nothing  wrong happen at all and may everything move forward and  progress. However, these are probabilities. When something  happens in Misratah, we should not be cross.    All the things I have mentioned come and go. Take poverty,  rain, money, houses, pavements, streets, homes and animals, they  all come and go. These are things that can be good at times and  bad at another. We must not let our future rely on them nor  distort our history. [passage omitted]    Brothers, you should be aware of these issues. This is the  confrontation: high morale, mobilization, anger and popular  revolution. These should be translated into a material action  on Libyan land which proves the will of confrontation and  convinces the enemy that these people are determined to live and  to live free. This is what will make them retreat. This is what  made the enemies retreat. But if we only talk and then put our  hand to them and beg them for a dollar, or trade in currencies,  or smuggle medicine, smuggle food products, smuggle Libyan  products, trade in the Libyan dinar, ask them to give us their  canned foods, or ask them to give us their cigarettes or their  drugs, they will laugh at us. They will say: These people only  talk, but in the end they put out their hands to us and beg. We  should reject this. [passage omitted]    The last subject is concerned with the family of Ja'akah.  First of all, you are aware that there is someone with the name  of Ja'akah; however, I do not know his first name. We heard the  Americans say that they would give 1 million American dollars,  300 Libyan dinars [as heard], to anyone who would give them  information about who brought down the Pan Am plane over  Lockerbie.    Ja'akah used to work in Malta; he went over to the Americans  and told them give me the 1 million dollars, I have information  for you. They told him: All right, just give us the  information. They kept him as a prisoner at the American  intelligence; they did not, of course, give him the $1 million  or anything else. He is still under arrest at the American  intelligence. They asked him: What information have you got?  He told them: That plane was brought down by such and such  person who used such and such thing. He concocted a story; the  story they are now repeating. They are saying that they have  confirmed information, but they have only Ja'akah as a witness.    If they have a trial abroad, they will bring him to face  [the  accused] to whom he will say: Yes, you did bring it down; you  put the case aboard and this and that. You did so because you  wanted revenge. The Libyans wanted to avenge the raid of 1986;  they wanted to take their revenge on Britain and America who  killed their children. He will say now they have killed your  children with such a bombing. They wanted to hit two birds with  one stone; they dealt a blow to America and Britain at the same  by bombing one plane which they brought down over Lockerbie, a  British town, he will add.    He said the Libyans did so to avenge the raid. The Americans  and the British have believed his story; they are trying to  convince the world with such a story by using Ja'akah. Ja'akah  is now with the American intelligence; he will lose his life...  [pauses] his liberty forever. He will always remain under their  control; they will never release him.    We started to ask who was Ja'akah? We were told Ja'akah was  someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah, and suddenly everybody started  crying this is very bad news for Suk al-Jumu'ah. Why is the  latter involved in such a scandal? Why did that someone from  Suk al-Jumu'ah put Libya in the mouth of a cannon? Why did that  someone from Suk al-Jumu'ah create such problems for Libya? Was  he a spy?    As soon as Suk al-Jumu'ah heard such a news they were angry.  They said: We must destroy whoever tries to embarrass us; this  one is a spy and we must set fire to his house and farm; we must  destroy the houses of his family. They had a meeting, then I  went to see them in Saradiq. I told them, O brothers, before  you start destroying and setting fire to things, let us hear  their story. Let them come and explain. So they came and said:  We are the family of Ja'akah. We asked them does this one  belong to you? They said yes, he is our son. His father came  and made a speech which you have all heard. He said that anyone  could take his [son's] life; anyone could kill him and that he  will kill him, if he finds him. He added: We, his family, his  father and close family, will kill him if we find him, because  he is an agent who has harmed us.    However, his uncle read to us a report that Ja'akah was in  an institution for mental illnesses. His testimony will,  therefore, not be valid in a court of law. Had he been a sane  person, he would not have been a spy against his country nor  would he have harmed it like this for $1 million. He must be  insane. That is how his uncle construed it.    I remember that people went after them and tried to take  them  apart. Had it not been for the guards, they would have been  killed. We told the people: Please do not touch them; they have  washed their hands of him. However, they told me that this  family was not from Suk al-Jumu'ah; it came from Zawiyah  al-Mahjub. Once the people at Zawiyah al-Mahjub heard the story  they said: If there is any treason in Zawiyah al-Mahjub, we  will have to do what Suk al- Jumu'ah would have done. We must  find this family in order to destroy it and burn it. And you  were told about the feelings of the people over there some time  ago by that Haj [someone in the tent].    Now, as soon as they heard the story, they went over to Suk  al-Jumu'ah and contacted the family of Ja'akah who told them  that there was no relation with between them. They told them  that the spy came from, in fact, the Ja'akah family in Suk  al-Jumu'ah. The Ja'akah here has nothing to do with that  Ja'akah. The only thing they shared was the name. Ja'akah was  a first name here and not a family name like in Zawiyah  al-Mahjub.    That is it, things are now clear. The day before yesterday  the population of Gmatah sent an emissary to me and said: We  heard that the people of Zawiyat al-Mahjub said that this  Ja'akah family is from Gmatah, but the family in Zawiyat  al-Mahjub has the surname of al-Jurushi. Al-Ja'akah is a name,  but the surname is al-Jurushi. Now the al-Jurshi family has had  martyrs and mujahidin. And indeed as the emissary showed us,  this family is a family of mujahidin and martyrs, and surely it  would not do anything wrong.    Now the population of Gmatah is angry and they said: If we  find that the family of this spy Ja'akah is in Gmatah we will  burn and destroy it. Naturally, this is in one way disturbing,  but this is also very useful. The Libyan people have now laid  down a rule, neither a written law nor a decision, all the  Libyan people have laid down a rule which says: Treason will be  hunted down, besieged and destroyed. They have reached the  point where they might have to burn families to death, destroy  homes. This is a frightening matter which we may be able to  prohibit, but in fact no one can prevent it. They said to me:  Even if you install guards around a treasonous family, we will  consider the guards as traitor themselves and we will burn them.  If thousands of people storm a house, who can stop them.  Neither Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, nor police nor anyone can do so.  If people attack treason, by God I will not be able to touch  them, even if they burn down a house or burn a family to death.  Now, thanks be to God, treason is indeed besieged.

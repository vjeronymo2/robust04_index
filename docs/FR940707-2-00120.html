			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Statement as to How Lively Differs From SSA Policy <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under SSA policy, if a determination or decision on a disability claim has become final, the Agency may apply administrative  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> res judicata <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  with respect to a subsequent disability claim under the same title of the Act if the same parties, facts and issues are involved in both the prior and subsequent claims. However, if the subsequent claim involves deciding whether the claimant is disabled during a period that was not adjudicated in the final determination or decision on the prior claim, SSA considers the issue of disability with respect to the unadjudicated period to be a new issue that prevents the application of administrative  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> res judicata. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Thus, when adjudicating a subsequent disability claim involving an unadjudicated period, SSA considers the facts and issues  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> de novo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in determining disability with respect to the unadjudicated period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit concluded that where a final decision of the Secretary after a hearing on a prior disability claim contained a finding about a claimant's residual functional capacity, the Secretary may not make a different finding in adjudicating a subsequent disability claim with an unadjudicated period arising under the same title of the Act as the prior claim unless there is new and material evidence relating to the claimant's residual functional capacity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Explanation of How SSA Will Apply the Decision Within the Circuit <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This Ruling applies only to disability findings in cases involving claimants who reside in Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, or West Virginia at the time of the determination or decision on the subsequent claim at the initial, reconsideration, Administrative Law Judge hearing or Appeals Council level. It applies only to a finding regarding a claimant's residual functional capacity or other finding required at a step in the sequential evaluation process for determining disability provided under 20 CFR 404.1520, 416.920 or 416.924, or a finding required under the evaluation process for determining disability provided under 20 CFR 404.1578, as appropriate, which was made in a final decision by an Administrative Law Judge or the Appeals Council on a prior disability claim. When adjudicating a subsequent disability claim with an unadjudicated period arising under the same title of the Act as the prior claim, adjudicators must adopt such a finding from the final decision by an Administrative Law Judge or the Appeals Council on the prior claim in determining whether the claimant is disabled with respect to the unadjudicated period unless there is new and material evidence relating to such a finding. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 03 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16418 Filed 7&hyph;6&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 4190&hyph;29&hyph;M <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

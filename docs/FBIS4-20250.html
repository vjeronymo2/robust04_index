			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gavin Cordon, Sian Clare and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS </F> ASSOCIATION]    [Text] The Government tonight faced calls for sanctions  against Iran after revealing the Tehran regime provided funds  for the IRA. The demands by Unionist MPs followed Foreign Office  disclosures that the Iranian intelligence service had been  assisting the terrorists.    But Iran's charge d'affaires in London strongly denied his  country supplied either money or weapons. "There is absolutely  no contact between the intelligence services of our country and  the IRA," Gholam Reza Ansari told a news conference.    He was summoned to the Foreign Office earlier today for a  10-minute dressing down from Minister of State Douglas Hogg, in  which it was made clear the flow of cash to terrorist coffers  must cease.    A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are convinced that  there  have been contacts between Iranian intelligence and the IRA. We  take the gravest view of any contact which might assist or  encourage terrorism."    The row marked a downturn in Anglo-Iranian relations already  soured by the long-running dispute over Ayatollah Khomeyni's  "fatwa" calling for the death of Satanic Verses author Salman  Rushdie.    It also raised disturbing questions about the IRA's  continuing ability to attract support for its campaign of  violence from overseas backers.    The Foreign Office's analysis was greeted with scepticism in  Dublin, where Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he knew  nothing of reported links between Iran and the IRA. "I do not  accept any part of the allegations until they are established."    In London, furious Unionist MPs called for tough measures  against Tehran. The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic  Unionist Party, said: "I have no doubt that international  terrorists and these countries that are really led by terrorists  are all in cahoots."    He added: "If the Iranian Government doesn't break off its  relations and show true repentance, sanctions should be imposed  on Iran. There is no difference between a government like Iraq  killing people and Iran supplying arms to terrorists to kill  people. They are both equally guilty."    David Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said:  "Merely slapping their wrists isn't going to be enough. They  should be looking at economic and diplomatic measures to make  life uncomfortable for the Iranian regime."    The matter was also raised by Popular Unionist Sir James  Kilfedder (Down N) in the Commons during Northern Ireland  questions.    The decision to publicly upbraid the Iranians followed  publication of reports in Greek and Middle Eastern newspapers,  although officials said they had had "conclusive" evidence of  the links for some time.    A Government spokesman said in what was thought to be a  reference to the intelligence services MI5 and MI6: "The  Government has reason to believe from independent information  that these reports were accurate."    According to one Greek press report, Iranian representatives  met the IRA in a number of European countries. Cash was handed  over and arms were said to have been promised. The report named  an Iranian official, Amir Hoseyn Taghavi, said to be the head of  the Western European Department of the Iranian Intelligence  Ministry, as being involved in the discussions. Mr. Ansari  said Mr. Taghavi's name was raised by Mr. Hogg during their  meeting today.    The disclosures came at a time of intensified terrorist  violence in Northern Ireland, with eight killings in the  province in the last eight days. They also followed a  crackdown on the IRA's racketeering activities, which provide  much of the funding for its campaign.    In the past the IRA has looked to sympathisers in the United  States and Libya for cash and weapons, so there was little  surprise among terrorism experts that it had reportedly extended  its links to Tehran. Paul Wilkinson, professor of  international relations at St. Andrew's University, said: "The  IRA is always looking around for arms and cash from a state like  Iran that has been involved in terrorism."    Dr. Conor Gearty, a reader of law at King's College, London,  said there was a long history of commercial links between Iran  and the Irish Republic.    "This is not a great surprise. This link with Iran must have  come from intelligence," he said. "It would have been logical  for the IRA to have sought help from Iran. Look how well they  did out of their links with Libya. It would be a case of  `England's enemy is the IRA's friend.'"</p>

			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOLE PROPOSAL  </P> <P> Pat Buchanan's Op-Ed piece, "Bob Dole's Proposal Is Half a Right Idea" (Jan.  21), has some merit. I can see no need for foreign aid, certainly for people  who consistently oppose us in the United Nations.  </P> <P> However, Israel is a special case. The defense aid we give to Denmark, Belgium  and West Germany, to the tune of $139 billion, is earmarked for defense. The  comparable defense aid for Israel, serving the same purpose in the Middle East  as it does in Western Europe, would cost some $59 billion if not for Israel, a  cost Israel underwrites, receiving a modest $3 billion from us.  </P> <P> Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East that maintains U.S. influence  against the Soviet and Arab totalitarians.  </P> <P> Pat Buchanan is right. It is time we put America first and didn't send aid to  people who inherently hate America and democracy. Let's help our friends and  hinder our enemies.  </P> <P> JEROME GREENBLATT  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

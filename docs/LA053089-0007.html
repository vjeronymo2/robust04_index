			<p><P> May 30, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST DEPUTY  </P> <P> In response to " 'Tarnished' LAPD Seeks Outside Check of Crime Laboratory,"  Metro, May 17:  </P> <P> While I'm certain that the reputation of the Los Angeles Police Department may  have suffered as a result of the Ricky Ross incident, it seems to me that the  greater injustice has been suffered by Ross.  </P> <P> The career and reputation of an 18-year veteran of the Los Angeles County  Sheriff's Department with an exemplary record has been permanently blemished.  </P> <P> The recent phenomena of guilt by association has created an atmosphere wherein  entire lives can be destroyed by rumor and innuendo.  </P> <P> With no facts pointing to his guilt other than an "iffy" make on ballistics  test run on a rusted gun found in the trunk of his car, a working peace officer  was arrested, jailed, and subsequently charged with three counts of murder in  the first degree.  </P> <P> In a joint press conference, both LAPD Chief Daryl Gates and Sheriff Sherman  Block indicated that it was a sad day for law enforcement when Ross was  arrested. Well it turns out that they were absolutely correct but not for the  reasons originally stated.  </P> <P> The damage that has been done as a result of what must now be construed as a  premature arrest based upon inconclusive evidence is irreparable.  </P> <P> While the LAPD is willing to do anything to re-establish its reputation, and  the Sheriff's Department has fired Ross, one can't help but wonder how Ross and  his family must feel. Who is going to help him re-establish his reputation,  career and life?  </P> <P> ALLEN HUMPHRIES  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

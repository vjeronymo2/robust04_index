			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Whitbread dilemma The jury remained out following final results from Whitbread which saw a sparkling performance from the retail division reined in by a flat domestic brewing side. Echoing the sentiment, Whitbread 'A' shares edged forward a penny to 482p. The improvement in the group's food and public houses businesses helped other selected drinks stocks, with Scottish &amp; Newcastle gaining 5 at 463p and Bass 8 at 533p. Analysts warned that Whitbread's split fortunes were likely to produce a two-way pull on the stock. Mr Geoff Collyer at NatWest Securities, said: 'Whitbread is one of the most expensive stocks in the sector and not justified by its earnings growth.' Reiterating his negative stance, he added that the company's 6 per cent earnings per share growth for this year and a forecast 8 per cent next year was half of that predicted for the All-Share. Ms Alex Oldroyd at SGST retained a hold stance, adding that improving margins and strong brands could stand Whitbread in good stead should there be a change of sentiment on the sector.</p>

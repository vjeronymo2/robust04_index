			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / S Africa welcomes Vance MR Cyrus Vance, the special UN envoy to South Africa, arrived in Johannesburg last night as business and labour leaders continued efforts to reach agreement on an economic and political charter which would avert a threatened general strike, and help revive constitutional negotiations, writes Michael Holman in Johannesburg. Some employer groups are expressing reservations about what would amount to an alliance with the African National Congress and the unions, with the South African Agricultural Union withdrawing from talks, while the Afrikaans Chamber of Commerce may attach conditions for its support.</p>

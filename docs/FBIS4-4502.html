			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Cooperative fields of  Korea are animated with spring farming.    The agricultural working people of South Hwanghae Province,  a  bread basket of the west coast, are pulling their full weight on  sowing of seed rice on cold-beds and ploughing of paddy and  non-paddy fields, true to the highly important teachings given  by the great leader President Kim Il-song when he met  agricultural officials of the province in March last year.    The great leader visited co-op farms in Yonan, Paechon and  Chongdan Counties of the province in August that year, went out  to fields and indicated ways of more successful farming,  acquainting himself with the number of ears per pyong [one pyong  is six feet square] and the number of grains per ear.    Always concerned for the development of agriculture of the  country and the happiness of the people, he has made tireless  trips of on-the-spot guidance to rural communities since the  liberation of the country. He conversed with farmers and  discussed farming with them at the edge of a field in a valley  in a chilly breeze of early spring, at a patch of a paddy field  under a scorching sun in summer and at a humble farmhouse till  late at night in winter.    In Korea the chuche method of farming was created, a new  agricultural guidance system was established and theses on the  socialist rural question was published. The great leader put  them forward by consummating the will of the peasants while  giving on- the-spot guidance to rural villages. He published  theses on the socialist rural question in February 1964 and has  made uninterrupted trips of on-the-spot guidance for its  realization. Not minding a muddy road of the countryside on a  rainy day, a road through the marsh of the tideland and a steep  mountain, he called on agricultural working people and converted  all the land of the country including the Kindung plain of  Hwangju, Singyemiudung and the Paekmu plateau which had been  forsaken as a barren land and tideland-turned fields on the west  coast into fertile soil.    He unfolded a bright prospect of rural construction at a  cooperative farm on the west coast, drawing a map of the  village. At a workteam of a farm at the foot of Mt. Kuwol he  indicated ways for the comprehensive mechanization of  agriculture.    Last year, he guided the work of the countryside, traveling  hundreds of kilometres to northernmost Yonsa County, North  Hamgyong Province, and Paekmu plateau in Yanggang Province,  tideland-turned fields and Kwail (fruit) County on the west  coast and the Yonbaek plain adjacent to the Military Demarcation  Line.    Indeed, our countryside which was a pronoun of backwardness  and poverty in the past has been turned into a modern socialist  countryside good to work and live in under the wise guidance of  the great leader President Kim Il-song.</p>

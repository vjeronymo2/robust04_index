			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Books: Live and be damned ALL THE TROUBLE IN THE WORLD by PJ O'Rourke Picador Pounds 14.99, 344 pages Are you dreading the future? Do predictions of population explosion and environmental apocalypse keep you up at night? Do you keep one eye on the ozone layer and the other on the number of preservatives in your dinner? Well, worry no more. P. J. O'Rourke is here to tell you that everything is going to be all right. In case you don't know, O'Rourke is a libertarian humorist who made a name for himself in the Reagan/Thatcher years as that most oxymoronic of creatures - a right wing party animal. With books like Republican Party Reptile and Give War a Chance, he dared to suggest that conservatism can be fun. In All the Trouble in the World, he takes on the world's doom-mongers and worry-warts, maintaining that the dark clouds on our planet's horizon are the product of their hot air rather than any real crisis. His premise is simple. 'Life is sweet. But you could spend a long time reading, going to the movies, and watching TV and not hear this mentioned . . . we should be enjoying ourselves, and we are not.' The reason for the psychic sourness is that we have let ourselves be conned by environmentalists, UN bureaucrats and concerned politicians into thinking that the world's a mess, when in fact life is better than ever. To support this proposition, O'Rourke visits Bangladesh, Somalia, the Amazon, Haiti, the former Yugoslavia and Vietnam, finding that people everywhere are pretty much just folks and that, all in all, things are less horrible than they used to be. Bangladesh may be overcrowded, but it is no more densely populated than your basic California suburb, while life expectancy, disease control and the infrastructure are improving all the time (in Bangladesh, that is.) Similarly, Vietnam, though still nominally Marxist, has largely thrown off the shackles of central planning to embrace a market economy that allows it both to grow and to forget the horrors of war. And as for the precious rainforest, well, have you ever had chiggers? The author gets them while on in Brazil, and, after weeks of unrelieved itching, finds the prospect of deforestation considerably less repugnant. O'Rourke is at his best when simply hanging out with people, observing the way they live and soaking up the hospitality which seems to increase geometrically the farther one strays from centres of wealth. He is particularly enamoured of the Haitians, who invite him to witness a voodoo ceremony, and the Vietnamese, who possess awe-inspiring industriousness and good cheer. He is also a gifted humorist with a deadly accurate eye, never sharper than when he points out that 'starving children are cute . . . Steven Spielberg's ET owes a lot to the Biafran-Bangladeshi-Ethiopian model of adorable suffering.' O'Rourke proves less convincing when he puts on his thinking cap. When he claims the current mess in Yugoslavia is an example of 'multiculturalism in practice', he gets it exactly wrong - Bosnia is what happens when multicultural tolerance is not being practiced. And when the author points to the truly horrific pollution of Eastern Bloc countries as something that inevitably happens when government manages the environment, he blatantly ignores the state-regulated cleanliness of many Northern European nations. These lapses are a pity - they sound a bitter note in an otherwise engaging book. Rhetoric is a poor substitute for belly laughs. More visits with resilient people and less theorising about lousy government would have gone further to proving the author's point.</p>

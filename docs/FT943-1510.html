			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: MDIS misses target with Pounds 5m - Disappointed market knocks 49% off share price The share price of McDonnell Information Systems, the Hemel Hempstead-based computing services group, halved in value yesterday after interim results which were substantially below market expectations. The shares fell by 49 per cent from 216p to 112p. On Wednesday, Aerostructures Hamble, the former British Aerospace aircraft components subsidiary, floated in May, suffered a 50p drop in its share price to 73p, after it warned of difficulties with several contracts. Pre-tax profits at MDIS for the six months to June 30 were Pounds 5.1m - 33 per cent down on the Pounds 7.53m achieved in the comparable period, and up to Pounds 4m short of analysts' forecasts. Mr Jerry Causley, chairman, pointed to delays in decision making in the public sector, which had pushed a number of orders into the second half of the year, and a failure to sell more copies of its flagship banking software package. There would be some improvement in the second half, but full-year results would inevitably be below those of 1993. MDIS is the latest in a series of computing services companies which have produced disappointing and unexpected results after floating. Turnover fell to Pounds 68.6m (Pounds 70.4m). Earnings were 28 per cent down at 3.38p (4.86p). An interim dividend of 2.3p will be paid. MDIS came to the market in March at 260p a share through a placing and public offering which valued the group at Pounds 260m. The placing and offer was the biggest in the information technology sector this year. The company had previously been the subject of a management buy-out from McDonnell Douglas of the US. Mr Causley said the underlying performance had been strong, with trading margins maintained in the public sector, commercial and industrial business areas. Some of its current difficulties are expected to be resolved in the second half, when a number of public sector orders, including four large police contracts, are expected to come through. Research and development, on which an extra Pounds 750,000 was spent in the first half, is expected to return to budget. Mr Causley warned, however: 'Local government business has been impacted by increasing uncertainty following the Banham Commissions's recommendations and the health business, following a good first half is also seeing slippage in order confirmations.' The performance of the banking package PRO-IV is critical. MDIS made its first sale to the Austrian Kontrol Bank last year, but has failed to find other buyers. The complete package costs up to Pounds 5m, so a small number of orders could make a significant difference to the year's outcome. MDIS's broker, NatWest Markets, has cut its estimate of pre-tax profit for the year to Pounds 17m - 11.4p of earnings - from Pounds 25.7m, and anticipates only Pounds 19m in 1995. It predicts a dividend of 7p a share for both years.</p>

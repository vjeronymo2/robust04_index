			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by BELINFORM correspondent Viktor Sakhankov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Minsk, 9 June -- Speaking on Wednesday [8 June]  evening before representatives of workers' collectives in the  city of Mogilyov, prime minister of Belarusia Vyacheslav Kebich  expressed confidence in the inevitability of a durable alliance  between the three fraternal peoples of Russia, Ukraine and  Belarusia. He believes this is determined by the historical  necessity to live together, the economic interests and ancient  cultural ties.    Belarusians cannot and will not be spongers of Russians  while  participating in inter-state division of labor and cooperating  with them on a mutually advantageous basis in all spheres of  life, the premier noted.    The agreement on the unification of the monetary systems of  the two countries is the first step towards a closer alliance,  and the head of the Belarusian government is doing everything in  his power to put into practice these aspirations of the peoples  of both countries.    Touching on national minorities in sovereign Belarusia,  Vyacheslav Kebich said that for him such a term was  unacceptable. People of different nationalities live in  Belarusia and there cannot be any pretext for inter-ethic  strife, the Belarusian prime minister emphasized.</p>

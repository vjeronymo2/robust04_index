			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / At last, Bush gets his first opponent: The emergence of a Democrat presidential hopeful THE FIRST Democrat willing to try his luck in the race next year for US President has emerged from the political wilderness. Mr Paul Tsongas, a former Massachusetts senator who yesterday announced his candidacy for his party's nomination, has everything against him - except a record of beating impossible odds. The times do not seem propitious for any Democratic candidate, which is why Mr Tsongas is, so far, alone in the race. Although the lustre of Operation Desert Storm has dimmed and the recession seems inclined to linger, President George Bush is still extraordinarily popular. Mr Bush has also proved himself a politician who will stop at very little to win elections; he could well make mincemeat of this unabashed idealist who dares opponents to put their own beliefs on the table because he thinks presidential campaigns should be a debate over issues. Mr Tsongas's admirers say he is a deep thinker, unafraid to take unpopular stands. He admits that he would have voted against the Gulf war had he been in the Senate; he pushes a petrol tax and nuclear energy. Mr Tsongas has not so much been out of the national limelight as much as he was barely ever in it. He says he has been the underdog in every political contest he ever entered. After serving two congressional terms and one in the Senate, he left Washington seven years ago aged 42 with leukaemia and little hope of surviving. With bone marrow transplants, massive chemotherapy and radiation, he beat the affliction into remission and emerged 'thin as a rail, bald as a billiard ball' and with a belief that he was spared for a purpose. Since leaving Washington, he says, 'I've travelled to places in the mind that I'd never visited before, and things which were boring to me are now wondrous and things which were wondrous now really don't interest me.' His mission is his message, outlined in an 80-page book, A Call to Economic Arms, a pro-business manifesto designed both to reform the Democratic Party and to halt economic decline by re-invigorating the industrial sector. Democrats must do more than seek to redistribute the national wealth, he says, because the economic pie is shrinking. 'They are going to have to sit down with the business community and jointly establish policies of wealth creation.' He would seek energy independence through conservation and nuclear power, make selective cuts in capital gains taxes to promote competitiveness, provide new seed money and tax credits for research and development, abolish quarterly reports for businesses. He decries 'demagogic appeals to protectionism' by the Democratic Party as well as 'corporate bashing, class warfare, and ideology'. Yet he denounces the selling of US assets to foreign interests as 'all the blood, sweat and tears of our forebears on the auction block'.</p>

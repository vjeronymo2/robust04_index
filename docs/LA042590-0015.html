			<p><P> April 25, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OJAI;  </P> <P> COUNCIL OKS RAISE FOR 24 EMPLOYEES  </P> <P> The Ojai City Council unanimously approved a 10% pay hike Tuesday for city  employees, a move designed to halt what was described as high turnover.  </P> <P> The average annual salary of 24 full-time Ojai city workers will rise from  $28,324 to $31,487 as of May 1.  </P> <P> The raises are long overdue, said Mayor Nina Shelley. While there are many  advantages to living or working in the Ojai Valley, "that doesn't pay the  rent," Shelley said.  </P> <P> Acting on the results of the city's first salary study in a decade, the council  agreed with its findings that 11 of the employees have the lowest salaries  among 11 other cities studied similar to Ojai in size or service level.  </P> <P> Planning Director William Prince will see his salary rise from $47,532 to  $51,912, which will still be under the survey median of $54,564.  </P> <P> Public Works Director Stan Moore, whose current salary is $51,192, will receive  $54,504 next year, or above the survey median of $51,192.  </P> <P> City Manager Andy Belknap, who recently received a separate raise, told the  council that the city can afford the $11,566 needed to cover the raises through  June, since 1989-90 revenues have exceeded expectations. The $69,400 in  additional salary outlay for next year will be included in the upcoming budget,  he said. THIA BELL  </P></p>

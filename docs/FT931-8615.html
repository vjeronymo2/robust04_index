			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / UK Company News: GPG buys Brown Shipley stake THE SMOOTH passage of Brown Shipley Holdings, the investment and broking business, into the arms of its largest shareholder was called into question yesterday when it was disclosed that Guinness Peat Group had bought shares at above the offer price. GPG, the UK investment vehicle for Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand entrepreneur, has bought a 7.5 per cent stake in BSH. The last purchase of shares was at 33p, which is 3p above Kredietbank Luxembourgeoise's offer. KBL already owns 29.8 per cent of the equity. The move by GPG was welcomed by one shareholder who said it was proving difficult to decide whether KBL's offer was adequate. BSH's share price gained 2p to close at 35p. GPG would only say it had taken the stake for investment purposes. In last November's document accompanying the lifting of a near-two-year suspension of its shares, it said it planned to identify opportunities for acquisition and investment particularly in the UK 'to achieve a more even balance between the level of investment in Europe and Australasia.' Two weeks ago BSH's board reluctantly recommended KBL's offer, which values the group at Pounds 4.8m against net assets of Pounds 8.1m. The sale appeared a forced one because KBL was about to pass on claims of up to Pounds 2.4m arising from its purchase of Brown Shipley &amp; Co, the merchant bank, last year. When news of the claims and KBL's potential offer broke, BSH's share price fell from 51p to 35p.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Sergey Balykov for TASS] </F>   [Text] Kiev May 26 TASS -- Ukrainian Acting Prime Minister  Yukhym Zvyahilskyy believes the talks in Moscow on the Black Sea  Fleet and the Crimea ended in a draw. "In Moscow we did not  win, but did not lose either," he told UKRINFORM upon his return  from the Russian capital.    Zvyahilskyy described the talks as "very tense and nervous."  "We tried to find variants of a positive solution of the tasks  set by the Ukrainian president. We made concessions, but only  those which could not result in the loss of Ukrainian wealth,  its independence and sovereignty," he stressed.    The head of government said that five variants of the  agreement, including that of the president, were submitted for  Russian consideration. "The fact that none of them was adopted  does not mean a defeat," he stressed and added that positive  moments achieved in Moscow would help resume talks "more  concretely, on the most acute issue."    The second round of negotiations is expected to begin in  Kiev  in 10-15 days.    According to Zvyahilskyy, during the Moscow talks "severe  fight was going on for each word, for each sentence in the  document which can help untie the Black Sea knot." He believes  that the sides succeeded in general to positively solve the  problem of sharing the disputed navy. Sevastopol will house the  major base of the Russian Navy, while Balaklava and Donuzlav  will become the main bases of the Ukrainian fleet, according to  him.    "Donuzlav is a mighty and well-equipped base and Ukraine had  no serious objections" about it. "Disagreements emerged after  the Russian side raised the issue of basing its navy in other  ports," he explained.    Zvyahilskyy hopes that the second round of negotiations will  be "more constructive" and will result in the signing of the  document on the Black Sea Fleet.</p>

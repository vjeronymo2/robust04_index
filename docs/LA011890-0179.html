			<p><P> January 18, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GIRL, 10, IS WOUNDED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING  </P> <P> A 10-year-old Pasadena girl sleeping next to her mother was wounded in the  thigh when a shower of bullets pierced the walls of their home during a  drive-by shooting at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday in the 600 block of N. Carmelo Ave.  </P> <P> About 30 shots were fired from three weapons wielded by several suspects in a  car, Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey said.  </P> <P> One bullet struck the child's left leg and broke her thigh bone, Yancey said.  She was taken to St. Luke's Medical Center, where she was reported in stable  condition.  </P> <P> Police believe the shooting is gang related because a relative of the injured  girl is a gang member and had recently lived at the house, Yancey said. But he  declined to provide the child's name or further information.  </P></p>

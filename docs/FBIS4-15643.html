			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [RUKH-PRESS report: "Another Hypothesis"] </F>   [Text] The abduction of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn was  perpetrated by the Russian special services, claims Stanislaw  Husak, deputy chairman of the United Party of Belarus [ADPB] and  member of the Belarusian Popular Front Council [BNF].    As everybody knows, the second international conference on  the Baltic-Black Sea oil collector (BChNK) was to be held in  Kiev on 29-30 January of this year. The conference's initiating  group elected Mykhaylo Boychyshyn chairman of the organizational  committee. All documents concerning the preparations and course  of the conference disappeared with him. The conference was to  be attended not only by specialists and government economists  from Latvia, Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine, but also private  bankers and entrepreneurs who had previously voiced their  readiness to establish the Regional Bank of Development. The  bank is expected to finance all design and assembly work  connected with the implementation of the idea behind the BChNK.    As Stanislaw Husak, author of the BChNK concept, notes, the  implementation of this idea would diametrically change the  geopolitical situation in the Baltic-Black Sea region. If the  collector is built, Russia will lose its monopolistic status in  the four countries' raw materials markets, and, perspectively,  also Estonia's. Such a situation would contradict with Russia's  aspirations. Therefore, Stanislaw Husak believes, the Russian  special services might have kidnapped Mykhaylo Boychyshyn to  hinder the conference. All the more so, since such a conference  held two months before the elections could have significantly  influenced the course of elections and bolstered the authority  of Rukh as a political organization.    Although Stanislaw Husak sent a report to Belarusian Prime  Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich on the BChNK project as early as the  spring of 1993, he has never received any response. The ADPB  and BNF leadership decided therefore that it is necessary to  support the project through politics. The Belarusian opposition  applied to the Peasant Party of Latvia, the Lithuanian Sajudis,  and the Ukrainian Rukh for assistance. In the summer of 1993,  the first international BChNK conference was held. The high  level of the conference was confirmed by the participation of  Ints Jansons, director general of the Latvian conglomerate  Latvijas Nafta; Arimantas Dragunevicius, Lithuanian Government  adviser for energy issues; Fedor Molochko, director of the  Belarusian Thermal Power Engineering Institute; and Stanislav  Ivanytskyy, deputy engineer general of the Ukrahazproekt  Institute. A feasibility study on the idea of BChNK was  conducted during the conference. The invited specialists in  design, assembly, and operation of oil pipelines confirmed the  feasibility of the project. Members of delegations representing  the governments of participating countries supported the idea of  building the BChNK.    The Latvian and Lithuanian authorities have recently  established committees to support the BChNK project. Despite  the mysterious disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, the  initiating group is preparing the second international BChNK  conference in Minsk. The timing of the conference is currently  being discussed, and the necessary documents are being  reconstructed. Stanislaw Husak has been elected chairman of the  organizational committee.</p>

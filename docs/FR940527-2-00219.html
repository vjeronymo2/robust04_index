			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This criterion is generally more restrictive than Criterion 4. The existing condition must pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the target population. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Criterion 9_Supports Other Federal or State Programs Being Undertaken in the Community or Deals with the Adverse Impact of Another Recent Federal or State Action. The Other Federal or State Program or Action Must Be of Substantial Size or Impact in the Community in Relation to the Proposed Program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The application must contain a complete description of the Federal or State Program(s) (excluding other CDBG Programs) which currently are underway, or a complete description of the adverse impact of a recent Federal or State action (e.g. the closing of a military base). A Federal or State program or action not yet initiated will be considered only where the application provides documentation establishing the certainty of, and the approximate commencement date of, the described program or action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed CDBG Program must demonstrate clearly the magnitude of the effect of the Federal or State Program or action on the community. The degree to which the proposed CDBG Program will support the Federal or State Program, and/or the extent to which the adverse impact of Federal or State action will be mitigated, also must be demonstrated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above, the nature and costs of the proposed activities will be considered in determining the degree of impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Criterion 10_Supports Energy Production or Conservation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This criterion will be judged, and points will be awarded, based upon the community's ability to demonstrate that the proposed program will support energy production or conservation. Applicants are urged to develop innovative approaches toward addressing energy needs with Small Cities CDBG funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Energy considerations can be a factor in most activities proposed by smaller communities. Attention should focus on new methods of producing energy or conserving energy where possible. In developing and evaluating proposals, there are a number of energy aspects to consider. The following factors will be considered: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Cost efficiency_Relationship of dollar amount to benefits to be derived. The applicant must document estimates of energy costs which are to be saved as a result of the proposed program. The proposed program should make maximum use of non-CDBG resources as well as CDBG funds. Appropriate documentation must be provided to ensure that the proposal is economically feasible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The extent to which the proposed program will support other programs currently aimed at addressing energy production or conservation needs of the community. From a management standpoint, proposed projects should be consistent with needs or objectives of any plan for energy management or conservation. Applicants should pursue the availability of other resources from Federal or State energy related programs. The degree of commitment of other resources should be established. State energy offices, private as well as municipally-owned utility companies, and home heating oil companies may be appropriate entities to be involved in the development and planning of proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The application should address whether the project is based on appropriate technology, materials and methods to maximize energy conservation. Engineering reports or studies would be appropriate evidence to support the overall feasibility of the project. The conversion of existing facilities, where appropriate, rather than proposing new construction may be more economical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _While housing rehabilitation programs which include weatherization/winterization components will be considered, they generally will not be presumed as addressing a severe need unless unique conditions are specifically identified and cost savings are properly documented. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Evaluation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Documentation for the 65 points for these items is the responsibility of the applicant. Claims of outstanding performance must be based upon actual accomplishments. Clear, precise documentation will be required. Maps must have a census tract or block numbering area (BNA), and they must be in accordance with the 1990 Census data. Additionally, maps must identify the locations of areas with minorities by census tract or BNA. If there are no minority areas, state so on the map. Only population data from the 1990 Census will be acceptable for purposes of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please note that a ``minority'' is a person belonging to, or culturally identified as, a member of any one of the following racial/ethnic categories: Black, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Alaskan Native. For the purposes of this section, the separate category_``women'' _is not considered a minority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Counties claiming points under this criterion must use county-wide statistics (excluding entitlement communities). In the case of joint applications, points will be awarded based on the performance of the lead entity only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following factors will be used to judge outstanding performance in these areas. Please note that the criteria are the same for Comprehensive and Single Purpose applicants, and that points for outstanding performance may be claimed under each criterion:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Housing Achievements <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (40 points total).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) 20 Points_Provision of Assisted Housing_Providing assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families, located in a manner which provides housing choice in areas outside of minority, or low- and moderate-income concentrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Points will be awarded where both of the following criteria are met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) More than one-third of the housing assistance provided by the applicant in the last five (5) years (excluding Section 8 existing and housing assistance provided in place) has been in Census Tracts (CT) or Block Numbering Areas (BNA) having a percentage of minority population which is less than the minority population in the community as a whole; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) With regard to the Section 8 Existing Program, a community must show the location (CT or BNA) of its currently occupied family units by race/ethnicity. Points will be awarded if more than one-half of the minority assisted families occupy units in areas which have a lower percentage of minority population than that of the community as a whole.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A community with no minorities must show the extent to which its assisted housing is located outside areas of concentrations of low- and moderate-income persons. In order to receive points under this criterion, applicants should follow the process outlined in (i) and (ii) above, substituting low- and moderate-income persons and families for minority persons or families. Applicants addressing the first criterion must use a map indicating the location of all assisted housing and a narrative which indicates the number of units and the type of assisted housing. The map also must show the general location of low- and moderate-income households and minority households, giving the numbers and percentages for both.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To qualify as housing assistance provided, the units being claimed must be part of a project located outside minority or lower income concentrated areas which has, at a minimum, received a firm commitment from the funding agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Points also may be awarded for efforts which enable low- and moderate-income persons to remain in their neighborhood when such neighborhoods are experiencing revitalization and substantial displacement as a result of private reinvestment. Applicants requesting points under this criterion would not need to meet the requirements of (i) and (ii) in order to receive points. Points will be awarded where more than one half of the families displaced were able to remain in their original neighborhood through the assistance of the applicant. Applicants must show that: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

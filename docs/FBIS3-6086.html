Moreover, the resolution  "protests with a sense of fury" against the U.S. military, the  Defense Facilities Agency, and other government agencies, urging  them to "take all possible measures to prevent similar accidents  from happening again."    Nine members of the same town assembly's Special Committee  for Base Affairs (chaired by Morisada Inamine) visited the KAB  on 9 March and inspected the site of the accident.    The resolution strongly criticizes the U.S. military,  saying:  "Strong and foul smells enveloped the entire area, and the  highly flammable material provoked fear among the residents.  The anger of the townspeople has reached its outer limit.  Accidents frequently occurred following the 1967 incident  dubbed the "flammable well" and... These are the consequences  of careless base management, which ignores the well-being of the  residents."    Members of the town assembly plan to visit relevant  organizations to file a protest in early April following the end  of the regular session in March.</p>

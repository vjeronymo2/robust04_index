			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 13 KYODO -- The Paris Club of official  creditors appears likely to agree on deferring 1 billion dollars  or so in Russian debt payments falling due in March or April,  government sources said Thursday [13 January].    The agreement is expected as early as January 17 when the  Paris Club holds a meeting, the sources said. The Paris Club is  an informal grouping of creditor nations which meet regularly in  the French capital.    Russia's official creditors so far have agreed to reschedule  some 15 billion dollars of the country's foreign debt falling  due last year for 10 years, with a five-year grace period for  interest payments.    They are also to defer Russian debt payments falling due in  1994 on condition that Russia and the International Monetary  Fund agree on economic reforms needed for IMF loans.    But a majority of Paris Club members now believe that a debt  rescheduling deal for Russian debt payments falling due by April  is needed unconditionally as a temporary measure because Russia  faces slow progress in economic reforms due to political unrest,  the sources said.</p>

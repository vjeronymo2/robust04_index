			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Management: Are you a workaholic? The British have never admired work for its own sake. They have tended to side with Oscar Wilde who noted that work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do. Americans have been known to consider 'workaholism' a virtue, a form of patriotism, the way to win friends and influence people. But the workaholic has self-doubts. He or she may be seen as a pathetic soul unable to experience pleasure. Workaholics shun vacations; because their jobs are their passion they do not feel they need to get away from it all. The anxiety that precedes taking any holiday break seems more trouble than it is worth. Finally, workaholics are afraid that they would lose complete control of their jobs if they left their desks, albeit briefly. Why not assess yourself? 1.

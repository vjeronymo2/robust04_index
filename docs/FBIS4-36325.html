			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Highlights" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Unsigned Agreement"] </F>   [Text] The trade and currency link with the West Bank is of  great concern to Jordan. It is currently the most important  economic issue because what is agreed today will govern this  relationship for many years to come. However, Jordan continues  to refrain from entering the real battle.    The interest in the Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement  is exaggerated. This agreement has not been signed because the  Palestinian leadership does not consider it a priority, being  busy pursuing more important things. It must be said that  points in the draft agreement which the Palestinian leadership  said needed more study are of no concern to anyone and can be  deleted, and therefore, the delay in signing the agreement is  intentional.    We say that the Jordanian interest in the economic agreement  with the PLO is exaggerated because even if it takes place, it  will be no more than a moral obligation, nonbinding and  inapplicable except in as much as Israel allows. The autonomy  government is not empowered to negotiate with Jordan and reach  agreements with it because it has no foreign policy powers and  no sovereignty to reach agreements with states. Thus, the  agreement is no more than an agreement of intentions with the  PLO in Tunis and not with the autonomous government.    Some Jordanian officials have reservations about the Paris  Israeli-Palestinian economic agreement on the pretext that it  does not give Jordan the economic advantages it had expected and  were promised in the 7 January 1994 economic agreement with the  PLO because the Palestinian side could not obtain more  advantages for Jordan due to Israel's intransigence.    However, the question is: Why does Jordan expect the  Palestinian side, which is weak and has no sovereignty, to  obtain for it rights and economic advantages in the West Bank  and Gaza? Why doesn't Jordan seek these rights and advantages  within the joint Jordanian-Israeli-U.S. economic committee?  When will the Jordanian officials stop evading confrontation  and blaming the Palestinian side for accepting an agreement that  gives priority to Israel's interests at Jordan's expense?    It is no secret that Mr. Yasir 'Arafat does not want strong  economic relations with Jordan because he wants an independent  state and is apprehensive of real or imaginary Jordanian  domination. Dr. 'Abd-al-Fattah Abu-Shukr, member of the  negotiating Palestinian delegation, said that the delegation did  not receive any instructions from the PLO leadership during the  first five rounds of talks and that the delegation did not  return to Tunis at all during these rounds, contrary to what  used to take place during negotiations with Jordan when  facsimile messages were exchanged with Tunis every half hour  because Tunis had apprehensions with respect to Jordan that did  not exist toward Israel.</p>

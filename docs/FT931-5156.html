			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Mitterrand to press for emergency G7 summit FRANCOIS Mitterrand, the French president, will meet US President Bill Clinton for the first time tomorrow to get to know the new US leader and push for an emergency Group of Seven summit to discuss an international economic growth initiative. The Washington meeting, to be held a fortnight before the French general election, in which Mr Mitterrand's Socialist party looks set for defeat by the right, seems as much designed to tell French voters that the president plans to keep the upper hand in foreign policy as to forge links with the new US administration. On March 16 Mr Mitterrand plans to visit Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, just as the French election campaign enters its last few days before the first round of voting on March 21. Mr Mitterrand will press Mr Clinton for an emergency G7 meeting before the July summit in Tokyo, a move supported by Germany, said Mr Jean Musitelli, the president's spokesman. 'What is clear is that the president will be sitting in the front chair' at such international gatherings, he added. France did not plan to abandon its tradition of a single chief in international affairs. The French president will use the Washington meeting to seek clarification of the US administration's stance on the stalled multilateral trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Clinton's recent complaint over subsidies to the European Airbus consortium and US anti-dumping duties on imported steel are also on his agenda. At home, the opposition was showing increasing confidence yesterday in its ability to hold its own against Mr Mitterrand in a government of cohabitation between the Socialist president and a right-wing parliamentary majority. Mr Bernard Pons, the parliamentary whip for the conservative RPR party, yesterday warned Mr Mitterrand not to try to block the future government's actions. At a rally of 30,000 RPR supporters at Le Bourget, north of Paris, Mr Pons accused Mr Mitterrand of handing out top jobs in the public administration to friends, to keep as much power as possible. If the president tried to obstruct the new government, the future prime minister would call repeated confidence motions in the parliament, Mr Pons said.</p>

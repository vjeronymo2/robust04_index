The main Es55.7bn loan will go to AutoEuropa, the Es300bn Ford/Volkswagen joint venture that will begin manufacturing passenger vehicles in southern Portugal in 1995. Two loans totalling Es17bn will be used to finance small and medium-sized companies in industry, industrial services and tourism. Two other loans of Es6bn each will finance roads. Among other loans, one of Es5.7bn will be used to improve energy facilities on the Azores islands. The loans bring total EIB lending to Portugal in 1993 to Es137bn. But other approved projects are expected to lift the total to Es330bn.</p>

Gayne Rescher's work on "Single Women, Married Men" won best  movie of the week, and a "Murder, She Wrote" episode, "Night of the Tarantula"  photographed by John Elsenbach, won as a regular series.  </P> <P> The awards, in their fourth year, also gave a lifetime achievement nod to  Stanley Cortez, whose work ranged from Orson Welles' "The Magnificent  Ambersons" to "The Three Faces of Eve." Linwood Dunn, visual effects pioneer,  was given an honorary award for such notable effects as King Kong's swatting at  planes from the top of the Empire State Building. A first-ever board of  governors award went to Gregory Peck, cited as a lifetime friend of camera  operators and the craft of cinematography. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Begin Constant recording]  FRAPH [Revolutionary Front for the Promotion and Progress of  Haiti] has askws the Clinton administration to remove the ships  operating off the Haitian coast because of the country's  volatile situation, and to avoid all defensive reaction from the  population.    FRAPH commands all its supporters to closely cooperate with  the Haitian Armed Forces during this period of hostility created  by the threat of intervention: We are saying: Grenadiers to the  assault. It is not important who dies. FRAPH says it hopes  President Clinton and the United Nations realize that the crisis  is political, not military. [end recording]    [Announcer] Furthermore, FRAPH denounces the new demands the  United Nations is making of the military. The organization led  by Emmannuel Constant states that the Governors Island agreement  does not provide, at any point, for the departure of the police  chief in Port-au-Prince nor of members of the Army General  Staff, but in its most recent stand, the United Nations Security  Council mentions the resignation of members of the General  Staff. Moreover, Constant demands the withdrawal of the military  from the negotiation file. The country now has a president in  Justice Jonassaint, maintains Emmannuel Constant. FRAPH favors  the professionalization of the Army and the separation of the  police and the Army. FRAPH calls on the government of Justice  Jonassaint to make reforms in public administration and to  prosecute President Aristide and resigning Prime Minister Robert  Malval.    [Begin Constant recording] FRAPH asks the executive to give  the necessary orders for the examining office to issues  summonses for the following citizens: Aristide, deposed  president of the Republic of Haiti; Prime Minister Malval;  Ambassador Jean Casimir; Attorney Michael Barnes, for  embezzlement -- see Mr. Malval's letter of 14 December 1994.    FRAPH solicits help for the Haitian state and the Haitian  justice system from the Armed Forces and the forces of order in  retrieving some of the administrative files that were taken by  ministers of the Aristide/Malval government. As agreed, FRAPH  hopes that the Ministry of Commerce will succeed in reducing the  prices of essential products by 40 percent. Bravo. [applause]  [end recording]    [Announcer] FRAPH also criticizes the international civilian  mission, which it accuses of writing subjective reports. FRAPH  asks the observers to stop their investigation on the human  rights situation in Haiti. FRAPH claims it is center-right and  denounces the extreme right in Haiti, which it calls  opportunistic and without political vision.</p>

			<p><P> February 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Federal Aviation Administration said it has no plans to speed up mandatory  changes in cargo door locks on older Boeing 747s even though investigators are  looking at a door malfunction as the most likely cause of the accident that  killed nine people over the Pacific Ocean. The FAA last summer gave airlines up  to two years to strengthen locks on the jets. As for Friday's accident, in  which part of the side of a United Airlines 747 ripped off, FAA spokesman Fred  Farrar said, "first of all, we've got to find out what happened" before issuing  additional orders.  </P></p>

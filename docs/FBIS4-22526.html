			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yuriy Sergeyevich Kuchiyev, honored captain </F> of the Arktika, by Dmitriy Struzhentsov: "We Are Quietly Sinking  to the Bottom: Yuriy Kuchiyev Asserts that There Is No  Alternative to Russian Nuclear-Powered Icebreakers"; St.  Petersburg, date not given]    [Text] The name of Yuriy Sergeyevich Kuchiyev is well  known, and not just to polar explorers. In the comparatively  recent past, almost everyone in the former Union had heard it.  Kuchiyev was stand-by captain of the firstcomer of the domestic  nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet, the Lenin. The first cruise in  navigational history of a surface ship -- the nuclear-powered  icebreaker Arktika -- in the North Pole area was made under his  command.    Now the honored captain of the Arktika is no longer  sailing, but works on shore. As before, however, he remains a  passionate champion and staunch defender of the nuclear-powered  fleet. And there is something to defend and to defend against.    We became acquainted back in the days when the  beautiful icebreaker Arktika left on its first cruise. Quite a  few years have passed since then. In all, Yuriy Kuchiyev sailed  on icebreakers for more than 40 years, including more than 20  years on ships with nuclear-powered units.    [Struzhentsov] How do you feel these days? -- I asked  Kuchiyev. -- Did the decades spent on nuclear-powered ships, in  constant proximity to nuclear reactors, have any effect on your  health?    [Kuchiyev] I gave up being a captain on the bridge on the  insistence of physicians, because of ischemic heart disease. Did  I receive an overdose of radiation exposure during the years of  sailing on nuclear-powered ships? No, I did not. I make so bold  as to state: not one of the crew members of nuclear-powered  icebreakers has contracted radiation sickness. Moreover, I am  convinced that the sojourn in the Arctic did them all good. Even  though the Arctic expanses are subjected to man's destructive  influence, the ecological situation is still much better there  than in other areas of Russia.    [Struzhentsov] Do you mean that during the entire time of  your work on nuclear-powered icebreakers, there was no threat of  radioactive emission, of radiation danger?    [Kuchiyev] I affirm: there was not! Localized emergency  situations did take place, but there were no emergencies  threatening the environment or human health. The emergency  safety systems on our nuclear-powered ships are absolutely  reliable. All the many years of practical work and the highly  professional operation of the nuclear-powered ships are  convincing proof.    [Struzhentsov] But this is, so to speak, your "own" opinion.  What about the international estimate of the safety of the  nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet?    [Kuchiyev] All our nuclear-powered icebreakers were built at  yards in Leningrad and Finland, and took their own route to the  Arctic Ocean, with a working reactor, through Danish territorial  waters. The Danes studied the air and water in the area of the  icebreakers very carefully, and not once did they detect the  slightest traces of radiation. Our crew watched the Danish  high-speed launches take samples of the water near the very  screw propellers of the Arktika, watched helicopters circling  above us, taking air samples. Later on we learned from the  Danish press that neither the water nor the air caused any alarm  among the Danish people. In addition, cruises of nuclear-powered  icebreakers carrying foreign tourists to the North Pole have now  become quite popular. Is this not an argument in favor of the  safety of our nuclear-powered ships?    [Struzhentsov] But why, then, don't the United States and  Canada, let us say, have any nuclear-powered icebreakers?    [Kuchiyev] They have no North Sea route. For the time being  the United States does not need a powerful icebreaker fleet with  unlimited cruising capacity just for sailing in the Canadian  archipelago and in Arctic waters. But we simply cannot do  without it. After all, the North Sea route is the reliable  transport artery, without which the development and operation of  the natural riches of the Arctic -- Russia's main economic  reserve -- would be unthinkable. Normal operation of the North  Sea route without a modern nuclear-powered icebreaker fleet  would be impossible!    [Struzhentsov] Why is diesel-electric power inferior?    [Kuchiyev] First of all, with respect to fuel and water,  ships of this class do not have sufficient cruising capacity.  The most unpleasant thing is that they are destructive to the  Arctic because of their oil spills. It is onerous for the crews  to operate the diesel-electric mastodons which represent  yesterday's icebreaker building. There is no alternative in the  foreseeable future to the powerful nuclear-powered icebreakers  in the Arctic, and indeed in the freezing seas of Northern  Russia. It is a pity that many people do not accept this truth.  We remember an incident which occurred in Magadan, the residents  of which would not let the newest nuclear-powered LASH ship,  Sevmorput, with cargo for the Arctic inhabitants, into the port.  This stems from technical ignorance and, of course, the  Chernobyl syndrome. As they say, "once burned, twice shy."  Magadan and other remote ports of the North will not survive  without modern nuclear-powered ships.    [Struzhentsov] You are not denying, though, that accidents  have happened on nuclear-powered ships?    [Kuchiyev] They have. For example, on the Arktika, in the  first navigation periods, the screws broke. We repaired them  ourselves at sea. Difficult, divers' work, but fully within  reach of the crew. This has nothing to do, however, with the  power unit. With competent servicing, it will not let us down.  As for what happened at Chernobyl -- this was first and foremost  the result of scandalous sloppiness, which, thank God, we don't  yet have in the fleet. Indeed, the safety systems on  nuclear-powered ships are very sound. You must address nuclear  power only as "Sir." In the past, our chief scientific director,  the now late academician, Anatoliy Aleksandrov, staunchly  defended the prestige and authority of nuclear power. He seemed  to foresee that any misfortune that happened in nuclear power  engineering could throw everything back that science and  practical experience had achieved over many years. That is what  happened at Chernobyl....    [Struzhentsov] What specifically do you have in mind, in  paying Academician Aleksandrov such a compliment?    [Kuchiyev] Here is a simple example for you. In order for  the  politburo to make a decision on the Arktika's cruise to the  North Pole, an official certificate, signed by the minister of  the Maritime Fleet and the president of the Academy of Sciences,  was required. Well, Minister Guzhenko signed this paper, but  Academician Aleksandrov abstained from signing. He explained  that he was completely comfortable with the nuclear-powered  unit, but he was afraid that, as had already happened, the screw  or propeller shaft would suddenly "fly off," and this could  spoil the expedition, and then the prestige of the  nuclear-powered icebreaker would inevitably be damaged. After  all, our country is not accustomed to looking for reasons: if  something does not turn out right -- everything is bad. Of  course, we were all lucky that the cruise, which took place  after all, went off successfully. The straightforward  academician was the first to send on board the Arktika a  telegram with the frank words: "You know that I was against your  cruise, but now I am proud of you." In actuality, he was much  happier about the success than others were. After all, Anatoliy  Petrovich is the person whose learning and efforts created our  naval and peacetime nuclear-powered fleet.    [Struzhentsov] At that time Academician Aleksandrov had  every  reason for joy. But how do you think he would feel, if he were  alive today?    [Kuchiyev] It is difficult even to conjecture. Something  inexplicable is taking place. The nuclear-powered fleet, which  has proven itself in full measure, and which has a superb base  in Murmansk, is slowly surrendering position. The icebreaker  Lenin, with a power complex which has served out its utility,  but still has excellently preserved interiors, made by the  Petersburg experts, stands idle in Murmansk. The Arctic seamen  came forth with a proposal to convert the first nuclear-powered  icebreaker in the world into a museum, to preserve this amazing  creation of domestic science and technology for their  descendants. Anatoliy Sobchak, mayor of St. Petersburg, gave the  "okay" for perpetual mooring of the nuclear-powered ship on the  Neva -- the birthplace of the Lenin. Things have come to a  standstill, however: there are no funds.    Repair of the nuclear-powered icebreakers Arktika and Sibir  is being held up for the same reason. The icebreaker fleet is  not being replenished. The most modern nuclear-powered  icebreaker, the Ural, is lying idle at the outfitting dock of  the Baltic Shipyard. It is over 50-percent finished. It is  already fitted out with main and auxiliary turbogenerators and a  propeller unit, and there is a nuclear-powered unit to be  finished. The icebreaker could go off on a voyage after two  years of intensive work. All work on finishing construction has  been suspended, though. The yard's director has sent telegrams  around to the suppliers on canceling the contracts: the yard has  no funds to finish work on the icebreaker, and the very  expensive equipment installed finds itself threatened with ruin.    All this is very alarming. The decline of the North Sea  route  is beginning. Unless this misfortune is averted, it will be hard  to count on the regeneration of the Russian economy, since  unless Arctic Siberia participates in this process, the problem  cannot be solved.    Finally, we have not fulfilled our duty to our ancestors,  who  passed down to us the baton of purposeful development of the  Arctic. After all, the cruises of our nuclear-powered  icebreakers to the North Pole region were made, not for the sake  of publicity, but in the name of charting the shortest  high-latitude routes for transit transport operations between  the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.</p>

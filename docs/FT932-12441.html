			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Euro Disney seeks more cash after FFr1.08bn loss EURO DISNEY, the leisure group which this month celebrated the first birthday of the Euro Disneyland theme park near Paris, yesterday announced that it lost FFr1.08bn (Dollars 203m) in the first half of this year and that it was seeking new capital. The group, which is already in discussions with its banks to try to restructure its FFr20bn debt, said it needed new funds to alleviate the impact of 'anticipated losses' and to prevent its working capital requirements from having an 'adverse effect on the cash and financial position'. Euro Disney confirmed that it had begun negotiations over the recapitalisation with Disney, the US entertainment group which is its 49 per cent shareholder. However it said the refinancing plan was at 'a very preliminary stage' and that it could not comment on sources of new capital, nor on the amount required. The group has failed to meet its financial targets since Euro Disneyland opened last spring. The park is expected to have attracted 11m visitors by the end of this month, making it France's second most popular tourist attraction after Notre-Dame cathedral. But income from hotels, catering and merchandising had fallen. The winter period, which falls in the first half of the financial year, was always expected to be the most difficult time for the park, but the outcome was worse than expected. Euro Disneyland attracted 3.3m visitors during the first half, when hotel occupancy reached 37 per cent. Euro Disney received FFr1.79bn in revenue during the six months to March 31 (comparisons with the previous year are invalid because the park was not open) but incurred FFr1.32bn of operating costs and FFr1.72bn of administrative expenses.

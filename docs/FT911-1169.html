			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Government steps into VEV rescue THE French government is trying to prevent the country's biggest company failure in a decade by stepping in to oversee rescue negotiations between VEV, the struggling textiles group, and its bankers. VEV, which employs some 11,000 people in its clothing and textile businesses, has been placed under the supervision of the Interministerial Committee for Industrial Reconstruction (CIRI), a unit of the Finance Ministry. Despite selling some of its most valuable assets, the group still has debts estimated at nearly FFr2.5bn (Dollars 410m). Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP), the two leading state-owned banks, are understood to be the most heavily exposed lenders. Credit Commercial de France (CCF) is involved mostly in VEV's capital, with a smaller loan exposure. VEV, whose shares were suspended on the stock exchange a week ago, said yesterday that it was delaying publishing its 1990 results, which are expected to show a sizeable loss, until next Monday. In 1989, with its financial debt totalling FFr3.3bn, VEV reported net losses of FFr188m. French press reports have suggested 1990's losses could exceed FFr500m. VEV's debt service is currently estimated to eat up 8 to 9 per cent of its sales - FFr6.4bn in 1989 - and government officials believe it will need to reduce this to 3 per cent in order to survive. Since many of the most profitable assets have already been sold off, meeting this target is expected to involve the write-off of a considerable portion of VEV's outstanding bank debts. Most French banks last year increased their provisions for bad debts substantially to cover an increase in the number of corporate defaults, but banking analysts believe most banks have not made provision for their VEV debts.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLHILL TO HAVE THROAT SURGERY  </P> <P> Freed American hostage Robert Polhill has a cancerous growth around his vocal  cords that will require surgeons to remove his voice box, his physicians said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Such radical surgery, scheduled for today, might have been avoided if the tumor  had been diagnosed sooner, doctors said.  </P> <P> The tumor "is quite old, probably at least a year," said Col. Russ Zajtchuk,  deputy commander of clinical services at Walter Reed Medical Center.  </P> <P> There is no evidence the cancer has spread, but Polhill's treatment will  include radiation therapy.  </P> <P> Polhill, 55, was held captive by Shiite Muslims in Lebanon for 39 months before  being freed April 22.  </P></p>

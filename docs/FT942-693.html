			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Leading Article: The fog still shrouding Japan If proof were needed that the realignment of Japan's political system has only just begun, it has been abundantly available in recent days. A popular and capable prime minister has resigned for lack of support in a fractious parliament. Politicians widely reviled for their remoteness from the concerns of ordinary voters conspire in smoke-filled rooms. The country is left leaderless as the yen rises to levels that threaten a sputtering economic recovery. More embarrassing still, it looks as if this sorry picture will again be on international display in 10 days' time, when Japan fields a lame-duck prime minister at a Group of Seven summit for the second year in a row. What are Tokyo's international partners to make of all this? At one level, the latest twist in Japanese politics should not be of enormous consequence to the world at large. Japan's western trading partners have long been used to dealing with a changing succession of political leaders, while recognising that the real power lies elsewhere in the 'iron triangle' of government, bureaucracy and business. Even the US administration, with its demands for deregulation and market opening, appears to have realised that there is little it can do to advance its agenda while a vacuum persists in Tokyo. In the meantime, the markets maintain their own form of pressure by bidding up the yen against the weakening dollar - itself in part an acknowledgement that no government under current conditions is likely to be able to do much about Japan's trade and current account surpluses. Impasse There is a place for concern, however, at the current impasse - and that is in Japan itself. For the fate of Mr Tsutomu Hata, whose government fell last Saturday after just 59 days in office, underlines just how unstable and incapable of action the entire political system has become. The order that governed Japan for decades after world war two - dominated by the Liberal Democratic party - has collapsed, but a new order is not yet in sight. Instead, small and scarcely distinguishable political fragments from the old LDP and the traditional opposition, the Social Democrats, manoeuvre ceaselessly before an increasingly disenchanted public, sometimes splitting, sometimes fusing to form short-lived coalitions. It is a process that, left to itself, could continue for months or even years before finally coming to rest in the form of a stable two- or three-party system. The problem is that Japan cannot afford to continue on political auto-pilot for this long. There are too many pressing issues that, in Japan's own interests, require speedy, effective and consistent government action. Stymied Tax reform is one area where action has been frequently promised but stymied by government divisions in recent months. Another is the much-touted and badly-needed plan to deregulate the economy, which would have the added advantage of answering one of the US's current concerns. Yet a third is the slow-fuse crisis over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. This is a matter crucial to Japan's security. Yet right up to last Saturday, Mr Hata was mired in discussions with the Social Democratic party, which was demanding that he water down plans for sanctions against Pyongyang in return for joining his coalition. The most regrettable feature of the current situation is that it is seriously out of kilter with what the voters themselves seem to want. A year ago, they voted out the LDP in favour of a coalition committed to creating a new, more representative electoral system. This the government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa eventually produced: a system that should enable politicians to be chosen more on their policies than on their ability to pass favours to constituents. What Japan needs is elections under that system - which should be possible once new constituency boundaries are in place this autumn. When they come, the clear-out of the old guard on all sides may well accelerate. In the meantime, Japan will probably have to settle for another fragile caretaker government and more muddling through.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Last installment of "basic contents" of Hanoi 20-25 January </F> Midterm Party National Conference resolution]    [Text] What are the bases for evaluation, selection, and  deployment of leading cadres?    The political report clearly stipulates: "The evaluation,  selection, and deployment of leading cadres at all levels should  be based on the fundamental criteria determined by the  resolution of the Party Central Committee Third Plenum:    -- A steadfast political standpoint, determination to  follow the socialist path, and determination to bring the  renovation undertaking of the country to victory.    -- Sound knowledge and the ability to participate in a  collective decision making process, as well as the ability to  organize and implement any assigned tasks efficiently.    -- Possession of revolutionary morality; being diligent,  thrifty, just, fair, objective, and unbiased; and having a  determination to protect the lines and policies of the party.    -- Being discipline oriented and protective of the unity  in the party.    -- Being close with people and trusted by them.    Among these criteria, special attention should be paid to  political acumen; dedication to the aims and ideals of the  party; commitment to lead a moral, healthy, and clean life; and  non- involvement in corruption. Ability is very important, but  the above criteria should also be considered carefully. This is  because the renovation undertaking carried out by our party is  bringing about many advantages as well as many dangers and  difficulties. Leading cadres will have to confront countless  ordeals, and if they, being core leaders, falter and show a lack  of determination and political acumen, then it is very likely  that they will head in the wrong direction. Working in a  market-based economy where leading cadres are empowered with  vast responsibility for managing public properties, and in an  environment where various forces would love to buy those leaders  with their money, if the leading cadres let themselves be  spoiled by money and become committed to corruption activities,  then the state will lose not only its money and its cadres, but  also the trust of the people. We definitely should not inject  into the leading organs of the party those who are politically  and morally degenerate.    Cadre work must be democratized. The evaluation of cadre  should be done by the managing party committee and other  relevant organs as stipulated, and it should be carried out in  orderly, democratic, proper, and just ways. Every cadre has the  right to know and answer to the evaluation by the party  committee and the leader of that individual cadre.    The political report also highly values the fostering and  training of talents, which are considered precious assets of the  country. To bring the country to prosperity and powerfulness,  we should have many talented people in all fields: outstanding  politicians, excellent entrepreneurs, and talented scientists,  technicians, culturalists, and so forth. Favorable conditions  should be created so that all people with sound character and  ability, both inside the party and outsiders, both living  domestically and overseas, can have a chance to contribute their  utmost to the country.    The training and retraining of cadres should be done  according to plan. The training contents must be specific for  each task and for the requirements of each position concerned.  Renovation must be carried out in both teaching and studying  methods, while adequate funds must be provided for the training.    All party organizations will reorganize and reevaluate the  existing contingent of cadres. Based on this evaluation, they  will make plans for party member work from now until the year  2000. This will correspond to the requirements for the  quantity, quality, and structure of cadres. This is our major  but difficult task that requires our best efforts to fulfill.  The party central committee will give out directives on this  task, but each sector, each locality should be a striking force  in the implementation process.    D. Are Party Members Allowed To Engage in Private Capitalist  Economic Activities?    The party by-laws stipulate that a party member "must be  exemplary in labor, combat, and study; and lead a healthy,  clean, and non-exploiting life." The Party Construction Report  of the Seventh Party Congress also confirmed: "Party members who  are currently employed as workers and employees, in addition to  the fulfillment of their assigned tasks, are encouraged to  develop family economic activities. Party members can be  shareholders of companies, state or collective enterprises.  Party members who are not employed directly in organs of the  party, state, or mass organizations, but directly involved in  labor (manual labor, technical labor, or management labor), are  allowed to organize a collective economic establishment  (production group, cooperative, and so forth), to tender for  bidding, and to lease land or other property of the state and  other collective organizations. They are also allowed to do  business as individual, small proprietors. Party members are  not allowed to be private economic capitalists." The political  report reaffirms this and all members should strictly abide by  it.    Regarding party members who are presently owners of private  capitalist economic establishments, the relevant party  organizations need to handle them on an individual case basis.  They can be helped to transform to enterprises, share-holding  enterprises with shares of the laboring partners or the state,  or to other forms of collective economic establishment, in order  to motivate the capital and entrepreneurial skills of party  members on one hand, and to ensure the class characteristic of  our party on the other.</p>

			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Arts: Hidebound by rhetoric - William Packer castigates the organisers of 'Unbound: Possibilities in Painting' It has to be said at once that Unbound, which with Dali: The Early Years, makes up the spring double-header at the Hayward, is as dispiriting and misbegotten an exhibition as could be contrived. What makes it worse, if that is possible, is that it raised beforehand a certain curiosity and even a few hopes. Subtitled Possibilities in Painting, it promised the work of some 14 artists from around the world united only in 'their passionate devotion to the physical, intellectual and emotional range offered by painting.' We should have known better. In the event it proves to be a celebration only of the kind of painting that fits the narrowest curatorial interest, which may be characterised as the orthodoxy of the conceptual avant-garde. We are in a time in which, as the Hayward's publicity material puts it, 'galleries . . . are reporting an upsurge of interest in paintings', to which disingenuous remark there are two things to say. There is no such upsurge of interest for the simple reason that there was never a downsurge: painting continues as it has always been, a principal means by which artists express their engagement with their experience of the world. Had there been one, however, any such downsurge would have been brought about precisely by the curatorial myopia and theoretical narrowness that such a show as this represents. As for the poor punter, he would be forgiven for never wanting to see 'a possible painting' ever again. The ploy is this. Since, to the sincere and educated curator of contemporary art, the only art to be respected is that sanctioned by its engagement with the currency of the avant-garde: and since that present currency is insistently conceptual - that is to say idea led - and since painting, stubborn as ever, won't go away: what to do? Why, shoe-horn it somehow or other into that fixed set of received principles. That done, the position is secure from all attack - heads, we win: tails, you lose. 'Those who treat painting precisely as an 'old-time religion', and they are endemic, especially in Britain,' writes Adrian Searle in his catalogue apologia for himself and his colleague, Greg Hilty, 'will find little comfort here. This is not a return to order but a breaking of bounds.' But what of those of us who treat painting as, well, painting? Let us take a work by the German, Imi Knoebel ' . . . at first sight (it) seems nothing more than a blank sheet of plywood, pinned to the wall . . . it is a painting which has turned its back to us: it is the reverse side of a painted panel . . . it comprises several paintings sandwiched together, paintings we shall never see.' Hmmm: and that makes the painter himself so special? Indeed. 'He works between positions, and with all positions: he works with dualities, oppositions, repetitions and contradictions. He does not so much have a repertoire of painting, as scrutinise what a repertoire means. His work is rigorous . . . ' And is it for him or us to turn a face to the wall, and weep? It is easy enough to mock, but necessary. Take the American, Jonathan Lasker, whose practise is to over-lay simple abstract figures, one upon another - grids, whirls and pictograms, all drawn with a self-conscious clumsiness. His has been, 'a scrutiny of intention and order in painting, and yet his work is filled with paradox . . . the final mark . . . as much a denial, or cancellation . . . as it is a summation.' Raoul de Keyser, a Belgian, presents a suite of small canvases, each painted with a perfunctory simplicity, the image sometimes roughly gestural but more often a set of rectangles, ambiguous blocks or apertures within the picture-plane. They have 'the concentration of a stare . . . they are full of impetuosity and strangeness . . . the activity of painting is often a series of delays . . . (undermined) with some reckless manoeuvre . . .' So the special pleading goes on. Michael Krebber, another German, offers imagery of an almost cynical ineptitude, its significance, we are told approvingly, 'jeopardised by the abject manner of its description . . . What we are offered . . . is snatched back, in repeated acts of self-consumption.' What do we learn of our own Zebedee Jones, and his 'opaque, all-over, single-hued surfaces'? 'The light in the paintings is fugitive, depending on how one stands in relation to the object', which is a great help. The presence of Peter Doig and Fiona Rae in such company is a surprise, that of Paula Rego oddest of all, for whatever else they might be, they are all true painters in something more than the mechanical and process-driven sense so dear to the selectors. But Doig won the John Moores Prize last autumn, Fiona Rae has been a Turner Prize contender, and Paula Rego presents the acceptable face of narrative painting, so it was safe enough to put them in. But for the 'Possibilities of Painting' that they adumbrate in their work, we are far more likely to find them relished and explored at the Summer Show of the Royal Academy than ever at the Hayward. Unbound: Possibilities in Painting, Hayward Gallery, South Bank Centre SE1, until May 30.</p>

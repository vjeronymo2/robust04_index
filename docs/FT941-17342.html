			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Management: Mysterious case of the vanishing career ladder - Tomorrow's bosses are being left to find their own way to the top Once upon a time managers spent their careers climbing the company ladder a step at a time, in a straight line towards the top. The upward journey taken by today's managers is more circuitous. Now that the old corporate hierarchies have been dismantled, the ladders have gone and it is often unclear what counts as the next step up. Moreover, in many companies there is no longer a paternalistic personnel department showing ambitious employees the way. Now that everybody is 'empowered', they are meant to 'own' - ie be responsible for - everything, including their careers. This laissez-faire approach to nurturing tomorrow's managers came under attack at a recent seminar in London attended by personnel directors of large British companies. According to Andrew Mayo, director of human resource development at ICL, many aspiring high-fliers are getting lost, and may even be leaving their jobs because they feel stuck. 'I listen to people who say that 'there used to be five slots between me and the top. Now I can't see the way forward, so I've decided to go outside'.' A survey conducted by GHN, the management consultancy which hosted the seminar, shows that 19 out of 20 companies believe it is important to develop high-fliers. Yet half do so passively, arguing that the full responsibility for career progression should rest with the individual, not with the company. Indeed, many of these companies now frown on the very word 'career', preferring instead the vaguer euphemism 'personal development'. Yet the task for which top managers are being groomed - or grooming themselves - is increasingly onerous. The days when someone could rise through a single department such as marketing or finance and emerge at the top, are gone. Business leaders need broad experience of different functions, and different markets. They need strategic vision, political skills, communication skills, team leading skills, a clarity of mind as well as the ability to change and be flexible. It is a tall order. Mayo argues that companies wanting to help equip managers for such a role must intervene to make sure that the right training and experience is going to the right sort of people. 'If you want to develop true general managers you need to help them and make interventions.' He also argues that if you leave it to the aspiring managers themselves you may miss some people with real potential. He says the laissez-faire approach penalises women: 'The kind of person who pushes themselves needs to do it 24 hours a day,' he explains. Deciding to intervene is one thing - getting it right is another. Companies pick out their high fliers in a bewildering variety of ways. Some, such as Amstrad, have traditionally gone for a seat of the pants evaluation, leaning heavily on the culture and style of Alan Sugar, the company's founder. At the other extreme are the multinationals - IBM or Shell, for example - which use complicated systems of appraisal, often backed up with high-tech wizardry, that plot the career profile of individual managers and map that against the needs of the company. Having selected the high-fliers, companies develop them through a mixture of outside training and work experience: and both routes are strewn with obstacles. Sheila Forbes of Reed Elsevier argues that companies are too willing to pay enormous sums on training tomorrow's bosses, sending them to business schools without any clear idea of what they are getting out of it. 'Often the standard MBA approach doesn't help. The problem is how you get the management trainers to work with you, rather than simply adopt an MBA approach. We need to ask ourselves if we are demanding enough as clients of the providers of management education'. She says it is a mistake to put someone through these courses (which might take them out of the office for two or three months) only to return them to the same job afterwards. 'During those courses people move on, and they want a new challenge when they come back.' Practical problems of moving people around the organisation can be even greater still. Blue Circle, the building materials group, owns a number of autonomously-managed companies. It believes that top managers do not make themselves, and that candidates for the top need experience of different parts of the group. Without stage managing from the centre it would be impossible for managers to jump from one subsidiary to another. To meet its needs, Blue Circle has developed a five-to-ten year management succession plan, and is moving its hand-picked managers round the world, to ensure that each will have the right sort of experience for a future at the top. 'In theory it is simple,' says Peter Mutter, personnel director. 'We ensure there is enough training so they have a tool bag of skills and then we supplement that with experience.' However, the company has found that its subsidiaries blanch when they are asked to give up their high fliers so that they can get more experience working for another part of the group. The answer, says Mutter, is to negotiate each case, in some cases giving in, in others holding out. Some companies doubt the worth of such an interventionist approach. In particular, they argue there is little point in drawing up a detailed corporate plan for the future and then attempting to train the people to fit that plan. 'Five years ago we used to look at the business plan and then at the people,' says Mike Haffenden, director of personnel at Hewlett-Packard (UK). 'Now we don't know what the business plan is. So we help individuals grow as people first.'</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Survey of Zambia (2): A delicate balance - Interview with President Frederick Chiluba In an interview with Michael Holman, President Frederick Chiluba calls for further external debt relief, promises tough measures to tackle inflation and extends a welcome to foreign investors. Holman: After a year of reform, what is your assessment of the economy? Chiluba: We need more external support, especially debt relief. If we have to service the debt from our meagre resources, there will be nothing for our recovery. We appreciated getting the Trinidad terms (partial debt write-off) but more of our debt should be written off. It is a way of recognising the difference between this democratic government and its predecessor. If we are to make democracy work, we need a sound economic base, and that we are unable to provide without more help. If we lose this opportunity, I see no way out of the quagmire. What has been the effect of the drought? It's the worst in living memory and has been a very big set-back. We have lost 70 per cent of our maize crop. It's not only hitting agriculture. Energy supplies have been cut, so factory production falls. We expect more than a 12 per cent decline in per capita GDP this year. But government responded promptly to the drought and acted more efficiently than surrounding states, while the international community rallied magnificently and magnanimously. More cuts in government spending lie ahead, including reducing the civil service: how much punishment can Zambians take? It's a very thin line between what is perceived as structural adjustment and what is perceived as punishment. But the civil service must be reorganised. We inherited a civil service and a political service, both employed by the state. We have got to trim it, otherwise you are accepting the rot. We have also cut subsidies, which is painful - but now peasant farmers can sell maize at higher prices, and not only to the state but to private buyers. Socialist propaganda made people believe that the state should be the provider. I want to get government off peoples' shoulders and make them more self sufficient. But you have to carry people along while pursuing reform . . . it's a very delicate balance. How serious a threat is inflation? It's public enemy number one. It means no savings, no investment, purchasing power wiped out. We have already cut government spending and cut the size of government itself. We are not going to print money. We're determined to bring inflation down. Will the second year be as tough as the first? In the early stages, yes. But by the second half, with inflation tackled, there should be slight changes for the better. What role is there for foreign investors? We need them - the economy needs their capital, their technology, their skills and expertise. The privatisation programme provides opportunities, the business environment has been radically improved. If we do not get foreign investment, the reform programme will be jeopardised to a large extent. Will ZCCM (the state-owned copper mining company) be privatised? Yes - but the government should hold on to some of its shares, because we have to create investor confidence. They will know we still care if we hold on to some shares. Would you accept a bid for shares by Anglo American conditional on their taking over management of the mines? That can be worked out when discussions take place. But would you object in principle? Anglo might want to bring in some staff from outside, but they would be working with the local staff. There are many qualified Zambians. Are you concerned by corruption in Zambia? It is part of the legacy of the old system, which we are still fighting. One way to do this is to ensure greater transparency in government and more accountability. What principles will be most important when Zambia draws up a new constitution? Entrenching the rights of the individual at the expense of the executive. The most striking thing about the past year is the way people have rallied under the new freedom. Zambia is enjoying a breath of fresh air - people are free to take initiatives.</p>

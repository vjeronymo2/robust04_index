			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Northamber loss deepens to Pounds 2.75m NORTHAMBER, the specialist computer and electronic transmission products supplier, announced increased pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.75m for the year to April 30 compared with Pounds 1.56m. Although turnover was just ahead to Pounds 93.1m (Pounds 90.1m) there was an operating loss of Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 1.07m). Mr David Phillips, the chairman, said the loss was after taking the stock and debtor provisions necessitated by the oversupplied and difficult market conditions. He said the group had again ended the year debt-free, with Pounds 1.3m net cash. Losses per share worked through at 11.6p (7.6p) and 'with the pervading uncertainty and in order to conserve cash' the single final dividend is cut from 2.5p to 0.5p.</p>

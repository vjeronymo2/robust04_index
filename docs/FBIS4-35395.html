			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source in the command of the Armed  Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY] has just stated  the following: With rare heroism and courage, our Armed Forces  have struck crushing blows against the aggressive, invading  forces of the al-Ahmar gang on the [words indistinct] front at  Tawr al-Bahah, and al-Turbah, forcing them to retreat and  surrender. The aggressors are now fleeing, under fire from our  fighter aircraft, artillery, and ground forces. Our heroic  fighters enjoy high morale, and effective, broad support and  participation from the masses, who have rallied round their  Armed Forces -- which are faithfully defending the DRY. God is  great. God is great.</p>

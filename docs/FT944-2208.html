			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Aid and warning for Kenya International aid donors yesterday signalled that they would cover Kenya's estimated external financing gap of Dollars 800m next year, but warned the Nairobi government to take steps to prevent public funds being misused again. At the end of a two-day meeting chaired by the World Bank, donors said they 'warmly welcomed' the government's public disclosure of the misappropriation of public funds and its action this week in charging a former permanent secretary of the treasury with conspiracy to steal. The legal action was clearly timed to influence the Paris meeting, where, however, donors stressed the 'critical importance' of preventing such misuse occurring again. Kenya was complimented by aid donors on its success over the past year in reducing inflation to single digits, boosting growth this year to 3.3 per cent, increasing external reserves and abolishing virtually all foreign exchange and internal price controls.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by unidentified reporter on speech by Luis Donaldo </F> Colosio, PRI presidential candidate, during the commemoration of  the 65th anniversary of the PRI at the Monument to the  Revolution in Mexico City on 6 March; from the "Good Morning  From Mexico" newscast; passages within quotation marks are  recorded]    [Text] PRI [Institutional Revolutionary Party] members  nationwide, including governors, attended the ceremony. This  ceremony followed a different pattern. For instance, this was  the first time President Carlos Salinas did not attend the  ceremony. In addition, photographs of the incumbent president  as the first PRI member of Mexico or other PRI founders were not  displayed at the site of the ceremony as was done previously at  commemorations of this type. The only photograph of President  Salinas was displayed on a building next to the Monument to the  Revolution -- the PRI Regional Movement Building. Except for  Health Secretary Jesus Cumate and some undersecretaries, no  cabinet members attended the ceremony. Colosio arrived with PRI  President Fernando Ortiz Arana. There was no preamble prior to  Colosio's arrival, which even surprised PRI members. Colosio  was the only one on the stage and waited only for the  introduction by the master of ceremonies to begin his speech.    In his speech, Colosio referred to the relationship between  the PRI and the government. He said that in light of the  elections, the PRI only asks for impartiality from the  government. He emphasized that the times of political  competition in the country have ended any presumptions regarding  the presence of a state party.    [Colosio] "When the government has sought to monopolize  political initiative, it has weakened the PRI. This is why  today, in light of the elections, the PRI only demands from the  government impartiality and firmness in the application of the  law. We do not want concessions that are not based on votes or  votes outside the law. [applause] Let us not seek to replace  the responsibilities of the government, but let us not seek  either to have the government fulfill the duties that only  concern the PRI as a party. Today we are facing a genuine  contest. The government will not give us the victory. It will  only be the product of our work, our effort, and our dedication."    Later, Colosio pointed out that it would be very difficult  to  explain modern-day Mexico without considering the PRI's  contributions. That is why, he said, those who argue that  Mexico's democratic transformation demands the PRI's  disappearance are mistaken.    [Colosio] "We offer change with direction, responsibility,  peace, and tranquility. Those who believe that Mexico's  democratic transformation demands the PRI's disappearance are  wrong. Indeed we have made our mistakes, but it would be very  difficult to explain modern-day Mexico without considering the  PRI's contributions. This is why, despite our defamers and the  criticism of our adversaries, we are proud to be PRI members."    Continuing with the electoral topic, Colosio said that the  PRI will participate in the 21 August elections with total  respect for Mexico's multiparty system. He stressed that there  will only be one winner that day, and added that only the clear  and unobjectionable victory of the Mexican people will be  acceptable.    [Colosio] "For the Mexican people to obtain a victory on 21  August, all political parties will have to abide by the law,  without advantages granted to anyone, prepotency, abuse, or  arbitrary actions. That is why, and in accordance with my  demand for a democratic election, I hope Congress will implement  the necessary electoral reforms based as always on the  agreements parties have achieved within the framework of the  Agreement for Peace, Justice, and Democracy signed on 27  January."    Luis Donaldo Colosio commented on the participation of  observers in the elections. He said one must not look at them  with fear.    [Colosio] "The election belongs to society. For that reason,  it cannot be a closed matter. Its pristine nature demands the  participation of observers and does not preclude our citizens  and visitors from abroad from giving a very thorough account of  it. There is no reason at all to look with fear at those who  wish to become acquainted with the nature of our democratic  processes. Our elections -- and I am saying this with full  conviction -- will have nothing shameful to hide."    Referring to the topic of Chiapas in his speech, Colosio  said  this situation appeals to the conscience of all Mexicans. He  noted, however, that this proposal for change is not limited to  Chiapas but covers all Mexicans.    [Colosio] "We want to keep our promises to Chiapas residents  and also to Mexicans in Laguasteca, La Laguna, the mountains in  Guerrero State, the northern mountain range in Puebla State,  [name indistinct] and Alvaro Obrergon's Barranca, the Federal  District, Ciudad Juarez's (Anapra) Port in Chihuahua State,  Guadalajara's Insurgentes Neighborhood in Jalisco State, and  Monterrey's Bernabe area in Nuevo Leon State."    The candidate commended the Mexican Army.    [Colosio] "Our institution proved its legitimacy and  efficiency, emerging stronger from the solution to the conflict.  From this dais I convey my words of praise to the Mexican Army  for its patriotism, loyalty, and selflessness in defending  national interests and unity."    Colosio criticized the attitude of PRI members regarding the  Chiapas conflict.    [Colosio] "PRI members must reflect on Chiapas. As the party  of stability and social justice, it shames us to feel we were  not sensitive to the major demands of our communities, we were  not next to them in their aspirations, we were not up to the  commitment they expected from us."    To conclude, the PRI candidate stressed that the main thing  he is proposing with change is change with responsibility, where  no area of the country's life is forgotten. He reaffirmed his  commitment to head the new phase of change in Mexico.    [Colosio] "With firmness, conviction, and full confidence I  say: I want to be president of Mexico to head this new phase of  change in Mexico!" [applause]</p>

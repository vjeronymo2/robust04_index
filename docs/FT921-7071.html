			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / Steetley in court action on Gobitta STEETLEY, the UK building materials group fighting a Pounds 600m hostile bid, is taking legal action against the Gobitta family which in 1990 sold its Paris aggregates business to Steetley for Pounds 92m. The valuation of the Gobitta business has been raised as a key issue in Steetley's defence against the bid from Redland, a rival British group. Mr Richard Miles, Steetley's chief executive, said last night that action against the Gobitta family was over warranties and guarantees affecting options to acquire land acquired by Steetley as part of the purchase. He said that Steetley wanted further information about who owned the title to some of these sites. He said: 'It would appear that some of the land thought to have been in the original contract may not be there.' Mr Miles stressed that Steetley generally had been pleased with the purchase of Gobitta which had given the British group a base in the important Paris market. He said that so far the group had paid only half the purchase price. The next instalment was not due until this summer. He said Steetley would provide a full valuation of all its businesses at the appropriate time. News of the legal action over Gobitta was disclosed yesterday by Redland which said that it had obtained a copy of a letter sent to British solicitors Linklaters and Paines by Mr Jean-Francois Gohier, legal manager of Garon, the Steetley subsidiary in France which carried out the Gobitta deal. The letter sent on January 28 this year accompanied copies of annexes to the Gobitta purchase agreement which had been requested by the British Takeover Panel. It refers to claims against the family over guarantee agreements but does not give details of the claims. Redland previously has said that the Pounds 92m price paid by Steetley for Gobitta substantially over-valued the business. It says that at the time of the acquisition Gobitta had received planning permission to extract only about 40m tonnes of the 150m tonnes of sand, gravel and limestone reserves it controlled. According to Redland, this had not been revealed to British analysts when the purchase was announced. Steetley said that full details were available in the French contract but that there had been 'an error of translation' which omitted these details in the British version.</p>

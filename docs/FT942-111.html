			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Third force emerges in high-risk world: Richard Lapper explains why reinsurers are clubbing together General Re and Cologne Re, respectively the world's fifth and fourth biggest reinsurance companies, have been circumspect in their comments on this week's proposed deal which gives the American company majority control of its erstwhile German rival. Few financial details have been provided, although analysts estimate the deal's value at DM2bn (Pounds 800m), and the structure is complex. General Re will own a majority and Colonia Konzern, Cologne Re's German parent, a minority of a new Netherlands-based holding company, which in turn will control Cologne Re. But the long-term implications are much clearer. The deal creates a powerful 'third force' in the global reinsurance industry, which will challenge the leadership of Germany's Munich Re and Switzerland's Swiss Re. It also signals further consolidation in an industry where the growing scale of risks, faced by insurance buyers and insurance companies alike, underlines the importance of size and financial strength. The new venture makes strategic sense for both parties. Cologne Re was unlikely to obtain the capital it needed to sustain growth from Colonia, now part of Union des Assurances de Paris, France's biggest insurance company. General Re, which obtains about 85 per cent of its income from the highly developed North American market, has been exploring the possibility of expansion in Europe for several years. In 1991 the group entered ultimately unsuccessful negotiations to acquire the reinsurance business of Royal Insurance, for example. Cologne Re, which obtains about 75 per cent of its income from Europe, shares General Re's approach to reinsurance, concentrating on both underwriting profitability and technical proficiency. In addition both companies specialise in relatively high margin 'non-proportional' and 'facultative' business, in which reinsurers have control over premium rates. Both Munich Re and Swiss Re remain heavily biased towards 'proportional' business, in which the reinsurer agrees to accept a set portion of the original premium in return for reinsuring the same proportion of the original risks, less commission. In non-proportional business the reinsurer agrees to cover a slice of risk, with payments under the policy triggered when losses reach a pre-determined level. In facultative business the reinsurer provides cover for a single large risk  -such as a chemicals plant or an oil rig - which is simply too big for a direct insurance company. Both types of business demand a higher level of technical proficiency, in areas such as risk assessment and surveying, than is typical in the proportional market. The transaction also makes sense in view of trends in the broader reinsurance industry. The position of smaller and medium-sized reinsurance companies has become less sustainable in recent years. This is because of increases in both the scale of risks - claims arising out of natural catastrophes, for instance - and the size of the reinsurer's customers, since rationalisation in the insurance industry has created bigger companies. In London many smaller reinsurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates have been overwhelmed by a string of catastrophe losses since the late 1980s. The growing size of these losses, highlighted by hurricane Andrew in 1992 which inflicted the biggest ever loss on the US insurance industry, has led some reinsurers to grow in order to diversify their exposure to large-scale losses. This in turn can reduce the cost of their own reinsurance protections, purchased in the so-called retrocession (reinsurance of reinsurance) market. At the same time, reinsurance brokers have become reluctant to place business with companies which have less than Pounds 50m in capital, forcing the survivors to seek mergers or other alliances. 'The bigger and stronger companies are able to point to their balance sheets and that gives comfort to the customer,' says one London reinsurance broker. This has led to consolidation within the reinsurance market. Takeovers have included this month's purchase of Abeille Re, the reinsurance subsidiary of the Victoire group, by SCOR, the growing French reinsurance company. The deal was worth more than FFr2.1bn (Pounds 240m). Other companies have reduced the size of their reinsurance operations or withdrawn. In the Lloyd's market the number of reinsurance underwriters has fallen sharply in recent years and the UK's domestically owned reinsurance industry has shrunk since the late 1980s. Legal &amp; General sold its reinsurance arm, Victory Re, to the Dutch group, NRG, in July 1990, while other British companies such as M&amp;G Re, owned by the Prudential, and Royal Re have virtually withdrawn from general reinsurance. As one industry analyst says, 'there has been a sorting out of the industry, with those companies that offer size, security and capacity coming out on top. The top seven or eight are playing a different game to the rest.'  ------------------------------------------------ TOP 10 REINSURERS  ------------------------------------------------                             Net Premiums Company                     1992 (dollars bn)  ------------------------------------------------ Munich Re (Ger)               8.93 Swiss Re (Sw)                 7.29 Employers Re (US)              3.1 Cologne Re (Ger)              2.36 General Re (US)               2.35 Hannover Re (Ger)              2.2 Assicurazioni Generali (It)   1.83 Gerling Globale (Ger)         1.71 Lincoln National (US)         1.66 Frankona Re (Ger)             1.59  ------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ALASKA;  </P> <P> ESKIMOS TO HUNT PROTECTED CARIBOU  </P> <P> Hungry Eskimos, armed with U.S. court-ordered permits to kill 50 caribou from a  protected herd, prepared for an emergency hunt to get fresh meat for their  southwestern Alaska village of Kwethluk. U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland  ruled that Kwethluk's urgent need for meat outweighed state desires to protect  the herd until it grows big enough to support such hunts in the future. "We're  real happy about it," said Kwethluk Village Council Vice President Moses  Nicolai.  </P> <P> Regional game biologist Randy Kacyon said he expects the hunting permits to go  quickly, and Nicolai said hunters would be out on snowy trails today in a hunt  expected to last a week. Kwethluk has 454 people, nearly all Yupik Eskimos who  hunt and fish for food.  </P></p>

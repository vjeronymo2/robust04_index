			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Philip Harris declines to Pounds 1.26m Despite an increase in sales from Pounds 85.3m to Pounds 90.5m, pre-tax profits of Philip Harris, the supplier of equipment and materials to the education, scientific, medical and industrial markets, fell from Pounds 2.02m to Pounds 1.26m. The directors said that the recession had hit margins in the education and scientific division, while the export business had operated at significantly lower levels than in the previous year and had ended the year in loss. Recently, however, a number of substantial overseas orders had been received which would benefit the current year, they added. The pre-tax figure was struck after a fall in interest payable from Pounds 570,000 to Pounds 184,000. Borrowings were significantly reduced as a result of a Pounds 5m rights issue in March last year. Gearing at the year end stood at 14 per cent, against a pre-rights issue level at the previous year end of 65 per cent and a post rights figure of 17 per cent at end-September 1993. Earnings per share fell from 16.47p to 8.1p. The final dividend, however, is held at 4.65p maintaining the total for the year at 6.85p.</p>

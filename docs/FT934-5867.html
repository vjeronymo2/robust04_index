			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Oil stocks reel on Opec deal The oil sector provided three of the market's most heavily traded stocks yesterday as domestic and international institutions acted on Opec's controversial move to maintain the 24.5m barrels a day output level it first agreed last September. And the overwhelming view of the market, confirming Thursday's knee-jerk reaction, was that Opec had been wrong to hold its production quotas. BP wrested the mantle of the sector's heaviest traded stock from Lasmo, with Shell close behind. BP shares ran back sharply, closing 9 1/2 off at 332 1/2 p, on heavy turnover of 16m shares, as dealers said US holders of the shares had begun to unload significant amounts of stock. Merrill Lynch, regarded as one of the world's biggest and most powerful stockbrokers, was said to have adopted a much more cautious outlook on oils in general and BP in particular. Merrill was said to have cited the Opec meeting and subsequent oil price considerations as the catalyst for a general downgrading of oils. BP was pinpointed as especially vulnerable to downside pressure in the medium to long-term with the market concerned about the possibility of the Kuwait Investment Office deciding to dump its near-10 per cent stake in the group and, even further out, the chances of the group launching a substantial rights issue. Shell slipped 6 to 678p after exceptionally high turnover of 9.1m shares. The worst performance in the sector, however, came from Lasmo whose shares slumped 11 to 117p, on 17m traded, as the market continued to fret about the chances of the company cutting the final dividend next March. A big line of Lasmo stock - 3.6m shares - was sold into the market early in the session amid talk that one broking house had drastically reduced its core asset valuation. One bull point for the stock, however, was a view that that PDFM (Phillips &amp; Drew's fund management group) had continued to increase its stake in Lasmo; on Thursday PDFM said it had taken its stake to over 11 per cent. Elsewhere, Burmah Castrol fell 5 to 735p after a sizeable agency cross involving a block of 650,000 shares, the same stock that had been offered in the market some weeks ago.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / The ERM: EC economies, the opportunities and risks - Spain Yesterday was a happy day for Spanish officials watching the peseta's performance following the ERM shake-up and an early morning cut in the Bank of Spain's benchmark intervention rate, from 11 per cent to 10.5, writes Peter Bruce. It rose strongly against the D-Mark, igniting hopes that it could withstand further cuts later in the year. The authorities will be cautious in cutting rates and the ERM adjustment is no guarantee of further falls, nor of improvements in unemployment or the country's widening deficits. But by taking the heat off the peseta, the new ERM rules enable economic managers to turn from the constant threat of monetary turmoil and to begin putting policies in place to help pull the country out of recession. Deeper interest rate cuts will probably depend on government success in negotiations with unions and employers on an emergency incomes policy and the extent to which it is prepared to cut social spending. Wages growth has become increasingly isolated as the prime cause of a stubborn 4.9 per cent inflation rate. With unemployment at a record 22.2 per cent, analysts believe only a combination of structural (a wages freeze) and fiscal (a tough 1994 budget) measures can turn employment around. About 100,000 jobs have been lost each month this year. Similarly the country's overall public deficit, targeted at about Pta2,253bn or 3.5 per cent of GDP this year, is out of control. Independent economists suggest it could reach 8.8 per cent of GDP next year if tough budgetary action is not taken now. Cuts of Pta300bn this year and a further Pta500bn next year could draw the deficit - which includes the central government and the free spending autonomous regions - close to 6 per cent.</p>

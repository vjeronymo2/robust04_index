			<p><P> February 24, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: A CHANCE TO DRIVE BY AND SEE REAL ARTISTS AT WORK.  </P> <P> Elegant outdoor dinner parties with entertainment and tours of fancy Palos  Verdes Peninsula kitchens have been past attractions for raising money for the  community-based Palos Verdes Art Center.  </P> <P> But this year, working peninsula and San Pedro artists -- what they create and  where they create it -- will be the stars as the center's largest support group  tries to raise a sizable sum for programs that range from exhibiting art and  giving classes to presenting arts programs in South Bay schools.  </P> <P> "Most people want to know how artists work," said Susan McNeil, an artist and  member of The Circle, the group putting on a six-hour "drive yourself" art tour  Sunday. It will take visitors into the studios of 21 artists from Palos Verdes  Estates to San Pedro, with San Pedro's Madrona Gallery of contemporary art as  an added attraction.  </P> <P> "The idea is to drop in on an artist in his environment," she said. Visitors  will see completed work and projects under way and be able to talk with the  artists about their craft. "It really shows the creative life style."  </P> <P> McNeil said the 21 artists were chosen to reflect a variety of styles and  disciplines -- sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, assemblage art and painting  that ranges from abstract to landscapes.  </P> <P> One artist does miniature oil paintings with intricate detail rivaling the Old  Masters, McNeil said. Another creates landscapes so vivid "that you can almost  feel the wind blow and the sunshine in his things," she said.  </P> <P> Other artists do op art that plays tricks on the eyes, paper sculpture,  black-humored collages of colored photographs, works of textured wax on canvas  or plywood, and paintings and sculpture that evoke dreams.  </P> <P> "These are major, professional artists who have had exhibits, been in  galleries, or are known artists," said McNeil, adding that San Pedro, and to a  lesser extent the peninsula, has developed an "art energy" that has attracted  creative people.  </P> <P> Tickets at $15 will be on sale at the art center in Rancho Palos Verdes and the  Madrona Gallery through the afternoon of the tour. Tickets come with a list of  artists and a map with each studio numbered; people make up their own routes.  </P> <P> Eva Kolosvary, who creates etchings with her husband, Paul, said she views  their involvement in the art walk as a "donation of time" to the art center and  a means of making South Bay people aware of the art community around them.  </P> <P> "People don't realize they have artists right there at their fingertips," she  said. "This is exposure for the artist and the public."  </P> <P> The walls of the Kolosvary studio in Rancho Palos Verdes on Sunday will be  covered with abstract etchings of rock formations at Joshua Tree National  Monument. "The sun is setting, and it looks like the rocks are glowing from the  inside with extremely bright colors of red and orange," she said.  </P> <P> Working on the deck of his striking San Pedro home overlooking the harbor,  artist Jay McCafferty conducts sunlight with a magnifying glass, burning  abstract images on rag paper. He said creating one of his "burns," as he calls  them, is like a "meditation" because it takes hours and requires careful  focusing of the magnifying glass.  </P> <P> "I'll be here (on Sunday) to answer questions," he said. "Hopefully, they won't  be 'Why is it art?'."  </P> <P> Pat Cox, a Palos Verdes Estates assemblage artist, uses such cast-offs as wire  and driftwood to create what she calls "small shrines" -- boxes with miniature  figures that come out of myth and legend. Crushed bottle caps become shields in  the funeral of a medieval lord, and bits of wood and trees are transformed into  forest nymphs.  </P> <P> Cox admitted being nervous about the tour. "I don't know what kind of art  people will like," she said. "If it's the limpid-pool-surrounded-by-trees  variety, they'll be puzzled, if not irritated, by what I do."  </P> <P> Calling Sunday's art walk a first for the art center, McNeil said The Circle  wants to make it an annual fund-raiser "if it works and the community is  interested."  </P> <P> Maudette Ball, executive director of the center, said she would like to see it  become as successful as the Vence Art Walk.  </P> <P> "That started as a gleam in someone's eye, too," she said.

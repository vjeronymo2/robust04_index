			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PANEL URGES BUILDING OF REGIONAL CRIME LAB;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: FACILITY TO PROCESS CRIMINAL EVIDENCE FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES IN  COUNTY WOULD COST $22 MILLION TO $27 MILLION TO CONSTRUCT.  </P> <P> San Diego County's local governments should pool their resources to build a  regional crime lab for analyzing evidence, members of a select committee  announced Wednesday.  </P> <P> The lab, which could provide service to all of the law enforcement agencies  within the county, would cost $22 million to $27 million, according to Dist.  Atty. Ed Miller and San Diego City Councilman Ron Roberts, both members of the  committee.  </P> <P> A jointly operated crime lab could process tests from evidence faster and more  cost-effectively than the labs now operated by the San Diego Police Department  and the county Sheriff's Department, Roberts said.  </P> <P> "We have criminals, up to and including murderers, who are remaining on the  streets because of the time lag at crime labs," Roberts said. "We've got to  change that."  </P> <P> The regional lab proposal is subject to the approval of the county and each of  the cities. That means that the lab probably wouldn't be built before 1993,  Roberts said.  </P> <P> As a first step toward building the jointly operated lab, the committee  recommended that the county and cities share the costs of acquiring three  pieces of high-tech equipment.  </P> <P> That equipment, estimated to cost $880,000 annually to operate and maintain,  would allow law enforcement officers to analyze "genetic fingerprints," gunshot  residue and minute fragments of fabric taken from crime scenes, Miller said.  </P> <P> The committee, which included representatives from the San Diego Police  Department and the sheriff's office, made its recommendation after having  studied the issue since March.  </P> <P> The regional lab should be housed in a 100,000- to 125,000-square-foot building  and include the latest high-tech analytic equipment, Miller said.  </P> <P> Because the public has become more knowledgeable about sophisticated  evidence-gathering methods, it is especially important for law enforcement  agencies to keep their facilities up-to-date, Miller said.  </P> <P> When jury members know that it's possible to gather DNA -- "genetic  fingerprints" -- from a crime scene, they become suspicious when such evidence  isn't presented at a trial, Miller said.  </P> <P> Government officials have kicked around the idea of building a regional crime  lab for almost 20 years.  </P> <P> Miller said he has advocated a regional lab since 1971, but the idea never  became reality because of a "vigorous turf battle" between the city and county.  </P> <P> The rising cost of lab equipment has changed that, Roberts said.  </P> <P> "Rivalries you can only afford up to a point," Roberts said. "I think that  we've reached that point."  </P> <P> Under the committee's plan, the city of San Diego would pay about 52% of the  lab's building cost, the county would pay about 22% and each of the smaller  cities that now use the sheriff's lab would pay a share based on their  populations and crime rates.  </P> <P> The $6-million annual operating cost of the lab would be similarly divided,  Miller said.  </P></p>

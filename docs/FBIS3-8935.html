Several thousand people attended the  ceremony, held in Szabadsag Square, in front of the Hungarian  Television building.    The co-chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party,  Istvan Csurka, said the Hungarian nation is in extreme peril,  threatened by internal deterioration, with the front line drawn  between the Hungarian national character and a foreign national  character. Csurka said the former system is ideologically still  in place, and there is major financial backing for attacks on  the national character.    "We want a free Hungarian press, in which left-wing lies  presented as truth are eliminated, and from which the  falsification of history and anti-Hungarian attitudes are  banished," Csurka said.</p>

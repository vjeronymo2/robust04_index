			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> KIDNEY SALES BROKERAGE IS FLOURISHING IN INDIA  </P> <P> Abdul Hai, a stocky 34-year-old now in police detention, sells human kidneys  for a living.  </P> <P> He wasn't jailed for dealing in kidneys; the sale of body organs is legal in  India. Hai was arrested when a kidney donor complained of being mugged after  refusing to pay Hai a commission.  </P> <P> Hai says he is one of about 100 middlemen who procure kidneys for the ailing  rich from Bombay's willing poor.  </P> <P> Hai, who worked as a doctor's chauffeur before becoming a kidney broker, said  he has arranged the sale of 20 kidneys since a surgeon suggested the business  to him a year ago.  </P> <P> "People queue up, ready to give away a kidney. You can find such donors  everywhere," he said in a cellblock interview.  </P> <P> Hai was arrested May 12 after Dhanraj Agarwal, a street vendor, told police  that two people attacked him and stole almost $2,000 he had been paid for a  kidney. Agarwal said the attack came minutes after he refused to give Hai a  commission, according to Police Inspector Appa Sahib Shinde.  </P> <P> "We have detained him only on suspicion of robbery, and it doesn't matter to me  if he sells  </P> <P> kidneys for a living or not," Shinde said. Hai has denied involvement in the  robbery.  </P> <P> Hai told a reporter that he charged roughly $95 to $190 for matching donors and  patients. India requires a kidney donor to officially affirm his desire to  voluntarily give up a kidney, but before that moment the donor could already  have collected $1,875 to $3,125 from the recipient, Hai said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Doctors Divided  </P> <P> The flourishing kidney trade has sharply divided Indian doctors along ethical  lines.  </P> <P> "The world knows that Bombay is a center for buying kidneys. I think it is a  shame for us to be so notoriously known," said Kisan Mehta, head of the Life  Foundation, a private group that advocates kidney transplants from cadavers.  Indian laws prohibit transplants from the dead.  </P> <P> "But what is ethics to a man who is dying?" asked Dr. Keshava Chandra Reddy, a  kidney transplant specialist in Madras. The urologist said he and other  surgeons from the Pandalai Cardiothoracic Foundation have transplanted 485  kidneys in four years.  </P> <P> Renal transplants became common in India about seven years ago when the  anti-rejection drug cyclosporine became available locally. There are no  official figures on the number of transplants performed in India. But since  cyclosporine's introduction, at least $7.8 million has changed hands in  connection with the estimated 4,000 kidney transplants performed in Bombay,  according to Dr. B. N. Colabawalla, chief of the National Kidney Foundation.  </P></p>

			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Management: Out of synch with the Internet I attended an internal market research briefing the other day. All extremely wonderful. Just as it started, the FT's marketing supremo breezed in and sat down beside me. 'Hi,' she said, breathlessly. 'I'm seeing a lot of you on the Internet.' ']]]]' I replied, with the eloquence of a Patrick White character. '????' She said: 'It is you, surely?' I said: 'I am not available on the Internet. Nor will I be available on Odyssey, the constellation of 12 satellites that will operate at medium-earth orbit - MEO, it's called - and provide simultaneous multi-regional communications services to users on a global basis by about 1999.' 'Well,' she said. 'It sounds like you. There is without question a person on the Internet passing themselves off as you, with bits of your persona. Really most convincing.' I wondered if she was using 'persona' in the Jungian sense. (You never know with that lot.) But her news set me thinking. Why should anyone wish to impersonate me on the Internet? Is it a good impersonation? I imagine that the impersonator has mastered the obvious elements: my serenity and cool; my been-there-got-the-T-shirt-but-go-on-surprise-me act; my cosmopolitanism; and my humorousness and charm. But what about the less obvious aspects, the ones that must be difficult for an impersonator on the Internet to grapple with, such as my caringness and sharingness? If the person impersonating me on the Internet would like some tips, they should ring me on the telephone and speak to the horse's mouth. Do not reverse the charge. Belatedly, I have been scrolling through the supplement produced by Marketing magazine that describes the latest winners in the Advertising Effectiveness Awards organised by Britain's Institute of Practitioners in Advertising. These awards focus on convincing demonstrations of the commercial contribution advertising makes to business success, and attracted, this year, 74 detailed case histories from 30 ad agencies on behalf of some of Britain's biggest advertisers, including British Airways, BT, Cadbury, Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Whitbread and - the big winner - BMW, as well as many with far smaller ad budgets. The advertising business loves awards. Almost every night, it seems, there is a loud and vulgar dinner-do at some London hotel at which admen award each other a sackful of prizes. At one of these bacchanals, several years ago, I watched fascinated as the guest speaker, Sir James Goldsmith, was pelted with bread rolls by some of the rowdier revellers on the fringes of the ballroom for a speech deemed too rightwing for an audience of agency long-hairs. I thought about throwing a roll myself, but was distracted by a drunken argument at the press table which ended in a face-slapping. (Goldsmith stood his ground. His sang-froid was admirable.) It is because the ad business is so promiscuous with its prize-givings that the IPA's effectiveness awards - based, as they are, on very solid case studies - stand out like a bishop in a nightclub. They are the serious side of advertising. Take the Health Education Authority's HIV-Aids prevention campaign, which won a silver award. You may recall that in its early days this campaign was rubbished by some critics for its 'apocalyptic' tone. But the criticism was stupid. This campaign, via the BMP agency, has done the trick in keeping HIV and Aids before the public gaze. Additionally, condom usage among 16-to-34-year-old Britons has zipped smartly higher. Over the six years to 1993, the HEA's campaign cost Pounds 15.4m. On the basis that it costs at least Pounds 30,000 annually to support someone with Aids, it is calculated that the campaign has paid for itself if it helps to prevent, on average, 51 cases of HIV infection a year. What is significant is that the prevalence of Aids in Britain had dropped from 93 per cent of the European Union average in 1984 to 54 per cent last year. Funnily enough, the striking thing about advertising is not its effectiveness, but its ineffectiveness. It is breathtaking how much expenditure is wasted. One of the reasons is that advertisers use mass media to communicate with quite small target audiences. This plunges some adpeople into gloom. They wail and slash their breasts - forgetting, it would seem, that salvation is round the corner: that in the information superfuture, the fragmentation of the media into thousands of glittering shards will greatly boost the effectiveness of their ads. Perhaps you think you are impervious to advertising. Almost certainly you aren't. But the likelihood is that it will become astonishingly effective as techniques improve. In hundreds of years' time there will still be prize-giving bacchanals in ritzy London hotels - and long-hairs hurling rolls, or so I shouldn't wonder.</p>

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOLS RAISE GRADE LIMIT FOR EXTRA ACTIVITIES  </P> <P> After several weeks of study, the Irvine Unified School District Board of  Trustees voted unanimously Tuesday to increase the minimum requirements to  participate in most extracurricular activities. Sports are excepted.  </P> <P> Any high school student who fails a class or does not maintain a 2.5 (C+)  grade-point average will not be allowed to take part in such activities as  cheerleading and student government.  </P> <P> The new policy will apply to the 5,850 students who attend the district's three  high schools. Previously, each high school was allowed to develop its own  standards for participation in extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> The new district policy was prompted by a Woodbridge High School cheerleader  who complained that she and other pep squad members were discriminated against  since they were the only ones to whom the "no F" rule applied. Other students  holding positions of responsibility, including student body officers, student  council members and athletes, were allowed to fail a class and still  participate in extracurricular activities.  </P> <P> The school board directed the district staff to divide extracurricular  activities into two categories based on the time commitment required.  </P> <P> Cheerleaders, other pep squad members and student body officers were placed in  the year-round category. Those students will be held to the higher standards.  </P> <P> Athletes and students participating in the performing arts were placed into a  partial-year category. They must only maintain a 2.0 grade-point average.  </P> <P> During the meeting, the mother of the cheerleader who originally complained  said she would file suit charging the school district with discrimination.  "Clearly there is a bias on the part of athletics," said Patricia Passy.  </P></p>

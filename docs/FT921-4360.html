			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Poles restart talks with banks Mr Andrzej Olechowski, Poland's new finance minister, will today meet representatives of Poland's 500 or so western commercial bank creditors in Warsaw to discuss a possible resumption of talks on reducing the Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.8bn) debt, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The talks with commercial banks have been stalled since the middle of 1991. Poland stopped servicing its commercial debt in the autumn of 1989 and arrears have mounted to over Dollars 1.5bn. The commercial banks have insisted that Poland settle its arrears before they agree to consider debt reduction. Poland has wanted to discuss both issues together.</p>

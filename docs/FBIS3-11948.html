Hondal added that  there are real possibilities of being able to meet the assigned  sugar plan; to accomplish this, the industry must grind  efficiently, now that the harvest is in its most productive  period. The plenum also reviewed the results obtained in 1993  regarding defense, production by local industries, recreation,  and tourism.    With regard to defense, the party plenum highlighted the  need to increase political work, with the help of party cadres,  and to boost the work of declaring zones defense-ready in the  second stage.</p>

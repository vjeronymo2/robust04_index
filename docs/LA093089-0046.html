			<p><P> September 30, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BENEFITS OF LIGHT RAIL  </P> <P> If you've been following the Valley's controversy over rail transit, you  already know about the wonderful opportunity at hand.  </P> <P> Southern Pacific wants to sell the Chandler-Victory route. This means it could  be used without any need to share with the heavy rail trains now running each  day. The stage is set to develop a system that satisfies all of the objections  raised so far. Higher costs and delays of other methods can be avoided.  </P> <P> Reporting on the L. A.-Long Beach light-rail test runs, The Times revealed:  "The car is so quiet and fast that people need to take extra care to stay out  of its way." In fact, the noisiest part of light rail is the warning system of  horns and bells. There's no rumble or vibration like heavy rail.  </P> <P> Placing Metro Rail 25 feet below ground doesn't eliminate its heavy rail  rumbling. The controversy over routes near Hollywood recording studios confirms  this.  </P> <P> The city should buy the Chandler-Victory route and dig a trench, allowing grade  separation crossings without bells and horns. Aesthetically designed walls  could contain the whirring sound of passing trains. Neighborhoods bothered by a  residual sound could separately pay to install a roof over the trench.  </P> <P> History demonstrates that property values always are enhanced by easy access to  transit corridors. Just look at the main streets near the freeway on- and  off-ramps. But neighborhoods not interested in the amenities of transit should  be allowed to choose to have no nearby stations.  </P> <P> I live five doors from Chandler, near Laurel Canyon. The Red Cars stopped there  and I miss them. I hope for a nearby light-rail station someday.  </P> <P> ROY W. RISING  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Dread of routine misery: Mark Nicholson and Edward Mortimer explain the internal pressures driving the president Whatever the real threat to Kuwait posed by President Saddam Hussein's troop build-up, there can be little doubt that he has mounted this defiant show of force partly to deal with a domestic threat to his own regime. The timing of the build-up is clearly related to discussion in the UN Security Council on easing the sanctions imposed four years ago, especially the ban on oil sales. It seems likely that Mr Saddam hopes, by staging a crisis and generating criticism of US 'belligerence' at home and abroad, to persuade the US to strike a deal, lifting sanctions in exchange for Iraqi recognition of Kuwait within its UN-designated borders. However, Mr Saddam's domestic audience is as important to him as the international one. Many observers believe the past year has seen a significant shift among ordinary Iraqis and in the army towards blaming Mr Saddam for the grave suffering sanctions have wrought. Mr Saddam himself took formal control of the government in May. Since then, official food rations, on which the majority of the population depends, have been halved, and barbarous penalties of amputation and branding (most of them without any base in Islamic law) have been introduced for hoarders and black marketeers. Mr Saddam and his cabal of 20 or so executive leaders, almost all from his own Tikriti clan, or related to it by marriage, have for the last four years blamed Iraq's plight on a hostile conspiracy, hatched in Washington and London and enforced by a 'hijacked' UN. But according to Mr Anoush Ehteshami, senior lecturer in Middle East studies at Durham University, the entire fabric of Iraqi society is 'unravelling' because of the impoverishment of Iraq's middle classes, the increasing inability of the state to provide basic nutrition and health, and the climate of political fear and repression. Mr Saddam, he says, 'is seeing the whole state crumble away at the edges'. Mr Ehteshami points especially at an apparent erosion of support for Mr Saddam in the regular army. The flow of desertions has accelerated in recent months, with opposition sources claiming it to be as high as 40 per cent. Except for elite units such as the Presidential and Republican Guards, Mr Saddam's emptying coffers have not been able to maintain the army at the privileged level of pay and perks to which it is accustomed. 'Much of the military is beginning to link up, through shared poverty, with civil society,' says Mr Ehteshami. 'And among both there is increasingly the view that nothing will change while Saddam is in power.' Whether disgruntled army officers could rise up and overthrow Mr Saddam is doubtful. Repeated rumours of coup attempts since the Gulf war have mostly been followed by rumours of purges and disappearances among the senior ranks, while Mr Saddam and his close-knit ruling clique have continued to sit tight. This spring, however, there appeared to be a serious rift in the clique, when members of the hitherto powerful Duri clan were dismissed. Since then, opposition sources have detected signs that even closer allies, such as the defence minister, Ali Hassan Majid, are under suspicion. More and more, power is vested in Mr Saddam's two sons, Udeh and Qaussy. One explanation for this week's large military deployment is that Mr Saddam felt the need to occupy the army in a distracting adventure. At the same time, by forcing an international crisis and the arrival in the Gulf of tens of thousands of US troops, the Iraqi leader may hope he can refocus attention inside and outside the country on the alleged US and western-led 'conspiracy'. 'What Saddam dreads most is this feeling among Iraqis of routine misery and that life under him has become tedious and unpleasant,' says Mr Charles Tripp, a lecturer in Middle East politics at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London. An external crisis provides a note of drama, and enables Mr Saddam to strike a 'heroic' pose.</p>

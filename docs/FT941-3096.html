			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc will not lift bid Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, yesterday ruled out an increase in its FFr2.8bn (Dollars 486m) bid for Co-operation Pharmaceutique Francaise (Cooper), one of France's biggest distributors of drugs and healthcare products to retail chemists. Mr Igor Landau, Rhone-Poulenc's managing director, said it was 'out of the question to pay one franc more' for its FFr2,400 per share bid, which offers an alternative of 18 Rhone-Poulenc shares for each of Cooper's. Rhone-Poulenc's bid, which it describes as friendly, has been accepted by Cooper's management. But it has met resistance from some shareholders. Sabeton, a Lyon-based investment company which holds 21 per cent of Cooper's shares has declined to say whether it would accept the offer. Predictions about the level of support for the offer are further complicated by the dispersed shareholdings in Cooper, with almost 40 per cent of the shares held by about 3,000 retail chemists. Rhone-Poulenc expressed confidence about winning the 67 per cent of Cooper's shares, excluding treasury stock, which it has set as the target for completing the deal. But Mr Landau warned of the consequences should the bid fail. In particular, he said that Rhone-Poulenc could withdraw its Doliprane paracetamol from Cooper's distribution network and create its own over-the-counter distribution network for Doliprane and other products. Doliprane is one of France's largest selling drugs and represents one of Cooper's largest sources of profits, according to Rhone-Poulenc. The pharmaceuticals group, which was privatised at the end of last year, said it remained determined to pursue its strategy of expanding its OTC and self-medication activities. It sees the expansion of its distribution activities as an important strategic move.</p>

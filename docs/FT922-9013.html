			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Settlement agreed on swaps CHEMICAL BANK confirmed yesterday that it had settled its Pounds 2.94m claim against Hammersmith and Fulham council in London. The action was part of the interest-rates swaps litigation, and the terms were not disclosed. Solicitors Linklaters and Paines, for the bank, said it would proceed with its claims against other councils arising from the Lords' ruling in January last year that swaps deals entered into by local authorities were void as they were outside their legal powers. Three of Chemical Bank's claims - against the councils in Richmond, London, Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire and Sandwell, West Midlands - involve similar facts to those in its case against Hammersmith and Fulham. Chemical Bank's claim against Hammersmith and Fulham was the fifth of the six lead cases in the swaps litigation - selected in the hope of obtaining guidelines from the court - to be settled out of court. The hearing of the sixth case, NationsBank of North Carolina against Hammersmith and Fulham, started in the High Court on Thursday and will continue on Tuesday. Yesterday, after hearing an application by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, for its claims against Welwyn Hatfield and South Tyneside council to be made lead actions, Mr Justice Hirst said any parties wishing their cases to become lead actions could apply to the court on June 8.</p>

The U.S. delegation arrived in western al-Biqa' in south  Lebanon across the border from Syria and carried out a four-hour  field tour of several villages before returning to Syria.    Some Lebanese newspapers have criticized the visit. The  Lebanese newspaper AL-DIYAR, mouthpiece of the Syrian Social  Nationalist Party, said the visit has created a diplomatic  crisis-like atmosphere between Lebanon and the United States.    AL-DIYAR said diplomatic sources in the Lebanese Foreign  Ministry have not concealed their astonishment at the way the  visit took place without official quarters being informed,  especially the Foreign Ministry, and without any meeting being  sought with any Lebanese official to explain the delegation's  mission.</p>

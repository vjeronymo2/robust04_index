			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 11 Jan (NA) -- Economy Minister  Domingo Cavallo warned today that "there is a breeding ground  for guerrilla actions in the provinces where no progress has  been made on economic changes." He added that the "faults in  the security mechanisms" are to blame for the recent incidents  in Santiago del Estero.    Cavallo said that the provinces that joined the federal  fiscal pact must extend the elimination of taxes on gross  income, and concentrate on tax collections on wholesale and  retail business where "there is still a great deal of tax  evasion."    Cavallo then referred to the guerrilla actions in Mexico,  saying that "the Central American guerrilla organizations were  able to operate in Mexico due to faults in the security system  which did not prevent an attack on cities."    Cavallo also denied that the Economy and Interior Ministries  would concentrate in their hands the government's social  spending, while admitting that coordinated action would be  carried out to discover "what part of the spending each ministry  does."    Cavallo also confirmed that the government "will not retreat  on the reduction in employers' contributions," but indicated  that the collection for social projects and for the PAMI  [Comprehensive Medical Assistance Plan] will not be reduced --  rather, "to the contrary."    He added: "There will be no losses. The collection for  social projects will be either maintained or increased."    Cavallo made these comments today during a news conference  to  discuss various current economic and political issues.    He first referred to the strike called by the CGT [General  Confederation of Labor], saying that the measure is within  "constitutional rights, but there is no reason to do it; it will  not be useful."    Cavallo said that what caused the strike was the decision to  reduce employers' contributions, which is a decision that  "should not have surprised anyone, because we always said we  were going to reduce them."    "Social projects will not lose one cent," said Cavallo in a  direct message to the union. He added: "The collection for  social projects will be increased with relation to 1993."    He admitted, however, that "there may be some problems in  redistribution." He added: "This is what the National  Administration for Health Insurance is for."    Cavallo indicated that the contributions' reduction will  represent "greater production, lower prices, investments, and  new sources of work."    Regarding the government's alleged persecution of unions,  Cavallo said: "The operations of the DGI [General Directorate  of Taxation] began in October-November, and not when the  reduction in the contribution was decided."    Regarding politics, Cavallo agreed with presenting a single  list for the election of constituent members in Cordoba Province.    In answer to a specific question on this issue, Cavallo  said:  "The technical answer is that it seems to me that the single  list is a very good thing, because there would be more  constituent members from the Justicialist Party and the UCD  [Democratic Center Union] than from the Radical Civic Union."    Cavallo added: "If the Radicals have a majority, they would  obstruct the economic process because their only chance to win  the elections is if the economic program fails."    He added: "If there is a confrontation I might consider the  possibility of becoming a candidate for the Constituent  Assembly, but if the results of 3 October 1993 are reflected I  will be quite satisfied."</p>

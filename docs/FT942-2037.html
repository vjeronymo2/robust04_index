			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / International Company News: Goodyear spells out strategy Goodyear chairman Mr Stanley Gault yesterday spelt out a new five-year plan for the US tyre company, including a dividend policy under which it will pay out between one-fifth and one-quarter of the previous year's earnings. Mr Gault, who recently agreed to stay with the company until the end of 1995 rather than retire at the end of this year, has been behind a strong recovery since joining Goodyear three years ago. Targets set at that time have been met ahead of plan, allowing the new financial goals. Goodyear has lifted its dividend from 5 cents a quarter in 1991 to 15 cents now, after a share split last year. At the current level, it will pay out Dollars 120m in dividends this year - close to a third of last year's net income of Dollars 388m, and ahead of the new dividend policy spelt out yesterday. With the US automotive industry performing strongly, though, Goodyear's after-tax earnings are widely expected to rise to between Dollars 560 and Dollars 570m this year. Targets set yesterday include a reduction in the company's gearing, from 40 per cent to 25-30 per cent by the end of 1998. Goodyear's debt has already come down to Dollars 1.4bn, from Dollars 3.7bn in 1991. Sales are targeted to grow at between 4.5 and 5 per cent a year until the end of 1998, twice the projected rate of growth in the tyre industry as a whole, Mr Gault said. Goodyear's shares lost Dollars 1 1/4 on the day.</p>

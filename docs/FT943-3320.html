			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Fisons suffers afresh The troubles of Fisons, the hard hit pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group, took another twist yesterday as the interim results statement appeared to offer enduring gloom. The company has been seen as a long-time bid target by market optimists. But the possibility that, however cheap, it might not actually have much to offer, has led some analysts to question just how much bid value there is in the share price and thus how much it would fall if bid hopes evap-orated. Mr Paul Woodhouse of Smith New Court argued that the stock was on a highly demanding prospective multiple of 23 times earnings. If it were to return to a sector rating, its share price would have to tumble to 90p, while if it was on the same rating as Glaxo its share price would be virtually halved. As it was, analysts responded to first-half profits of Pounds 30.4m, a halved dividend, and a very cautious statement on prospects for the second half by lowering forecasts. Smith New Court came down to Pounds 45m from Pounds 80m for the full year, while UBS reduced its estimate to Pounds 60m from Pounds 90m. Fisons, which stood above 500p a share three years ago, crumbled a further 10 per cent yesterday to end at 135p, with heavy volume of 7.7m going through the electronic ticker.</p>

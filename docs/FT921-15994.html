			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Palestinian expulsions condemned ISRAEL was strongly con-demned last night by the United Nations Security Council, with the full backing of the US, over its decision to deport 12 Palestinian activists from the occupied territories. The resolution, backed by all 15 council members, could pave the way for a resumption of the US-sponsored Middle East peace talks, which had been due to resume in Washington today. Arab delegations had delayed their arrival to await the outcome of UN deliberations. There were indications that Israel saw the UN condemnation of the planned expulsions as the price it must pay for the resumption of talks. Mr Yossi Ben Aharon, the senior Israeli negotiator who arrived in Washington with his team yesterday, said before the vote: 'We have heard from (the Arabs) they expect some kind of denunciation measure from the Security Council, and that will be their admission Continued on Page 18 ticket to the talks. It's a pity they are using these tactics.' As the Security Council prepared to vote, a Palestine Liberation Organisation official said that the Arab delegations, including the Palestinians from the occupied territories, would leave for Washington as soon as the resolution was announced. It requests Israel, as the occupying power, to ensure the safe and immediate return of deportees. It also reaffirms the applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the treatment of civilians to the Palestinian territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war. The council also decided to keep the matter under review, leaving the door open for further action once the expulsions had occurred. Israel is considered unlikely to halt the deportations as it has already rebuffed similar requests by the US. The latest expulsion orders were retaliation for the killing of a Jewish settler in the Gaza Strip. Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, has defended the expulsions as vital to combat terrorism.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Wina Chanrung and Marisa Chimprapha] </F>   [Text] The National Security Council (NSC) has again warned  Burmese students if they attempt to protest against Burma's  participation in the Asean meeting next month they will face  apprehension and tough legal action.    NSC deputy chief Khachatphai Burutphat said the government  has allowed the Burmese students to stay here on the condition  that they do not use Thailand as a base for staging political  moves against the Burmese government.    "We will regard them as illegal immigrants and arrest them  if  they stage a protest against the presence of Burma at the Asean  conference in July," he said.    Khachatphai was responding to a report that Burmese students  living along the border and at Maniloi holding centre in  Ratchaburi province planned to organize a rally in front of the  Bangkok hotel where the Asean meeting takes place on July 23-28.    A high-ranking official in the Interior Ministry recently  confirmed the ministry had been informed of the planned protest  by Burmese at the holding centre who disagreed with the move.    The official, who asked not to be named, said Burmese along  the border had telephoned their friends at Maniloi and urged  them to join the rally.    "However there is a group of the students who disagree and  they told the centre's chief about it," he said. The government  opened the camp for the Burmese last year, but only about 200 of  the 516 granted student-in-exile status have entered the camp.    The official said the ministry had information that some  Burmese students planned to sneak from the camp to join the  protest in Bangkok. Students living in the camp can take leave  for a few days with consent of the camp head.    Rangoon's Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw, will represent Burma  at the meeting as guest of Thailand, the host country this year.  The invitation has drawn strong criticism from several groups as  Burma is still governed by the military.    The junta, officially the State Law and Order Restoration  Council, has detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi since  1989 and refused to hand over administrative power to the  political party which won the 1990 elections.    "Thailand has already been accused of supporting Burma's  anti-government movement by allowing the Burmese students stay  here. However, we will not stand by idly if they use the country  as a base for launching political activities," said Khachatphai.    The Maniloi camp chief would be instructed to restrict  movement out of the camp before and during the Asean conference.    Tight security would also be provided for the ministers  attending the Asean forum, including the Burmese minister, he  added.    Deputy Permanent Secretary to Interior Chaloem Phromloet has  also warned the Burmese they would be arrested and their student  status revoked if they joined the protest.    They would then be charged as illegal immigrants,  interrogated and given the choice of being deported back to  Burma or entering the Maniloi holding centre.    "I don't really understand why the Burmese students would  stage a protest as the Burmese minister, as guest of the host,  will not participate in the full meeting. He will only attend  certain functions," said Chaloem.</p>

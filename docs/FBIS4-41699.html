			<p>BFN     [Text] The unfinished aircraft carrier Varyag, moored in  the Nikolayev harbor in the Black Sea, will in all probability  have to be scrapped. The scrapping will cost $174.6 million and  take 4.5 years to complete. Even though some quarters have  expressed interest in buying the vessel, any plans to sell it  are hampered by the existing agreement between Russia and  Ukraine, under which vessels of this type cannot be sold to a  third country.</p>

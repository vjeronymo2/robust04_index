			<p>BFN     [Text] Lebanon's Hezbollah has praised the  martyrdom-seeking operations carried out on Wednesday [6 April]  by a Palestinian in the town of 'Afula in northern Palestine,  and expresses its full support for the continuation of such  operations.    Issuing a statement in Beirut today, Lebanon's Hezbollah  announced: The anti-Zionist struggle is the legitimate right of  the Palestinian people toward the liberation of the holy lands  of Palestine from the clutches of the Zionist regime. By  carrying out their martyrdom-seeking operations, the Mojahedin  are, in reality, defending the honor and dignity of the Islamic  ummah.    The statement stresses the futility of the path of  compromise  with the Zionist regime and states: The people of Palestine will  never succumb to the bullying of occupiers and compromisers.</p>

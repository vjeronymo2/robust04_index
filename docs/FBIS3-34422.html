			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary from the News Research and Commentaries Group] </F>   [Excerpts] The first congress of Iranologists and of  Persian language and literature academicians from Central Asia  and the Caucasus opened in Tehran on Friday afternoon, 4  February, with a message from President Hashemi-Rafsanjani at  the Cultural Heritage Organization. The congress, which is to  continue until tomorrow, Monday, will study the role of Persian  language and literature in the region and its influence on the  culture and literature of countries in Central Asia and the  Caucasus. [passage omitted]    Persian language and literature, which is influenced by  Islam, prevails in extensive areas in southern, central, and  western Asia and the peoples and nations in the region are  familiar with this language and literature. This is at a time  when the 70-year presence of communism in countries north of  Iran prevented these peoples from becoming better acquainted  with Persian culture and language and, as a result, from  becoming better acquainted with their own ancient culture. The  emergence of the Islamic revolution and the liberation of the  nations in Central Asia and the Caucasus from the yoke of  communism has made these nations show more interest in learning  about Iran and its culture and language.    The truth is that the countries of the former Soviet Union  are exerting great efforts to acquire their own culture and  identity and to return to their historic Islamic roots.  Meanwhile, the West is trying to propagate its own culture and  to encourage these countries to follow Western culture. Thus,  having strong cultural ties with these countries, and especially  with Muslim-inhabited areas, can help them become acquainted  with the Persian language and culture and with Islamic teachings  and also help them realize that, like Iran, they can use Islamic  culture to further enrich their society, language, literature,  and culture and can do without the West.</p>

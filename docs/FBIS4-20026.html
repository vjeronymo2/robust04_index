			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Charles Miller, PRESS ASSOCIATION defense correspondent] </F>   [Text] The Armed Forces are not a luxury and excessive cuts  will damage Britain's security and reputation, Defence Secretary  Malcolm Rifkind warned the Treasury today.    The warning came as ministers and senior officials this week  prepared to draw up final recommendations for spending  reductions in a bid to find 2.3 billion pounds sterling savings  in line with Treasury demands.    Mr Rifkind set out his stall in the annual Defence White  Paper, which officials admitted was necessarily "bland" because  the Front Line First review would not be completed until July.    "Our Armed Forces are widely regarded -- and rightly -- as a  valuable and prestigious national asset," the White Paper said.    "The possession of such an asset is not a luxury; and it is  not something we could surrender without grave injury to the  security and reputation of this country."    Strong Armed Forces were essential so long as Britain wanted  to play an active part in international affairs. Although the  end of the Cold War was welcomed, nationalism and extremism were  "sadly" on the march. It would be many years before it became  clear whether Russia -- with its huge arsenal of weapons --  would be able to develop into a permanent friend of the West and  a stable democracy.    "We do not intend to take risks with our security," said the  White Paper. "The penalties for misjudgment would be too severe."    Yet the Front Line First review -- also known as the Defence  Cost Studies -- is expected to slash thousands of military and  civilian jobs in the support areas and axe hundreds of buildings  and centres.    Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley, Defence Procurement  Minister Jonathan Aitken and Junior Defence Minister Lord  Cranbourne meet the Front Line First's so-called executive group  on Thursday to discuss recommendations.    Since December, 33 studies have been carried out into the  entire support sector in a bid to find the necessary savings.  These studies -- apart from two -- are now complete and will be  discussed by the ministerial/executive group, which includes  Christopher Littmoden from Marks &amp; Spencer.    A final package of recommendations will be put together from  the various studies and presented to Mr Rifkind in the middle of  next month. But the key proposals include a 20,000 cut in  civilian and military manpower, with the RAF [Royal Air Force]  particularly targeted.    One aim is to cut the billions of pounds worth of spares and  stocks held by the military by by well over half. The RAF  stockholders are almost entirely in uniform, whereas the Army's  are half military and half civilian employees.    Ministers are determined that the job should be almost  entirely privatised, as civilian workers cost about half as much  as a serviceman. Thus, RAF manpower will tumble to well below  the 70,000 ceiling it will reach next April under the Options  for Change cuts.    The MoD [Ministry of Defense] headquarters in London is  another prime target with more than 3,000 posts likely to be  axed, together with a cut of a fifth in the 11,000-strong  Procurement Executive, which oversees the purchase of all new  equipment.    The number of senior military officers from the rank of  brigadier -- and their civilian equivalents -- upwards will be  cut by at least 20 percent. Large numbers of expensive-to-run  buildings such as the staff colleges of the Royal Navy at  historic Greenwich, south London, and the RAF at Bracknell,  Berkshire, are likely to be shut, with joint tri-service courses  being run at the Army's equivalent at Camberley, Surrey. One of  the most politically contentious issues is the naval base at  Rosyth in Fife, which the Royal Navy has recommended for closure  with warships moved to Portsmouth.    Labour has alredy warned that the proposals threaten the  entire structure of Britain's security, and party leader John  Smith has called for a full defence review, warning there were  too many "piecemeal cuts."    Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Menzies Campbell said the  White Paper was "substantially undermined" by the Front Line  First review.</p>

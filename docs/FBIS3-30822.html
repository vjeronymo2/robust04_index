			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At its meeting in Bratislava today, the government  approved the draft addendum on the payments agreement between  Slovakia and the Czech Republic and the draft agreement between  the two countries on mutual payments of outstanding claims  ensuing for the two republics from certain agreements following  the end of the federation.    Deputy Prime Minister Sergej Kozlik said that, on the basis  of these legislative amendments, the so-called old bloc should  be abolished and a one-bloc clearing system of accounting should  be introduced. According to Kozlik, there were no direct talks  at the government session today about the Slovak budget deficit.    At a news conference, however, he said that the government  had to grant 6 billion Slovak korunas from the state budget to  commence independent activity of the National Insurance Company,  which hugely increased the state budget revenues for January.</p>

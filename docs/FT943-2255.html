			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Markets Report: Swedish krona up The Swedish krona rebounded from early drops yesterday to consolidate an overall gain after a general election returned the Social Democratic party to power on Sunday, writes Motoko Rich. Against the D-Mark, the Swedish krona finished at SKr4.805, up from SKr4.828. During the day the Nordic currency dipped as low as Skr4.88 as markets were disappointed in the SDP's failure to achieve a majority of parliamentary seats. The dollar remained range bound but recovered some of its Friday losses on the back of a spate of short covering in the European afternoon. In London, it ended up against the D-Mark at DM1.5528 from DM1.5376 though down against the yen at Y98.7650 from Y98.8550. Sterling had lost some of its lustre in the aftermath of last week's interest rate rise, as it lost ground against the dollar and the German currency. The pound closed in London at DM2.4347 from DM2.4356 and Dollars 1.568 from Dollars 1.584. The week opened on a quiet note as market-moving economic data were in short supply and currency traders turned their attention to political and technical factors. Ballot results from Sweden's general election on Sunday catapulted the krona into the limelight. In early trading the krona dipped against the D-Mark as markets were left uncertain about the prospects for a centre-left coalition, which investors would prefer. The markets were cheered after a speech by Mr Ingvar Carlsson, prime-minister designate and leader of the SDP, in which he said he wanted to introduce new parliamentary procedures to allow parliament to fix a total budget ceiling. Analysts said the markets will be keen to see if Mr Carlsson's government can control Sweden's budget deficit. 'If the new leadership fails to turn around the deficit, there will be a sell off of the Swedish krona,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank. 'Right now the currency is in a honeymoon period.' The markets appeared to continue the Scandinavian theme as they drove the Finnish markka to its highest level against the D-Mark this year, at FM3.1775. This regional focus is likely to continue this week as traders look to the general election in Denmark tomorrow. Mr MacKinnon said he anticipated the Danish krone reaching as high as DKr3.85 against the D-Mark. Yesterday in London it finished at DKr3.938. Technically driven trade urged the dollar back up against the D-Mark. After testing the US currency's downside on Friday, the markets took the absence of any dramatic follow-through as a sign that it was safe to consolidate positions and raise the dollar on short-covering. Mr Adrian Cunningham, senior currency economist at UBS, said he expected the dollar to remain within a five-pfennig range against the D-Mark, between DM1.5250 and DM1.5750. 'That range should hold until a fundamental catalyst from outside arrives.' He said that a catalyst would most likely come from the trade talks between the US and Japan in advance of the September 30 deadline for sanctions. If the talks go well, the dollar should benefit. US officials were optimistic that a Japanese fiscal reform package, expected this morning, could help to correct the trade imbalance. Sterling continued to show some independence from the dollar, though to its detriment. While the US currency enjoyed a rebound, the UK currency trickled down against the D-Mark and lost its sixteen month high against the dollar. But Mr Malcolm Barr, international economist at Chemical Bank, did not think the pound would remain detached from the dollar for long. 'There may have been a bit of de-coupling of sterling from the dollar, but I would be sceptical of saying that it will continue,' he said. The German currency was looking vulnerable as it wavered on the crosses. It gave up its gains against the Italian lira and finished at L1010 from L1011. Against the French franc, it closed at FFr3.416 from FFr3.418. Mr Cunningham said the markets were retreating from the D-Mark because of a growing belief that the Bundesbank will soon raise the discount rate by 25 basis points. A report from the Bundesbank stating that Germany is on course for economic growth free of inflation spurred further speculation that a spate of monetary loosening could be in the offing. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England forecasted a Pounds 500m shortage and initially provided Pounds 200m assistance at established rates. Later it provided liquidity of Pounds 300m at established rates. Overnight money traded betwee 2 1/2 and 5 per cent. The September short sterling contract, which expires tomorrow, traded 5,800 lots to finish at 94.15 from 94.16. The December Euromark contract traded 40,660 lots and settled at 94.66 from 94.67.</p>

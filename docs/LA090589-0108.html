			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY WOMEN LOSE OUT IN DIVORCE  </P> <P> Patricia White has never regretted her decision to divorce her husband of six  years.  </P> <P> What she has regretted, though, was how she went about it.  </P> <P> "I signed the house over to him, the car, and basically left the marriage with  what I came in with," said White, a 32-year-old graphic artist who asked that  her real name not be used. "He said he'd fight me for custody of our son if I  didn't, and I guess I just let him intimidate me one more time.  </P> <P> "His mortgage is less than what I pay now in rent for a tiny apartment, and  he's doing great. For me it's a constant struggle," she said. "It was stupid of  me, I know that now, but it's a little late to do anything about it."  </P> <P> White's story is by no means an isolated one. Despite the passage of no-fault  and equitable-distribution divorce laws over the last two decades, many women  end up faring significantly worse than their husbands after a divorce.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Living Standard Declines  </P> <P> In a Harvard University study, sociologist Lenore Weitzman found that, on an  average, women with minor children experience a 73% decline in their standard  of living during the first year after divorce, while their ex-husbands  experience a 42% increase in their standard of living.  </P> <P> What hasn't been addressed until recently, however, are the reasons why.  </P> <P> Said Chris Archambault, director of Divorce Anonymous in Los Angeles, a  self-help group based on the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, women are easily  pressured and intimidated into signing things, and regret it later: "I see it  all the time. Women can take personal-growth seminars and learn how to develop  intimacy, but no one is teaching them how to break up intelligently."  </P> <P> In recent years, several companies have sought to assist women through the  financial maze of divorce with such things as audiocassettes and computer  programs. One computer program called "Divorce Plan," for example, was designed  for use by attorneys and their clients in projecting the financial impact of  various settlements. Some women, however, have said that these products ignore  the emotional factors that led to poor financial decisions in the first place.  For women facing divorce, two recently published books may help.  </P> <P> "You're Entitled! A Divorce Lawyer Talks to Women" (Contemporary Books: $18.95)  and "Getting Your Share: A Woman's Guide to Successful Divorce Strategies"  (Crown: $17.95) address everything from choosing the right attorney, getting an  accurate picture of family assets and obtaining alimony and child support, to  common psychological pitfalls that can cost women dearly.  </P> <P> "The major difference between men and women during a divorce is that women get  wrapped up in the emotional aspects of the breakup and men view it as a  business deal," said "You're Entitled!" author Sidney DeAngelis, a New York  divorce attorney since 1955. "Women come into my office and cry. Men walk in  and say, 'OK, how much is this going to cost me?' The purpose of the book was  to get women to look at it the same way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Inaction Is Damaging  </P> <P> One of the most damaging courses of action for many women in the early stages  of divorce, DeAngelis says, is actually one of no action. Instead of promptly  gathering financial information, such as canceled checks, tax returns, deeds,  mortgage statements, charge account slips, pension plan information and other  papers showing financial worth, many women freeze in their tracks.  </P> <P> "You wouldn't believe how often I hear, 'But he'd kill me if he found out I  went through those records,' or, 'We're still living together. What if we get  back together?' " DeAngelis said. "What they don't realize is that while they  are crying about the marriage ending, he's out there trying to make it look to  any judge that he's as poor as can be.  </P> <P> "He's paying a so-called debt to his brother, or selling off part of his  business to a cousin. If she acts quickly, though, her lawyer will ask the  court to freeze all the assets so they can't be hidden or dissipated."  </P> <P> Although many women may be tempted to believe their husbands' claims of full  financial disclosure, DeAngelis calls it risky business. "If you believe him  when he says, 'Come on, honey, you know I want you and the kids to be happy.  Just trust me, and let's settle this without the expense of lawyers,' you're a  goner," he said. "The bottom line is: If he were so wonderful and trustworthy,  you'd still be married to him."  </P> <P> </P> <P> First Legal Consultation  </P> <P> "Getting Your Share" co-authors, Lois Brenner, head of the family law  department of a leading New York City law firm, and Robert Stein, the former  editor-in-chief of Redbook and McCall's, give similar advice. Brenner recalled  one woman in her late 40s who showed up for her first legal consultation with  obvious qualms. "My husband," the woman told Brenner, "has always taken good  care of me."  </P> <P> During the course of the conversation, Brenner learned just how well he had  taken care of her. After she signed what appeared to be a reasonable separation  agreement, the amount of the husband's checks became irregular and her  reimbursement from medical costs was a fraction of what she had actually paid.  When the man filed for divorce a short time later, the woman was left with the  bare-bones terms of their agreement.  </P> <P> "Over and over again, matrimonial lawyers find themselves representing wives  who have been physically or emotionally abused, sexually betrayed and cheated  -- and who nonetheless continually accept their husbands' assurances that they  will 'take care of them,' " the authors say.  </P> <P> Divorce Anonymous director Archambault calls the ill-founded trust a form of  denial: "By not confronting economic issues, they're thinking, in the back of  their minds, that maybe it will go away."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unsure of Assets  </P> <P> There are some indications, though, that failure to pursue economic issues may  be fueled in large part by ignorance. In one recent national survey of divorce  lawyers, 52% of respondents said that most of their women clients had an  unclear picture of family assets or income.  </P> <P> Without accurate information, attorneys say they are flying blind.  </P> <P> "It's impossible to know what you're entitled to in a divorce if you have no  idea what's there to begin with. And a lot of times, the husband doesn't want  that to be found out," said Ronald Anteau, a family-law specialist with the Los  Angeles law firm of Simke, Chodos, Silberfeld &amp; Anto. "One client's husband  went to Las Vegas and converted thousands of dollars into $100 and $500 casino  chips. You'd be amazed how much money can be kept in a shoe box that way."  </P> <P> According to Michael Kaplan, a forensic accountant in Los Angeles who has  worked on more than 400 divorce cases, underreporting of income by the owners  of small businesses routinely deprives wives of 20% to 50% of their rightful  share of property and support.  </P> <P> Unlike conventional accountants who often take information in financial ledgers  at face value and then try to make sense of the numbers, forensic accountants  analyze figures and scrutinize them for inconsistencies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Underreported Income  </P> <P> "If the husband is underreporting income," said Kaplan, a partner with the Los  Angeles accounting firm of Duitch &amp; Franklin, "the wife's share of the  community property will be substantially reduced and her support payments from  the husband will be lower than they should be."  </P> <P> Only a careful examination by a wife's attorney or accountant of bank  statements, paid bills, ledgers and other documents will provide a true picture  of the business's actual worth, he said.  </P> <P> "But in all too many divorces," Kaplan said, "the wife fails to press for such  documents."  </P></p>

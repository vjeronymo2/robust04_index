			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOCUS ON OWNERSHIP;  </P> <P> OPPONENTS TO ASK JUDGE TO RESCIND TEMPLE LEASE  </P> <P> The fate of a controversial plan to build a Jewish temple on a former Pierce  College cornfield in Woodland Hills may hinge on a judge ruling whether the  land is part of the campus. Leaders of a Woodland Hills homeowners group  announced Friday that they will go to court next week to demand that the Los  Angeles Community College District rescind a Jewish group's lease on a 17  1/2-acre Victory Boulevard site. They claim that the rental is an illegal use  of Pierce College land.  </P> <P> District administrators vowed to fight the challenge by arguing that the  acreage is surplus district property and is not part of the Pierce College  campus.  </P> <P> The pending showdown came as members of the Woodland Hills Homeowners  Organization voted not to drop the lawsuit that the group filed four months ago  in hopes of blocking the district's lease with Temple Shir Chadash.  </P> <P> College trustees voted in 1986 to rent the vacant land for 75 years to the  temple for $3 million. The land, long used for Pierce College agricultural  school crops, is a block east of the main campus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angry Homeowners  </P> <P> Homeowners were angered when temple officials disclosed that they needed only  about five acres for their synagogue and announced plans to build a residential  retirement project on the other 12 acres as a profit-making venture.  </P> <P> Temple leaders later agreed to substitute single-family homes for the  residential retirement development. But the homeowners group decided to sue to  block that plan too.  </P> <P> Thursday night, homeowners voted to reject a district request to drop the suit.  In making the request, the district said it has a new chancellor who "has a  different approach to handling real property disposition issues" and might  resolve the issue without a court battle.  </P> <P> Rosemary Woodlock, president of the homeowners organization, said her group  will seek a summary judgment against the district next week "on the basis of  separation of church and state."  </P> <P> Antonio Cosby-Rossmann, the group's lawyer, said Friday that the lease violates  a state Education Code provision requiring that rental of college grounds to  religious organizations be for a temporary period and only when the  organization cannot find an alternative site. He said the law also mandates  that the rent be set at fair market value.  </P> <P> Cosby-Rossmann said that 75 years does not qualify as a temporary use and that  the $3-million rent is far below the going rate for valuable Woodland Hills  land.  </P> <P> He accused college officials of sidestepping the question of the lease's  legality when the rental agreement was approved in 1986. "They were basically  playing hide-the-ball with their own trustees," Cosby-Rossmann said.  </P> <P> A college district lawyer refused Friday to discuss the issue.  </P> <P> But David Czamanske, district contracts coordinator, disputed the homeowners'  interpretation of the law.  </P> <P> He said the college district views the 17 1/2-acre site as surplus district  land to which the state Education Code provision does not apply. He said it is  not part of the Pierce College campus. He said the district stands by the  contract and will defend it in court.  </P> <P> "We don't see it as college grounds, not at all," Czamanske said. "I would hope  the judge would read it the same way we do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Constitutional Issue  </P> <P> Czamanske also denied that officials skirted the legality issue when college  trustees voted on the lease. Separation of church and state is a constitutional  issue and is not governed by the state Education Code, he said.  </P> <P> Caught in the dispute Friday were officials of Temple Shir Chadash, a  400-member Reform synagogue based in Encino.  </P> <P> "I hope and pray this ends soon," said Anita Green, congregation president. "We  want to build on that property. It's three years already. We can touch it and  feel it. This is the community we want to be in."  </P> <P> The fight between homeowners and college officials is costing the congregation,  she said.  </P> <P> "We're paying $15,000 a month in interest to sit and watch the college and the  homeowners fight with one another. We're sorry we're in the middle."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by PRENSA LATINA Columnist Nils Castro, a </F> Panamanian political leader and journalist: "Actions Speak for  Themselves"]    [Text] Following the election of Carlos Roberto Reina, who  will take office this month with the support of a considerable  legislative majority, another event confirms that changes are  brewing in Honduras that will keep that forgotten country in the  newspaper headlines over the next few months. At present, the  issue is the unexpected scope of the report entitled Actions  Speak for Themselves, presented by National Human Rights  Commissioner Leonardo Valladares. Valladares' dramatic  revelations, which involve former governments as well as current  military chiefs and oligarchic leaders, were made right after  the president-elect announced his risky plan to downsize the  Army, which aroused the resistance of his high command.    According to the report, between 1979 and 1990, ranking  civilian and military officials were heavily involved in a  "dirty war" that included the organization and concealment of  death squads responsible for the "disappearance" of at least 184  citizens detained for political reasons. These crimes -- among  other atrocities of various types -- were carried out in  accordance with the so-called "National Security Doctrine"  during the lengthy period when the U.S. administrations of  Ronald Reagan and George Bush intervened in Honduran  governments, rendering the country a veritable "aircraft  carrier" for policies implemented by Washington on the Central  American isthmus.  <H5>  Multinational Terrorism </H5>   These murders -- perpetrated with the advice and  participation of Argentine soldiers, Nicaraguan contras, and  U.S. agents -- took place under the military government of  Policarpo Paz Garcia (1976- 81) and during the civilian  presidencies of liberals Roberto Suazo Cordoba (1982-86) and  Jose Azcona Hoyo (1986-90). General Paz Garcia culminated the  series of military governments that Honduras endured throughout  the seventies. Paz Garcia was a close ally of Anastasio  Somoza's regime in Nicaragua. He later organized a constituent  assembly that confirmed him in his post and regulated the  transition to civilian rule, guaranteeing that civilian  governments would exclusively favor the oligarchic leaders of  the traditional Liberal and National Parties (conservative).    Gen. Paz Garcia's first successor, Suazo Cordoba, submitted  his administration to U.S. policy, lent it for intervention  against the Sandinist government and the Salvadoran  revolutionary process, and passed an "antiterrorist law" that  prohibited strikes and gave free rein to paramilitary groups.  During his term, Honduras tolerated the permanent establishment  of U.S. troops and contra bases in its territory --  approximately 15,000 men -- as well as an extraordinary increase  in the size and cost of the Honduran Army, which doubled the  number of troops and acquired a modern air force. Approximately  1,200 Americans provided training and logistic support,  participating directly in military operations in addition to  organizing provocative "joint" maneuvers with the participation  of up to 7,000 U.S. troops.    The management of the huge foreign military "aid" generated  widespread corruption within the Armed Forces as well as in  traditional political circles. This continued throughout the  term of Azcona Hoyo, who developed a plan for privatization and  reduced public spending -- without affecting the military --  which ended in failure and dramatically harmed the country's  social situation. Just as Suazo had in the past, Azcona also  maintained the oligarchy's control over the Liberal Party,  preventing the development of different political options within  the organization. Subjected to a plan for Nicaragua and El  Salvador that was foreign to Honduras, the country's economic,  political, and moral structures were profoundly deformed.    Such frustrations led to the election in 1989 of  conservative  Rafael Callejas, now the outgoing president. Following the  liberals' defeat and transfer to the opposition, there emerged  within the liberal sector a more civilized trend of social  democratic orientation headed by brothers Carlos Roberto and  Jorge Arturo Reina. This trend won the elections in November  despite the tenacious resistance of the traditional factions  within their own party.    This caused an about-face explainable not only by the long  years of perseverance and preaching by the Reinas but also by  the high cost of the failed orthodox neoliberal policy  implemented by the Callejas administration. There was also an  abrupt change in Washington's position concerning Honduras:  After profoundly deforming the country -- for the sake of its  warlike priorities in Central America -- the Bush administration  suddenly cut off "aid" to Tegucigalpa following the Sandinist  defeat in 1990.    During Callejas' administration -- which intensified the  economic "adjustment" initiated by Azcona -- corruption  continued, there was no reinvestment in the productive sector,  farm production decreased -- the country now imports corn and  beans to ease the domestic shortage -- exports came to a  standstill, the public sector deficit increased, rural laborers  lost access to land, over one-third of the economically active  population became unemployed or underemployed, the middle class  was drastically impoverished, and the boundaries between poverty  and total destitution were practically erased as low-income  neighborhoods and social degradation spread.  <H5>  Adjusting the Adjustment </H5>   Within this context, one of the key issues of the Reinas'  campaign was the demand for an "adjustment of the adjustment."  They advocated an economic policy "with a human face" that  would satisfy social needs instead of macroeconomic indexes --  an issue upon which the international financial organizations  now agree in view of the threat of social upheaval in the  country -- and a "moral revolution" to abolish corruption and  reform policies to recover national sovereignty and bend the  oligarchs' resistance to true democratization, which is  essential just to maintain the Liberal Party's control in view  of a predictable counteroffensive by its traditional sectors.    One of the most critical issues in this plan is a reduction  of the Army's size and power and the creation of an attorney  general's office to eliminate the Armed Forces' control over the  police force. The president-elect boldly announced these plans  as soon as his electoral victory was confirmed. Carlos Roberto  Reina's position on the issue coincides with that of the current  U.S. Administration, which, now that circumstances in Central  America have changed, has acknowledged that the Honduran  military has a poor human rights record. Reina also agrees with  the demands of the international financial organizations, which  have acknowledged that the Honduran Army is a burden on the  country's public spending.    Nevertheless, several high command sources immediately  expressed their opposition to these plans, thus providing a  glimpse of the imminent conflict over the issue. It is under  these circumstances that Commissioner Leonardo Valladares'  report appeared. The report names some of the commanders as  well as distinguished civilian members of the two  oligarchic-liberal governments that preceded Azcona's as  criminals or accessories, thus dealing a harsh blow to their  plans to obstruct any changes.    Fervently supported by Honduran humanitarian organizations,  the revealing document -- which implicates current Armed Forces  Chief General Luis Alonso Discua -- was coldly received by  spokesmen for the outgoing government and rejected by the  military hierarchy. Military spokesman Colonel Napoleon Santos  said that it is part of a "well organized" campaign "to  discredit the institution by blaming us for things that cannot  be proven." Another spokesman said the report is based on  "statements to the media made by biased individuals or on rumors  that are simply inconsistent." The Armed Forces announced that  it will not open its archives on the missing persons to which  Valladares had no access for his investigation.    Meanwhile, President Callejas came out in defense of  impunity, saying that the civilian and military authorities  involved cannot be legally prosecuted because they had already  received a previous stay of proceedings for the same charges in  the past decade. Upon learning of the lawsuit filed by the  Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras  requesting that Congress suspend Gen. Discua from his post so he  can be prosecuted, Callejas added that Valladares' report "has  no legal foundation and will not be pursued by the respective  authorities." Callejas alleges that the initiative "revives  hatred and opens old wounds."    The root of this concern lies in the fact that former  President Ronald Reagan and his ambassador to Honduras, John  Dimitri Negroponte, are among the people implicated by the  commissioner and the humanitarian organizations.    The outgoing Congress avoided the request to suspend Discua.  However, in response to public pressure, the Supreme Court of  Justice ordered common courts in the areas where disappearances  took place to begin proceedings and arranged for a group of  prosecutors to examine the report to establish which cases will  require penal action. Although the current conservative court  is not trusted by the humanitarian organizations, the initiative  is relevant because the next Congress -- controlled by liberals  and strongly influenced by the Reina brothers -- will appoint  new justices.    Meanwhile, the president-elect maintains that "Valladares'  brave work constitutes an immense effort that cannot remain a  temporary report." Reina pledged that the new government will  work with determination to follow up on all of its implications.  If that is the case, actions will speak for themselves and we  will see changes of an increasingly democratic nature.</p>

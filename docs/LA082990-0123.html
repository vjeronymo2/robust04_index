			<p><P> August 29, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAX PARKING FEES TO INCREASE AGAIN;  </P> <P> FINANCES: ACTION FOLLOWS IMPOSITION OF A 10% TAX ON SPACES CITYWIDE. CHARGES  WILL RISE AN EVEN $1 SO LOT ATTENDANTS DON'T HAVE TO MAKE CHANGE.  </P> <P> The price of parking at Los Angeles International Airport will rise this  weekend, the second large increase in nine months.  </P> <P> Airport officials said Tuesday they had no choice but to raise parking rates  after the Los Angeles City Council imposed a 10% citywide parking tax to combat  city budget woes.  </P> <P> Fearing that simply adding the tax to current parking charges would force  attendants to make change and lead to longer delays at exit booths, officials  decided to use the opportunity to raise rates even further.  </P> <P> Beginning Saturday, it will cost an additional $1 a day to park at garages in  the central terminal area and at remote lots. Charges for the first hour of  parking opposite the terminals will also increase by $1.  </P> <P> Donald Miller, deputy executive director of the Department of Airports, said  "it would be a disaster" if the airport had tacked on the 10% parking tax to a  motorist's bill and attendants had to make change for odd amounts. "We wanted  to avoid it at all cost."  </P> <P> The result -- the $1 increase -- is expected to add $1.3 million to the airport  beyond the $5.4 million in parking taxes that will go to the city's treasury.  "We tried to set the rates so the impact would be zero, but there was just no  way to do it," Miller said.  </P> <P> Altogether, the approximately 25,000 parking spaces at LAX are expected to  raise just under $59 million annually beginning Sept. 1.  </P> <P> Rates in the central terminal area will rise from $15 to $16 a day.  </P> <P> The steepest increase will be for those who park for an hour or less. The  current rate is $2 for the first hour and $1 per hour after that, up to the  daily $15 maximum. The new minimum charge will be $3, which covers the first  two hours of parking, and $1 an hour after that, up to the new maximum of $16  per day.  </P> <P> Parking meters in the terminal area will remain 25 cents for 15 minutes.  </P> <P> The daily charge in remote Lot B, at 111th Street between Aviation and La  Cienega boulevards, will rise to $5. In remote Lot C, at 96th Street and  Sepulveda Boulevard, the daily rate -- which was $4 before last December's  increase -- will rise to $7. Parking will continue to be free for the first two  hours at remote lots.  </P> <P> The chief beneficiaries of the previous increase in parking revenues were the  airlines that serve the airport. Through a complex agreement that has existed  since the late 1940s, every time airport revenues exceed expenses and debt  service by a set amount, landing fees drop.  </P> <P> As a result, the airport's raising of both short-term and long-term parking  rates last December, the first such increases in seven years, meant a  $12-million savings for the airlines this year.  </P> <P> "Essentially, all things being equal, every $1 of increased revenue lowers the  landing fees by a corresponding $1," Miller said.  </P> <P> Because of higher expenses and a recent decision to eliminate rental charges  for luggage carts, this weekend's increase in parking rates in not likely to  mean a further reduction in landing fees, Miller said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LAX PARKING RATE INCREASES  </P> <P>  The second parking rate hike in nine months takes effect Saturday at Los  Angeles International Airport. The figures reflect a 10% parking tax imposed  because of city budget problems.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.54IN:2.99IN:2.88IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> PARKING AREA  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> OLD RATE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> NEW RATE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> INCREASE  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  *Central Terminal Area  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $15 per day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $16 per day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 6.6%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $2 minimum  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $3 minimum  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C">  --  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (covers 1st hour)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> (covers 2 hours)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  *Remote Lot B  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (111th St. between  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Aviation and  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $4 per day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $5 per day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 25%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> La Cienega Blvds.)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C">  *Remote Lot C  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> (96th St. and  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $6 per day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> $7 per day  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 16.6%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Sepulveda Blvd.)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> Source: Los Angeles Department of Airports  </P></p>

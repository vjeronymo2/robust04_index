			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Survey of Ukraine (7): A rash of difficulties - Profile: Western investors WHEN Tambrands, the US tampon company, first began to make their cotton products in Ukraine, back in 1989, tampons were as unfamiliar to Ukrainian women as a market economy. Today, billboards featuring slightly plumper gymnasts than might appear in a western magazine advertise tampons on the streets of Kiev and television viewers are blitzed with commercials. But if Tambrands, the first Fortune 500 company to begin manufacturing in Ukraine, has found a ready market, it has also encountered a rash of difficulties since it began producing tampons with 36 employees at a plant 20 kilometres outside Kiev on March 8, International Women's Day. Four hundred employees now produce 14m tampons a month at a brightly-lit, spotless plant in the town of Boryspil. Seventy per cent of production is sold within Ukraine, but the plant also exports to eastern Europe and the UK. Tambrands plans to increase production to about 250m tampons a year, still only about 2 per cent of the potential market. Mr Terry Manniex, the British plant director, has been pleasantly surprised by the high quality of the Ukrainian workforce, recruited locally and attracted by an average wage of 18,000 coupons a month, more than double what they could earn in Ukrainian factories. Tambrands is using part of its locally-generated funds to build 104 high-quality apartments for its workforce. 'I am very surprised that there are not more companies producing here,' Mr Manniex says. 'The skills of the local people are excellent.' But the management of Tambrands Ukraine has been faced with a double-headed problem: the challenges of doing business in a crumbling post-Soviet economy and the additional obstacles created by governmental mis-management, both of which combine to make it difficult for the plant to do more than cover its running costs and service its debts. 'It is difficult to operate in this country', says Mr Manniex, who is scheduled to leave later this month when the factory will be turned over completely to Ukrainian management. 'Every day there are little surprises.' Tambrands Ukraine started out in 1989 as Femtech, a joint venture formed by Tambrands' wholly-owned British subsidiary, Tambrands Ltd, and GPU, the Ukrainian pharmacy monopoly. The arrangement floundered when GPU was disbanded by the Ukrainian government and Tambrands was forced to buy out its Ukrainian partner and replace the joint venture with a western-owned company, Tambrands Ukraine. Tambrands, like all other western investors in Ukraine, initially enjoyed a two-year tax holiday. This has now run out and the company has been subjected to the same irrational and fluctuating taxation system which has crippled many Ukrainian enterprises. The plant is also vulnerable to an erratic supply of electricity and water and has had painstakingly to educate Ukrainian producers in order to obtain the quality product Tambrands requires. A further reason why more western companies have not been tempted to set up manufacturing operations in Ukraine may be the sort of difficulties which the political convulsions in the former Soviet Union have created for Tambrands. Ukrainian government officials say that when Vnesheconombank, the Soviet bank for foreign economic activity, retaliated against Ukraine's declaration of independence by freezing all Ukrainian accounts, Ukraine lost more than Dollars 1bn. Some Dollars lm of this belonged to Tambrands. More damaging still for Tambrands has been the disintegration of the rouble zone. The initial concept behind stepping up production in Ukraine was to buy all inputs domestically, using the proceeds from the sale of finished tampons. Since Ukraine's withdrawal from the rouble zone last autumn, this scheme has fallen apart because Tambrands' suppliers of cotton in Uzbekistan will not accept Ukrainian coupons as payment. This has forced Tambrands to experiment with the same complex barter arrangements which take up so much of the energy of Ukrainian enterprises. The difficulties of producing in Ukraine have made just-in-time delivery a distant dream for Tambrands. Instead, as Mr Roman Luchkiv, the 31-year-old Ukrainian who will take over from Mr Manniex, explains, they have built a special warehouse where 74 tonnes of cotton are stored to cushion the factory against fluctuations in supply. But there could be a light at the end of the tunnel if the Ukrainian government pulls off its ambitious market reform programme. Mr Manniex welcomes a plan by Mr Leonid Kuchma, prime minister, to make the Ukrainian currency at least internally convertible in the fourth quarter of 1993. 'The main success for us would be if the coupon becomes convertible,' Mr Manniex says. 'Then we are home and dry.'</p>

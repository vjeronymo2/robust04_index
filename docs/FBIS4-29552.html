			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["A DPRK FM Spokesman Says French Authorities Should Ponder </F> Over Matters" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  DPRK Foreign Ministry [FM] answered a question put by KCNA today  regarding the fact that the French Government has recently  danced duet with the United States in the clamor for "sanctions"  against the DPRK, thus aggravating the situation in Korea.    He said:    Some time ago, the French Foreign Ministry claimed "a  decisive measure against North Korea", manifesting its official  stand to support a UN resolution on "sanctions".    Earlier, during U.S. President Bill Clinton visit to France,  the French prime minister and government officials agreed to his  proposal for "sanctions" against the DPRK.    Such moves of France are aimed at preventing the "nuclear  issue" which has become an international focal point from being  solved through DPRK-U.S. talks, having a greater say by poking  its nose into the matter, goading Northeast Asian countries onto  a conflict and thereby fishing in troubled waters.    The situation in our country now has become extremely  strained due to the anti-DPRK moves of the United States and its  followers.    Our people are making full preparations to defend the  dignity  and sovereignty of the country in face of the enemy's moves.    The French authorities cannot be ignorant of the fact that  "sanctions" against the DPRK under such circumstances may lead  the situation to a catastrophic phase.    Nevertheless, France fell in with the United States' view in  the clamor for "sanctions" without any idea of its own and  danced to the tune of others, edging itself into other's [words  indistinct] for the convocation of an international conference,  [words indistinct] to shame. Judging from this, one can see  clearly that France is not interested at all in the question of  defusing the present crisis on the Korean peninsula but  persistently seeking to gratify its sinister aims.    We cannot but throw into question the reckless behavior of  the French authorities.    We have already declared more than once that in case any  "sanctions" should be imposed on us not only the parties taking  the van in enforcing them but also those who back them would be  held responsible.    The French authorities must know that our warning is not an  empty word and ponder over the matter.    If France wants to save its face and discharge its  responsibility as a permanent member of the UN Security Council,  it should help toward a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue  on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation,  instead on joining in the act of bringing the issue into  extremes.</p>

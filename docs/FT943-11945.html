			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: IBM plans global superhighway network International Business Machines plans to create a worldwide high-speed voice and data network to offer advanced communications services to multinational business users. The initiative reflects IBM's determination to claim leadership in network-centric computing, commonly known as information superhighway services. Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman, has identified network-centric computing as one of six strategic imperatives for IBM's recovery and growth. The company has formed a business unit, IBM Global Network, with a staff of 5,000 people, to develop and operate the network. It will be headed by Mr John Whiteside, formerly of MCI Communications, the US long-distance telephone service company. 'The IBM Global Network will be the business persons Internet,' said Mr Whiteside, referring to the global web of computer networks that link tens of thousands of computers. Like Internet, IBM's Global Network will enable companies to share multimedia data and services among their computers worldwide. 'The computing environment of the future is one where networks do much more than just provide for the transport of information,' said Mr James Cannavino, IBM senior-vice president for strategy and development. 'Applications and services will be embedded in high-speed voice and data networks, and people who use these services - whether to fill out an order entry form or to watch a movie - do so by accessing the network, rather than a software application sitting on their desktop,' he predicted. 'The IBM Global Network will accelerate the evolution to this new computing model.' To create its global network IBM will draw together existing national and regional networks including Advantis, a US joint venture between IBM and Sears Roebuck and IBM information networks throughout the world. The network will cover more than 700 cities around the globe, providing networking-based services to 23,000 companies in 94 countries. IBM Global Network will work in partnership with IBM's outsourcing businesses to offer a broad range of information processing services.</p>

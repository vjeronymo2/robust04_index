			<p><P> July 29, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MT. LAGUNA SELECTED AS SITE FOR JOB CORPS CENTER  </P> <P> A second Job Corps center will open in San Diego County, federal officials  announced Friday.  </P> <P> The facility to train economically disadvantaged youth will be at a former Air  Force communications station on Mt. Laguna in the Cleveland National Forest.  </P> <P> U. S. Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole announced the Mt. Laguna site selection  along with other new centers for Gadsden, Ala.; Minot, N.D., and  Matanuska-Susitna Borough, Alaska.  </P> <P> Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Coronado) hailed Dole's choice of the Laguna site,  pointing out that, if the facility had been in operation during the recent  Cleveland National Forest fire, which burned 4,600 acres in the area, "two  strike teams would have been available without delay" to fight the blaze.  </P> <P> The Mt. Laguna Job Corps Center will accommodate 250 to 300 men and women from  16 to 21 years old in residential units, giving them intensive basic  educational instruction and skills training in fields in which jobs are  available, Dole said.  </P> <P> Mary Silva, Job Corps chief of program management and review, said Friday that  it is too early to estimate the cost of redeveloping the isolated Air Force  site into housing and classrooms. The existing buildings have been vacant for  several years, she said.  </P> <P> Job Corps programs are designed to train participants for jobs in the area for  which there is a demand, Silva said. The facility will not open for several  years, she added.  </P> <P> The county's first Job Corps center, located at a former helicopter base in  Imperial Beach, opened in 1979 and has trained thousands of Southern California  youths in skills such as masonry, bricklaying, culinary arts, welding, business  office skills and electronics assembly.  </P> <P> Training at the 107 Job Corps centers nationwide is aimed primarily at youths  who are doing poorly in school or who have dropped out without obtaining  necessary job skills.  </P> <P> Trainees receive room and board, books, supplies and a small living allowance,  part of which is paid after the participant has successfully completed the  course. Job Corps members may stay in the program for up to two years, but the  average student leaves after eight months.  </P></p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Outdoors: Saving the best for last - Skiing / Late season snowfalls In the Tyrolean mountains, sexism has been swamped with snow. 'In April,' we are told in the Ischgl visitors magazine, 'it seems as if the mountain becomes the fair sex. Soft, round, warm, alluring, and ready for all pranks.' But this April, the pranks will have to wait. Blizzards which swept much of the Alps gave some resorts their biggest falls of the season. Too late, in most cases. The day the Swiss resort of Gstaad closed for skiing the heavens opened and dumped half a foot of snow on the notice-board announcing that all the lifts had shut. The following day in nearby Villars skiers battled through thigh-deep powder even on the piste. It always seems to snow in April, but rarely quite as much as this. Says Patrick Messeiller, Verbier's Tourist Director: 'We had such a hot March that winter was bound to come back in April. This is real winter snow we are skiing on. Not a few flakes of spring snow.' In Verbier they were caught out: they had already rolled up their sleeves to make a start on preparations for the new large Funitel gondola which will at last replace the antiquated Attelas 1 cable car. The fresh snowfalls interrupted progress, but the 15 cabins, each transporting 30 skiers, will be running next winter, helping to alleviate Verbier's lift-queues by transporting an extra 1,650 skiers an hour. The fresh snow brought conditions that skiers dream of in December but simply do not bother to enjoy in spring when their minds are full of summer activities. Once again there are comparatively few people in the cream of the Alpine ski areas, but there was a minor scramble to get to the snow. Andrew Dunn, of Ski Scott Dunn, reported a flurry of bookings for Courchevel - which had two metres of fresh snow in a week, and Zermatt. 'Conditions have been quite astonishing,' he says. 'It bodes really well for next Easter which is much later in 1995. People who don't bother to ski in April just don't know what they're missing. It has snowed heavily in April for the last three or four years.' Also in Courchevel, FlexiSki, which was due to close last weekend stayed open for another week or two. 'It's unbelievable,' said Neal Manuel. 'The locals in Courchevel say they've never seen it snow so much in the spring. It's normal to have a few days snowfall in April, but not day after day for more than a week. It's finally getting through to people that there's still some great skiing even this late in the season.' But it brings hazards. In Verbier - not a good place in which to become lost  -it was only the homing-pigeon instincts of one of our group that enabled us to find our way through the thick mist back to our chalet. The arrival of all this fresh snow was double-edged, as it were, for ski shops. 'Normally at this time of year people are skiing on spring snow which leaches out the wax from skis,' said Ian Oakman, at Verbier's Ski Service shop. 'This kind of snow is much better for skis, and yet in the first two or three days of new snow we had more damaged skis than at any time this season. What happened was that when fresh snow fell on the lower slopes where the snow had already vanished, it gave the appearance of being a good surface. In reality it was soft snow on stony ground, so when people skied the lower runs, they were damaging their skis.' Either way, tour operators hope that just as people have begun to realise that the unfashionable month of January is a good bet for skiing, more people will now be convinced that some of the best skiing of the winter is not in winter at all, but in spring. For those who like their Aprils warm, there is an old Swiss saying, which seems particularly appropriate this year: 'He who has seen three good Aprils is already old.' Meanwhile, just like at the end of term at boarding school, everyone is packing their bags and heading for home. 'The end of the season,' announces the Ski Club of Great Britain on the Tourist Office notice board in Verbier. 'Rep rides off into the sunset. Flowers, bequests, gifts and tokens of love welcome. Back next year.' FlexiSki: Crogen Stables, Corwen, Clwyd. LL21 0SY. Tel: 071- 352-0044 or 049084-445. Ski Scott Dunn: Fovant Mews, 12 Noyna Rd, London. SW17 7PH Tel: 081-767-0202.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Chang-nok, director of the Foreign Exchange Policy </F> Division and the International Finance Bureau of the ROK  Ministry of Finance]    [Text] Financial market-opening has both positive and  negative effects. An influx of foreign capital lowers interest  rates and increases investment. But massive inflow of foreign  capital increases money supply and puts pressure on appreciation  of currency. Thus the size of capital inflow must be adjusted  or the government must export capital in order to balance  capital inflow.    A net capital inflow of 10 billion dollars is expected for  this year. To offset a surge of capital inflow, the government  mapped out a series of measures to encourage capital outflow or  capital exports. These measures have expanded room for overseas  expansion and operations of Korean industrial companies.    First of all, the government softened its control on private  holding of foreign capital. A total of 1,300 enterprises with  annual external trade volume of more than 10 million dollars  have been permitted to hold up to 300 million dollars overseas  or 30 percent of their annual external trade volume.    Other smaller companies and individuals were also permitted  to keep up to 20,000 dollars overseas, through a drastic easing  of the foreign exchange concentration system.    Second, restrictions on overseas investment in bonds,  securities and real estate for portfolio management purposes  have been eased. Securities companies, institutional investors  and insurance companies have been authorized to invest as much  capital as possible in buying foreign bonds and equities and  real estate for asset management purposes. From around June,  individual investors will be able to directly invest in foreign  bonds and equities within a ceiling to be set later. General  trading companies can also invest in overseas real estate up to  100 million dollars or within 10 percent of their annual export  and import volume.    Third, the government virtually liberalized its remaining  restrictions on outbound direct investment by local firms. The  number of sectors to be "restricted" for offshore direct  investment, was reduced to 14, from the previous 17. Except for  these "restricted" sectors, Korean firms can invest in all kinds  of projects overseas. Outbound investment less than 300,000  dollars can be made only by reporting to banks, not to the  government. About 75 percent of outbound direct investments are  handled by banks. This liberalization measures will help local  firms expand their offshore production base and sharpen their  international competitive edge.    Fourth, measures were also taken to help industrial firms  make a timely settlement in external payments. Local firms will  no longer need government approval when they pay royalties less  than 300,000 dollars. Commercial banks, not the Bank of Korea,  will be in charge of verifying the overseas remittance of funds  by industrial firms for the capital increase of their foreign  offshoots.    Local firms can send up to 20,000 dollars per month to  overseas office for maintenance expenses. When Korea eliminates  restrictions on the current account transactions, including  services fees payment, from June, Korean firms will be able to  deal in external activities in a more liberal way that is  available in Western industrialized countries.    When foreign exchange restrictions are lifted, there is a  worry that speculative hot money will move in and out of Korea.  To prevent the movement of the disruptive hot money, the  government has barred, from February, individuals from receiving  foreign currency of up to 20,000 dollars without identifying  their sources. Those who receive up to 50,000 dollars from  overseas will be placed on the special surveillance list of the  Korean tax office.    Secondly, non-residents, namely foreigners, can not convert  more than 20,000 dollars per month in local currency, without  identifying the sources and uses.    Korea is ready to push for liberalizing the foreign exchange  rules for internationalizing its economy. As excessive capital  inflows have many negative effects, the government must devise a  mechanism to keep the foreign capital inflow amount at an  optimal way. Especially, the government is promoting a policy  that will encourage the outflow of capital for productive  purposes that will be of long-term benefit to Korean firms and  the economy, not for consumption-oriented purposes such as  upward adjustment of overseas travel expenses.</p>

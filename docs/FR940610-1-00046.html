A beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinarily valued using a standard section 7520 income or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder interest factor. The present value of a beneficial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest in a pooled income fund is determined according to rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and special remainder factors prescribed in &sect;1.642(c)&hyph;6 of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chapter (Income Tax Regulations).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Examples.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The provisions of this paragraph (b)(2) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illustrated by the following examples: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Unproductive property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The donor transfers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation stock to a trust under the terms of which all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trust income is payable to a child for life. After the death of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the life income beneficiary, the trust is to terminate and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trust property is to be distributed to a grandchild. The trust  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retain the shares of stock. The corporation has paid no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dividends on this stock during the past 5 years, and there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indication that this policy will change in the near future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under applicable state law, the corporation is considered to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an adequately sound growth investment for a trust with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversified investments because the corporation's practice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retaining its earnings has caused the value of the corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stock to increase commensurately each year. The facts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances, including applicable state law, indicate that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income beneficiary would not have the legal right to compel the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trustee to make the trust corpus productive in conformity with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirements for a lifetime trust income interest under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable local law. Therefore, the life income interest in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this case is considered nonproductive. Consequently, the income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest may not be valued actuarially under this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 2. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Beneficiary's right to make trust productive. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , except that the trustee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not specifically authorized to retain the shares of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation stock. Further, the terms of the trust specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide that the life income beneficiary may require the trustee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make the trust corpus productive consistent with income yield  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for trusts under applicable state law. Under that law,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the minimum rate of income that a productive trust may produce is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially below the section 7520 interest rate on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> valuation date. In this case, because the income beneficiary has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the right to compel the trustee to make the trust productive for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of applicable local law during the beneficiary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lifetime, the income interest is considered an ordinary income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest for purposes of this paragraph, and the standard section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7520 life income factor may be used to determine the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income interest. However, in the case of gifts made after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 8, 1990, if the donor was the life income beneficiary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the value of the income interest would be considered to be zero  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this situation. See &sect;25.2702&hyph;2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Annuity trust funded with unproductive property. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The donor, who is age 60, transfers corporation stock worth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $1,000,000 to a trust. The trust will pay a 6 percent ($60,000  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per year) annuity in cash or other property to the donor for 10  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> years or until the donor's prior death. Upon the termination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the trust, the trust property is to be distributed to the donor's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child. The section 7520 rate for the month of the transfer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.2 percent. The corporation has paid no dividends on the stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> law, the corporation is considered to be a sound investment for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trust with diversified investments because the corporation's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice of retaining its earnings has caused the value of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corporation stock to grow commensurately each year. Considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 6 percent annuity payout rate and the 8.2 percent section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7520 interest rate, the trust corpus is considered sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pay this annuity for the entire 10-year term of the trust, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> even indefinitely. Thus, though the trust assets not likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> earn dividend income during the term of the trust, the assets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be assumed to appreciate at the rate of 8.2 percent per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year if there were no income. Therefore, the trust's sole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment in this corporation is not expected to adversely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affect the interest of either the annuity beneficiary or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remainder beneficiary. The trust specifically authorizes, but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not require, the trustee to retain the shares of stock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it appears that neither beneficiary would be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compel the trustee to make the trust corpus produce investment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income, the annuity interest in this case is considered to be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ordinary annuity interest, and a section 7520 annuity factor may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be used to determine the present value of the annuity. In this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, the section 7520 annuity factor would represent the right  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to receive $1.00 per year for a term of 10 years or the prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> death of a person age 60.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 4. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Unitrust funded with unproductive property.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts are the same as in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Example 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , except that the donor has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained a unitrust interest equal to 7 percent of the value of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the trust property, valued as of the beginning of each year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the trust corpus is nonincome producing, the present  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value of the donor's retained unitrust interest may be determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by using the section 7520 unitrust factor for a term of years or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a prior death.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Governor of the National Bank of Yugoslavia  Dragoslav Avramovic has held talks with the businessmen and  trade union leaders of the Rakovica commune. Concluding that  production could be increased on the basis of consumer loans,  he, at the same time, announced their introduction. Dragoslav  Avramovic stressed that it is encouraging that we have noted a  drop in unemployment for the first time since the outbreak of  the war on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. He added  that the policy of the National Bank of Yugoslavia is determined  by the fact that more than half of the capacities in the economy  are unexploited, while the reserves in the labor force are also  great. Dragoslav Avramovic is of the opinion that company  profits should be taxed and not salaries.</p>

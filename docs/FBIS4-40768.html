			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 17, RIA -- The Duma ought to protest  against the recent presidential crime effort resolution before  it sends the nation into utter disorder, Gennadiy Zyuganov,  leader of the communist parliamentary group, said in a public  statement.    The resolution ignores the new Russian constitution and  brings back the atrocities of the 1930s. Mr. Yeltsin's other  latest decisions are meant to leave the national economy in  ruins and run counter to his own message on strengthening  Russian statehood.    The communist group also demands the suspension of  SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA daily revoked by an ad hoc commission to be set up for  the purpose.    The group called former mps from all ex-Soviet republics to  a  congress of June 25 to demand the USSR re-established.</p>

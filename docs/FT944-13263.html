			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / People: Paula Vennells puts on her running shoes Marketing is a fast-moving business but some marketing directors move faster than others. Pizza Hut (UK) put out a press release saying that Paula Vennells, 35, would be joining as marketing director from Dixons, the retailer, where she was retail marketing director. Now it turns out that she is not joining Pizza Hut after all, but is instead going to Sears Sports &amp; Leisurewear, where she is to be general manager for Sportsworld, the group's out-of-town sports chain. Pizza Hut this week said they were now looking for her replacement but otherwise did not want to discuss the matter. 'We are surprised and disappointed, but these things do happen,' said a Pizza Hut spokesman. It seems that Vennells was tempted by the offer from Sears, which came along later in the day on learning that she was scouting round for a move from Dixons. Sears has contacted Pizza Hut and apart from normal competitive disappointments, fences appear to have been mended.</p>

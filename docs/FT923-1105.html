			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Demand for smelters queried A HUGE expansion of existing copper smelting capacity planned for the next few years calls into question the need for new smelters, suggests the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group. Mr Stephen Briggs, analyst at MMRS, says the organisation has identified 'well over 500,000 extra annual tonnes' of planned capacity. This compares with western world copper production of about 8.7m tonnes last year. MMRS's comments come at a time when the spot market treatment charges for copper concentrates (an intermediate material) have been easing from a very high level caused by a temporary shortage of smelting capacity. They also come shortly after the partners in the proposed Rayong copper smelter project in Thailand finished a 'road show' seeking finance for the Dollars 480.3m venture. Partners in the project are Padaeng of Thailand (51 per cent); three Japanese organisations - Mitsubishi Materials (13 per cent); Mitsubishi Corporation and Mitsui (7.5 per cent each) - MIM of Australia (12 per cent) and the Switzerland-based Marc Rich trading organisation (9 per cent). They want the international banking community to provide Dollars 333m in ten-year loans. Traders suggest that western smelter charges for treating copper concentrates, which once ranged between 10 cents and 20 cents a lb, jumped to 35 cents earlier this year but have fallen considerably because spare capacity was found in the Commonwealth of Independent States and in Zambia. For example, the Palabora copper mine in South Africa has been sending concentrates to Zambia and that country has also been treating concentrates sent by Marc Rich from Indonesia. Rich and Euromin, a trading house with offices in Stockholm and Moscow, have been having concentrates toll-smelted in the CIS where smelters in the Urals and Kazakhstan not only have excess capacity but are also eager to earn foreign currency. Mr Briggs of MMRS says that the upsurge in expansion of existing smelter capacity has been prompted by the need for smelters to be adapted to meet ever-tightening environmental regulations. It is cost-effective to increase capacity when this is done, he points out. MMRS also believes that the annual growth in concentrates production will be only 'sedate', in spite of the large increase in mine capacity expected in the next decade, because more than half the copper will be obtained by solvent-extraction-electro winning technology which disposes with the smelting process.</p>

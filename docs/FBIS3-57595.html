			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Irina Litvinova: "The Smiling </F> Prime Minister Prefers To Act When Parliament Is In Recess"]    [Text] Riga -- Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis is in an  unenviable position: He has admitted so many times that the  east is still the Achilles heel of Latvian foreign policy, but  unexpected political developments, such as the recent arrest of  some Russian generals, keep putting off his desire to rectify  the situation.    Guntis Ulmanis is new to politics. Until now, only his  surname was well known: His grandfather's brother, Karlis  Ulmanis, was perhaps the most striking figure in the history of  prewar Latvia. Many were sceptical about the political future of  the young Ulmanis, but they have been proved wrong.    He is frank, open, and not afraid to assume responsibility  --  that is, of course, obvious. Ulmanis travels around the  republic to meet people a great deal. According to the  constitution, the president's functions are largely  representative. He apparently does not bear political  responsibility for the many decisions adopted by the Saeima  (parliament) and the government. But it is clear that Guntis  Ulmanis does not intend to be a mere figurehead. Admittedly, the  president's potential to exert a more active influence on the  situation is limited by legislation. That is why the quantity  of his meetings with ordinary people and political leaders has  yet to translate into quality of decisions and actions. Is this  not indicated by the slight drop in the head of state's rating  at the beginning of January: Words are all very well, but what  about some action?    The Latvian leader's hobbyhorse is the unity of the Baltic  countries. On taking up office, Ulmanis organized a meeting of  the three Baltic presidents; and he constantly consults with  them on all the most important aspects of foreign policy.    A feature of the Latvian situation is that the president,  the  Saeima, and the government have managed to retain unity. This  conflict-free existence is perhaps explained by the fact that  Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs' cabinet is formed by the ruling  coalition in parliament, which incorporates the two leading  factions: the Latvian Way and the Peasants' Union. When the  Saeima is in recess, the Latvian government has extensive  powers, which it uses. Valdis Birkavs, who headed the cabinet  of ministers in the summer, is educated and a well-known lawyer.  Journalists have nicknamed him "the smiling prime minster."    Birkavs can be seen as a veteran politician: He was deputy  chairman of the Latvian Supreme Soviet. The prime minister  endeavors to explain every move he makes and tries to avoid  secrecy.    His team includes quite a few emigres, who have returned to  help Latvia at this difficult time of revival. This certainly  goes a long way to explaining their Western style of work, which  means openness without fail.    Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs tries to maintain  a  balance between the wishes of emigre leaders -- many of whom  have not returned to the republic but help by championing  Latvia's interests in the world arena -- and the line taken by  Latvia's own politicians. The minister believes that continuing  talks with Russia will be the main task in 1994.    Janis Jurkans, Andrejevs' predecessor and current leader of  the Latvian Accord faction, can be seen as the main opponent of  the present foreign policy line. He believes that Latvian  security can only be guaranteed by stabilizing Latvian society,  which is impossible without serious consideration for the  interests of Latvia's noncitizens, who make up one-third of the  population. Jurkans does not dispute the idea of building a  national, single-community state, but he proposes more liberal  methods.    The desire to increase the percentage of Latvians in Latvia  one way or another and bring their number up to a minimum of 75  percent is producing laws which are drawing increasing attention  to Latvia in the world community. Latvian politicians have  requested the European Union to set up a program to repatriate  people wishing to leave the Latvian state. In their view,  Western Europe must carry some of the blame for the fact that  the consequences of World War II have not been eliminated in  Latvia, as reflected in the demographic situation. So far,  however, these appeals have met with no response from Western  countries.    Latvia is also dissatisfied because Russia does not have a  comprehensive program to take care of its compatriots. The  internal problem of how to treat permanent residents of Latvia  who are not automatically granted citizenship, as is done in  other former Soviet republics, has become one of the main  problems of Latvian foreign policy. There is no doubt that this  is holding back the development of normal relations with Russia.  Incidentally, Russians are not the only ones to be left in a  state of limbo: 81,200 Belarusians, 58,000 Ukrainians, 25,000  Lithuanians, 23,000 Poles, 8,000 Jews, 3,000 Tatars, and 2,600  Germans are also without citizenship....    The foreign policy bias of the national radical opposition  is  well known: All those who have come to Latvia since 1940 are  "colonists" with no rights other than the right to go back to  their land of origin. And it looks as if this point of view is  gaining increasing support. Judging by the results of  sociological surveys, the positions of the Latvian Way faction  were dramatically weakened on the eve of the local elections,  but the hardliners have now strengthened them.</p>

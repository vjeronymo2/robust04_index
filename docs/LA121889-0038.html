			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OFFICER, WIFE BEATEN IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> MILITARY ALERT: BUSH REVIEWS OPTIONS FOR ACTION IN WAKE OF FATAL SHOOTING.  CHENEY ACCUSES NORIEGA OF FOSTERING VIOLENCE.  </P> <P> A U.S. Navy lieutenant was beaten and his wife was roughed up and sexually  threatened by Panamanian soldiers late Saturday after they witnessed the fatal  shooting of another American military officer in Panama City, Administration  officials disclosed Sunday.  </P> <P> The violence prompted President Bush and other Administration officials to  quickly review a variety of possible actions by the United States to protect  American lives in Panama against further provocations by the forces of  Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the President received frequent briefings on the situation in  Panama, and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney huddled with his advisers at the  Pentagon.  </P> <P> U.S. forces in Panama were placed on alert to guard against further hostile  actions by the Panamanian military, but there was no indication that Bush was  considering military retaliation. Bush was harshly criticized in October for  failing to assist in a failed coup attempt against Noriega.  </P> <P> Cheney blamed Noriega for the slaying of the American officer and called for  all of those responsible to be brought to justice. He issued a statement after  his Pentagon meetings saying that the Panamanian leader's brutality against his  own people had "created an atmosphere in which Panamanian Defense Forces feel  free to fire on unarmed Americans."  </P> <P> The shooting came closely on the heels of a declaration Friday by Noriega's  rubber-stamp legislature that Panama is "in a state of war" with the United  States, but it did not appear to U.S. policy-makers that the killers were  acting under orders. Administration officials instead characterized the  incident as part of a steady escalation in the harassment of Americans in  Panama over the past two years.  </P> <P> "We are extremely concerned that a climate of aggression has developed that  puts American lives at risk," said State Department spokeswoman Margaret  Tutwiler.  </P> <P> The identity of the fatal shooting victim was being withheld pending  notification of the next of kin. The Pentagon did not identify the others  involved, either.  </P> <P> In a statement released Sunday night, Pentagon officials said the victim and  three other American military officers were fired upon as they drove away from  a confrontation with soldiers at a checkpoint near the headquarters of  Noriega's Panama Defense Forces. A second officer was "grazed," it said.  </P> <P> After witnessing the shooting, an unidentified U.S. Navy lieutenant and his  wife were detained for four hours by Panamanian soldiers, according to the  Pentagon. Officials said that the officer was "repeatedly beaten and kicked in  the groin and head" and threatened with death if he did not disclose the nature  of his duties in Panama.  </P> <P> While her husband was being interrogated, officials said, the officer's wife  was harassed and "sexually threatened" by Panamanian soldiers.  </P> <P> "His wife was slammed against a wall with such force that her head was cut,"  the Pentagon said. "After standing at the wall for half an hour with her arms  above her head, she collapsed onto the floor."  </P> <P> U.S. officials strongly denied a statement issued by the Panama Defense Forces  on Sunday claiming that the American servicemen had fired on a crowd at a  checkpoint, wounding a Defense Forces soldier and two civilians -- including a  1-year-old girl.  </P> <P> "That is bull," declared Mercedes Morris, spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern  Command headquartered in Panama. "The U.S. forces were not armed. They did not  shoot into the crowd. My own guess is that one of their (the Panamanians')  bullets hit the civilians."  </P> <P> The four men, dressed in civilian clothes, were driving to a popular downtown  Panama City restaurant Saturday night when they made a wrong turn and were  halted by soldiers at the checkpoint. According to the Pentagon, a crowd of  five soldiers and about 40 bystanders swarmed the Americans' car when it  arrived at the checkpoint.  </P> <P> The men received no answer when they inquired in Spanish why they were not  being permitted to pass through the checkpoint, according to the Pentagon.  Instead, the soldiers' rifles were loaded and aimed at the Americans.  </P> <P> When the Panamanian soldiers grabbed at the Americans through the windows of  their car and bystanders started chanting anti-American slogans, according to  U.S. officials, the U.S. military officers "felt they were in a threatening  situation" and drove off.  </P> <P> The checkpoint guards responded by firing their Soviet-made AK-47s directly at  the passengers in the fleeing vehicle, not at their tires, officials said. The  Americans drove directly to nearby Gorgas Hospital, a U.S. Defense Department  facility, where the victim died about 15 minutes after being admitted for  treatment.  </P> <P> The Navy lieutenant and his wife witnessed the shooting because their car had  been halted at the same checkpoint shortly before the four American soldiers  arrived. The couple had become lost while driving home from a restaurant,  according to the Pentagon.  </P> <P> They were immediately taken to a nearby Defense Forces office, blindfolded with  masking tape and driven to another location for interrogation, according to the  Pentagon. Officials said the lieutenant believed the questioning took place at  Defense Forces headquarters.  </P> <P> After the interrogation and beating ended, the couple were released about three  blocks away from PDF headquarters. Officials said they arrived about 2:15 a.m.  at the naval security office, where they told their story.  </P> <P> It was apparently the bloodiest confrontation between the two nations since  Jan. 9, 1964, when U.S. police and soldiers clashed with Panamanian rioters in  the old Panama Canal Zone. Four U.S. soldiers and 22 Panamanians died in that  clash.  </P> <P> Morris, in a telephone interview from Panama City, attributed the shooting to  escalating anti-American rhetoric by government forces in Panama, which she  characterized as "an attempt to distract focus away from the fact that Gen.  Noriega is a dictator, and a bloody one."  </P> <P> A top State Department official, who declined to be identified, said it is  unlikely the killers were acting under orders since the checkpoint  confrontation occurred without warning. Likewise, he said, subsequent  detention, beating and harassment of the American bystanders was probably not a  premeditated act on the part of the Panama Defense Forces.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, American officials were taking strict precautions against further  loss of American life in Panama. U.S. soldiers dressed in battle fatigues were  mobilized along the perimeters of American installations a few miles northwest  of Panama City.  </P> <P> In addition, all 12,000 American military personnel in Panama were placed under  a so-called Delta curfew, which requires them to postpone all unnecessary  travel and confine their movements in Panama to restricted routes heavily  guarded by U.S. forces.  </P> <P> Another 40,000 Americans also live in Panama.  </P> <P> The curfew added to a feeling of tension in the city on Sunday, according to  military officials. There were no golfers on the links at Ft. Amador, a  military base shared by U.S. and Panamanian military units, and a popular  picnic ground near the base was also virtually deserted.  </P> <P> Despite the increased tension brought on by the shooting, there were no  reported incidents of renewed violence Sunday.  </P> <P> U.S. officials refused to discuss what options were being considered for U.S.  action or whether the President had considered a military response. But there  was no sense of urgency in the statements made by Administration officials.  </P> <P> "The situation is being intensely watched, and the President will continue to  review status reports and briefings in the days ahead," said one State  Department official.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk issued a statement accusing Noriega of  using "force and intimidation" to thwart the will of the Panamanian people. "We  deplore this act of violence," he said. "We are presently looking into the  circumstances of this incident."  </P> <P> Tensions between the armed forces of the two governments already were high as a  result of the United States' long support for the overthrow of Noriega. Since  October, the United States has been reviewing its legal options for direct  action against Noriega, who is under indictment on drug charges in the United  States.  </P></p>

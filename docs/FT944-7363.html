			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Economic Watch: Rate of French growth slower France's rate of growth slowed in the third quarter to 0.7 per cent, from 1.1 per cent in the second quarter and 0.8 per cent in the first three months of this year, Insee, the official statistics agency, reported yesterday. Insee also said consumer purchases of manufactured goods fell by 2.5 per cent in October after stagnation in September. But the agency saw 'no sign of a break in the recovery', which had been exceptionally strong in the January-June period and was now continuing at a more normal pace. Even if gross domestic product was flat in the fourth quarter, average growth this year would be 2.3 per cent higher than 1993, Insee said. In the third quarter growth was led by domestic demand, with household consumption rising 0.9 per cent in July-September. This offset the one negative factor - exports, which in volume terms increased only 0.1 per cent in the third quarter after growing 2.7 per cent in April-June. By contrast, import volumes rose by the same 1.6 per cent as in the second quarter. Italian industrial producer prices rose 3.7 per cent in the year to September compared with a 3.5 per cent rise in August, the National Statistical Institute reported. The fall in the west German inflation rate is gathering pace, according to preliminary data from two key states, published yesterday. Consumer prices in North Rhine-Westphalia, the most populous state, rose 0.1 per cent in the month to mid-November. The annual rate was 2.5 per cent, after 2.7 per cent in October, and the lowest since March 1991, the regional statistics office said. A 0.2 per cent month-on-month rise in Baden-Wurttemberg brought the annual rate there to 2.4 per cent after 2.6 per cent last month.</p>

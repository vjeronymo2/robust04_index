			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GA cuts first quarter loss to Pounds 29m - Chink of light but shares marked down 9p after profit taking THERE WAS a chink of light for the UK's beleaguered general insurance sector yesterday when General Accident, the third biggest of the UK's composite companies, showed a reduced pre-tax loss for the first quarter. Losses for the three months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 29.2m, slightly ahead of expectations and an improvement of Pounds 45.5m compared with the same period of 1991. This was 'a move in the right direction by anybody's standards,' said Mr Nelson Robertson, chief general manager. GA's satisfaction was marred, however, by the response from the market which marked the shares down 9p to 489p, a fall which largely reflected profit taking by traders after a strong performance by the shares over the last month. First quarter losses per share were cut to 5.4p (13.6p). Underwriting losses were down 20 per cent to Pounds 129.6m (Pounds 162.2m), with losses in the UK down by nearly a third to Pounds 65.2m (Pounds 92.8m). The underwriting improvement reflected a series of premium increases over the past 15 months and comparatively light weather-related losses. A decline in subsidence claims and the impact of premium increases reduced losses in the UK homeowners' sector to Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 20.9m). Commercial property losses also fell to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 21.7m), although the London bombs of April 10 and 11 will cost a further Pounds 6m in the second quarter. Rising claims costs in motor business are holding back improvement in the UK motor sector, where underwriting losses amounted to Pounds 26.5m compared with Pounds 32m a year earlier, despite heavy premium increases during the past 12 months. Investment income was up to Pounds 110.4m (Pounds 102.7m) and, adjusted to take into account interest paid, to Pounds 97.1m (Pounds 84.5m). Estate agency losses were down to Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 5.2m) and profits from life businesses emerged slightly lower at Pounds 7.8m (Pounds 8m). The group's financial position has also improved marginally over the first quarter. Net assets per share amounted to 317p (as of May 8), up 1p on the 316p recorded at the end of 1991. The solvency margin (the yardstick measuring net assets as a percentage of non-life premiums) was down marginally at 42 per cent (42.6 per cent). COMMENT After over a year in the doldrums, the last few weeks have seen the composites outperform the market by 15 per cent, a performance bettered only by the more obviously politically sensitive water stocks. Although there is some concern that the shares are now trading at too high a premium to net asset value, most analysts were inclined to attribute yesterday's fall simply to profit taking. The results indicate that the general insurance sector may be entering a recovery phase in its traditional cycle with recent premium increases feeding through into improved underwriting results. GA, which has only a minimum exposure to domestic mortgage indemnity business, is - barring major accidents - well placed to benefit. It appears bound to significantly reduce - and possibly eliminate - its pre-tax losses this year. The figures are also encouraging on the dividend front.</p>

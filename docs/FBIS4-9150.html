			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Eva </F> Martinkova; place and date not given: "Some Parties Are Playing  False Cards"]    [Text] [Martinkova] In your view, what is the objective  of the Litomysl meeting of presidents?    [Klaus] This provides yet another means of communication  with neighboring countries. We desire this communication, we  are striving for it, and we are pleased that it is going to  happen. Moreover, the meeting has another important  aspect--breaking down the incessant polarization of the world  into West and East. The fact that the presidents of Austria and  Germany will also be there is, I think, a step in the right  direction.    [Martinkova] In the wake of Wednesday's [13 April]  government session, do the ambiguities within the coalition over  the jurisdiction of the higher territorial units still persist?    [Klaus] There is no fundamental dispute among the coalition  parties in the actual issue of jurisdiction. When we begin to  discuss whether the new regions may conclude international  treaties or announce their own taxes or smog alert levels, or  build their own theaters or galleries, any overpoliticized  dispute will evaporate. The government coalition ministers, in  closed ranks, are looking for ways to define jurisdiction. The  problems lie somewhere else. In the political game, that is  being played beyond the matter-of-fact element of this issue.    I repeat: This is not a matter-of-fact dispute. Some parties  are still pulling false cards from their sleeves. I would hope  that they do not play with them.    [Martinkova] The unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is  one of the lowest in the world. Apparently, only Luxembourg,  Japan, and New Zealand are doing better. Nevertheless, the  government is often the target of criticism because of this.  Can we in the Czech Republic talk about false employment,  employment that interferes with natural economic relations?    [Klaus] Unemployment in our country is the way it is; no one  is holding it back or speeding it up. Each month the government  awaits with anticipation the figures on its movement, without in  any way attempting to manipulate it. Its low level is a major  success, which, on the other hand, is the subject of various  worst-case scenarios and elaborations on the artificial curbing  of unemployment. What I mean is the criticism from some  economists from the postcommunist countries. However, even  Western states are a little envious of our low unemployment  rate. The current level is a consequence of our economy's  exceptionally high absorption capability. For example, in the  Louny District, where the unemployment level is one of the  highest--it is touching 8 percent--there are about 3,000  unemployed. However, three years ago, 7,000 people lost their  jobs due to the collapse of the large agricultural enterprises.  Where are they? In new jobs.    [Martinkova] You say that the enterprise sphere is the trade  unionists' domain, not collective bargaining at the  macroeconomic level. The Maastricht Treaty, however, even takes  into consideration supranational collective bargaining within  the framework of the European Union.    [Klaus] I have never made a secret of my criticism of the  Maastricht Treaty. The social democratic authors who  participated in drafting it have left their mark in certain  points. The social sphere is one of them.</p>

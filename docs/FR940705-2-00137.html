			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-D&hyph;2. Experiments Involving Whole Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section covers experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified whole plants, and/or experiments involving recombinant DNA-modified organisms associated with whole plants, except those that fall under Section III-A, III-B, III-C, or III-E. It should be emphasized that knowledge of the organisms and judgment based on accepted scientific practices should be used in all cases in selecting the appropriate level of containment. For example, if the genetic modification has the objective of increasing pathogenicity or converting a non-pathogenic organism into a pathogen, then a higher level of containment may be appropriate depending on the organism, its mode of dissemination, and its target organisms. By contrast, a lower level of containment may be appropriate for small animals associated with many types of recombinant DNA-modified plants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D-2-a. BL1&hyph;P is recommended for all experiments with recombinant DNA-containing plants and plant-associated microorganisms not covered in Section III-D&hyph;2-b or other sections of the NIH Guidelines. Examples of such experiments are those involving recombinant DNA-modified plants that are not noxious weeds or that cannot interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area, and experiments involving whole plants and recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic (see Section V-W) microorganisms that have no recognized potential for rapid and widespread dissemination or for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rhizobium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp. and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Agrobacterium  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> spp.). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b. BL2&hyph;P or BL1&hyph;P + biological containment is recommended for the following experiments:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(1). Plants modified by recombinant DNA that are noxious weeds or can interbreed with noxious weeds in the immediate geographic area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(2). Plants in which the introduced DNA represents the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete genome of a non-exotic infectious agent (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(3). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified non-exotic microorganisms that have a recognized potential for serious detrimental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(4). Plants associated with recombinant DNA-modified exotic microorganisms that have no recognized potential for serious natural ecosystems (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-D&hyph;2-b-(5). Experiments with recombinant DNA-modified arthropods or small animals associated with plants, or with arthropods or small animals with recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms associated with them if the recombinant DNA-modified microorganisms have no recognized potential for serious detrimental impact on managed or natural ecosystems (see Section V-W).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section III-E. Exempt Experiments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following recombinant DNA molecules are exempt from the NIH Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and registration with the Institutional Biosafety Committee is not required:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-E&hyph;1. Those that are not in organisms or viruses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-E&hyph;2. Those that consist entirely of DNA segments from a single nonchromosomal or viral DNA source, though one or more of the segments may be a synthetic equivalent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-E&hyph;3. Those that consist entirely of DNA from a prokaryotic host including its indigenous plasmids or viruses when propagated only in that host (or a closely related strain of the same species), or when transferred to another host by well established physiological means.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-E&hyph;4. Those that consist entirely of DNA from an eukaryotic host including its chloroplasts, mitochondria, or plasmids (but excluding viruses) when propagated only in that host (or a closely related strain of the same species).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-E&hyph;5. Those that consist entirely of DNA segments from different species that exchange DNA by known physiological processes, though one or more of the segments may be a synthetic equivalent. A list of such exchangers will be prepared and periodically revised by the NIH Director with advice of the RAC after appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment (see Section IV-C&hyph;1-b-(1)-(c)). See Appendices A-I through A-VI for a list of natural exchangers that are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section III-E&hyph;6. Those that do not present a significant risk to health or the environment (see Section IV-C&hyph;1-b-(1)-(c)), as determined by the NIH Director, with the advice of the RAC, and following appropriate notice and opportunity for public comment. See Appendix C for other classes of experiments which are exempt from the NIH Guidelines.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Amendment to Section IV, Roles and Responsibilities of the NIH Guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amended version of Section IV-C&hyph;1-b reads as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Section IV-C&hyph;1-b.

Major Actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To execute Major Actions, the NIH Director shall seek the advice of the RAC and provide an opportunity for public and Federal agency comment. Specifically, the Notice of Meeting and Proposed Actions to the NIH Guidelines shall be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least 15 days before the RAC meeting (not applicable for Expedited Review single patient human gene transfer experiments considered under Appendix M-VI). The NIH Director's decision, at his/her discretion, may be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for 15 days of comment before final action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken.

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: A future based on a dual-track strategy for growth - Vital changes that have transformed Courtaulds IN HIS new headquarters in London's west end Mr Sipko Huismans was in ebullient mood as he announced an 8 per cent improvement in Courtaulds' full year profits. The move to the smart new offices symbolises the changes at Courtaulds since it demerged its textiles operations two-years ago, according to Mr Huismans. 'We've moved the group from a tired, beaten up textile company in dingy surroundings into a modern up-to-date entity which has taken a grip of its destiny,' he says. 'We were described as a rat-bag of industries ripe only for takeover. Now we have demonstrated we have critical mass.' Courtaulds' ability to shrug off the recession has been dependent upon tight financial controls and its ability to manage high-margin businesses, Mr Huismans says. The company has cut its workforce from 23,550 last year to 22,700 and further cost savings are inevitable. Any company executive who reckons his company is efficiently run is a fool, argues Mr Huismans. Courtaulds has managers who cannot manage and there is lots more room for profits improvements, he adds. For the future, Mr Huismans has developed a dual-track strategy for growth through the exploitation of a new material called Tencel and through the replication of businesses on a global scale. Geographical expansion will mainly be in the Far East. He says he is not looking at diversification in any circumstances and that any acquisitions would be add-ons. Mr Huismans says that during his tenure, he would like to more than double turnover in the Far East. At present the region generates about 6 per cent of sales and he would like it to reach 15 per cent. Mr Huismans, who has been chief executive for nearly two years, reckons managers can achieve about four or five things over about half a dozen years before running out of steam. Meanwhile, Tencel, a man-made fibre aimed at the high-quality cotton market, remains one of Courtaulds' chief hopes. Its main advantage is that it does not need dry cleaning, can be laundered like cotton, but unlike cotton it can be produced when needed. A first Tencel plant, costing about Dollars 85m, is on-stream and should make every existing plant for cellulose fibres obsolete, according to Mr Huismans. The process also has a minimal environmental impact, he adds. He wants Courtaulds to reap the full benefits from Tencel, rather than setting-up co-marketing agreements. As for threats, the main one - according to analysts - is a Taiwanese investment for additional viscose production in the US which threatens to flood the market there, potentially undermining margins of between 20 and 25 per cent. But Mr Huismans reckons any investment would not come on stream for five years and the permits for the necessary pulp plant have not even been given yet. 'We've made mistakes,' admits Mr Huismans. 'I can name half a dozen without even thinking.' When pressed for examples he says it would be invidious to give details, but adds that all of them were because the group failed to understand the market or underestimated the reaction of the competition. 'In the end, you have to be an optimist, otherwise you end up as a gilts investor,' he concludes.</p>

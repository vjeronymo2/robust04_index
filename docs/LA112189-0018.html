			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> DELAY SOUGHT IN USE OF REAGAN DIARIES  </P> <P> The Justice Department asked a federal judge to grant a two-week delay before  compelling former President Ronald Reagan to turn over diaries and other  personal records that his former national security adviser says he needs to  defend himself against charges in the Iran-Contra scandal. U.S. District Judge  Harold H. Greene has taken no action on the request. Reagan had been subpoenaed  by John M. Poindexter's attorneys to produce the records by Wednesday. The  department's request was filed on behalf of the national archivist. Theodore B.  Olson, a Washington attorney retained by Reagan, filed the same request.  </P></p>

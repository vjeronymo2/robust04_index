			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Text of "Declaration Issued by the Democratic Convention of </F> Romania"; date not given]    [Text] The end of the year is always an opportunity to  take stock. The Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR] notes  with concern that the inventory of the exercise of power by the  current coalition of political forces does not acknowledge the  alarm signals being more and more clearly emitted by Romanian  society.    The economic crisis and the social crisis experienced by  Romania thus turn into the nation's serious crisis of confidence  in the political forces, which have assumed the responsibility  to rule the country. The immobilism and uncertainty that those  in power enjoy, the absence of a firm political desire for  change, as well as voluntarism and arrogance do not offer  tangible answers to the growing desperation of our citizens  regarding the serious economic imbalance and the increasing and  futile sacrifices, which an incompetent government has been  perpetuating for more than a year now.    Instead of protecting the standard of living and the  security  of citizens, those in power protect corruption and stagnation.  Instead of making efforts to bring about change and structural  reform that might put an end to our crisis, and instead of  promoting truth, the executive power perpetuates confusion and  stagnation that permit the preservation of the privileges of a  petty and greedy political clientele. No generous project, no  disinterested thoughts, and no respect for the interests of the  citizen and for the sovereign interests of the nation inspires  the policy of the current holders of the essential levers of our  country's political activity.    The CDR has done everything in its power to change this  tense  situation. It has always promoted a policy of supporting a firm  policy of reform and has effectively supported all correct legal  initiatives -- unfortunately too few so far. It has  consistently and responsibly assumed the basic political task  characteristic of any opposition, namely to criticize the errors  made by the executive power. Through constitutional means at  its disposal, it has drawn attention to the growing mistrust of  citizens in the policy promoted by the coalition forces, which  ensured the PDSR's [Social Democracy Party of Romania] majority  in Parliament, and in the way in which the PDSR government has  fulfilled its mandate. On several occasions, it proposed a  program of stopping the crisis and it has shown its readiness  for any dialogue that would have permitted the fulfillment of  this program and the halting of the dramatic deterioration of  the citizens' standard of living.    The systematic rejection of these arguments, the demagogic  and arrogant answer by the majority coalition, which did not  heed these signals and continued verbal maneuvers and back-stage  moves instead of firmly implementing at least its own reform  program, have taken our country to a serious crisis of political  confidence.    It is clear for anyone that one cannot govern correctly with  a majority of 13 votes in parliament and a proportion of  confidence, without any precedent in the past four years. The  PDSR is trying to persuade us that these are inevitable effects  of any reform policy; it is obvious, however, for anyone that,  on the contrary, these are the effects of lack of will to  promote the reform process. Our citizens realize very well that  stagnation and the absence of a consistent strategy for change  generate a chaotic and uncontrollable development of the  inflation and an unprecedented impoverishing of the majority of  the population, and they realize that the government imposes  useless sacrifices on the country; the electorate realizes very  well that the government's lack of prospects takes all of us  down a blind lane from which it will be more and more difficult  to emerge.    Within this context, the CDR calls on the entire nation not  to lose hope. There are still a lot of competent people and  generous ideas to put an end to this crisis. These latent  forces have to become the essential vector of our political  activity. Through our joint will, let us make the PDSR renounce  the bankrupt policy that it continues to promote, and to adopt a  new policy able to stir and involve all those who are waiting  for a new wave in our country. We are calling on all  responsible political formations, all trade unions and civic  associations, and the entire Romanian society to rally around  the CDR in order to impose a new political pact on those in  power; a pact that will rally all forces favoring change and  that will keep away reactionary, extremist, and antireform  forces from the executive power; a pact that will ensure the  responsible promotion of a clear-cut, generous, and intelligent  strategy for coming out of this crisis; and a pact that will put  an end to misery, poverty, corruption, and lies. Let us turn  1994 into the first year of a prosperous, powerful, and  dignified Romania!    [Signed] Emil Constantinescu, CDR president</p>

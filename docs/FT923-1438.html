			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / BA scraps 500 supervisor posts BRITISH AIRWAYS has abolished more than 500 supervisor posts as part of a flexible-working deal agreed with unions representing almost 4,000 engineering and maintenance staff at Heathrow, Gatwick and Glasgow. Mr Alistair Cummings, BA's director of engineering, said: 'We realised supervisors were doing an impossible job. They had to combine aspects of man management, the organisation of production, problem-solving and material shortages.' Former supervisors will be absorbed into teams responsible for one or other of those functions. Some will be promoted into the upper layers of production control management within a new production control unit on the shop floor. The move is consistent with recent research by the Confederation of British Industry and the National Economic Development Council. Both criticised the competence and development of Britain's supervisors, who number more than 1m. BA's approach to the matter fits in with recommendations that the job of supervisor should be rethought. Some functions should be transferred to management and others to production team leaders. The airline says the wider deal, agreed with the AEEU electrical and engineering union and the MSF professional and technical union, underlines the sea change in relations with engineering staff. It believes the deal means immediate productivity gains of 5 per cent to 10 per cent. In the longer term, BA hopes the new arrangement will allow it to undertake more work for other airlines because of the end of demarcation among engineering staff and the creation of a multi-skilled workforce through training. It introduces a simplified pay structure that consolidates allowances into basic pay. That means improved sick pay and pension benefits. The airline says all jobs are secure and the deal will improve long-term prospects for staff. During the 1980s and early 1990, BA and its engineering staff were involved in a number of disputes over pay and flexibility. BA says relations were hampered by a lack of trust on both sides. The airline believes the vital groundwork for the new agreement was laid in 1986 when the two sides agreed a measure of flexibility. Union fears of job losses proved groundless. Management and unions cemented their working relationship in 1990 when the two sides met frequently to discuss changes in the airline. Mr Roger Butler, an AEEU executive council member, welcomed the deal, which he said would protect jobs: 'This multi-skilled training package gives the workers higher skills and more independence. It also gives them a lot more trust and responsibility.' He said the abolition of the supervisors was sensible, since it had been proved that the workforce could self-supervise.</p>

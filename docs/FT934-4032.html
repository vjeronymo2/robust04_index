			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / International Company News: Incentive profits 55% ahead Profits at Incentive, the Swedish industrial group controlled by the Wallenberg family, rose 55 per cent to SKr345m (Dollars 40.9m) in the first nine months, excluding associated companies. The company started to feel the full effect of the Swedish krona's depreciation in the third quarter, after the expiry of hedging programmes, adding to the benefits of cost-cutting and lower capital costs it was already experiencing. The profits improvement would have been greater but for a SKr70m charge for restructuring within the group's marine unit, Hagglunds. Market conditions remain disappointing, the company warned, even though there was a pick-up in the volume of orders in the latter half of the period. Sales at SKr8.33bn were down 2 per cent in underlying terms from last year, because an upturn in the North American and Asian markets was unable to offset continuing weakness in Europe, particularly in the Nordic region. Orders rose to SKr9.12bn from SKr8.48bn. If income from Incentive's stakes in Asea, Electrolux and Esab are included, profits were up by 34 per cent at SKr1.07bn. The main impact came from Asea, which lifted its contribution to SKr665m from SKr485m. The group says its full year result, excluding associated companies, will exceed last year's SKr371m, with the final quarter expected to show an improvement on the corresponding 1992 period.</p>

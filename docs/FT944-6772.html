			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / Equity Markets: Investors fear Fed-induced recession Investors this week will continue to wrestle with fears that the Federal Reserve may induce recession through tighter and tighter monetary policy. But economists do not expect a repeat of last week's severe falls as a good deal of the worry about higher interest rates has been absorbed by the market, at least for the moment. Such apprehensions could resurface, however, if economic news this week continues to show strong inflationary pressures in the economy. Perhaps the most important piece of data will be Friday's employment figures. A consensus of economists expects non-farm employment for November to show an increase of about 225,000 jobs. If the figure is significantly greater, it could ignite fears that the Fed will move sooner rather than later to increase interest rates. Investors will also get early indications of the strength of the economy through a preliminary reading of the gross domestic product due out on Wednesday and a report from the National Association of Purchasing Managers on Thursday. Market-watchers will be looking for hints of consumer spending habits during the holiday season, the strongest part of the year for retailers. Early in the week, investors will probably be looking for bargains amid the rubble of last week's sell-off that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge more than 90 points last Tuesday, its biggest drop since last February. That fall only compounded five days of losses, which saw the Dow drop nearly 120 points overall even after a 33 point rebound on Friday. The interest rate increases that battered the stock market had the opposite effect on bonds, which rose last week in mirror image to the decline in share prices. Laszlo Birinyi, president of research firm Birinyi Associates, expects this week's market to be steady, but somewhat lower as investors recover from last week's slide. 'The history of these declines has been that once the market stabilises and people realise that there was much more noise than significance to them, they will be back.' Ultimately, the Dow will return to the broad trading range it has maintained for most of the year in the 3,800-point range, he says. One indication that there could be a steadying of the market comes from Friday's performance of cyclical stocks, which generally bear the brunt of fears about recession. Those shares bounced up further than the Dow on Friday, with Morgan Stanley's index of cyclical stocks up 1.13 per cent compared with a 0.92 per cent increase in the Dow. Other analysts are not so optimistic about stocks. Although hope remains for a year-end rally, most are bearish about the general trend for the next few months.</p>

			<p><P> March 13, 1990, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MCA AGREES TO SELL AILING TOY UNIT  </P> <P> Entertainment giant MCA Inc. has agreed to sell its troubled LJN Toys unit to  Acclaim Entertainment Inc. for an undisclosed amount of cash and Acclaim common  stock.  </P> <P> Acclaim, a major publisher of software for the popular Nintendo Entertainment  System, will acquire all of LJN's U.S. operations, with the exception of its  American Publishing puzzles division.  </P> <P> The accord also gives Acclaim the right to release five additional titles per  year for the Nintendo Entertainment System under the LJN label.  </P> <P> The acquisition remains subject to various government regulatory and legal  approvals, the companies said.  </P> <P> Acclaim, based in Oyster Bay, N.Y., was the first U.S. company to obtain a  license from Nintendo of America to publish software for the Japanese computer  game maker. It had sales of nearly $70 million last year, an increase of 76%  over 1988.  </P> <P> MCA has been plagued by the performance of its LJN unit since consumer  disenchantment with a faulty LJN toy gun caused MCA profits to plunge 79.5% to  $8.1 million in the second quarter of 1987. Net income was hurt, in part, by a  $35-million charge that MCA took to write down the value of LJN's inventory of  paint-shooting "Gotcha!" toy guns.  </P></p>

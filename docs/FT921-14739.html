			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy debt downgraded by S&amp;P STANDARD &amp; POORS, the US credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded the subordinated debt issued by RH Macy, the US department store chain which sent a shudder through the retail industry on Friday when it announced it would be late making January payments to suppliers. S&amp;P said its action reflected Macy's weaker-than-expected performance during the crucial Christmas season, leading to near-term liquidity pressures. It lowered the rate from triple-C-plus to triple-C-minus. Meanwhile, Macy's senior management has been repeating that it is working on a comprehensive plan to reduce its debt and has been trying to dispel persistent rumours it may be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In a series of interviews, Mr Edward Finkelstein, Macy's chairman, and Mr Myron Ullman, its vice-chairman, have insisted they have no plan to file for Chapter 11, which they say would not be in the company's interests. However, they declined to give details of their new financing plan, which is being worked out with investment bankers at Goldman,Sachs. Macy's, which went private in a leveraged buy-out in 1986, is one of the leading department store groups in the US, but it has been struggling under a burden of more than Dollars 3.5bn in long-term debt, which it has difficulty in servicing. The group lost Dollars 155m in the quarter to early November. As a private company, Macy does not give out monthly sales figures, but analysts believe its sales were probably flat to slightly lower, compared with the group's hopes of a 5 per cent increase. The company said on Friday it would not be sending out any cheques to vendors until January 25, two weeks late. This was because an agreement with its commercial bank lenders required it to cut its revolving borrowings to specified levels between mid-December and mid-February. The agreement with the banks was negotiated in early December, when Macy apparently hoped Christmas sales would be sufficiently strong for it to both cut borrowings and pay vendors, but last week that proved impossible. S&amp;P said a critical element in Macy's avoidance of default had been its good relationships with suppliers and banks, but the vendor moratorium had now jeopardised this, 'substantially increasing near-term risks.'</p>

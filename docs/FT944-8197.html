			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (2): Moving forward at a snail's pace - Technology For several years nuclear technology has been moving forward at a snail's pace. Progress is painfully slow for those who remember how quickly new reactors were designed during the growth years in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s. It is also glacial when compared with other industries, not only fast-moving fields such as biotechnology and electronics but also competing energy technologies such as efficient gas-fired power plants. Some of the reasons for the slow progress are obvious. After 15 years with few orders for new nuclear plants the industry has neither the funds to undertake research and development on a large scale nor the incentive to design new reactors. So the main activity is gradual, incremental improvement of the long-established reactor designs - which is not something to quicken the heart of an enthusiastic young engineer. There is a morale problem in some nuclear research establishments, with an ageing workforce soldiering on to retirement. The pressurised water reactor, designed originally in the US, dominates the international nuclear industry. PWRs represent 55 per cent of the world's operating nuclear reactors and generate 63 per cent of nuclear electricity. And the PWR features just as prominently in the industry's future plans. According to the Nuclear Industry Handbook 1994, published by Nuclear Engineering International, PWRs account for 74 of the 143 units planned or under construction (equivalent to 67 per cent of generating capacity). The PWR pumps water under high pressure - to prevent boiling - to the generator, where steam is raised in a separate circuit. The next most popular type is the PWR's closest cousin, the boiling water reactor. The BWR raises steam directly from the cooling water and therefore does not need a separate heat exchanger. Although the simpler circuitry reduces construction costs, this advantage is offset by the requirement for additional shielding since the circuit is susceptible to radioactive contamination. Development of advanced BWRs for the late 1990s is continuing, particularly in Japan where five BWR units are under construction and four are planned. But development work in Europe and US is concentrated on advanced PWRs. These designs incorporate a range of 'passive' or 'inherent' safety features which are intended to reduce the risk of a catastrophic accident by an order of magnitude or more compared to existing reactors. For example the power density of the core is reduced and the reactor is larger than earlier PWRs with the same output. And the new designs are simpler, more rugged and more forgiving of operator error and mechanical failure. Europe's standardised advanced design is the 1,450MW European PWR (EPR) from Nuclear Power International, a partnership of France's Framatome and Germany's Siemens. The project timetable calls for sites for the first EPR units to be selected in 1997 and construction to begin in 1999, with commercial operation from 2005. The US is developing two advanced PWRs with joint funding from the government and industry: the 1,350MW System 80+ from ABB Combustion Engineering and the 600MW AP600 from Westinghouse. With little immediate prospect of new orders from the US electricity supply industry, their commercial prospects probably depend on winning export business in Asia. Westinghouse, for example, set up an AP600 engineering centre in Indonesia this year to prepare for the design's introduction there. The emphasis of advanced reactor research is more on winning public acceptability through inherent safety than reducing costs, because the industry remains convinced that in the long term it can win the economic competition with fossil fuels. Development of gas-cooled reactors - the technology on which the British nuclear industry relied until a PWR was ordered for Sizewell B - has virtually stopped in the UK. But gas-cooled reactor research is continuing in the US and Russia. The latest government-funded US project is the Gas Turbine-Modular Helium Reactor (GT-MHR) in which high-temperature helium coolant from the reactor drives a gas turbine directly, without the need for a steam generating circuit. It is claimed to be safe, simple and cheap to build and operate. The GT-MHR is a candidate for burning surplus plutonium extracted from former Soviet nuclear warheads in a US-Russian joint venture. The reactor would generate electricity and produce energy for district heating. Meanwhile R&amp;D into fast breeder reactors - once seen as the inevitable next step for the nuclear industry - is running down worldwide. Substantial programmes still continue in France, Russia and Japan, but there seems to be little prospect that fast reactors will enter commercial operation within 20 years.</p>

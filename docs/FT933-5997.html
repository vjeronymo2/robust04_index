			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Survey of Malaysia (13): A crucible of races and religions - Sabah's delicate demographic balance is being steadily altered ASK for a meal in a cafe in Kota Kinabalu, the quiet, seaside capital of Sabah, and the chances are that the waitress will be an Indonesian teenager; glance at a building site, and half the construction workers you see are probably Filipinos. Since the 1970s, hundreds of thousands of casual migrant workers and refugees have poured into Sabah, the state perched on the northern tip of Borneo two and a half hours away from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur by air across the South China Sea. The immigrants, politely and inaccurately called 'the transient population' in official documents, are now estimated to account for as much as 40 per cent of the Sabah population of 1.8m and two thirds of the workforce; many have lived in Sabah for two decades. Their continued presence is yet another bone of contention between the federal authorities and Sabah's predominantly Christian state government. A large portion of the immigrants, numbering between 450,000 and 700,000, are Moslems from the southern Philippines or Indonesia. Sabah is one of only two states in the country led by opponents of Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the federal prime minister, and Sabah officials of local Kadazan or ethnic Chinese origin suspect the federal government of wanting to flood the state with Moslems who would be favourably inclined towards Dr Mahathir and the Moslem-controlled national government. 'What Kuala Lumpur is trying to do is to legalise these people by the back door by giving them the identity cards which signify your citizenship,' said Mr Bernard Dompok, the Sabah finance minister, in an interview. 'We don't mind the workers here, but we want them to be properly regulated.' Like immigrants in so many countries, the 'illegals' of Sabah are needed but also resented by the local population. They work in plantations, building sites, restaurants and hotels and as maids in the homes of richer Sabahans for wages which the local inhabitants would not accept. Tourism, for example, is an increasingly important foreign currency earner for Sabah, as the logging industry inexorably declines after years of deforestation and over-extraction of valuable timber. In the last five years, visitor arrivals have doubled to more than 100,000. Many workers in the tourism industry are of Filipino origin. Plantations of oil palm and cocoa are also vital to the Sabah economy, with the state accounting for 70 per cent of the Malaysian cocoa crop and 10 per cent of palm oil output - a figure which is rising as more and more oil palm plantation developers come in from peninsular Malaysia. In some areas as many as 95 per cent of plantation workers are Indonesians. Sabah's remoteness and internal transport problems can push costs for businesses 20 or 30 per cent above the national average, and the Sabah government acknowledges that cheap migrant labourers help to offset such disadvantages. 'In many ways the economy of the state of Sabah moves because of them,' said Mr Dompok. 'They are a source of cheap labour .. This is the only competitive edge we have over west Malaysia and Singapore.' Even the smuggling of cigarettes and other goods from the southern Philippines - often on the same boats as the migrants - is welcomed by Sabahan officials as a means of reducing costs, since most customs duties are collected by the federal rather than the state government. Sabah citizens, however, complain bitterly that the immigrants overload the state's schools and hospitals (without paying taxes) and breed crime and prostitution - to the extent that some areas, especially in the eastern towns of Sandakan and Tawau, are said to be 'no-go' areas for the police. The problem of coping with the immigrants is compounded by confusion over who in Sabah really are Malaysian citizens and by widespread forging of identity cards. Many Sabahans, especially the Kadazans in the interior, do not have birth certificates and it is easy for an immigrant to bribe a village headman into acknowledging him or her as a local. 'They are so integrated,' says one ethnic Chinese Sabahan of the immigrant Filipinos. 'I myself can't tell the difference. Some people have been here 20 years.' Mr Harris bin Mohamad Salleh, a former Sabah chief minister and a strong supporter of Dr Mahathir, says that 10 to 20 per cent of immigrant Moslems have become citizens over the years and claims proudly that more than half the state's population is now Moslem. But if the federal government is indeed encouraging the naturalisation of such people it is a tactic which may backfire. One of the dangers is that the presence of numerous Filipinos in Sabah will revive a dormant territorial claim to Sabah by the Philippines; in the 19th century the Sultan of the Sulu islands, now part of the Philippines, leased Sabah for Dollars 5,000 a year to British businessmen. He never got it back. Another danger for the federal government is that the influx of Moslems will not have the desired political effect of boosting support for the United Malays National Organisation (Umno), the dominant national party. According to officials in Sabah, local Moslems are as resentful as anyone else about the competition from immigrants, especially in the fishing and fishmongering trades along the coast. Nor is it certain that newly legalised Moslems will support the Kuala Lumpur government. The immigrants often share the Sabahans' resentment of the dictats of far away Kuala Lumpur. The Sabah state authorities, under Mr Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the chief minister, pride themselves on the integration of races and religions in Sabah and have managed to lure some Sabah Moslems into their fold. 'What it (the federal government) doesn't understand is that these people, even if they are Moslems, are basically nominal Moslems,' said Mr Dompok of the Filipinos who make up two thirds of the immigrants. 'Religion is secondary.'  ---------------------- REAL GDP GROWTH (%)  ----------------------        Malaysia   Sabah  ---------------------- 1988        8.9     5.5 1989        9.2     6.2 1990        9.7     3.6 1991        8.7     1.8 1992          8      3*  ---------------------- * estimate Source: Berita IDS  ----------------------  -------------------------------------------------- SABAH'S LOCAL AND FOREIGN WORKERS BY SECTOR IN 1988  -------------------------------------------------- SECTOR                      LOCAL (%)   FOREIGN (%)  -------------------------------------------------- Agriculture                        10            90 Forestry                           53            47 Construction                     50.7          49.3 Wholesale, retail trade          71.6          28.4 Manufacturing                      58            42 Miscellaneous                    32.8          67.2  -------------------------------------------------- Sources: Statistics Department, Sabah Institute for Development Studies  --------------------------------------------------</p>

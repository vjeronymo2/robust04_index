			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Bonds: EIB in record L1,000bn deal as Eurolira sector expands The flood of fresh debt in the Eurobond market shows no sign of abating as new issues emerged across a wide range of currencies yesterday. The Eurolira bond market continued its rapid expansion, as the European Investment Bank launched the largest ever deal in a single tranche. Issuance in the sector is running at a record level: as well as the EIB's L1,000bn deal, Bayerische Landesbank launched a German-targeted L300bn issue yesterday, following a deal by Bayerische Vereinsbank on Monday. This brings the total amount of new issues so far this year to L3,300bn, compared with L18,000bn for the whole of last year. Although the newly liberalised market is beginning to appear overloaded, the injection of liquidity into the market is helping to attract more institutional participants. 'L1,000bn is the typical size of an Italian government bond issue,' said Mr Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano. He reported strong sales to fund managers in the UK, Switzerland, Germany, Scandinavia and Benelux countries. However, retail investors also participated in the deal, he added. The L1,000bn EIB deal is part of its total lending programme of L5,000bn to Italy this year. The issue was priced to yield 88 basis points below the gross yield of the five-year Italian government bond. Although this appears aggressive, it compares favourably with the pricing of other recent Eurobonds, such as last week's Eurofima deal. Some investors prefer to buy Eurobonds rather than government bonds because foreign investors are still having problems reclaiming withholding tax on Italian government bonds. In the D-Mark sector, the Republic of Finland launched DM2bn of seven-year bonds via Dresdner Bank. The bonds, which are due to be priced today with an expected yield spread of 21-23 basis points over the benchmark bund, are the first non-bank D-Mark straight bonds this year and met with good demand from domestic and foreign investors, syndicate officials said. Investors were especially attracted by the seven-year maturity, where there has been a dearth of supply in recent weeks. 'There's been a lot of supply in the five and 10-year sector - much of it not yet placed - but in the seven-year area there's very little paper,' said one syndicate manager. Another official said that the maturity should compensate for the pricing of the bonds, which he said was on the tight side. German buyers were reported to be especially attracted by the yield pick-up of some 11 basis points over domestic paper. The DM1bn issue of 10-year bonds by WestLB Finance via Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale were rather harder to place in Germany, yielding about 10 basis points below domestic bonds. Moreover, the 10-year sector is saturated with recent bank bond issues. 'The trouble is that issuers want to take advantage of low long yields, but investors want to buy short-dated paper to play what's left of the interest-rate easing,' said a Frankfurt syndicate official. The bonds ended at the recommended reoffer price of 99.80. The Ecu sector came back to life with the first new issue this year - Ecu225m of seven-year bonds for Eurofima. Despite its relatively tight pricing, it met with strong retail demand. According to an official with lead manager Swiss Bank Corporation, the deal quickly broke syndicate and the yield tightened to around 19 basis points below the relevant Ecu OAT from a launch spread of 17 basis points below. Separately, Italy's Y300bn global offering was priced yesterday at the tight end of the indicated range, at 41 basis points over the seven-year JGB yield. By the end of the day, the deal had tightened to 40 basis points over the curve, while the price dropped slightly from a fixed reoffer level of 99.98, to close at 99.88 in a weakening market. The Japanese equity-warrant sector saw three deals totalling Dollars 500m, which met with solid demand from continental Europe.</p>

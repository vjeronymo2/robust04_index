			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Heavier tax likely for combined bank THE ACQUISITION of Midland Bank by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank may impose substantial additional tax burdens on the combined group, it emerged yesterday. It is believed that the Inland Revenue is likely to gain additional taxes from the group at the expense of other regimes overseas with lower rates. Officials at Hongkong Bank were beginning to approach professional advisers and regulators yesterday to discuss the position. One suggested that the need to consult more widely on tax implications was one of the main reasons for making the offer public, to prevent news leaking out before an announcement was made. At the heart of the deliberations is the status of HSBC Holdings, a company established last April which is incorporated in the UK but classified as non-UK resident for tax purposes. This is possible because central control and management of the company rests in Hong Kong. Subsidiaries of HSBC include Marine Midland, James Capel, the British Bank of the Middle East and Hongkong Bank of Canada and Australia, as well as Hongkong Bank itself. Midland, currently resident for UK tax, would remain UK resident under the acquisition and become a subsidiary of HSBC. But there are questions over the non-resident status of HSBC as a result of the purchase. Officials say HSBC was created to give the Hongkong bank a foothold in Europe in preparation for the single European market. But it also had significant tax advantages. Its status as non-resident means it is liable for Hong Kong profit tax, which stood at 16.5 per cent in 1990, compared with 33 per cent corporation tax currently charged in the UK. The last published accounts for Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation for the year to December 31 1990  - before the new arrangement was ratified  - do not disclose tax liabilities. Those for HSBC Holdings only show liabilities against a Thai branch of the bank. The figures for 1991 are due to be published at the end of this month. A senior adviser to HSBC said it would be 'a naive conclusion' to assume tax issues had not been thought about in advance of the offer.</p>

			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / London set for patchy upturn SIGNS of economic recovery are emerging in Britain's capital,the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry's latest quarterly survey indicates. But falling employment and investment, and tough conditions for small and medium-sized companies, do not suggest a vigorous rise in activity. Business activity was stronger in the first quarter of this year than at any time in the past two and a half years, according to the survey of 250 London-based companies. Twenty nine per cent of companies reported higher business levels, compared with 24 per cent reporting lower business levels. The balance of 5 percentage points reporting higher rather than lower business compares with a negative balance of 7 points in the final quarter of 1992 and is at its highest level since June 1990. But the aggregate improvement is not universally shared. Small and medium-sized companies reported a further net fall in orders, while employment is still contracting. Thirty per cent of manufacturing companies and 18 per cent of service-sector companies reported a reduction in their total staff in the first quarter. Mr Simon Sperryn, chief executive of the London chamber, said: 'Recovery in London will be patchy and growth sluggish.' He predicted that London would lag behind other regions in the recovery's early stages. 'But this time there are a number of positive factors which should prevent a slide back into decline,' he added. London Chamber of Commerce. 071-248-4444.</p>

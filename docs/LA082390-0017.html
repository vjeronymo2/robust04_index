			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURBANK HOSPITAL LURES SURGEON FROM ST. VINCENT  </P> <P> Dr. Taro Yokoyama, one of the leading heart surgeons in California, will direct  a $5-million state-of-the-art cardiac surgery program at St. Joseph Medical  Center in Burbank that will have new operating rooms and a pediatric intensive  care unit built to his exact specifications.  </P> <P> In the past, most high-risk patients from the San Fernando Valley were referred  to the County-USC or UCLA medical centers, Good Samaritan Hospital or  Yokoyama's team at St. Vincent Medical Center in downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Among the operations Yokoyama performs are multiple valve replacements,  pediatric heart surgeries and procedures to preserve tissue after heart  attacks.  </P> <P> Yokoyama will continue operating at St. Vincent but has expanded his  specialized medical team so the group can also perform surgery at St. Joseph  Medical Center, said Vincent Guinan, president of St. Vincent.  </P> <P> St. Joseph administrator James Sauer said attracting Yokoyama will help the  hospital achieve its goal of creating two "major centers of excellence," one in  cancer treatment and one in heart surgery.  </P> <P> Four heart surgeons are already on the staff at St. Joseph, performing about  125 operations a year at the 647-bed Catholic hospital, Sauer said.  </P> <P> "We'll certainly double that volume and maybe triple it as the program gets  going," he said.  </P> <P> Yokoyama's team of 10 surgeons and 15 anesthesiologists, surgical and intensive  care nurses and physicians' assistants will begin working at St. Joseph on  Sept. 10.  </P> <P> After Yokoyama was selected by a hospital search committee to direct the heart  surgery program six months ago, negotiations began to accommodate the surgeon's  requirements, Sauer said.  </P> <P> The hospital agreed to build two additional operating rooms, renovate its  existing rooms and add a cardiac catheterization laboratory and a pediatric  intensive care unit.  </P> <P> The hospital also will equip all the rooms with specialized instruments and  will retrain staff members, he said.  </P> <P> Yokoyama also specified changes in the lighting, air-conditioning and humidity  levels in the cardiac surgery and intensive care units, Sauer said.  </P> <P> "Essentially, we had to work with Dr. Yokoyama to produce the heart surgery  environment he functions best in," Sauer said.  </P> <P> Yokoyama, 56, received his medical degree and a Ph.D. in physiology from  Okayama University Medical School in Japan.  </P> <P> He received further surgical training at Georgetown University Medical Center  in Washington and at County-USC Medical Center before becoming a kidney  transplantation specialist at Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia.  </P> <P> His reputation as a cardiac surgeon was achieved at St. Vincent Medical Center,  beginning in 1975.  </P> <P> In 1989, he and his team performed 750 open-heart surgeries, nearly five times  the number required of members of the American College of Surgeons.  </P> <P> The team's 3% mortality rate is considerably below the 5% statewide average,  despite the complexity of the cases the team accepts, state health statistics  show.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman at the Los Angeles chapter of the American Heart Assn. said  Yokoyama and his team are "very well-known, and very highly respected."  </P> <P> Yokoyama was in surgery and could not be reached for comment.  </P></p>

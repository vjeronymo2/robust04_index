			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / International Company News: Olivetti in talks on disposal Olivetti, the Italian computers group, is in advanced negotiations to slim down its operations in Germany with the possible sale of part of its Triumph Adler subsidiary. Details of the talks, believed to be under way since November, remain unclear. However, the group stressed that the transaction would not involve Triumph Adler's production, distribution and sales activities. Triumph Adler is best known in Germany for its typewriters and office products. Olivetti said the talks, with an unnamed German investor group, should be concluded by February. Olivetti bought Triumph Adler in 1986 from Volkswagen, which took a small stake in the Italian company as part payment. In the past two years, Triumph Adler has undergone a wide-ranging restructuring to staunch heavy losses.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Arts: The 'kiss kiss bang bang' formula - Cinema MAD DOG AND GLORY (15) John McNaughton THE ASSASSIN (18) John Badham RED ROCK WEST (15) John Dahl THE FENCING MASTER (12) Pedro Olea 'Kiss kiss bang bang' is the oldest formula in films. 'Kiss kiss' refers to the bits where two people melt together, softened by the string section and lured by the cosmic push towards Oneness. 'Bang bang' (leave aside more risque meanings) refers to the bits where two or more people enact the ultimate ritual of atomisation: split apart from each other, from the movie or from life itself. But 'Kiss kiss bang bang', however potent its potential, can never be the whole story in a film: merely an underpinning to richer things. Two of this week's American movies deploy the formula in all its schematic nakedness and are then surprised when audiences who begin by whooping with excitement end up sicklied o'er with the pale cast of deja vu. In Mad Dog And Glory, screenwriter Richard Price, tangy chronicler of life on the edge in films like Sea Of Love and The Colour Of Money, gets what he may have thought a 'Eureka' idea for a KKBB plot. Shy police photographer Robert De Niro accidentally saves the life of crime boss Bill Murray - frightening off the thief who is standing on Murray's face during a convenience store robbery - and then falls in love with the girl (Uma Thurman) whom a grateful Murray 'loans' him. Will bullets fly when the little man tells the big man that he cannot have the lady back? Since director John McNaughton's last film was the grimly provocative Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer, all bang and no kisses, we wonder how he will cope with the two-tone mandates of commercial cinema. Answer: scarcely at all. After a gruesome, Henry-ish first scene shot in black and white - a roadside drug deal sealed with two bullets in two brains - we swing into the wacky, all-colour world of Chicago crime and punishment. De Niro is a timid, gentle, creasy-faced loner who hums 'That ol' black magic' as he snapshots corpses. Murray has a mug that could crack a mirror but he loves his friends and does stand-up comedy routines for his fellow hoods. And Thurman is a little packet of fizzy sex appeal sent to De Niro as a 'seven-day singing telegram' and outstaying her time limit. These lovable goofballs never existed outside a film, nor did their slap-happy schedule of love and violence. The romance-and-action alternations might have been designed by a committee. A few minutes of rough stuff out on police patrol; then a few of De Niro and Thurman going kissy-kissy on his sofa (burbling saxophone and harp glissandoes on soundtrack); then a few more of thudding corpses or crashing fists; then some buddy-buddy cosiness between De Niro and Murray; then more mayhem; then more amore . . . Finally the film disappears up its own regimented schizophrenia: living, or half-living, proof that when the kiss-kiss-bang-bang formula is mishandled it no longer seems a pithy precis of human life, more the product of an entertainment industry handing out love and violence like a pill doctor dealing out uppers and downers. Much the same perfunctory prescriptions are on offer in The Assassin, America's remake of Nikita. Luc Besson's French original gave us Anne Parillaud as a drug addict/murderess turned glamorous government hitwoman. Spared the ultimate penalty by a state who forgave her criminal past in return for a future of hired liquidation, she dashed around Europe popping off VIPs while trying to achieve emotional normalcy with her boyfriend. The cleverest, maddest scene in Nikita had the heroine fitting up her gun in a hotel bathroom for an immediate 'hit' - she has received a phone call in mid-love scene in the bedroom - while the boyfriend bangs on the locked door suffering from a combination of curiosity and coitus interruptus. Hollywood perkily re-runs this scene, with Bridget Fonda doing her nut over the assembly-kit rifle while her frustrated Californian hippie (Dermot Mulroney) quizzes through the door. Elsewhere, The Assassin is less convincing than Nikita even on the French film's absurdist, fabulist terms. As in Mad Dog And Glory, automatism takes over the kiss-bang franchise. We begin with the explosive: robbery, murder, arrest, violent training. Then like soothing sorbets between helpings of red meat, we keep being served romantic entr'actes. There is Gabriel Byrne, the secret service smoothie whose hard exterior conceals a made-in-Hollywood heart; Mr Mulroney, our heroine's oceanside Galahad; even Anne Bancroft, who runs the Assassin Training School's charm school and teaches the young gels the finer things of life. Like how to walk, talk and court; how to remove bones from the throat during posh dinners (sic); and how to dress correctly for Mr Right. The Bancroft scenes are totally barmy. But then as directed by John (Saturday Night Fever, War Games) Badham, the whole film is barmy. As with all bad kiss-bang cinema, plausibility is pushed aside by the fallacious creed that all you need to ensnare an audience is a remorseless, nonstop Yin-ing and Yang-ing between the romantic and the kinetic. Red Rock West comes closer to getting the recipe right. Kiss-kiss is put on a back burner - or allowed to lie around defrosting - until the ingredients for bang-bang are properly heated. Job-hunting hobo Nicolas Cage, arriving in Red Rock, Wyoming, is mistaken by bar-owner JT Walsh for the hired killer he plans to set on his wife (Lara Flynn Boyle). Walsh gives him Dollars 5,000 for the job; Miss Boyle gives him Dollars 10,000 not to do the job - or to do it on Walsh; and so the merry imbroglio begins. Soon we have stalkings, ambushes, gunplay and Dennis Hopper, stark mad in a Mexican jacket as the real late-arriving hit man. And before the bang-bang climax in a studio-built graveyard, we have all we need in the way of kiss-kiss: Mr Cage and Miss Boyle exchanging some moody, noirish moments of passion in her darkened hacienda. Director John Dahl's previous feature was another attempt at stylish pulp, Kill Me Again. He and co-writer brother Rick must have had the complete works of Jim Thompson or James M Cain dropped on their heads as children. Red Rock West runs into a diminishing-returns zone before the close: too many self-conscious 'surprises', too much strenuously hardboiled dialogue. But before that, what a pleasure to see a kiss-bang thriller in which both forms of consummation are dealt out slowly, teasingly, appetisingly, rather than force-fed to us from frame one. The Fencing Master is a similar but Spanish tale: more kiss-kiss-swish-swish. A rapier maestro in 1860s Madrid (Omero Antonutti) falls in love with his beautiful, mysterious lady pupil (Assumpta Serna). Could she be a political agent, limbering up for an assassination programme as Spain breathes the first heady scents of Republicanism? Soon bodies are thudding to floors and corpses are being extracted from rivers. The fencing scenes, as well as providing sublimated love play, become teasing, inquisitorial pas de deux between the suspicious master and the suspected mistress of deception. Director Pedro Olea, adapting a novel by Arturo Perez Reverte, could have given his camera more rapier-like dash and force. With each scene we seem to bog down in a new sub-Velasquez tableau. But at least in Spain, unlike some parts of Hollywood, love and violence are seen as subtle, seditiously symbiotic forces rather than mere seesawing extremes for a variety-hungry audience.</p>

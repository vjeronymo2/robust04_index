			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Survey upgrades growth forecasts Upbeat news about the economy and improving business sentiment have resulted in a widespread upgrading of economic growth forecasts in Britain this year and next, Consensus Economics said yesterday in its poll of forecasters. The company said its monthly survey of 35 economic forecasters found an average expectation that gross domestic product would grow 3 per cent this year and 2.9 per cent next year. Last month's expectation was 2.8 per cent growth this year and 2.7 per cent in 1995, while three months ago it was 2.7 per cent for both years. In general, economists are more bullish than the Treasury, which at the end of June forecast growth of 2 3/4 per cent this year and next. Consensus Economics says that, on average, forecasters raised their expectations of consumers' expenditure, gross investment, company trading profits and manufacturing production in both years over the past month. However, the consensus points to an average rise of 2.6 per cent in retail prices this year - unchanged from July - and a slight rise to 3.7 per cent from 3.6 per cent in expected average retail price inflation next year. The economists were slightly more optimistic about the outlook for the current account and the public sector borrowing requirement. The consensus now points to a PSBR of Pounds 34.4bn in the fiscal year to the end of March 1995 against the government's Pounds 36bn forecast, and Pounds 26.2bn for 1995-96 against the Treasury's Pounds 28bn. Consensus Economics reports an upgrading of German growth forecasts. Its panel produced average forecasts of 2 per cent GDP growth this year and 2.7 per cent next year, against 1.8 per cent and 2.6 per cent previously.

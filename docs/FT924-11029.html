			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Dirty tricks claim backfires on Perot THERE were signs yesterday that Mr Ross Perot's unsubstantiated charges of dirty tricks against President George Bush's presidential campaign were beginning to hurt the independent candidate in the eyes of the US electorate, writes Jurek Martin in Washington. The two latest public opinion polls, by ABC News and CNN/USA Today, restored a double digit lead, 11 points in both cases, to Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate. Both had Mr Perot at less than 20 per cent, while the head of Gallup said in an interview his surveys found that support for the independent candidate had peaked and that his 'favourable' ratings had stopped going up. Mr Bush yesterday described Mr Perot's charges that there was a Republican plot to disrupt his daughter's wedding as 'crazy'. He thought Mr Perot's self-financed campaign was, historically, 'most unusual' and, generally, 'a little bizarre'. Throughout his swing through North Carolina on Monday, Mr Clinton confined himself to disparaging both his opponents for apparently investigating each other's children. Media reports and commentaries have turned savagely critical of Mr Perot who, in turn, has been critical of the media. Both the New York Times and the Washington Post, in editorials, found it incredible he should now invent another reason for leaving the race in July. The Times referred to 'traits that bear directly on his fitness for office,' while the Post wondered about his 'startling belief in secret manoeuvrings against him by malign forces worldwide'. If Mr Perot's popularity starts falling, the logical beneficiary is Mr Clinton, who has been hurt most by his rise. Amid the latest polling volatility, Mr Bush's support has remained flat, in the low 30s, while Mr Clinton's has dropped from the upper to the lower 40s. In his TV interview yesterday, Mr Bush expressed confidence he would win next Tuesday because he felt he had earned the trust of the country, which Mr Clinton had not. Asked if he liked Mr Clinton, he smiled and said: 'Yeah, and I think he likes me.' On the stump in New Mexico the president sought to lift the level of the campaign in a speech about the economic and philosophical differences between him and Mr Clinton. He described himself as a 'conservative activist' and laid claim to some of the populist traits of both his opponents.</p>

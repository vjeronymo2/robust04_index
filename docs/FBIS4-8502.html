			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Slovak newspapers have recently carried  several items dealing with the possibility of another group of  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) deputies leaving the  formerly ruling movement, thereby securing for the current  government coalition 90 votes needed to pass constitutional laws.    Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 9 April on pages 1 and 3  carries a 1,100-word interview with Vladimir Bajan, former  deputy chairman of the HZDS Club of Deputies in the Slovak  Parliament and now a leader of Prime Minister Moravcik's  "Alternative of Political Realism," by Martin Krno entitled  "Blow Below the Belt." In the interview, the place and date of  which are not given, Bajan denounces the "StB [communist-era  secret service] methods" practiced in the HZDS Club of Deputies  and indicates that another nine deputies are to defect from the  HZDS parliamentary group.    In the PRAVDA interview, Bajan reacts to the "publication in  the press" of "sworn statements" signed by HZDS deputies at a  meeting of the HZDS leadership at Horne Plachtince in November  1993, in which they pledged that they would relinquish their  mandates as deputies if they ever leave the HZDS. Bajan  confirms that he signed such a statement "under threats" last  November but denies that he had violated it by retaining his  seat in parliament: "I kept it [the sworn statement] because I  did not leave the HZDS. I was expelled from it." Speaking about  the circumstances of the Horne Plachtince pledge, Bajan says:  "All day long we were clarifying the position of confidence,  and, in the evening, they presented a statement they had brought  finished from Bratislava in the morning. We considered this a  blow below the belt. First, 21 persons, including Ivan  Gasparovic, chairman of the parliament, refused to sign. We  considered this quite normal. Gasparovic is a lawyer and knew  that this is outrageous. Then Meciar said he would resign along  with the whole government. He said he would call upon his people  to take to the streets and oppose the deputies." After the  "prime minister's threats," Bajan continues, Gasparovic asked  the deputies "not to be foolish because the declaration has no  legal validity, and if it calms the situation in the HZDS, it is  necessary to sign it." According to Bajan, the statements were  then entrusted to Gasparovic in a sealed envelope. Because they  have now appeared in the press, Bajan says, "I would like to ask  Gasparovic whether someone has broken into his office." Bajan  views the publication of the statements, which include the home  addresses and phone numbers of the signatories, as "illegal" and  a "dangerous precedent" and announces that he will ask the  General Prosecutor's Office to investigate the leak: "All day  long scores of people are calling, threatening the deputies'  wives and children. If the HZDS wanted to achieve this through  these StB methods, it really succeeded," Bajan says.    In one part of the interview, Bajan confirms that HZDS ranks  might be left by social democratically oriented deputies. The  passage reads: "[Krno] We have learned from various sources  that eight more deputies might leave the HZDS Club of Deputies  and establish a Social Democratic Club and that one deputy is  planning to reinforce Cernak's National Democratic Club of  Deputies. Can you confirm these rumors?    "[Bajan] It is difficult to accurately estimate their  number. But I do not rule out that your figures might be close  to the reality. The Social Democratic current has so far  remained in the HZDS parliamentary club. It is only a question  of time when these deputies will publicly confirm their  disagreement with the policy of the present leadership of the  movement. This is connected with the crystallization of the  political scene.... Our former HZDS colleagues have one last  chance to join parties with a future."    Bratislava SME in Slovak on 9 April on page 2 carries a  100-word interview with Ivan Laluha, a parliamentary deputy for  the HZDS who is considered to be the leader of the "Social  Democratic" current, about the possibility of more defections  from the HZDS parliamentary group. The interview, the place and  date of which are not given, reads: "[SME] Before the HZDS  Assembly in Presov [held on 26-27 March], it was expected that  you would establish there a Social Democratic Platform within  the HZDS or that you would leave the movement. Why did these  expectations from behind the scenes not come true, all the more  because it was rumored that you would contest the elections  jointly with the Social Democratic Party in Slovakia? How  likely is your departure from the HZDS?    "[Laluha] If you allow me, I will make a statement on this  at a later date."    Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 12 April on pages 1 and 3  carries an 800-word interview with Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of  the parliament, by Martin Krno entitled "No One Has Broken Into  My Office." In the interview, which was conducted on 11 April,  Gasparovic responds to the interview with Vladimir Bajan in  Bratislava PRAVDA on 9 April. He describes how the "sworn  statement" of November 1993 came about, stressing that "it is  binding morally rather than legally." He also explains the  circumstances under which the signed statements became public:  "After several deputies left our Club of Deputies and formed the  Alternative of Political Realism, Mr. Cabaj, chairman of the  HZDS Club of Deputies, came to see me. I handed him the  envelope at his request. I did so because it was property of  the HZDS and did not concern the National Council. Therefore,  no one has broken into my office and, I hope, never will."  Asked about the expected departures from the HZDS Club of  Deputies, Gasparovic says: "There exist certain indications of  that. But even if some more deputies leave, this need not be  considered a tragedy. We have clearly stated that only those  should remain in our club who trust the HZDS program and want to  implement it to the last degree. It would make no sense for  people to remain among us who disagree with this program."</p>

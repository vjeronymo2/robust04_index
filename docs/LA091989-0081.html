			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KINGS LOSE TO PENGUINS BEFORE 17,385  </P> <P> It was just an exhibition game between the Kings and the Pittsburgh Penguins,  but it was still a matchup of Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux and it drew  17,385 to the Richfield Coliseum Monday night.  </P> <P> Lemieux recorded an assist on every goal as the Penguins beat the Kings, 3-1.  It was the Kings' first defeat in the exhibition season.  </P> <P> Gretzky had the assist on the Kings' only goal, passing the puck back to Steve  Duchesne, who was trailing on a breakaway. Duchesne's goal at 4:39 of the first  period beat Tom Barrasso and gave the Kings a brief lead.  </P> <P> Rookie goalie Robb Stauber, who decided in June to skip his senior year at the  University of Minnesota to sign with the Kings, played the entire game Monday  night. He made some impressive saves and had little chance at any of the shots  that beat him -- Bob Errey's rebound of a Lemieux shot in the first period, Dan  Quinn's tip of a centering pass by Lemieux on the power play in the second  period, and Jimmy Johnson's shot after a Lemieux pass as Johnson stood at point  blank-range.  </P> <P> </P> <P> King Notes  </P> <P> The Kings will take a 1-1-1 record into their game against the Quebec Nordiques  Wednesday night in Denver. The game will be televised live at 6 p.m. on Prime  Ticket. . . . Tickets for the Kings' regular-season games went on sale at 10  a.m. at the Forum, and by noon all the tickets that had been made available had  been sold out for all four games of the opening home stand, both games against  Montreal, all games against Calgary and the game against Philadelphia. . . .  Dave Taylor, still having problems with a cervical strain, has returned to Los  Angeles for treatment.  </P></p>

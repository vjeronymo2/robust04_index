			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: French closure costs put Darby Pounds 2.8m in the red DARBY GROUP, the specialist glass maker currently traded on the London Stock Exchange Alternative Trading Service, has moved into a loss of Pounds 2.76m in the year ended February 28 1993 as the cost of closing the French operations hit hard. The loss compared with a profit of Pounds 285,000. No dividend is being paid (2p total last time). Losses per share were 16.68p (earnings 2.51p). Turnover fell to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 17.9m), including a Pounds 3.97m contribution from discontinued operations. Closure of Darby France accounted for Pounds 2.43m of pre-tax losses. Mr Michael Darby, chairman and chief executive, said the recession in continental Europe became increasingly severe during last year with the French market being particularly adversely affected.' He said selling prices and margins were squeezed and the group saw no improvement in industrial relations. A further Pounds 177,000 was charged to profits to cover the costs of failing to establish a US market after a concerted effort since 1989. The group will continue exporting. Mr Darby said continuing activities, now UK trading operations, would concentrate on manufacturing high value speciality products. The second half was little different to the first, with very similar levels of profitability. That was encouraging, he said, since it was the first six month period for several years where there had not been a deterioration in UK business.</p>

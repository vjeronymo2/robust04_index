			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Antonello Caporale report: "Segni Ready To Accept Bossi's </F> Embrace"]    [Text] Rome -- Perhaps the roses will bloom once more and  the marriage will take place properly. [Pact for Italy leader]  Mariotto Segni and [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi  will meet and will probably say "I do." The path has been set  out, and fate has determined this final test. As long as it  means that he can block the way to the left-wing forces, as long  as it means that he can defeat "statism" and -- why not? --  "centralism," Segni is about to accept Bossi's embrace, to sign  the pact.    The pact was announced the very day of the television  appearance by the leader of the moderate front opposite  [Democratic Party of the Left, PDS, Secretary] Achille Occhetto,  the leader of the alignment to be defeated. There will be an  electoral agreement with the League, Segni told his men at his  headquarters on Largo del Nazareno: In order to ensure victory  we need to win over the North. Without the League, it will be a  futile struggle. So.... But his trials cannot be said to be  over: He still has to persuade [Christian Democratic Party, DC,  Secretary] Martinazzoli to sign the armistice and, above all, to  convince Berlusconi that his television venture is better, much  better, than his electoral one. Rooting for Italy is fine -- but  without Silvio Berlusconi.    On the last day of the First Republic Mario Segni explained  to Carlo Azeglio Ciampi what he wants to achieve, and with whom.  A liberal-democratic alignment in which there is a place for  the League, too. Speaking in the Lower House, he said: "There  seem to be two opposing lines within the League. One advocates  adhering to the old destructive proposal, while the other  advocates focusing on the struggle against statism. Whoever is  concerned about Italy's future hopes that the latter line will  prevail. It is up to the League to choose clearly and  definitely whether to remain entrenched in the destructive  position or to contribute constructively to Italy's progress."    There is no need to ask; the decision has been made. Indeed,  the time is almost up for the League. The tough-guy approach  has failed, and what is needed now is "reason" and "balance."  Bossi said: "If Segni has something to tell us, he knows where  to find us; if the potential is there, it will show itself and  we will see it in the coming days. We are certainly not  yielding the initiative to him: We have been making openings  since before the end of the year. There has been no response.  Of course, we command the votes in the North...." In any case,  according to Bossi, the League is the "cornerstone of a  liberal-democratic alignment. Segni has no votes. More than  anything, he is a point of neutralization, the center of the  compass, a potentially useful image." He paused for breath,  then continued: "There is still time for an agreement; there  will be time until the day before the lists are presented.  Segni only has to call my secretary's office." That was a  small lie. Segni has already called him. Bossi admitted:  "Within a matter of hours, some of my closest aides will be  meeting with Segni or his trusted representatives. What is  certain is that we have already made an official commitment to  meet."    Additional proof that this is precisely the case, that is,  that the time is ripe, is provided by remarks made by  representatives of the Pact. The Republican, Guglielmo  Castagnetti, explained: "We consider relations with the League  crucial, because we believe that all the liberal-democratic  forces must unite."    The enemy can only be defeated through unity: "If the  moderates stand divided into two or three lists, clearly a  defeat becomes inevitable." In any case, according to [Pact  member] Alberto Michelini, "on programs, there is an almost  perfect identity of views between us and the League.  Furthermore, once the conditions of Italy's unity, solidarity,  and the strengthening of local government have been accepted,  there are no more problems."    Yesterday evening Mario Segni was a guest on Telemontecarlo.  Corrado Augias set him against Achille Occhetto. Segni's attack  on the progressive leader focused on his favorite topic -- state  control. He cited figures, names, amendments, and parliamentary  documents. Segni was very well prepared. Augias stopped him  and asked: Will you be the leader of a government thanks to  votes won by the League? "There must be a political agreement;  I would rather lose the elections and remain consistent." Only  with the MSI [Italian Social Movement] is there no chance. "We  have no dealings with the MSI." The ball was back in Occhetto's  court, and this time the issue was Communist Renaissance. What  did he have to say about it? "Our only preconditions have to do  with matters of policy, not ideology. It is not to be assumed  that the government accord that we put forward will embrace all  the forces with which we have an electoral agreement."    The duel continued. What about Berlusconi? "He is the enemy  of the genuine liberal-democratic forces," Occhetto said  provocatively. Segni renewed his advice to Berlusconi -- It is  better for him not to allow himself to be dragged into electoral  contests: "I still hope that he will not enter the arena."  His lavish praise for [former IL GIORNALE editor] Montanelli  -- "an example of courage and extraordinary consistency" --  revealed his continuing coolness toward Berlusconi.</p>

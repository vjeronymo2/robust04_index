The two were Yi Chang-sik and Pak Chang-kwang.    The prosecution charged that the two, acting on instructions  from their company president, tried to bribe Rep. Kim Mal-yong  of the Democratic Party with money. However, they falsely  testified at an Assembly Labor Committee session on last Jan.  27 that they did not seek to hand an envelop containing money  to Rep. Kim, the prosecution said.    Meanwhile, the Seoul area Labor Administration Office  announced Tuesday it had decided to take legal actions against  Pak Chang-kwang and 13 other officials and employees of Korea  Automobile Fire and Marine Insurance Co. on charges of engaging  in undue labor activities.    An investigation based on a complaint filed by the labor  union of the insurance firm indicated that the 14 people had  tried to control and interfere in labor activities of the firm's  union, the labor office said.    By law a person found guilty of undue labor activities is to  be sentenced to a prison term not exceeding one year or to a  fine of 15 million won.</p>

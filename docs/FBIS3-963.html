			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Joe Mwinga in Lusaka on the "Focus </F> on Africa" program]    [Excerpt] The UNITA [National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola] delegation at the Lusaka peace talks  returned today apparently more willing to compromise. UNITA  spokesman Jorge Valentim told reporters that the rebel movement  no longer considered power sharing central to the issue of the  talks. He said that UNITA did not want to gamble everything  away by insisting on a few ministerial positions which the  government were not prepared to give. The most important issue,  he said, from UNITA's point of view, were guarantees that the  opposition would be able to participate freely in the country's  politics. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Source of change for mergers: The approval of Nestle's bid for Perrier has implications for EC competition laws Both Nestle and Brussels can claim victory from the European Commission's approval yesterday of the Swiss food company's FFr15.46bn (Pounds 1.58bn) acquisition of Perrier, France's biggest mineral water group. But while Nestle has cleared an immediate obstacle to one particular deal, Brussels stands to gain an important extension of its merger control powers, which will have a broad and enduring impact on Europe's industrial landscape. Although the decision obliges Nestle to sell some of Perrier's businesses, it can keep those it most wants. As well as Perrier's well-known sparkling water, they include big brands such as Contrexeville and the French group's extensive mineral-water interests in the US, which are at least as valuable. Equally important, Nestle's politically sensitive relationship with BSN, France's largest food group, remains intact. Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's chairman, played a pivotal role in helping Nestle defeat a rival bid for Perrier by the Italian Agnelli family earlier this year. In return, Mr Helmut Maucher, Nestle's chairman, agreed to sell Volvic, Perrier's second-largest brand, to BSN. However, that agreement threatened to scupper the deal, which was challenged by Brussels on the grounds that it would give Nestle and BSN a duopoly of the French mineral-water market. Had the Commission's merger watchdogs insisted that Nestle cancel the Volvic sale, that could have jeopardised the economics of the takeover and unleashed a political fracas in France. Indeed, Brussels may be accused of yielding to political expediency by letting Nestle and BSN off lightly, so as not to rock the boat ahead of France's referendum on the Maastricht treaty in September. Even after the planned disposals, the two companies will together control more than two-thirds of current French mineral water production. However, for the Commission, the case sets an important long-term precedent. For the first time, Brussels has explicitly made clear its intention to challenge mergers on the grounds that they would create not just a simple monopoly or dominant position, but an oligopoly, in which several producers jointly dominate a market. Competition policy experts agree that this is a landmark development, which should in theory enable Brussels to apply the two-year-old EC merger regulation to large cross-border deals in any industry where the number of competitors is limited. Furthermore, such mergers may be challenged if they threaten competition in only one country, not the whole EC market. Some companies believe the result will be heightened regulatory uncertainty, and at worst severe restrictions on their future expansion. 'I think there will be some very major implications for industries like oil,' says Mr Stephen Walzer, British Petroleum's manager of international legal affairs. 'It effectively means that continued expansion by acquisition is out.' Mr Derek Ridyard of Nera, an economic consultancy, says the impact will be felt in any business where high capital costs limit competitive entry. It is also likely to affect airas food, where many product categories are dominated by three or four big brands. Many experts question the legal basis of the Commission's new approach, pointing out that the EC merger regulation nowhere refers to joint dominance or oligopoly. 'This is another example of Brussels pushing the boundaries further than anyone had anticipated from reading the text,' says Mr David Hall, a partner in Linklaters &amp; Paines, a leading British law firm. Nestle has angrily accused the Commission of changing the rules in the middle of the game. Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, insists the approach is consistent with the merger regulation, and that he is simply bringing EC policy into line with the practice in countries such as Britain, France, Germany and the US. In all these countries, he says, regulators can challenge oligopolies, although only in Germany does legislation explicitly give them the right to do so. While this view is widely shared by Sir Leon's colleagues, some are concerned by his insistence that Brussels approve the buyer of the Perrier brands which Nestle must sell. In their eyes, this smacks of excessive interventionism. What is clear from the growing debate, both within and outside the Commission, is that EC merger policy is advancing into uncharted territory, where the guidelines may be defined largely by the success of Brussels' efforts to test the limits of its powers. That prospect disturbs competition lawyers. However, many are torn over how loudly to protest. In practice, they admit that the special Commission task force responsible for enforcing the merger regulation has so far behaved with exemplary fairness and pragmatism. 'You may not always get the results you want, but the system is quick, it's usually definitive and you can talk to the people involved,' says one lawyer, who contrasts the task force's attitude favourably with the rigid and doctrinaire approach of EC officials dealing with other aspects of competition policy. Indeed, since the regulation took effect, the Commission has so far investigated in depth only eight of the roughly 100 deals notified to it - and blocked only one. This was the takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft manufacturer, by Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. However, much depends on the attitudes of the individuals in charge of policy. Sir Leon's current term as competition commissioner expires at the end of this year, and Mr Colin Overbury is due to retire as head of the merger task force in the next 12 months. There is no guarantee that their successors will follow the same line. Many experts believe these uncertainties increase the need for an objective review of EC merger policy, to make it more transparent, predictable and accountable. Under the EC system, that responsibility lies with the European Court of Justice. However, the Court's past decisions offer only sketchy guidance on the oligopoly question, and it has yet to rule on the Commission's interpretation of the merger regulation. That is because the Court can only act on specific cases presented to it, and none of the mergers Brussels has vetted so far has given rise to such a challenge. Because Court proceedings are lengthy and expensive, the Commission's powers may not be clarified until a frustrated acquirer decides formally to contest them. For the growing number of companies and lawyers who are worried that EC merger policy is in danger of becoming an unguided weapon, that day cannot come too soon.</p>

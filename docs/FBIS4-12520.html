			<p>BFN     [Text] Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has strongly  criticized Israeli maneuvers in the peace talks and its  disregard for the timetables which had been agreed in accordance  with the declaration of principles signed between the two sides  on 13 September last.    He warned of the dangerous results which could ensue from  these maneuvers.    The Palestinian president expressed this stance when he  received in Tunis the delegation of the enquiry commission  representing journalists accredited to the United Nations from  various countries, which is touring the Middle East.</p>

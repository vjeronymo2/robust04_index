			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandra Tevzadze, member of the Deported </F> Meskhetians Subcommission of the Parliamentary Commission for  the Protection of Human Rights and National Minorities Affairs:  "We Must Break Down the Barrier of Distrust"]    [Text] Our society is well aware that on 15 November 1944  the Mohammedan population of Meskhetia-Dzhavaketia--chiefly  children, women, and old people (the men were fighting in the  war...)--were all deported to Central Asia.    The pretext for the deportation was that they were  "unreliable" in districts bordering on Turkey.    Most of the deportees were Moslemized-Turkefied Georgians,  as  is confirmed by plenty of historical documents, and I will not  dwell on this matter here.    Much has been written and said about the historical  processes  that resulted in that demographic pattern in  Meskhetia-Dzhavakhetia. Let me recapitulate: first,  incorporation by the Ottoman Empire, followed by Tsarist  Russia's long-range anti-Georgian actions, and finally the  Soviet system's monstrous nationality policy, cut a substantial  portion of the Georgian people off from their native culture,  deprived them of their language, destroyed their national  consciousness, and finally made them victims to Stalinist  repression--the Mohammedan Meskhetians were uprooted from their  native soil, and the final thread linking them to their  motherland was broken. There in Central Asia, in a Moslem  environment, they became further denationalized.    Today, they find it difficult to give a definite answer to  the question, "Who are you?" They shrug their shoulders, look at  each other, start to speak, argue, and finally... they look at  us as if to say, You hold the key to that mystery, you know more.    After the deportation, two groups of political leaders  arose,  with opposing orientations--pro-Georgian and pro-Turkish.    The pro-Turkish leaders emphasize the deportee's present  situation--Moslem religion, Turkish language, and Azberbaijani  surnames and nationality listed in their documents. These  leaders engage in falsifying history and they instill among  their own people and broad segments of society the notion that  Meskhetia was historically inhabited by Turkish tribes, and that  they themselves are descendants of these tribes.    The pro-Georgian leaders (L. Baratashvili, Kh. Gozalishvili,  and I. Varsknelidze), drawing upon historical documents, tried  to restore and reenforce Georgian national consciousness among  the people. They always cooperated with Georgia's leading  intellectuals and also, though not always successfully, tried to  establish contact with the Georgian government.    Everyone wants to return to his homeland, regardless of  national orientation. This problem became especially acute after  the Fergana tragedy. Let me also add that of all the peoples of  the former Soviet Union who were deported in 1944, only the  Mohammedan Meskhetians have failed to gain real rehabilitation;  they are the only ones who have not been repatriated.    The hysteria that broke out in 1989-91 regarding this  unfortunate people did so much to poison our society's  consciousness that its effects are still felt. This  long-suffering people should be returned to their homeland, but  our country's vital interests demand that the Meskhetians be  brought back with a Georgian national consciousness.    What is being done in Georgia to accomplish this task?    The deportee issue is being dealt with by both legislative  agencies (the Commission for the Protection of Human Rights and  National Minorities Affairs) and executive bodies (the Committee  for the Protection of Human Rights and Interethnic Relations,  the Refugees and Settlement Committee). In addition, a  governmental commission to settle the deportee problem has been  set up--though only formally so far.    Despite all these protectors, things are not getting  anywhere. The Parliamentary Commission has drafted several bills  on deportee rehabilitation, but it is unlikely, unfortunately,  that Parliament will pass them. Instead of a bill, a totally  "bland" draft decree has been placed on the agenda of  Parliament's plenary session, having to do with granting  citizenship to repatriates. Meanwhile, our bill has been waiting  in vain for Parliament's attention. Children of the deportees  have been in Tbilisi for almost a year now, living in a  dormitory in the Gldani district. There are about 80 boys. They  are studying Georgian language and history in the Sulkhan-Saba  Orbeliani Pedagogical Institute. Twelve young men are trainees  in the Military Academy. They are also studying Georgian. What  shall we do with these boys, who keep asking us the same  question every day: When are we to get our Georgian surnames and  nationality back? That's the question we have been asking  Parliament, and we are eagerly awaiting their answer. Things  were not helped by the Head of State's Order No. 106, issued 18  May 1993, concerning the problems of deportees. The basic part  of the Order remains unimplemented to this day.    Just as a man cannot hide from himself, no people can escape  its history. The Meskhetians' historical misfortunes are a part  of our own common historical fate. The mistakes which were  committed in the recent or distant past and which brought the  Mohammedan population of Meskhetia-Dzhavakhetia to such a tragic  plight, are something we have to rectify. It is a sad reality of  Georgia's history that being cut off for so long from their  native culture has brought it about that the Mohammedan  Meskhetians do not know their identity, and today, left without  a homeland, they have come to our door and are meekly waiting  (bless their patience!) for us to let them come home.    I'll go further: even those deportees who, under the  influence of the pro-Turkish orientation, consider themselves  Turks, deserve our care and protection. Especially considering  experience we have had in which, given the necessary explanation  work and sincere treatment, these people have turned back to  Georgianness. The fact that only a few of the Mohammedan  Meskhetians who were repatriated in the 1970s and 1980s still  remain in Georgia, while the rest were expelled again, must be  on our conscience alone. I take full responsibility in saying  this, because I was a direct participant in that deplorable  process.    Clear proof of the fact that we are not taking care of those  that do remain can be seen in the predicament of the Mohammedan  Meskhetians living in the town of Kopitnari, Samtredskiy Rayon.  Consider two aspects: schooling, and the restoration of surnames  and nationality. The younger school children have to walk a long  way, which is dangerous given today's crime situation, because  the Mohammedan population is the most vulnerable (last October,  the fighting there cost the lives of two children). There is a  building in the town in which elementary classes were being  taught a few years ago. For two years now the people have been  asking for the classes to be resumed. They are asking for  schooling, to be taught in Georgian, and we aren't doing a  thing. The same is true of the reinstatement of surnames and  nationality. Their applications still lie untouched in the Rayon  Civil Registry Office. A Meskhetian girl named Amina, who died  in the tragic events of October, had taken part in a television  program in connection with the start of the school year in  Georgia on 20 September, just a few days before she died. A  reporter asked her what she wanted the most. Her answer--in  beautiful Georgian--: "To go to school and grow up to be a good  Georgian for my country."    The Georgian people and those who were cut off from them  must  break down the barrier of distrust which was erected several  years ago by the anti-Meskhetian campaign fomented by  destructive forces.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC says US aircraft tax rules unfair THE European Commission is expected to accuse the US next week of breaching international civil aircraft trade rules by letting US manufacturers use a controversial financing vehicle to avoid paying tax on aircraft sales. The EC is threatening to take the issue before a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade disputes panel. After a series of renewed US attacks against government support for Airbus, the EC is mounting a vigorous counter- attack on what it claims is increasing administration support for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. The EC is especially concerned by the use of a US tax financing vehicle called the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. More than Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) worth of aircraft are estimated to have been financed through this technique in the US. Airbus says such tax benefits are not available to the European manufacturer, and are an unfair export subsidy for the two US companies. 'We will certainly press this issue during trade talks with the US in Brussels next week,' said Mr Michel Dechelotte, Airbus director of international affairs. He also said Airbus, with 95 order cancellations last year and a further 20 last week, had been worse hit by the recession than Boeing. Airbus partners have traditionally relied more heavily on direct support, while US manufacturers have benefited from what the EC claims has been significant indirect government support. Mr Dechelotte said Airbus was worried the US intended to increase these indirect supports to help its industry during the recession.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> A RESPECTFUL, NO-FRILLS 'RICHARD III' AT ACTORS ALLEY  </P> <P> Arguably, the most poisonous and outrageous seduction scenes in English  literature are Richard III's reptilian triumphs over Lady Anne and Queen  Elizabeth. At the Actors Alley Repertory Theatre, actor Walter Raymond's  hunchbacked "jolly, thriving wooer" propels "Richard III" onto the track of  single-minded energy the play demands.  </P> <P> Raymond's lithe serpent of a Richard insidiously worms his honeyed tongue past  the defenses of Anne and Elizabeth, whose loved ones he has murdered to better  proffer his own love. These scenes, which bookend icy, bloody intrigues, are  the production's linchpins, as directed by Jordan Charney in his swan song  after five years as artistic director of the company.  </P> <P> Charney has not cut a line of the play. Though the running time is three hours  with two intermissions, events rush headlong. Line readings are clear and  unpretentious. Nobody in the cast of 22 poses or pauses for a declamation.  </P> <P> Forget spectacle. For a company that had never staged Shakespeare before, the  result is respectful and accessible, the unadorned, budget-conscious set and  costumes notwithstanding.  </P> <P> Often productions of "Richard III," for brevity's sake, eliminate a royal lady  altogether or rob one of them (frequently Queen Margaret) of a harangue. Not  here. The role of the women, a tight, wailing chorus, is restored to its  prominence. A contemporary abused wife syndrome even jumps into focus, giving  balance to the plot's noise and bustle.  </P> <P> Raymond's jaunty villain catches Richard's wit, not to mention his crooked  body, which Raymond negotiates with deft economy. But Raymond's nasty, ruthless  wooing could not work without the flashing repartee and convincing, measured  retreats of Joann DiSano's Anne and Leslie Paxton's Elizabeth.  </P> <P> This foul king knows psychology and here it's sex that Shakespeare's "toad"  pushes to the limit. Among the other women, Bobbi Holtzman's joyless,  embittered dowager Margaret and Joan Benedict's defiant Duchess of York  (Richard's mother) enliven a nest of squawking talons.  </P> <P> In the men's world, Steven Kavner's Buckingham is sturdy and powerfully  intoned, and Brian Paul Fornes' Henry VII-to-be is the image of noble heroism.  </P> <P> As a surprise, Charney directs a new ending that is not as jarring as it  sounds: In an unspoken suicidal act, Richard III plunges Henry's sword into his  own chest. The moment is designed to complete the unrepentant Richard's final  haunting of his dream of ghosts the night before battle ("Despair, and die!").  We can live with that.  </P> <P>  Performances at 4334 Van Nuys Blvd., Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.;  Sunday, March 5, 2 p.m., until March 18. Tickets: $10-$13. (818) 986-2278.

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Legal Briefs: Linklaters &amp; Paines top Eurobond advisers' league AN ANNUAL league table of law firms that advise on Eurobond issues has placed City solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines top for the fourth year running. The solicitors were involved as advisers to the lead managers of 341 issues in 1992, well clear of nearest rival Allen &amp; Overy, which came second for its part in 199 issues. Slaughter and May ranked third for its involvement in 77 issues. According to the International Financial Law Review, which publishes the table, there was a marked increase in the total value of Eurobond transactions during 1992 as investors sought safer havens for their money. Instability in the world equity markets, chaos in European currency exchange rates and uncertainty over interest rate levels all played their part as transaction values reached Dollars 287bn (Pounds 190bn) compared with Dollars 255bn in 1991. The full league table places the UK's Clifford Chance fourth with 59 issues; the French firm Giroux Buhagiar &amp; Associes fifth with 31; the US firm Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton sixth with 28; the UK's Freshfields seventh with 22 issues; the Dutch firm De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek eighth with 17; and Canada's Stikeman Elliott, America's Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and France's Simeon et Associes equal ninth with 16 issues.</p>

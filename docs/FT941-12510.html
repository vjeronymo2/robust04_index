			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Mutual funds the key to Toronto prospects - Nervousness among the bulls How long can this go on? That is the question most often raised these days about the heady performance of the Toronto stock exchange. The TSE-300 index has broken new records on 10 of the 19 trading days since New Year. Having risen by 29 per cent in 1993, it has gained another 171 points, or 3.9 per cent, to 4,492.21 so far this month. The action in recent weeks has centred on some of the economy's late bloomers, such as resource companies, media groups and real estate developers. Forestry shares have been boosted by evidence that the long slide in pulp and paper prices may be over. Abitibi-Price, the newsprint producer, has bounced up from CDollars 13.25 at the end of October to CDollars 16.25. The TSE's real-estate sub-index has climbed by almost 7 per cent in the past four weeks, thanks to a continuing slide in interest rates and early signs of renewed demand for space in office blocks and shopping malls. Bank shares have been another favourite, bolstered by the prospect of declining loan losses and rising credit demand. Bank of Nova Scotia, investors' current darling, has jumped from CDollars 29 to CDollars 32 in the past three months. Many analysts remain bullish. ScotiaMcLeod recently advised clients to expand the equity component of their portfolios from 45 per cent to 50 per cent on the strength of an expected further surge in the TSE-300 to 4,800 by mid-year. Much of the optimism stems from the seasonal flood of savings into tax-sheltered portfolios prior to the Feb 28 contributions deadline. Beyond that, there is the prospect of a further fall in long-term bond yields coupled with rising earnings and dividends. But signs of nervousness are also not hard to find. Institutional investors acknowledge that they have growing difficulty identifying undervalued outlets for the cash which is pouring into their coffers. ScotiaMcLeod cautions that a correction in the TSE-300 to around 4,500 is possible by the end of the year. Some Canadian equity mutual funds have begun to raise the cash component of their portfolios. They are motivated partly by the paucity of attractive investments, but also by concern that a market setback may lead to a rash of redemptions. The behaviour of mutual fund managers and investors could be crucial in determining both the timing and the extent of a correction. As in the US, mutual funds have become the new musclemen in Canada's financial markets. Total assets of the funds that do business in Canada, roughly 600, have soared from CDollars 67bn at the end of 1992 to CDollars 110bn last month. Mutual funds have been prime movers in the growth of TSE volume from an average of 13,900 transactions a day in 1992 to 23,700 last year. The funds have also been among the most eager investors in the flood of new equity issues. According to the Investment Dealers Association, the value of common equity issues on Canadian securities markets soared from CDollars 10.9bn to CDollars 20.8bn in 1993. 'The system is relatively awash with liquidity,' says Mr Michael Shannon, a portfolio manager at Pembroke Management, a Montreal-based investment adviser. 'It's only in initial public offerings and new issues that an institution can get the kind of stock it requires.' In many cases, a single institution has bought a stake of 10 per cent or more in a newly-listed company. In their drive to outperform the market, managers of equity funds have increasingly been drawn to small and medium-sized companies which have been in the vanguard of the flood of initial public offerings (IPOs). The 89 IPOs on the TSE last year ranged from a host of resource and high-technology companies to A Buck or Two Stores, a retail chain selling products with a price tag of no more than CDollars 5. Until now, newly-listed companies have been among the market's stellar performers. The risk, however, is that these shares could be as volatile coming down as they were going up. The extent of the sell-off could depend heavily on whether retail investors rush to redeem mutual fund units during the course of a sharp market correction. Mr Selwyn Kossuth, president of the Investment Funds Institute of Canada, the industry's trade association, notes that net inflows continued in the immediate aftermath of the October 1987 crash. As Mr Shannon points out, 'every dip in the market has been an opportunity to buy as opposed to a warning signal to get out.' Nevertheless, mutual fund redemptions did pick up sharply in 1988 and 1989. The outflow from real-estate funds was so heavy in the early 1990s that several fund managers either slapped a ban on further redemptions or converted their funds into listed real-estate investment trusts. Regulators and the industry itself have sought to bolster investor confidence with quarterly reporting of mutual fund portfolios, and limits on holdings of obviously illiquid securities. Several mutual fund distributors have raised their minimum investment in the hope of attracting long-term investors who will not panic at the first sign of trouble. None of these precautions offers a watertight assurance, however, that investors and fund managers will remain calm in stormy waters.</p>

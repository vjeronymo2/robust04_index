			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Inflation fears increase as US industry spurts US manufacturing activity accelerated again in October, according to a survey of industry purchasing managers, arousing new fears in the financial markets that inflation might be building up steam. The National Association of Purchasing Managers said its monthly index rose to 59.7 per cent in October from 58.2 per cent in September, signalling a pick-up in business activity after a slowdown in the third quarter. Mr Ralph Kauffman, chairman of the NAPM's survey committee, said if the index stayed at its October level it might indicate a growth rate for the overall economy of around 5.4 per cent, far in excess of the 3.4 per cent annual rate reported last week for the third quarter. Bond and stock markets both fell in response to the survey yesterday, as analysts suggested the evidence of renewed strength in the manufacturing sector might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its November 15 meeting by more than the half percentage point already widely anticipated. The yields on the 30-year US Treasury bond pushed back above 8.0 per cent again, and by noon the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 31.63 to 3,876.49. With the gap between the Federal funds rate and the yield on two-year Treasury notes now more than 2 full percentage points, the markets appear to have built in a Fed increase of at least  3/4 percentage point. Adding to the financial markets' concerns were signs within the NAPM that manufacturers might be feeling increasing pressure to raise their prices. The association's index of prices paid for materials rose to 79.9 in October, its highest level in six years, from 77.1 in September, with more than 70 per cent of the purchasing executives surveyed saying they had paid higher prices for their raw materials. Mr Kauffman said competitive pressures were still preventing many manufacturers from passing on price increases to their customers. Executives said one of their most pressing concerns was that suppliers' deliveries were becoming much slower. Commodities in particularly short supply included paper and cardboard boxes, chemicals such as ethylene, ethylene glycol and glycerine, steel, aluminium and dynamic random access memory chips. US September construction spending rose 1.6 per cent, the largest rise since a 2.1 per cent in March, Reuter reports from Washington. Wall Street economists had forecast September construction spending would rise 0.2 per cent.</p>

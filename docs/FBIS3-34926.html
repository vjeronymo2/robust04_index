Plumes of smoke billowed into the air after warplanes  swooped  over the Iqlim al-Tuffah ridge east of the port of Sidon, firing  missiles and dropping several delayed action and cluster bombs,  the sources said.    One Hizballah guerrilla was killed and two others were  wounded in the raids, they said.    A spokesman for Hizballah in Beirut said earlier there were  no casualties in the attacks, which coincided with the  resumption in Washington of Arab-Israeli peace talks.    In Jerusalem, an Israeli army spokesman confirmed the raid  saying all aircraft returned safely to base.    "All the targets, which were in a zone entirely controlled  by  the Hizballah, were destroyed," he said. The Hizballah  positions were used for training and launching attacks on  Israeli targets, he added.    The raids came three days after Hizballah's secretary  general  Shaykh Hasan Nasrallah warned his group would step up attacks  against Israel in south Lebanon.    The Iranian-backed movement killed four Israeli soldiers and  wounded five others on February 7 in the bloodiest attack since  August, triggering Israeli air strikes and artillery attacks and  threats of further reprisals.    Israel has lost 30 soldiers in Lebanon since January 1993.    In Tuesday's raids two warplanes fired missiles on  al-Luwayzah, a Hizballah stronghold in the Iqlim al-Tuffah, and  minutes later, warplanes struck again at Hizballah hideouts in  nearby Jarju'.    A Hizballah source in the port of Tyre said guerrillas fired  four shoulder-launched SAM-7 missiles at the planes. A security  source said up to seven missiles were fired at the aircraft.

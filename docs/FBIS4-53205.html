			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Local vernacular dailies on 17 May  carry editorials commenting on the remarks of former opposition  leader Kim Tae-chung, who is now chairman of the Asia-Pacific  Peace Foundation, APPF, that North Korea's possession of two or  three atomic bombs would not be much of a problem compared with  the 20,000 nuclear warheads the United States has.    The conservative CHOSON ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Mr. Kim Tae-chung's View on the North Korean  Nuclear Issue." Referring to his remarks, the editorial says  "it is not important how many nuclear bombs North Korea  possesses but whether it actually has nuclear weapons." The  editorial then says that it is "hard to understand" the APPF's  excuse that Kim made the remarks in order to stress the futility  of North Korea's possession of a few nuclear weapons because the  number of nuclear warheads is not the focus of the nuclear issue.    Noting the ongoing international efforts to deter North  Korea's nuclear development, the editorial holds that his  remarks are "tantamount to throwing a wet blanket over such  efforts," and calls on Kim to "clarify his view on the North  Korean nuclear issue before or after he returns home from the  United States."    The moderate KYONGHYANG SINMUN carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "We Should Not Allow North Korea To Have a  Nuclear Bomb, Not Even One Nuclear Bomb." Noting that his  remarks regarding North Korea's nuclear issue has "caused  ripples at home and abroad," the editorial maintains "regardless  of the true intent behind his remarks, there is a high  possibility that the remarks will confuse the government's North  Korean policy."    Stressing the importance of deterring North Korea's nuclear  development for the nation's interests, the editorial says, "In  view of this, it is hard to read the true intent of Kim's remark  that `the ROK and U.S. Governments have complicated the matter  by not yielding a single point to North Korea.'" The editorial  concludes that "While we are well aware of where Chairman Kim's  true heart and aspiration for the improvement of the North-South  relations lie, as one of the most respected personalities in ROK  politics, he should refrain from making ambiguous remarks and  should work towards a unified national view."    The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 an 800-word  editorial entitled "Does He Mean That the North's Nuclear Bomb  Is Tolerable?" Referring to Kim Tae-chung's "shocking" remarks  on the North's nuclear development the editorial says: "It is  deplorable that he made such irresponsible remarks at a time  when the entire nation is working hard to stop North Korea's  nuclear development."    The editorial says Kim's remarks at the Washington's  National  Press Club proposing the invitation of Kim Il-song to the United  States and the appointment of Former President Jimmy Carter as a  special envoy to Pyongyang should have been "more discreet"    The editorial concludes that "he should restrain himself  from  making remarks creating uneasiness and confusion among the  people who call for the transparency of North's nuclear issue  and want to improve the relations between the North and South."</p>

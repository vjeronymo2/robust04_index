			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The National Roofing Contractors Association said that currently there is no HEPA vacuum attached roofing cutter (Ex. 146). However, a wide variety of power tools have been fitted with local exhaust systems that work very well, including those used on tools for asbestos work. The 1972 asbestos standard required the use of local exhaust ventilation on all hand-operated or powered tools which may produce or release asbestos fibers in excess of the permissible exposure limit (37 FR 11320). The 1986 standard affirmed the requirement for ventilation for tools (51 FR 22715). We again reaffirm it here. To the extent feasible, tools used for working with ACM must be equipped with local exhaust ventilation. Some development work may be needed, but HEPA vacuum systems have been designed for many similar uses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Basic Controls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The other basic controls in (g)(1), required for all operations under the standard are intended to reduce exposure caused by resuspension of asbestos fibers which have settled. The first is the requirement in (g)(1)(i) to use vacuum cleaners equipped with HEPA filters or other methods to collect debris and visible dust containing ACM or PACM before the material dries, which prevents the resuspension of fibers. This requirement complements the prohibition in (g)(2)(iii), which prohibits dry clean-up, including sweeping and shoveling, of dust and debris containing ACM or PACM. Although ``wet'' sweeping is not prohibited, it is not preferred, and may not be used to ``collect'' visible dust and debris. Nor may dry ACM or PACM-containing dust or debris be collected by means other than vacuuming with a HEPA filtered vacuum.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There was substantial record support for these requirements. As noted above these procedures apply to all asbestos operations. In removal operations, the requirement to use wet methods in the removal [(g)(1)(ii)] will help assure that resulting debris and dust can be collected before they dry out or are vacuumed up using vacuums equipped with HEPA filters (g)(1)(i). Even if operations are conducted within negative pressure enclosures, debris and dust should not remain uncollected for the entire work shift, because the resuspension of asbestos fibers from these sources creates additional new exposures for employees. If the work is performed within glove bags, leaks in the bags may create dust and debris. Fallen debris can be spread to parts of the building and thereby create widespread contamination. If the collection bags or devices required by other provisions fail or fall short, prompt collection of the dust and debris will limit the exposure to workers from such failure. If the negative pressure within the enclosure lapses, prompt collection of dust and debris will protect employees outside the enclosure from resuspended fibers. For these reasons, OSHA believes that careful treatment of asbestos waste and visible dust must be followed in all construction and shipyard industry operations which expose employees to asbestos.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA notes that for demolition and renovation work which is covered under NESHAP (40 CFR 61 Subpart M), all ACM must be kept wet until sealed in a leak-tight container which includes an appropriate label. OSHA is extending this requirement to all jobs under the standard, and now requires that all asbestos-contaminated waste be promptly disposed of in leak tight containers [(g)(1)(iii)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for Operations Which May Exceed the PELs <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (g)(2) applies to situations where it is expected that exposures may exceed the PEL, and thus additional controls are required to keep exposures at or below the PEL. Paragraph (g)(2) requires that local exhaust ventilation equipped with HEPA filter dust collection systems be installed for fixed processes involving asbestos handling and for power tools used in installing, or otherwise handling asbestos containing materials. In addition, enclosure or isolation of the asbestos releasing process must take place. These controls were listed as optional in the 1986 standard. They are now required, because of their proven ability to reduce dust levels in virtually all occupational environments. These controls, in particular, apply to construction activities involving the installation of new asbestos-containing construction materials, and in some cases the removal of previously installed material.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> R.J. Pigg, President of the Asbestos Information Assn. of North America, testified that ``the tools that we use, (for cutting asbestos-cement pipe as recommended work practices) are those that can be fitted with vacuum attachments. We have studies that relate to those recommended work practices that *&blank;*&blank;* support, when they're being followed, that you're well below the PEL'' (Tr. 558&hyph;9).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, paragraph (g)(2) requires that where the exposures are expected to be above the PEL, ventilation to move contaminated air away from exposed employees in the regulated areas toward a HEPA filtration or collection device is required. This requirement is adapted from the current standard which lists ``general ventilation systems'' as one of the control methods to be used to achieve the PEL. However, OSHA believes that the term ``air sweeping away from exposed employees toward a HEPA filtered exhaust device'' is more appropriate and effective. Further, it removes the interpretative possibility that using a general building ventilation system to vent asbestos-contaminated air, would be acceptable under the standard. A similar requirement is also aimed at Class I jobs which cannot produce a negative initial exposure assessment [see (g)(4)(F)].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

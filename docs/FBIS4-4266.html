			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 29 (XINHUA)--The customs authorities  of North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have taken  steps to strengthen inspection of commodities to prevent exports  of goods with fake brand names.    All personal luggages are strictly examined and inspected,  and the quantity of luggage a traveller may take is strictly  limited. No unqualified product is allowed to be taken out of  the country.    Last year the three entry and exit ports of Manzhouli,  Labudalin and Erlian alone seized fake brand-name products worth  10 million yuan.    The Manzhouli Tourism Bureau provides foreign tourists with  a  shopping guide in the Russian language, which reminds tourists  to demand receipts from Chinese shops. If a commodity can not  pass customs inspection the buyer can claim compensation from  the shop. If any travel agent does not provide a tourist with  the shopping guide and the tourist buys a fake, the travel agent  is responsible for paying any compensation.    These measures are aimed at safeguarding the reputation of  Chinese-made products and ensuring that cross-border trade  develops in a healthy way, according to a local official.</p>

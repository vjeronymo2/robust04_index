Following its discussion, the Board adopted a resolution,  inter alia expressing its grave concern, finding the DPRK in  further non-compliance with its Safeguards Agreement; calling  upon the DPRK immediately to allow the IAEA to complete all  required inspection activities and to comply fully with its  Safeguards Agreement; and requesting the Director General to  transmit the resolution and his report to the Security Council  and General Assembly of the United Nations.    The full text of the Board's resolution, as adopted, is  attached:    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE AGENCY AND THE  DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA FOR THE APPLICATION OF  SAFEGUARDS IN CONNECTION WITH THE TREATY ON THE  NON-PROLIFERATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS (INFCIRC/403)  THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS,    (a) RECALLING the Board of Governors' resolutions GOV/2636  of 25 February 1993, GOV/2639 of 19 March 1993, GOV/2692 of 23  September 1993, the General Conference's resolution GC  (XXXVII)/RES/624 of 1 October 1993, and in particular, GOV/2645  of 1 April 1993, which found the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK) to be in non-compliance with its safeguards  agreement (INFCIRC/403) and referred the matter to the Security  Council of the United Nations,    (b) RECALLING ALSO resolution 825 (1993) adopted by the  Security Council of the United Nations on 11 May 1993, which,  INTER ALIA, requested the Director General to report on this  matter to the Security Council,    (c) NOTING the Director General's written and oral reports  of 21 March 1994 and GOV/2687/ADD.4 in which he stated that the  Agency inspection team was not allowed to conduct indispensable  and agreed inspection activities at the DPRK radiochemical  laboratory, and that the Agency is unable to draw conclusions as  to whether there has been either diversion of nuclear material  or reprocessing at the radiochemical laboratory since February  1993,    (d) NOTING FURTHER the Director General's reaffirmation that  the Secretariat remains available to perform inspection  activities in the DPRK in accordance with its procedures and  agreements, and    (e) TAKING ACCOUNT of the fact that the DPRK is a party to  the NPT and is bound by its safeguards commitments;    1.

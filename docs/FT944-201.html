The venture is a significant move in the restructuring of the European automotive components sector, creating an alliance between two of the industry's leaders. Valeo, the leading French automotive components maker, planned to take an initial 75 per cent stake in the venture, which would integrate the heating and air conditioning systems activities of the two companies. Siemens will have an option to increase its stake to 30 per cent. The venture, which is expected to have annual sales of about FFr4.2bn (Dollars 772.3m), should begin operations in the first quarter of 1995.

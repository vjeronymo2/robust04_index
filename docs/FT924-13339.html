			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Danes seek opt-outs from Maastricht DENMARK will today propose opt-out possibilities from Maastricht treaty clauses on joint European currency, defence and law enforcement as a means of resolving the deadlock caused by the Danish No vote in June's referendum, Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, said yesterday. He said that the special arrangements sought by Denmark had to be 'legally binding and not limited in time'. 'We must succeed in our quest for a special deal if Denmark is to continue to be a member of the European Community,' he stated. 'There is a formula for solving this problem, but I don't want to elaborate now.' Mr Schluter, speaking after a meeting of the Folketing's (parliament's) market affairs committee, said the government believed that binding arrangements could be made with the European Community without needing to renegotiate the treaty. He added that Denmark would also seek more openness and democracy within the EC decision-making process, reiterating its right to run its own social policies. After several days of negotiation and disagreement among Danish politicians over the terms of the treaty, the market committee gave its unanimous backing to the position which will be taken by Mr Schluter in Birmingham. Danish parties, which backed the treaty in the referendum, have said that extensive and binding amendments to the treaty are necessary in order to ensure a Yes in the next referendum. However, other EC members have said they will only consider solutions which do not constitute renegotiation or a new ratification process. Denmark already built into the original treaty last December a clause making participation in economic and monetary union (Emu) subject to a further referendum later in the 1990s. Mr Schluter said a concrete Danish proposal would be ready around November 1 after further talks between political parties in Denmark. The first serious EC discussion of Denmark's special terms will not take place until the EC summit in Edinburgh in December.</p>

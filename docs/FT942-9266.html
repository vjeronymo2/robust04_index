			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / People: Non-executive directors - Brewing Dolphin Sir Peter Thompson, 66, the businessman who has been heavily involved in promoting wider share ownership, has joined the board of Brewin Dolphin, one of the UK's biggest private client stock brokers. Sir Peter, who is president of ProShare and several quoted companies, made his name as chairman of NFC, the employee controlled transport group which he brought to the stock market. He is one of two non-executives joining the board of Brewin Dolphin shortly before it gets its shares floated on the market. Dame Angela Rumbold, 62, a deputy chairman of the Conservative Party and MP for Mitcham and Morden, has also joined the board. Brewin Dolphin, which has 32,000 clients and a network of 12 regional offices, has developed through a series of mergers of old-established stockbroking firms. It was bought by the Scandinavian Bank in 1987 at the time of Big Bang. In April 1992 its management bought the business from the Scandinavian owners and in April 1993 it bought Bell Lawrie, one of Scotland's largest stockbrokers.</p>

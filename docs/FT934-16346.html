			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Inflation rate edges down in Greece GREECE'S year-on-year inflation rate declined to 12.8 per cent in September, reaching its lowest level in the past decade, according to the official statistical service. The September rate was down from 14.6 per cent in August, the sharpest monthly drop this year. It reflects both the government's success in holding down price increases and the effects of continuing recession. The statistical service noted that lower prices for fruit and vegetables, which account for a sizeable portion of household spending in Greece, and a freeze on fees at private schools contributed to the decline. It predicted that year-on-year inflation would drop to 11.5 per cent by December, below the economy ministry's latest forecast of 12 per cent. However, this would still be more than three times the average rate in the rest of the European Community. Containing inflation has been a priority under the Conservative government's stabilisation programme. The opposition Socialists are committed to a similar policy if they win Sunday's general election.</p>

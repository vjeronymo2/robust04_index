			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus arrived from  Davos to Ermantigen near Lake Constance today. Jiri Halousek  reports:    [Halousek] Vaclav Klaus is staying today at Wolfsberg Castle  near Ermantigen, at the invitation of the Union Bank of  Switzerland. [passage omitted]    Klaus held a news conference for representatives of the  Swiss  communications media this afternoon.    The prime minister first pointed to the differences that  exist between the Czech Republic and the majority of the other  former communist countries. These differences exist in both the  political structure and the economy. While, for example, in the  majority of postcommunist states privatization of large  enterprises is only beginning, it will be completed in our  country this year.    Klaus went on to say that the fact that there is low  unemployment in our country is the consequence of our having  managed to secure the correct ratio between labor productivity  and wages. In the West, on the contrary, this ratio is  troublesome at the moment. The current 3.5 percent of  unemployed will not be possible to maintain on a long-term  basis, but unemployment will grow in a balanced way. Klaus  expects the growth of unemployment this year to be 0.1 percent a  month. Inflation should be under 10 percent.    The Czech prime minister then said he was convinced that  what  our government has done has general validity. Despite various  national differences, other postcommunist countries must proceed  basically in the same way if they want to succeed.    We do not need help from the West, only security guarantees,  membership in international institutions, and open markets. We  are interested in entry into the EC. However, as Klaus  continued, on the other hand, we also have worries similar to  Switzerland's. We do not like bureaucracy and state  interventionism. About the Maastricht Treaty, Klaus said that  we need common markets, not a political union. We are seeking  our own identity, which we lost during the years of proletarian  internationalism, and we fear that we might lose it again in a  too-unified Europe. We want to get to Europe, but we do not  want to dissolve in it as a lump of sugar in a cup of coffee,  Klaus said literally. Large nations do not have these worries,  but small countries such as the Czech Republic have them.    Klaus then went on to say that he was on the side of  Slovakia  in the conflict between Slovakia and Hungary. [passage omitted]</p>

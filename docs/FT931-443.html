			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Observer: Banking on a name Have British banks gone completely mad? First, traditional firms like Barclays and Lloyds drop the apostrophe in their family titles, then they abandon trusted brand names such as Martins and Williams and Glyn's by merging with each other. Now they are trying to make new services sound exciting by giving them American-sounding names. Take telephone banking. Midland has Firstdirect and National Westminster has PrimeLine. Both names have a US bank's combination of eccentric use of capital letters, and the running of two words together. Now Bank of Scotland, of all places, has re-named its direct banking operations Centrebank. Admittedly, Central Banking Services, its old name, doesn't have a snappy ring. But if they must sound American, why not just call it Centerbank?</p>

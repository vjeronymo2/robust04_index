Data show the food additive regulation is not needed because any residues of mancozeb on raisins are covered by the tolerance set for the corresponding raw commodity (grapes). This rule responds to a petition submitted by the Mancozeb Task Force, which requested that EPA revoke the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This regulation is effective June 30, 1994.

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Statutory Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) authorizes EPA to establish maximum permissible levels or ``tolerances'' for pesticide residues in or on foods. The FFDCA has separate provisions for tolerances for raw agricultural commodities (RACs) and tolerances for processed foods. For pesticide residues in or on raw commodities, EPA establishes tolerances, or exemptions from the requirement of tolerances when appropriate, under section 408. 21 U.S.C. 346a. In processed foods, food additive regulations setting maximum permissible levels of pesticide residues are established under section 409. 21 U.S.C. 348. Section 409 tolerances are required, however, only for certain pesticide residues in processed food. Under section 402(a)(2) of the FFDCA, no section 409 tolerance is required if any pesticide residue in a processed food is equal to or below the tolerance for that pesticide in or on the RAC from which it was derived. This exemption in section 402(a)(2) is commonly referred to as the ``flow-through'' provision because it allows the section 408 raw food tolerance to flow through to the processed food form. Thus, a section 409 tolerance is only necessary to prevent foods from being deemed adulterated when the concentration of the pesticide residue in a processed food is greater than the tolerance prescribed for the raw agricultural commodity, or if the processed food itself is treated or comes in contact with a pesticide. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Petitions to Revoke <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1989, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the State of California, Public Citizen, the AFL-CIO, and several individuals filed a petition requesting that EPA revoke several food additive regulations (including the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins) on the grounds that the regulations violated the Delaney clause in FFDCA section 409. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of July 14, 1993 (58 FR 37862), EPA revoked the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins; however, that revocation has been stayed. Published elsewhere in the rules and regulations section of this issue of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is EPA's latest Order responding to the petition. That Order addresses food additive regulations other than mancozeb on raisins. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 23, 1993, the Mancozeb Task Force, which includes E.I. du Pont de Nemours Company, Elf Atochem North America, Inc., and Rohm and Haas Co., filed a petition requesting revocation of the food additive regulations for raisins and the brans of barley, oats, rye, and wheat. The petition was based on the assertion that the food additive regulations were not needed since there was no concentration of residues in these processed commodities, and, consequently, the corresponding tolerances on the raw agricultural commodities are adequate to cover residues in both raw and processed foods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of May 19, 1993 (58 FR 29318), EPA issued the receipt of that petition in a notice of availability and requested public comments on the petitioner's request and supporting materials. Contents of and comments received on that petition regarding the requested action on raisins are described in the next section. The Agency has not yet finished its review of the data submitted for the brans of barley, oats, rye, and wheat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Revocation of the Food Additive Regulation for Mancozeb on Raisins <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Mancozeb Task Force's petition requests revocation of the section 409 tolerance for mancozeb on raisins, on the basis of data showing that residues in grapes do not concentrate in raisins. The Task Force cited two studies reflecting six different use patterns. In all cases, mancozeb residues were lower in raisins than in the raw commodity, grapes. In addition to the petition, the Mancozeb Task Force filed comments in response to the May 19, 1993 Federal Register notice, where they reiterated their position and the significance of the supporting data. No other comments were filed in response to the May 19, 1993 notice of availability. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA agrees with the petitioner's assertion that the food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins is not needed since the data show that levels of mancozeb on typically processed raisins are lower than those in the unprocessed grapes. The study used as a basis for setting the original food additive regulation was not reflective of the current typical processing practices which include washing of raisins as one of the processing steps. Subdivision O Residue Chemistry Guidelines require that the processing data submitted reflect typical processing practices (Refs. 1 and 2: U.S. EPA, Pesticide Assessment Guidelines, Subdivision O, Residue Chemistry, p. 21, October 1982 and Considine Considine, eds., Foods and Food Production Encyclopedia, p. 1640 (1982)). Information currently available confirms that raisins are typically washed as a part of normal processing. In 1990, prior to the submission of their petition, the Mancozeb Task Force submitted a new processing study which did simulate commercial processing including washing of the raisins (Ref. 3: U.S. EPA, MRID 41483801). In an EPA review of those data, completed on August 11, 1992, EPA concluded that ``residues of mancozeb concentrated up to 30x in raisin waste but did not concentrate in raisins, wet pomace, dry pomace, or juice'' (Ref. 4: U.S. EPA, Memorandum from Edward Zager, Health Effects Division, EPA to Lois Rossi, Reregistration Branch, EPA, ``Mancozeb Update to Reregistration Standard,'' p. 106 (August 11, 1992)). A copy of this EPA review is located in the OPP docket, the location of which is given under the ``Addresses'' section earlier in this document. EPA determined that ``the established food additive tolerance for mancozeb on raisins is not needed and should be revoked'' (Ref. 5: Same as Ref. 4, p. 107). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's current policy mandates that we compare the residues in processed commodities to the residues in the raw agricultural commodities to determine whether concentration occurs. In this case, the residues in raisins, which have been washed during normal commercial processing are compared to the residues in unwashed grapes. Since the data show that levels of mancozeb on typically processed raisins are lower than those in the unprocessed grapes, EPA is granting the Mancozeb Task Force's petition as to the revocation of the section 409 food additive regulation for mancozeb on raisins.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Procedural Matters <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Filing of Objections and Requests for Hearings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person adversely affected by this Order may file written objections to the Order, and may include with any such objection a written request for an evidentiary hearing on the objection. Such objections must be submitted to the Hearing Clerk at the address listed under ``ADDRESSES'' on or before August 1, 1994. Copies of such objections should be filed with the OPP docket for this action. Regulations applicable to objections and requests for hearings are set out at 40 CFR parts 178 and 179. Those regulations require, among other things, that objections specify with particularity the provisions of the Order objected to, the basis for the objections, and the relief sought. Additional requirements as to the form and manner of the submission of objections are set out at 40 CFR 178.25. The Administrator will respond as set forth in 40 CFR 178.30, 178.35 and/or 178.37 to objections that are not accompanied by a request for evidentiary hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A person may include with any objection a written request for an evidentiary hearing on the objection. A hearing request must include a statement of the factual issues on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. A copy of any hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should also be filed with the OPP docket for this action. Additional requirements as to the form and manner of submission of requests for an evidentiary hearing are set out at 40 CFR 178.27. Under 40 CFR 178.32(c), the Administrator, where appropriate, will make rulings on any issues raised by an objection if such issues must be resolved prior to determining whether a request for an evidentiary hearing should be granted. The Administrator will respond to requests for evidentiary hearings as set forth in 40 CFR 178.30, 178.32, 178.35, 178.37, and/or 179.20. Under 40 CFR 178.32(b), a request for an evidentiary hearing on an objection will be granted if the objection and request have been properly submitted and if the Administrator determines that the material submitted show: (1) There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact for resolution at a hearing; (2) there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor; and (3) resolution of one or more of the factual issues in the manner sought by the person requesting the hearing would be adequate to justify the action requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person wishing to comment on any objections or requests may submit such comments to the Hearing Clerk on or before August 15, 1994. A copy of such comments should also be filed with the OPP docket for this action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Executive Order 12866 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 1735, October 4, 1993), EPA must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (or review by the Office of Budget and Management). Section 3(f) defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to (1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely or materially affect a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities; (2) create serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially alter the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' within the meaning of that term as defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. EPA is taking this action because it has determined that the subject food additive regulation is not needed; the Agency believes that mancozeb, when used according to the label instructions, will not result in residues on raisins that exceed the section 408 tolerance prescribed to cover mancozeb residues from the use on grapes. Therefore, the Agency expects no economic impact will result. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Regulatory Flexibility Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354; 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires EPA to analyze regulatory options to assess the economic impact on small businesses, small governments and small organizations. As explained above, the Agency believes there will be no economic impact on small businesses, governments and organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI.

For two weeks, the U.S. capital has been holding  discussions. In Port-au-Prince, however, some political players  are predicting new developments within the coming days.  Following is a synopsis of the situation with Clarence Renois:    [Begin recording] In the 28th month of what is here and  elsewhere considered an unprecedented crisis, the Haitian case  seems to be rekindling interest in the eyes of the international  community. Relegated to a number-three position of importance  among the concerns of the world's great leaders, the Haitian  case is gradually returning to a level of priority since the  step taken by the American Center for Democracy, initiator of  restarting Washington-Haitian negotiations.    In fact, for two weeks, the principal leaders of the Haitian  parliament have been visiting the U.S. capital where senators  and deputies have been working on writing a plan for a solution  to the political crisis. Approved from the start by the United  States, this plan also benefits from the firm support of the  four countries, Friends of Haiti; and today, from the support of  the United Nations, brought to bear by Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The  UN secretary general has thus quickly answered the letter from  six Haitian legislators who were soliciting moral support from  his organization.    Everything could lead us to believe that this latest attempt  might be the good one if the intransigence -- the word is from  the [U.S.] State Department --President Aristide's intransigence  did not present an obstacle in the execution of the plan for a  solution to the crisis. But careful! Besides the position of  President Aristide, an unknown is the position of the military,  concealed behind a complete, disconcerting silence. The military  institution has said nothing about all these negotiations, at  least not publicly or officially, while it is again a question  of the anticipated retirement of the Army commander in chief.    Deputy Samuel Madistin asked the judicious question, quote:  Do six legislators have enough authority to force Gen. Raoul  Cedras to respect what has not been respected in the Governors  Island agreement, unquote. Another unknown in this situation is  the position of some legislators who openly dissociate  themselves from the initiative by their six colleagues.  Furthermore, the crisis in the Senate of the Republic does not  facilitate things either.    In any case, the coming days, even the coming hours, could  be  of importance because, FRAPH, [Revolutionary Front for Haitian  Advancement and Progress] has launched an ultimatum to President  Aristide, an ultimatum that expires today; and a senator of the  republic has announced surprises for the coming hours. Today,  once again, all eyes are turned on Washington, the capital of  Uncle Sam, which for the past 28 months has been the center of  political activities of the independent and sovereign Republic  of Haiti.

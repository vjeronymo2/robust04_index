			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Pendulum can swing it Sir, May I offer a simple solution to the signalmen's dispute (and indeed to all such differences). Under pendulum arbitration, an arbitrator is appointed whose task is to find for one side or another, but not to negotiate any further compromise. It is incumbent therefore upon each side to put forward their most reasonable claim, and one which they believe an independent third party will favour. This has the effect of bringing both sides quite close to each other, and removing the issue of loss of face. I commend it to RMT and Railtrack.

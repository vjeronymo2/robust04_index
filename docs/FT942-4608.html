			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Bougainville negotiations called for A delegation of Australian MPs, among the first 'outside observers' to visit the strife-torn island of Bougainville, yesterday recommended that Mr Paias Wingti, Papua New Guinea's prime minister, and other top politicians should visit the island in soon in an effort to reconcile interest groups there. It said it was imperative that a ceasefire be negotiated 'by whatever processes can ensure its acceptance and maintenance by all parties' and that 'concurrently with the ceasefire, medical supplies and food should be made freely available'. The delegation said in a report report that 'sympathetic third party involvement' could assist this process. The notion of establishing a regional peacekeeping force - drawn from the likes of Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga - has been mooted recently. The report also suggested that Australia could host peace talks, and should use its substantial aid programme to PNG to boost humanitarian relief and address infrastructure problems.</p>

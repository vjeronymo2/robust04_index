			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Second Friday prayers sermon by Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi, </F> head of the judiciary branch and acting Friday prayers leader,  in Tehran on 1 April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] In the name of God, the merciful, the  compassionate. [passage omitted] Today is 12 Farvardin [1  April]. In fact, 16 years have passed since the victory of the  revolution. [passage omitted] I presume that the form of our  Islamic government is still unfamiliar to the world. Whenever  the world refers to the Islamic Republic -- its decisions,  organizations, officials, and responsibilities -- one senses  that the world has not properly understood the formation of our  government. [passage omitted] When the word, republic, comes  to mind, people think it is like other republics. Yes, they do.  The majority of the people voted for it; that is, 98.2 percent  of all Iranians who could vote said yes to the Islamic Republic,  and this system relies on the public vote. Its decisions take  shape through by voting. Majles representatives are elected by  voting. Members of the Experts Assembly are elected by the  people. People use the ballot in many other cases. [passage  omitted]    Our people use the ballot to ensure that the government  respects religious laws in employment and in the execution of  government affairs. They voted that women should respect  Islamic norms once they accept responsibility in organizations  of the system. The republic has voted for the sovereignty of  Islam. All people have called for the sovereignty of Islam. In  some cases, it is true, votes are cast but they are not in  contradiction with the principles of Islam. There is a  supervisory body -- the honored Guardian Council which reviews  approved bills and rejects things that contradict the  constitution and the religious laws. Anyway, Islam is sovereign.    The world has not understood the form of the Islamic rule.  They sometimes ask: Who is the first person of the system?  They see that in other systems the head of the executive is the  first person. Then they see that the Islamic system is  different, where the first person is the supreme jurisconsult  and has the honored position of the leadership, presently his  eminence Ayatollah Khamene'i, may God preserve his noble shadow,  [crowd chants in approval]. And he is responsible for  determining the general plan of the country's management. In  truth, the legitimacy of the other officials of the system is  formed and actualized in their relationship to him. Of course,  here I do not want to discuss the form of Islamic government  which includes legitimacy, the measures of legitimacy, the  method of activity, and the limits of activity. This is an  extensive debate that must be discussed in its place. But I  want to say that some officials in some countries speak, and one  understands them to be thinking that republic in this system is  the same as republic in some Arab or European country. Then  they realize that the systems are not compatible in some issues  and therefore ask: what are we to do? You should inform  yourselves better. Improve your knowledge. You should  understand our system, our people, our system of government and  the rights and duties of each official.    Take for example, as you know, the judiciary. In places I  have visited during my term of office, or in various countries  of the world which I have studied, the highest person  responsible for the judiciary is in fact supervised by the  executive and even in many places he is appointed by the  president. Even in systems managed by councils, a number of the  council members are appointed by the president. But our system  is different. In our system, the official responsible for the  judiciary is directly appointed by the esteemed leader.  Naturally then there are many differences in terms of laws,  rights, and manifestations. In fact, the independence of the  three powers is relatively greater in Islamic government than  the systems existing in the world today. Anyway, in the Islamic  republic, where the republic has called for Islam and where all  the officials of the system work on the basis of Islam, there is  a particular system with its particular methods, manifestations  and consequences. [passage omitted]    There are a few other minor issues. Concerning the issue  of the pilgrimage, I will voice my own view: First of all, I  wish to point out to high-ranking officials that bilateral or  multilateral issues cannot be resolved on a unilateral basis.  One should never lose sight of this fact and try to resolve the  issue on a unilateral basis. Whenever there is a bilateral or  multilateral issue, we must accept the face that it should be  resolved on a bilateral or multilateral basis. This is the  terminology being used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A  unilateral solution is either no solution at all or, even if it  is a solution, it is only a temporary solution and may have  other consequences.    Therefore, on the pilgrimage issue, one should accept that  the problem is a bilateral problem. In order to resolve this  problem, one should act in a bilateral way and, God willing, get  to the root of the problem. In this connection, of course, if  there are any words of advice or caution, any facts, one should  bring these to the notice of the Saudi Government. One should  remind them of the issues, inform them of the facts, and explain  the situation of the Islamic Republics compared with other  countries. When they say that there is no difference between  this country and another country, one should tell them that  there is a difference and there are reasons for the difference,  and so on. One should explain the issues to them so that a  correct solution can be found and the issue resolved on a  fundamental basis. This is one point, that one cannot solve  these problems from a unilateral point of view.    Of course, you know that the responsible officials have been  trying to have discussions, they are discussing it, and I do not  have any specific information about the outcome of these talks.  One should not make a promise from this podium unless it is  clearly based on facts and is definite; and as I do not have any  specific information I will not make any promises.    The second issue - again I'm giving you my own opinion: It  seems to me that we should clarify the issue and appoint someone  with full powers. He should be told: Go and pursue the matter  until a solution is found. This is the way to solve the  problem. When every day we have a situation in which a certain  newspaper of our country writes a certain article, a certain  Saudi newspaper writes another article and a newspaper in a  third country -- which has nothing to do with the Islamic  Republic or with Saudi Arabia -- writes something else -- this  newspaper is a famous newspaper. These are all examples, each  one of them have to be discussed. If a newspaper has written a  certain article, what has that got to do with the fate of two  countries? If a newspaper has published something, what has  that got to do with the fate of a country?    Newspapers are free; each one of them publishes articles  according to their taste. The issues of a country cannot be  given to a couple of journalists to play with. A journalist's  job is to do this. He looks at the issues and increases the  size of his headline or reduces it. Or he might write something  catchy for his headline and when you look at the article you do  not see that much. I know a number of newspapers will not like  what I am saying, but I have examples for everything I say.    All I am saying is that someone should be given the  responsibility by the higher authorities of the country -- with  full powers and taking into account all the realities in our  country, in the other country and in the world of Islam -- to  solve this problem fundamentally and once and for all; and far  from the fears and discussions created by newspapers, especially  the media and newspapers of other countries, who are waiting for  such opportunities to say something or other. The problem  should be solved once and for all.    The third issue -- again, this is my opinion: Regarding the  hajj, I don't know if this decision was made by our esteemed  deputy minister of culture and Islamic guidance or the minister  of guidance or both. However, I say this: How many times should  we experience one issue? If we experienced something and we  were not successful, we should not go through it again. We  should not repeat the act since we experienced defeat. When I  see that it is officially announced that if someone were to have  a passport and the passport holder had the visa to visit that  country and we said: We will not give you an exit visa. I ask  the honorable minister, and the esteemed deputy minister: Are  you in a position to ban anyone from travelling abroad? Is  leaving the country in your hands? What is the legal basis of  your decision? You did this once, and you saw that certain  people, even those held in high esteem by you, with passports at  hand entered Saudi Arabia via other countries during the hajj.  And you saw them there and they said to you: Hello, how are  you! Why did you do this and create problems for us and  yourselves? You did not achieve anything. My first point is  legal and the political point is secondary.    I say that the Hajj Organization or the Guidance Ministry --  because I do not know who made this decision.... [pauses] If  someone has a passport, that means it does not matter. If  someone has a visa, it means it does not matter. With a  passport and a visa, why do you say: We will not let you go?  You cannot say this. It is not within your jurisdiction to ban  someone from travel abroad. What is this! How many people are  there in the country who can do this? How many people can leave  the country to go to hajj and be honored in this way? Let us  pay a bit more attention to reality. In other words, limit the  people to the extent that is called for, and by taking into  account all the issues. [passage omitted]    Palestine -- and about yesterday's agreement in Cairo --  and Mr. Clinton's remarks -- I really don't know; we must really  ask the American President: who gave you the right -- you, who  are on the other side of the world -- and on the basis of what  criteria? Even if we look at it on the basis of common law --  on the basis of what criteria do you say that Quds [Jerusalem]  belongs to Israel? On the basis of what criteria?    You are the President of the United States. That is fine.  The people of the United States voted for you. What right does  this give you to interfere in the country of Palestine -- or  Israel, as it stands? These remarks do not have any legal or  judicial basis, even on the basis of common law. That is the  first point.    Secondly, let me say this to you: Palestine, the people of  Palestine and Quds, all these agreements, remarks, signatures,  and talks, as you have seen in practice, Palestinian jihadi  groups are unanimously opposed to them. There are strikes every  day. There are clashes every day. There are killings every  day. The pure blood of the martyrs of the shrine of Abraham in  al-Khalil [Hebron] has not even dried yet. The blood of the  martyrs of the incident which took place a few days ago has not  dried yet. Do you think that by just gathering together in a  country such as Egypt, for example, or elsewhere and signing a  piece of paper you can solve everything? You can do away with  past promises?    The people of Palestine are the true owners of Palestine.  Quds is the permanent and eternal capital of Palestine and  Palestine belongs to the Palestinian people. [crowd chants in  support]    They commit the worst crime. The entire world says that it  was the ugliest crime to massacre people while they were  kneeling in prayer in a mosque. Then they say that it was done  by an extremist group; it had nothing to do with the government.  A few days later, they kill a number of other people. Then  they say, yes, it was such and such a group and it had nothing  to do with the government. They use trickery and wear different  clothes, then they massacre Palestinian youths, and then they  give some other explanation for the incident.    Let me tell you this: apart from military and war issues,  the  killers of the Palestinian Muslims in the Hebron mosque must  definitely be brought before an international penal court sooner  or later; whoever they may be. You say they are an extremist  group, we say it was the government itself under the guise of an  extremist group, and others say the order came from even higher  up: from the United States or wherever else. What I am saying  is this: an international penal court must definitely examine  and try this crime and punish the perpetrators. [crowd chants in  support]    We hope the Armenian Government responds to the Foreign  Ministry statement as soon as possible. Procrastinating and  saying we have not officially received a report yet, or that it  has been rushed, and so forth, will not suffice. In any case,  an incident has occurred and the plane carrying a number of  innocent people has crashed. The Foreign Ministry has  investigated the matter and announced the results. A reply must  be made.    About our Afghan brothers, I do not know how to say it. Do  they, themselves, know that there have recently been whispers in  the world of appointing a guardian, of a partition, and so  forth. Do you know what the outcome of the continuation of  these wars and domestic clashes will be? For God's sake, for  Islam's sake, leave these power struggles aside, stop these  civil wars; put an end to the matter; do not break your recent  cease fire; come and sit together and solve the problem and  preserve Islam; do not ruin any further this ruined country.  Otherwise one of oppressors or infidels who ruled your country  for many years would come from the other side of the world,  under the pretext that you cannot manage yourselves, and lay  their hands on the country, and you will once again be enslaved  by another power. Come and put an end to the matter. We hope  that your cease-fire will have a happy ending. [passage omitted]</p>

Radio station S5.9,  created and run by soldiers of the Presidential Guard Battalion,  is on the air beginning today.    The Presidential Guard Battalion no longer has to wake up to  the sounds of reveille only. The soldiers now wake up to music  played on 88.3 MHz, a frequency that identifies S5.9, a military  radio station.    [Begin radio announcer Juan Carlos Ramirez recording] All of  the equipment came from the Presidential Guard Battalion. In  general, everyone ranging from colonels to captains contributed,  including the soldiers. It all began when the soldiers started  bringing their records. They brought their drawings representing  the radio station. They brought microphones and equipment. The  console came from the Presidential Guard Battalion.

They hope to get civilians to listen  to the radio station as well; this does not mean the radio  station will ease up on military discipline. Here is what the  colonel had to say:    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] Training is stronger  now, but it is accompanied by psychology. These men are being  trained so that when they finish their military career they can  work in a radio or television station. [end recording]</p>

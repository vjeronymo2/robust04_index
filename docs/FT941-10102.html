			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Bank's growth forecast revised upwards Thailand's central bank yesterday revised upwards its economic growth forecast for 1994 and its estimate for last year, saying that gross domestic product could increase by a real 8.2-8.3 per cent in 1994 after a rise of about 8 per cent in 1993, Victor Mallet reports from Bangkok. Mr Vijit Supinit, Bank of Thailand governor, attributed the better-than-expected performance to higher exports and investment; previous official estimates suggested GDP would grow less than 8 per cent this year and last. 'Exports performed much better than expected, which means the current account deficit improved,' Mr Vijit said. Thailand's current account deficit was about 5 per cent of GDP in 1993, compared with the forecast 6.3 per cent. Exports last year rose by more than the 11.5 per cent previously predicted. The value of Thai exports was hit in the first part of 1993 by low prices for agricultural commodities, although electronics exports continued to grow strongly. Prices for rice, one of Thailand's main export commodities, have risen recently, following the Japanese decision to allow foreign rice imports. But a water shortage in the central plains of Thailand is likely to restrict the amount of Thai rice available for export.</p>

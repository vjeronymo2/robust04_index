Speaking at  a press conference with foreign journalists here Wednesday [16  February], Ciampi noted that he had first made the proposals  many years ago when he was governor of the Bank of Italy. He  voiced the hope that the heavy lira would become a reality  because, as he put it, those three extra zeroes serve no purpose  and only complicate matters.    Ciampi said that he always figured that before the heavy  lira  could be introduced, it was necessary for two-digit inflation in  Italy to be brought down to a one-digit number.    Today this has been achieved and Italy finds itself closer  to  Europe, the premier added. Because of all the zeroes involved,  calculating in lire is cumbersome and confusing. A figure like  1,000 lire is worth 59 cents, while a 100,000 lire banknote,  Italy's largest, is worth 59.17 dollars. One million dollars in  Italian money would come to 1,690,000,000 lire.    With the heavy lira, one lira would be worth 59 cents; a 50  lire bill would be worth around thirty dollars, the 100 lire  banknote would equal close to sixty dollars, and so on.</p>

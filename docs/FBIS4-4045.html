			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Willy Wo-lap Lam] </F>   [Text] By sending Wang Juntao into perhaps permanent  exile, Beijing has deprived itself of an opportunity to build  bridges to the dissident community and other disaffected sectors  of society.    Permission given the veteran activist to leave jail and seek  medical treatment in the United States confirms a policy the  Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adopted more than a year ago: To  get rid of "troublemakers" by exiling them.    The administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton has  already  cited the "release" of Wang as a sign of improvement in  Beijing's human rights record. "Emigration" is one of criteria  set forth in Mr. Clinton's executive order, the fulfilment of  which is necessary for the renewal of China's Most Favoured  Nation (MFN) status in early June. In spite of Beijing's  refusal to allow Han Dongfang and other exiled dissidents to  return to China, Washington -- and Western governments in  general -- have yet to decry this as a violation of the civil  rights of Chinese citizens.    "Almost all dissidents who have left China have seen their  effectiveness as the custodians of the national conscience  suffer," said political scientist Yan Jiaqi, who fled the  country immediately after Tiananmen Square. Professor Yan, who  recently moved to New York from Paris, added: "They are cut off  from their soil. Moreover, even big names among exiles have to  solve their livelihood problems. This detracts from their  ability to pursue the (pro- democracy) crusade on a full-time  basis."    In spite of Wang's credentials as one of China's most  respected and combat-hardened intellectuals, analysts are  pessimistic that he could unify the badly fractured overseas  dissident movement. Two other figures of comparable stature who  have settled in the U.S. -- astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and  Shanghai-based writer Wang Ruowang -- have disappointed their  followers by failing to provide strong leadership.    In the past two years, the flagship of the overseas  dissident  movement, the Paris-based Federation for a Democratic China, has  splintered into six outfits most of whose leaders do not talk to  each other.    Friends of Wang Juntao said they would advise him not to  join  any of the six so as not to get bogged down with ugly  in-fighting. And while Wang had to contend with the Herculean  task of pursuing the pro-democracy crusade on alien soil,  negotiating with Beijing over the terms of his return could be  as daunting.    The CCP administration has in the past year forced a number  of "second-line" exiles to submit to humiliating conditions for  their homecoming. These include pledges that upon returning to  China, they abstain from "anti-government activities" and stay  away from "underground political organisations."    Beijing has, however, been adamant against letting prominent  dissidents including Professors Yan and Fang, Han, and  journalist Liu Binyan to go home on any terms. In most  instances, the Chinese embassy in Washington and the consulates  have simply refused to renew their Chinese passports.    A West Coast-based dissident journalist indicated last week  that Beijing was using the threat of permanent exile to "cow him  into subservience". "Senior cadres visiting the U.S. have told  me I have no hope of returning unless I stop writing  `anti-Chinese' articles in Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers," the  journalist said. "Last month, when a friend of mine renewed his  passport at the local consulate, he was asked by the consular  official to relay the same message to me."    Both as a means of clinching MFN and to rid the  administration of challengers, Beijing is expected to give more  dissidents one-way tickets to the West. Yet if the CCP had the  interests of the country at heart -- or even if it is merely  committed to the much narrower goal of maintaining stability, as  numerous party leaders have reiterated since January -- it  should keep a more open mind.    Setting free Wang -- with his unique background and  experience -- and allowing him to stay in China could actually  help Beijing defuse tension in the dissident community and  society in general. In spite of Wang's reputation as the "black  hand" of the 1989 movement and his being characterised by  Premier Li Peng as a "tiger which should never be allowed to  return to the hills," the economist and editor is a moderate  within the pro-democracy movement.    "Since his activism began in the late 1970s, Wang has always  believed in evolutionary changes inside the system," a source  said.    During the Democracy Wall period, Wang worked with the  liberal wing of the CCP, then led by the late party chief Hu  Yaobang, to bring about progress from within. "Wang and Hu  struck up a friendship which lasted into the early 1980s," the  source said.    In the three or so years before the June 4, 1989 crackdown,  Wang -- together with fellow "black hand" Chen Ziming, who was  also given 13 years in jail in 1991 -- was involved with a  quasi-private institute for economic and social research as well  as the now- defunct Economics Weekly, a paper that urged market  reforms.    "Wang has never advocated revolution," another friend said.  "Right through early June 1989, he tried hard to prevent  radicals among the students and intellectuals in the Square from  directly confronting the regime."    Until the eve of the massacre, Wang maintained ties with  liberal cadres and the children of party elders. Analysts said  if the hardline faction of the CCP could put aside its  prejudices, Wang together with Chen, another candidate for  "medical bail" -- would be an ideal mediator between Beijing and  the dissidents. Instead, the CCP has refused to consider  options other than using the weapons of the "dictatorship of the  proletariat" to impose control.    It is true that Beijing might, through a spate of detentions  since the spring, be able to stifle the voice of opposition in  the run-up to the fifth anniversary of June 4.    However, the underlying causes of revolt -- hyperinflation,  unemployment, corruption and the party's total refusal to share  power are more acute now than in early 1989.    Without the moderating influence of "evolutionists" like  Wang  and Chen, the next outbreak of the democracy movement could be  more extreme -- and violent -- than ever. Packing the likes of  Wang into exile merely ensures that when the conflagration  erupts, there could be no dialogue between the administration  and its critics.</p>

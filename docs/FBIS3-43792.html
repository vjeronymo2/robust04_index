Another man was killed by  unknown gunmen in the central Ouenze district of Brazzaville,  the official added.    The four dead were killed in separate clashes between  government forces and opposition militia on the one hand and  pro-government and opposition militia on the other.    This brought the death toll since the resumption of fighting  in the capital in mid-December to 115.    After several days of relative calm, clashes resumed on  Thursday [13 January] and Friday, with government forces using  heavy weapons to respond to machine gun fire from opposition  militias. More heavy weapons fire was heard late Saturday  evening in Makele- Kele district, where government troops had  deployed in armoured vehicles to try to separate the clashing  rival militias, a military source said.    The shelling had died down Sunday morning, but there were  still bursts of fire from machine pistols in the district.    In the other areas of the capital, government forces  continued to check vehicles for arms.    Meanwhile a presidential statement said an officer guarding  President Pascal Lissouba was kidnapped on Saturday by "the  private militia" of opposition leader Bernard Kolelas but it  gave no details of the abduction. The statement called for  national mediator, Defence Minister Raymond Damase N'gollo, to  do everything possible to gain the release of Lieutenant  Jonathon Mabiala.</p>

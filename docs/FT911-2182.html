			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Military junta deposed in Lesotho Maj Gen Justinus Lekhanya, the military ruler of the tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho, was deposed in a military coup yesterday, Julian Ozanne reports from Nairobi. A morning radio broadcast announced that he and Col Michael Tsotetsi, another member of the military junta, were under arrest. Later Gen Lekhanya, who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1986, resigned on the radio saying it had been made clear to him that he was no longer serving the interests of the country. Soldiers of the Support Company of the Royal Lesotho Defence Force, who led the coup, were said to be dissatisfied with recent pay awards.</p>

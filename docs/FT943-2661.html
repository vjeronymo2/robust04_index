			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / FT Guide for the Serious Investor (9): Keep an ear to the boardroom door - Directors' dealings / A look at the legal way of getting what amounts to an inside tip from those in the know - the people who run the company Fuzzy thinking and compromise are the enemy of successful investment. You should either take a hands-on approach or leave it to someone else. But inevitably people search for foolproof systems which allow them to make successful investment decisions without putting in much preliminary work. Some of these are based on yield, such as the Investors Chronicle High Yield System and the O'Higgins system. The former picks the highest yielding shares which satisfy certain other criteria designed to prevent you from backing out and out losers. The latter is based on high yield shares with low share prices. Other systems rely on technical analysis: studying past price patterns in order to predict future price movements. One investment system which often appeals to stock market newcomers is tracking directors' share dealings. There is something irresistibly appealing about the idea of getting what amounts to an inside tip from those in the know - the people who run the company. In the United States, publications tracking share dealings by company directors are common; and they have caught on in this country during the past 10 years. All companies have to report all dealings by directors to the Stock Exchange within five working days. These deals are then made available to the screen-based information services, and published. The Financial Times regularly gives details of all the latest directors' dealings in its Weekend section. The difference between insider dealing, which is illegal, and ordinary sharedealing by directors, which is quite acceptable, is puzzling to many people. Essentially, inside information about a company is knowledge of facts which would be likely to influence its share price if generally known. A person becomes an insider if he obtains this information by virtue of his job: for example, if he works for the company or its auditors or bankers, or if he gets his information from someone whom he knows to be an insider. Insider dealing occurs when an insider takes advantage of this privileged information to buy or sell shares. Directors' deals which fall into this category are as illegal as any others. And the stock exchange has tried to help honest directors to avoid falling into this trap by setting out some guidelines. The catch-all rule is that directors may not deal when in possession of 'unpublished price-sensitive information'. Imminent bids are the classic example, but buying shortly before your company landed an important order would be equally objectionable. And since company results often influence the price of its shares, directors are banned from dealing for two months before the results are due to be announced. The trouble, of course, is that it is not really possible to draw a firm line between insider dealing by directors and their other dealings. They are a continuum. Directors are always - one hopes - more informed about the affairs of their companies than most outsiders. So even their acceptable dealings have an inside flavour to them. Investors who follow directors' sharedealings are relying on this fact. And what they are looking for are those dealings which rely heavily on the director's knowledge of the company's affairs. Selectivity is crucial. Share purchases are generally more significant than sales. Nobody buys shares if he thinks they are likely to go down in the near future, but there are many reasons why a director might need to sell shares - divorce, school fees or a new yacht, for example. But some of the most significant deals are sales. Directus, a firm which sells information on published dealings to both professional and private investors, and also supplies the lists published in the FT, has these suggestions for its customers: look for purchases which are meaningful in relation to existing shareholdings. As a rule of thumb, transactions involving more than 10 per cent of a director's total holding are worth examining. When several directors deal together, it is usually a worthwhile indicator. But beware of new directors buying the shares they need to qualify for their boardroom seats. Substantial sales at the top of the market, followed by small purchases later, can be misleading. The sales are usually more worth following than the subsequent purchases. Be particularly wary if a single director appears to be buying when the whole of the market is selling. He may be trying to support the price. If directors fail to take up their rights issue entitlements, it hardly suggests confidence in the company's future. It is probably sensible to follow their example. Look hard at any dealings shortly before the close season ahead of the company's results. It is directors' last chance to take advantage of their inside knowledge without being classified as insiders. Look out for companies where individual directors have a record of timing their dealing well. Such men are worth following. You can probably add to this list for yourself. For example, beware of buying a new issue where all the money raised is going to its directors rather than to the business. It is also worth finding out as much about the company as you can, when weighing up the significance of the deals. It is usually more significant when a dominant entrepreneurial founder/director buys or sells. And in such cases it often pays to ignore his explanations. For example, when Alan Sugar sold Pounds 35m of Amstrad shares in March 1991 (and three of his co-directors also sold), he said that he needed the money for some property investments. But within four months, the shares had lost half their value. When Hollinger, a company controlled by Telegraph chairman Conrad Black, sold Pounds 73m of Telegraph shares in May this year, the newspaper's management had not yet decided to cut its price in its battle against the Times. But Telegraph shareholders who followed Hollinger must have blessed themselves as the share price plunged more than by 40 per cent once the newspaper price cut was announced.</p>

			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Speyhawk sees no reason for share price increase SPEYHAWK, the property company with liabilities which exceed its assets by Pounds 70m, yesterday stated that it saw no justification for the increase in its share price. The shares closed yesterday at 18 3/4 p, up from 17p. This compares with a low of 2 1/2 p at the start of last month, when the company announced a Pounds 216m annual loss and restructuring talks with its banks concerning more than Pounds 300m of debt. When it announced the result, it said that 'the lead banks have agreed in principle to proposals for a restructuring covering Speyhawk's entire bank debt . . . the principles of which are at an advanced stage of negotiation'. Speyhawk said yesterday its position was unchanged. One analyst ascribed the share price surge to speculators who were unaware of the gravity of the company's financial state.</p>

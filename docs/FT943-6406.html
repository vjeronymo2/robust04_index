			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Hospitality hire scheme floated for new royal yacht The royal family will only have a new yacht to replace Britannia if big companies are prepared to use it for corporate entertaining, according to a joint letter from the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign Office, which has been leaked to the Financial Times. The letter, from Mr Ray Mingay, director-general of export promotion at the DTI, asks the chairmen of big companies whether they would rent a new yacht for 'promoting your products to potential buyers, receiving potential foreign buyers and signing ceremonies for prestigious contracts'. An almost identical letter from another official also explicitly lists 'entertaining foreign business partners and potential partners' as a use. Mr Mingay continues: 'The president of the Board of Trade (Mr Michael Heseltine) has asked that assessment of potential demand for a replacement yacht be kept discreet and be completed quickly.' Replies are requested by mid-September. The private sector can currently use Britannia during 'sea days', when the boat is used as part of government-sponsored export initiatives. But the letter says any replacement would be run on far more stringent commercial lines. Sent on the instructions of Mr Heseltine, it says 'the charge for hiring the yacht would be required to recoup a proportion of the running costs'. The letter estimates these running costs at Pounds 5m a year. Companies would pay less if the boat were moored in the Pool of London than if they hired it for a 'sailing event' or for sending it to 'an overseas moored event'. The government is currently deciding whether to spend an estimated Pounds 60m on buying a new yacht to replace Britannia, which is due to be decommissioned in 1997. Though the DTI and the Foreign Office want the government to make the investment, they are meeting stiff opposition from the Treasury. Access to the new yacht would be restricted to 'prestigious companies', so that its 'exclusivity' would be preserved. The chief executive of one company said: 'I think its a marvellous idea. The royal yacht would be the glitziest corporate hospitality venue in the world.' However, companies contacted by the Financial Times said they could not predict what their corporate entertaining needs would be in a few years. 'Although Michael Heseltine is not asking for a firm commitment, it is quite difficult to give even an indication of how much we might use it,' said one chairman.</p>

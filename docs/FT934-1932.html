			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Greater wealth of nations Conclusion of the Uruguay Round is truly a triumph in adversity. Securing agreement among so many countries on such a complex raft of trade agreements frequently seemed an insuperable challenge in the past seven years. To have done it at a time of sluggish growth, political uncertainty and protectionist pressures is an extraordinary achievement. Whatever the shortcomings of the result, the original vision of a broad expansion of international trade law is now much closer to fulfilment. More remarkably still, so is the dream that drove the founding fathers of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade: that of a liberal, rules-based international trading system overseen by an authoritative world trade organisation. Just as the Gatt helped foster economic integration and growth in the postwar decades, the new agreement should provide powerful underpinning for the world economy, fresh impetus to competition, and fresh hope for those developing and former communist countries that have been opening up to international commerce. Several individuals deserve credit. Mr Peter Sutherland and before him Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt directors-general, worked tirelessly to cajole recalcitrants - especially the US and EU - into settling differences. Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, has dispelled the most serious doubts about his and the administration's commitment to multilateral free trade. Sir Leon Brittan, the European trade commissioner, played a difficult hand with consummate skill and, by luring France into the fold, arguably saved the Union from a political crisis of alarming proportions. Reduced danger The importance of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round is essentially threefold. First, as well as containing substantial tariff cuts, it promises to bring large areas of trade that have up to now been 'outside the law' - above all in farm produce, services and textiles - within Gatt disciplines. Inclusion of farm trade, though incomplete, will reduce the danger of international conflict over dumping of subsidised surpluses, reinforce market-based agricultural reforms that are gradually being introduced in the developed world, and give developing countries a better chance of exploiting their comparative advantage as food producers. The accord on services - though also not as far-reaching as hoped - begins the extension of rules to the fastest-growing sector of world trade, and in theory could generate gains as great as those stimulated by the establishment of multilateral disciplines for manufactures more than 40 years ago. In textiles, gradual phasing out of the protectionist Multifibre Arrangement will eventually allow greater international competition and force overdue restructuring of textile industries in the developed world. Tougher protection Second, the agreement will deliver tougher protection for intellectual property rights, a source of increasing conflict between developed and developing countries. Third, it provides for a significant elaboration of rules designed to ensure that trade is fair as well as free. It promises greater clarity concerning when and for how long countries will be permitted to resort to 'safeguard' measures against imports, to impose anti-dumping duties and to subsidise domestic industries. While this does not go as far as intended in the previous draft Final Act of December 1991, the overall aim has not in the end been fatally compromised. All this is not to say that a brave new world of perfectly liberal trade is at hand. Significant uncertainties remain concerning the trade policies of the biggest players, the US and EU, with the former reaching all too readily for unilateral instruments of 'managed trade' and the latter increasingly following suit. At least one large, and rapidly growing, trading power - China - remains outside the multilateral framework. Moreover, yesterday's accord does not touch on emerging trade issues, from competition policy to the environment, which will offer ample potential for conflict in future. These matters will deserve urgent attention as soon as the ink from the Uruguay Round is dry. Before that, however, the signatories should celebrate a victory for the international rule of law, and concentrate on getting the accord ratified and implemented.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: N Brown improves 19% amid expanding customer base More buyers and greater spending per head helped N Brown Group, the Manchester-based direct mail order group, announce a 19 per cent increase in first-half profits. In the 26 weeks to August 27, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 10.8m (Pounds 9.02m) on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 98.4m (Pounds 86.2m). Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said that of a total database of about 8m people some 1.2m were buyers in the six months, 8 per cent up on last time. Those 1.2m were spending 6 per cent more. The database lists about 200 attributes on each customer. Sir David Alliance, the chairman whose family holds 58 per cent of the company, said that, although N Brown had been pipped to the acquisition of Country Holidays, a direct seller of country cottage holidays, the company had 'no real need to buy'. It was also 'watching developments' on the TV shopping front, although Sir David reckoned it would not be important this decade. N Brown recently received the results of a two-year project undertaken by the University of Manchester to ascertain the changing shape of women. Among the conclusions of the survey, which took 30,000 measurements from more than 700 women, were that they had grown bigger and wider, and had figures more conical than hour-glass shaped. Mr Martin said that this information was being fed into Brown's catalogues and he hoped it would reduce the number of items returned. Home shopping operating profits rose 15 per cent to Pounds 11.9m on turnover up 15 per cent to Pounds 95.2m. Within that, the core catalogues for the mature woman accounted for 84 per cent and lifted sales by 10 per cent. However, Fashion World and Candid, for younger women, had sales growth of 31 per cent. This represented 14 per cent of divisional turnover. Greater efficiencies offset the Pounds 1m launch costs of Classic Combination, which accounted for 2.3 per cent of turnover and lost just Pounds 200,000. It should move into the black next year. Earnings rose to 4.97p (4.15p) per share and the interim dividend is raised 20 per cent to 1.35p (1.125p). The shares fell 4p to 240p. With the City looking for Pounds 26.5m pre-tax for the full year, they are trading on a multiple of 19.5.</p>

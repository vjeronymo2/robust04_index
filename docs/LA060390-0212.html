			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> SOPHOMORE KEEPS HIS COOL IN PROVIDING MARINA'S RELIEF  </P> <P> Robin Lindsey usually speaks his mind to his teammates, but the Marina High  School catcher had to bite his tongue in the fourth inning Saturday night at  Anaheim Stadium.  </P> <P> Lindsey had to show some self-control when dealing with sophomore Sean Connors,  who pitched 3 1/3 innings of scoreless relief in the Vikings' 6-4 victory over  Diamond Bar in the Southern Section 5-A championship game.  </P> <P> "I was scared about what I could say to Connors," Lindsey said. "He's a young  kid and he takes things hard. I'm a pretty verbal guy and sometimes that's bad  for someone."  </P> <P> Not for Connors, who relieved starter Sean Patterson with two out in the fourth  inning. Connors allowed only one runner past second base, had two strikeouts  and a couple walks to improve to 3-3.  </P> <P> "I was really anxious to get out there and pitch," Connors said. "After the  game I couldn't believe it. We won the 5-A championship.  </P> <P> "Robin helped me a lot. He kept telling me I could get my fastball over the  plate and I could do it."  </P> <P> Marina Coach Paul Renfrow said he never second-guessed his decision to use  Connors, though the sophomore hadn't pitched since the Vikings' 4-2 victory  over Hacienda Heights Wilson in the first round.  </P> <P> "I'm sure (Diamond Bar) prepared for Patterson all the way," Renfrow said.  "We're fortunate we had a kid the caliber of Connors to put in there."  </P> <P> Connors made the most of his few opportunities to pitch this season. He spent  most of the year in the bullpen, reliving seniors Dave Schultz and Patterson.  </P> <P> "Connors is a team kid and he knows we win with seniors and we don't cheat them  out of a chance to play," Renfrow said. "That's why we went with Patterson  today. I could have (started) Connors."  </P> <P> Instead, the lanky left-hander started the day in the dugout. He said he wasn't  surprised when Renfrow called on him.  </P> <P> "He had a lot of confidence in me," Connors said. "We were in real trouble and  I was ready."  </P> <P> Diamond Bar had runners on first and second with two out when Connors entered  the game. He got slugger Jeff Turley, who hit a two-run home run the previous  inning, to fly to center field to end the threat.  </P> <P> "I was throwing my fastball all the way," Connors said. "My curve wasn't  working at all."  </P> <P> Lindsey said Connors ignored the pressure.  </P> <P> "The kid has a heart the size of Texas," said Lindsey, whose two-run single in  the seventh gave the Vikings the victory. "He went out there and did what he  had to. I kept those guys off balance with his fastball."  </P></p>

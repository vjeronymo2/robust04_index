			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriy Vyzhutovich article: "Central Electoral Commission </F> Turning Into Political Department. This Is the Opinion of  Experts With Whom Commission Chairman Nikolay Ryabov Resolutely  Disagrees"]    [Text] The Experts: "The Elections to the Federal  Assembly Were Falsified"    Having analyzed the official data of the Central Electoral  Commission [CEC] and a number of district electoral commissions  in accordance with its own statistical methods, a special expert  group to study the results of elections and referendums under  the President's Administration reached this conclusion: The  elections to the Federal Assembly were falsified.    In the experts' estimation, approximately 3.5 million votes  were falsified at the level of precinct commissions, and  approximately 5.7 million at the level of district commissions.    The experts classified the forgeries in three types.    "Classic" falsifications at the level of electoral  precincts: Casting of additional voting papers, administrative  coercion of voters to vote for a particular candidate or for a  particular list of candidates.    In the opinion of Aleksandr Sobyanin, leader of the expert  group, the scale of such falsifications amounted to  approximately 1.8 million voting papers in favor of the  Communist Party of the Russian Federation (and against the draft  Constitution) and approximately 1.7 million for the Agrarian  Party's candidates (and also against the draft Fundamental Law).    Falsifications of a "new type" at the level of district  electoral commissions and working groups of regional  administrations: Artificial overstating of the voter turnout,  ascribing of an additional number of votes to particular  candidates or lists of candidates.    Falsifications of this kind used to be virtually ruled out  by  the existence of an intermediate link -- rayon, city, and  rayon-within-city electoral commissions, whose data were subject  to mandatory publication in the local press. The abolition of  this link, recorded in the president's Statute on Elections,  gave the apparatus of district commissions and local  administrations the totally unconstrained freedom to "edit"  reports from the precincts according to their own political  taste. For example, LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]  Member Sokolov won in the single-seat District No. 113 in  Troitsk, Moscow Oblast, where the scientific intelligentsia  predominates. Instead of Shabad, who was running there for  "Russia's Choice." In a check initiated by the democratic  parties' activists, it was discovered that the LDPR and  "Russia's Choice" had changed places in the final table:  Somebody had swapped over the lines. Well, they might have  made a mistake, for this does happen. But similar "slips" with  target hits were also discovered in five out of six precincts  checked in Tula Oblast and in Moscow Oblast's Podolskiy,  Shchelkovskiy, and Orekhovo-Zuyevskiy Districts. Every mistake  was in favor of the Communists, Agrarians, Zhirinovskiyites....  As though living up to their name, the electoral commissions  made very selective mistakes.    The experts believe that the LDPR received up to 6 million  "extra" votes as a result of write-ups and the transposition of  columns in the final returns, "Women of Russia" received  approximately 1 million, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord  approximately 0.5 million, and "Yabloko" roughly 0.2 million.  At the same time "Russia's Choice" was approximately 2 million  votes short as a result of transpositions of columns and the  categorization of some of the voting papers cast for it as  invalid.    Mistakes and erasures in the summing up of the data  of district and precinct electoral commissions by the CEC.    The experts believe that such things were practised in the  elections of Duma deputies for the federal district and in the  vote on the draft Constitution. Otherwise why does the number  of voters in a particular region in the CEC's final tables  differ from the district commissions' data? In Krasnodar Kray,  for example, this discrepancy amounted to 135,000 people. In  Amur and Penza Oblasts an almost 100-percent voter turnout was  recorded -- unprecedented even in the times of votes for  candidates of the "inviolable bloc of Communists and nonparty  people." At the same time the unprecedented activeness of  citizens was here combined with their high literacy: There  proved to be suspiciously few spoiled voting papers.    "It need hardly be said," the experts argue, "that universal  activeness combines with universal literacy only in one instance  -- if in electoral precincts there is mass casting [dobros] of  voting papers faultlessly filled out in favor of the desired  parties and candidates. It is possible to judge which parties  and candidates were desired by the electoral commissions in  Penza Oblast rayons from the fact that there the LDPR was  supported by a 30-40-percent majority, while `Russia's Choice'  received less than 10 percent of the votes, and former  Prosecutor Ilyukhin, now a member of the Communists' faction and  chairman of the State Duma Security Committee, who was unknown  to anyone there, got through in a single-seat district."    The experts did not risk saying that all the falsifications  and forgeries were carried out deliberately. They pointed out  that a great deal happened here because of unprofessionalism and  the CEC's arrogant overestimation of its own technical  potential: "An example of such conduct is provided by the CEC's  decision itself to sum up the voting results on party lists in  Russia's 95,000 electoral precincts and by the subsequent muddle  connected with the huge volume of data being processed and with  the existence of a large number of returns lost on the way and  filled out with serious mistakes. The CEC should have at least  doubled its staff in order to make more precise the data of many  thousands of precinct returns filled out with mistakes."    But the following appears the most sensational discovery by  Aleksandr Sobyanin and his colleagues: "In all, according to  our estimates, 49 million of the 106.2 million registered voters  actually participated in the 12 December vote, or 46.1 percent  (instead of 58.2 million voters, or 54.8 percent according to  the official data)."    These figures are political dynamite. For, if just 46.1  percent of the electorate participated in the vote, then  the Constitution was not adopted. It turns out that  the reconstructed state edifice has no foundations. The  activities of the president and the government, of the Duma and  the Federation Council, the edicts, directives, and decrees  adopted since December -- all are to be deemed invalid!    Even given the present insuperable Russian craving for  everything absurd, however, people will hardly be found who are  willing to restore the pre-December status quo. The  intransigent opposition? It is less inclined than anyone toward  a revision of the referendum results, which would promise (if  everything is deemed invalid, the amnesty too) Rutskoy, Anpilov,  or Konstantinov a festive return to Lefortovo. At least, not  one electoral bloc and not one political party has yet attempted  to dispute the CEC's official data.    But the experts continue to dispute them. They borrowed  their research methods from the Italian sociologist Vilfredo  Pareto. The famous Italian discovered mathematical correlations  which make it possible to establish natural laws in the  distribution of the number of residents in cities depending on  their ordinal number on the list, the number of beasts of prey  depending on their weight.... By using Pareto's charts with  regard to voting results, Aleksandr Sobyanin and the Krasnoyarsk  scientist Vladislav Sukhovolskiy, who helped him, discovered  glaring deviations from the normal (if the elections were  conducted honestly) trajectory.    Let the specialists judge how correct such research is and  how convincing the conclusions from it are. It will be useful  for the reader to familiarize himself also with a different  viewpoint. The fact that this viewpoint is exclusively  departmental does not, I believe, reduce the need to expound it  but, on the contrary, only increases it.    CEC Chairman: "There Are No Grounds for Doubting  the Voting Results"    Does the CEC admit the very possibility of a falsification  of  the voting results as a consequence of political design or  because of the incompetence of the commissions' members?    "I cannot say that nothing like this happened," CEC Chairman  Nikolay Ryabov answered me. "In Amur Oblast, for example, the  electoral commission split up into political groupings. A  falsication of the returns was recorded there. The case has  gone to court."    "Is this the only court case of this kind?"    "No, 19 complaints about the actions of district electoral  commissions have been examined in courts. Only five of them  have been satisfied. Six complaints were lodged at the Supreme  Court against the CEC, but just one has been satisfied. Thus,  there are no grounds for speaking of large-scale falsifications  and violations."    Nikolay Ryabov also rejected the experts' allegation about  an  almost 100-percent turnout at electoral precincts in Amur and  Penza Oblasts. According to official data, 60 percent of the  electorate voted in Amur Oblast, and 64.4 percent in Penza  Oblast.    In addition, Ryabov confirmed the high competence of CEC  apparatus staffers (although they were all evacuated to it from  the Supreme Soviet apparatus and are not professionals in  organizing and holding elections). The CEC chairman also swept  aside the experts' suspicions concerning the extraordinary  politicization of the new recruits who hold key posts in this  department (although only quite recently CEC Secretary Ivan  Galushko was an activist for the "Communists of Russia" faction,  while Vladimir Okrut, CEC head of personnel, served as chief  personnel manager in the Supreme Soviet and was one of those  persons closest to Khasbulatov).    "These people left the Supreme Soviet apparatus along with  me," Ryabov said. He too, incidentally, hastily exchanged the  post of deputy speaker for that of CEC chairman. "They made  their choice and left the White House before 4 October. They  certainly should not be suspected of disloyalty to the  president, rather the opposite...."    Answering a question about whether the experts had been  carrying out anyone's political order by accusing the CEC of  falsifications, Ryabov replied: "I do not want to think so.  They were probably motivated by scientific ardor. They were in  thrall to their own hypothesis, to prove which they scorned the  obvious facts."  <H5>  The "Adventure" and Its Consequences </H5>   Vasiliy Kazakov knowingly warned of the embarrassment that  would inevitably result from these sudden, premature elections.  Having continuously been the long-standing CEC chairman, who  until the last days of his tenure of the post entrusted the  counting of votes only to the beads of the office abacus or, in  case of special emergency, to a calculating machine, he  resolutely refused to head the new CEC, making a highly terse  assessment of the short-distance (just two months) electoral  race: "It is an adventure."    The flaws of the present electoral system, which endowed the  CEC and its local branches with unprecedented authority and  considerable powers, have a congenital origin. The Statute on  Elections to the Federal Assembly and the Basic Provisions on  Elections to Representative Organs of Power did not appear just  at any time but at the very height of the fall political clash,  when the president was looking for support wherever he might  find it. In the regions above all. The reward for this support  was the right granted to the governors independently to decide  on the election procedure in the province -- of which they are  now making inventive use by returning the party and economic  nomenklatura to power.    The parties were also rewarded -- with a reduction in the  number of signatures needed for a nomination from the 200,000  proposed by the draft's compilers to 100,000. This was why,  while not having broad mass support, the contenders in the  struggle for seats were essentially not political parties but,  rather, departmental ones -- the State Committee for  Nationalities Policy (Party of Russian Unity and Accord), the  agro-industrial complex (Agrarian Party), veterans'  organizations and the Committee in Defense of Peace ("Dignity  and Charity")....    The logical consequence of this departmental multiparty  system fostered by the elections was the emergence in the Duma  of such a faction as, let us say, "New Regional Policy," which  represents the interests of major raw material producers, and  other deputies' associations with clearly expressed lobbyist  leanings.    The electoral process -- it has already become continuous,  like steelmaking -- is now governed by CEC officials. Not by law  -- in view of its absence. But even the law "On Basic  Guarantees of the Electoral Rights of Citizens of the Russian  Federation" was prepared there, deep within the CEC. Its draft,  which went to the State Duma Legislation Committee, was  evaluated as follows by Vladimir Tumanov, a member of this  committee and an authoritative jurist: "It is a draft law not  on protection for voters' rights but on the electoral  commissions' protection from voters."  <H5>  "Ministry of Democracy" </H5>   Observers associate the CEC's concern at the increase in its  departmental weight with the figure of its chairman, above all.  It is possible to guess what kind of department, which merely  serves the political process rather than determining it, Ryabov  will now head, after his appreciable stay in the top echelon of  the Russian nomenklatura. In the Kremlin table of ranks the  post of CEC chairman takes a back seat, albeit an honorable one.  Therefore Ryabov will definitely do everything to return to  real politics. If his ambitions are not satisfied in the very  near future with an appointment to some influential post, he  will evidently endeavor to enlarge the scale of his present  post. But this can only be done by expanding the volume of the  CEC's functions and powers.    Movement in this direction has already become apparent.  Controlling the procedure, course, and, if the experts are to be  believed, even the results of elections, having budget finances  at its disposal, having branches in the province and a very  experienced and, moreover, evidently not entirely impartial  apparatus, and receiving prompt and extensive information on the  electorate's mood and on the movement of the power elites, the  CEC is gradually acquiring the features of an influential  political department. We seem to underestimate the potential  strength of this "ministry of democracy," which is able to bring  to power any politician it likes through the voting booths.</p>

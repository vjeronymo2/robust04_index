			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Rules to trap the unwary: Despatches Being away from Europe for a couple of weeks certainly helps put the old world in perspective. One of the pleasures of visiting the United States is the enjoyment of the marvellously deregulated world of work the International Monetary Fund commended so vigorously last week to west Europeans. And yet the experience of the realities of American life is one of incessant and constantly increasing regulation. Only Germany and Switzerland get near it in European terms, but then the US has often seemed to owe more to its German heritage than to the British. Look at the food, the picnics, the houses and the taste for short trousers. But maybe I am alone in finding myself in a sometimes Kafkaesque world, the world of a bombardment of instructions. I recall the shock I felt, nearly a quarter of a century ago, on boarding a Greyhound bus in California and seeing a sign which read: 'Smoking permitted unless prohibited.' Today, of course, there is no such latitude: 'If you smoke you will be shot' would be a more likely warning. Shooting is one of those areas which remains highly deregulated, requiring no licence, certificate of proficiency or permit to do it. This is probably because it involves no communication, in any real sense, between human beings. Once you enter that sphere, life consists of hazards of enormous complexity. Ordering food is merely one, the multifarious ways in which an egg can be prepared and the varieties of bread in which the contents of a sandwich might be incarcerated provide unexpected pitfalls for the stranger. Those who choose to visit 'the nation's capital', as Washington quaintly calls itself, should realise it is no use asking a taxi driver to take you to the White House. Every destination has to be noted by its address. Well, not quite its address, but the street it is on and the nearest street that crosses it. So the White House becomes 'Sixteenth and Pennsylvania'. Arrivals at Dulles international airport give an insight into the New World of communication, the need to state the obvious. As you pass from your aeroplane to the immigration hall by a curious car on stilts known as a mobile lounge and cross the runways en route, small signs say, 'Aircraft have priority'. Similarly, if you travel the wrong way down freeways, signs will shout 'Wrong way'. I imagine the purpose of such deliberate redundancy is to avoid the attentions of that caste of superior American beings who play a role that approximates to that of the communist party in the old Soviet Union: the lawyers. Their control over national life is astonishing, their contribution to national well-being minimal. A friend of mine who, as an act of charity, masterminded the sale of a medical group practice last year, received visits nearly once a week from officials proffering writs to the value of Dollars 5m. That, apparently, was normal. The purpose was to ensure any legal suits could be underway before the transfer of ownership took place. Aspects of the old Soviet Union have appeared in the state of Maryland today: homeowners have to sort their garbage into five bags. They are then flung into the same truck. (Glass, it is argued, will not break because bags that contain it land on newspapers.) The bags are then sorted by teams of poorly-paid individuals. In Newark, garbage inspectors have the right to open bags in the street to see if the garbage has been correctly sorted and to take Polaroid photographs of offending materials to provide evidence for legal action. Another Soviet-style trick is the existence of conflicting regulations to trap the unwary. A fine was highlighted last week in Dr Gridlock, a regular column providing a banquet of information in the Washington Post on local traffic problems. June Bashkin complained that she parked her car at a meter, got back within the appointed time and found Dollars 50 ticket. The meter was placed in a no parking area and subsequent inspections have shown other cars regularly plastered with tickets. Another profitable little job for the state sector. Once you rid yourself of these problems and drive on the open road, the difficulties multiply. There are, according to American friends, about 10 times as many signs on the highways as one might find in Europe. They are contradictory and of little help when seeking a small town or unusual destination. In Miami such systems have had lethal results for tourists. But then one of the paradoxes of the free and flexible market is that it can work only with a high degree of regulation. And that is how free markets can create jobs.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Around the Clock Non-Stop" </F> rubric: "State Duma Jeered At"]    [Text] Yesterday the Judicial Chamber on Information  Disputes proposed that the founders of EKSPRESS GAZETA --  KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA and the SEGODNYA group -- fire the weekly's  editor-in-chief, Aleksandr Kupriyanov. The reason for this  disgrace was a March article about all kinds of perks enjoyed by  State Duma deputies. The chamber, in the person of its  chairman, Anatoliy Vengerov, deemed this publication to be "a  jeer" at people's deputies.</p>

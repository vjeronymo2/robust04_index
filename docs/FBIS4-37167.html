			<p>BFN       The following additions complete the excerpted item  headlined "Hashemi-Rafsanjani Holds News Conference," published  in the 10 June Near East &amp; South Asia DAILY REPORT, pages  44-58:    Page 44, column one, paragraph one make processing indicator  read: [Text].    Page 45, column one, paragraph six, from end of last  sentence  make read: ...policy?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] About the privatization policy, this  policy began during the first five-year plan. It will continue  in the second plan. We are carrying out the task gradually  within the framework of the Constitution. That is, anything that  the Constitution permits to be transferred to the private  sector, will be privatized. The stock exchange has become more  active recently, in recent months. The stock exchange will open  branches in various cities and towns. The system was  computerized to speed up the work.    About foreign investment...    Page 47, column one, paragraph six, from end of last  sentence  make read: ...economic readjustment policy. If today someone  finds time to go around Iran, he will see for himself that in  each corner of Iran an industrial township has been created and  a large number of new industries are engaged in activities --  either they are being built or they have become operational.  The readjustment policy allowed us to reach this stage.  Otherwise -- we had a sum of oil money and used it to import  goods and sell them cheap to people -- the old situation would  have been repeated and nothing would have happened.    [Indian correspondent (?Sukimra)]...    Page 47, column two, paragraph two, from the end of the last  sentence make read: ...reached so far.    [RESALAT correspondent 'Abbas Tavangar] In the name of God,  the compassionate, the merciful. Is the government planning to  curtail economic growth so as to provide a greater degree of  support for the deprived, the oppressed, and the salary earners  in line with the growing inflation rate?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] There is no need to curtail economic  growth, for we have performed some tasks in the first five-year  plan which have paved the grounds for giving greater support to  the deprived and the oppressed. First, more attention is paid  to the deprived and war-stricken areas, which absorbed a large  chunk of the first plan's budget. Second, we are currently  preparing some programs to provide social welfare and national  health insurance for the entire country. The government is  currently debating these programs and you will be made aware of  these programs when they are presented to the Majles. These  programs plan to provide welfare and national insurance to  everyone whose income is below a certain rational level, or to  the unemployed. We hope to be able to solve this problem  completely by the end of the second plan, without having to  curtain economic growth.    [RESALAT correspondent] If...    Page 48, column two, paragraph two, from the end of the last  sentence make read: ...the court verdict.    [Correspondent Sa'id Hashemi] Mr. President. Please explain  the latest decisions of the Council of the Economy on prices of  services and goods. Will we have more price rises? And when  will the price rises come into effect?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] We have typically approved all that was  necessary concerning services and goods. We have apparently  nothing remaining for the future. As far as I see the  directives of the Council of the Economy every month, there is  nothing in it for the future. Whatever that was there before  has been carried out.    [Correspondent Sa'id Hashemi] This question was...  (supplying  passage omitted and correcting correspondent's first name from  "Farid" to "Sa'id")    Page 51, column two, first partial paragraph, from the end  of  the last sentence make read: ...to see this.    [Unidentified person in hall reminds Rafsanjani to answer  AFP  correspondent's second question]    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani continues] The visit by...    Page 52, column one, paragraph two, from end of last  sentence  make read: ...The Islamic instructions. That means if we apply  Islamic ideas to work, to extravagance, to justice, to obtaining  the rights of the weak from the strong. If we could do all  that, in our view, many problems that exist in many other places  would not exist in such an atmosphere; or problems which the  west is facing now because of moral issues, because of its  promiscuity. We know what sort of problems families without  breadwinners, orphaned children, widowed women and others have  there. Such things would not exist in an Islamic atmosphere.  And many other things. The philosophy cannot be applied  partially and prejudicially. It is a combination and it should  be applied as a whole.    [SALAM correspondent Nuri-Shemirani]...    Page 52, column one, paragraph four, from end of last  sentence make read: ...and so on. We determine the price of  some general goods through the guilds. The [Consumer] Protection  Organization gets together with the unions and considering an  appropriate profit for wholesalers, producers, and small  businesses, they decide on three sets of prices that must be  implemented. They ensure a fair profit and the customer can see  and choose. This has nothing against trade and throughout the  world, in countries which are more advanced in freedom of trade,  such a method is used.    We believe that...    Page 53, column one, paragraph three, from end of last  sentence make read: ...and income supplements. I believe that  that they [those receiving benefits] have a good answer to your  question. If you compare that, for instance, what they received  five years ago under the sickness benefit coverage and what they  get today then the answer to the question can be extracted.    [Fazel] Many thanks. My second question is about issuing  coupons for laborers. Could you tell us whether such payments  are given in the Second Plan as well, or not?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] During the First Plan we owed the  laborers and the government had an undertaking dating back to  the previous government which had not been paid out. And other  undertakings were added to that in the First Plan. Some of that  debt is still outstanding. We have said that the debt should be  considered in the budget every year. I think that several years  still remain for [complete payment of] that debt and it will be  paid gradually, at the same level that we are paying this year.    [Fazel] I have...    Page 53, column one, paragraph eight, from end of last  sentence make read: ...statement on that? The Egyptian  government, Mr. Husni Mubarak's government believes that Iran is  responsible for Islamic unrest in that country. Could you  express your view on those allegations.    Second question: What...    Page 54, column one, paragraph five, from end of last  sentence make read: ...would be convicted.    [Qotbi] My final question is about some apparent violations  that have taken place regarding imports during 1370-1371 --  whether through the Free Trade Zones or the normal channels.  For example some agreements which were granted in principle to  some firms or individuals for founding vehicle production  plants. They were such that a ceiling of up to 2,000 vehicles  could be imported. I would like to ask in particular [about the  fact] that more than that figure have been imported -- I mean  one of those firms imported between 10,000 to 15,000 vehicles.  Will such violations be confronted and how?    [Hashemi-Rafsanjani] If they have acted in violation they  will definitely be confronted. We have no intention of letting  any violation pass. Whenever we come to one or someone makes a  claim we get it investigated. We refer it to the relevant  courts. The system will really not make any concessions to  anyone who seeks to commit violations...

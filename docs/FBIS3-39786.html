A statement issued by the President's Office declared that  the developments in the aftermath of the Cold War in Europe and  the subject of terrorism in Turkey were discussed during the  meeting. According to the statement, Demirel remarked that  European organizations, which were established under Cold War  conditions, are facing difficulties under the new conditions.  Demirel stressed that the aggressors in Bosnia-Herzegovina and  in the Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict have remained unpunished.  Such developments cast a shadow over the credibility of these  organizations, Demirel said, adding that the recent ultimatum  issued by NATO to the Serbs is a favorable sign. Commenting on  terrorism, the president underlined the terrorists' separatist  and racist character. He said that the terrorist organization  cannot attain its goals and a struggle is being waged against  those who attack Turkey's integrity.    Vefa Tanir, acting speaker of the Turkish Grand National  Assembly, also received Lalumiere and conferred with her.  During the meeting, Lalumiere said that Turkey occupied an  extremely important place in the Council of Europe and its  attitude and moves are followed with interest. Tanir, in turn,  declared that many problems can be overcome if the eyes turned  on Turkey's moves are impartial. During the meeting, Lalumiere  presented Tanir with a medal from the Council of Europe and  Tanir reciprocated with a porcelain dish with a picture of the  Turkish parliament.    Lalumiere later held a meeting with Sayit Kemal Mimaroglu,  leader of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Turkish  group, and other members of the group.</p>

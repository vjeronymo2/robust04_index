			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Veronika Romanenkova] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 8 TASS -- The programme of the 15th  main expedition to the Mir orbital complex, started today, which  is made up of Mission Commander Viktor Afanasyev, Flight  Engineer Yuriy Usachev and Cosmonaut Researcher and Physician  Valeriy Polyakov, is going to be very intensive.    On January 10 the spacecraft is planned to be docked with  the  Mir orbital complex. For three days the crews of two  expeditions -- the 14th expedition (Vasili Tsibiliev and  Aleksandr Serebrov) and the 15th expedition -- will be working  there. On January 14 Tsibiliev and Serebrov will return to the  Earth on board the Soyuz TM-17 spacecraft. Afanasyev, Usachev  and Polyakov will work at the Mir complex for 179 days.    The fact that the crew includes a professional medic is the  characteristic feature of the expedition. He is going to set  the record of the longest stay of man in outer space and to  spend more than a year at the orbital complex (429 days).  Polyakov will work as a member of the 15th, 16th and 17th main  expeditions.    A number of medical experiments will be conducted during the  current space mission. Special attention will be devoted to the  medical and sanitary-hygienic aspects of super-long space  flights, including the future space expeditions to Mars, as well  as to methods of offsetting the negative impact of  weightlessness on human body during long flights.    During the simultaneous work of the two crews a series of  biotechnological experiments will be conducted, so that  Tsibiliev and Serebrov will be able to bring their results to  the Earth.    Afanasyev, Usachev and Polyakov will conduct some  technological experiments in the sphere of crystallography, the  study of the impact of vacuum on various materials, and to  continue astrophysical studies and the long-distance sounding of  the Earth. The work on geological anomalies will be resumed.  The study from outer space of the emergence and development of  typhoons in various parts of the world ocean is going to be very  interesting. No space walkouts are planned.    The crew will receive three cargo spacecraft, one of which  will have a ballistic capsule to be returned to the Earth.  Planned repair and maintenance work will be continued in order  to keep the Mir complex in a proper condition.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> The last few paragraphs of an article about the sentencing of former Los  Angeles Police Officer Robert Von Villas were omitted from some copies  Thursday. Von Villas was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of  parole for the contract killing of a Northridge businessman.  </P> <P> The missing part of the story quoted Von Villas as saying he believed jurors  were prejudiced against him because of information they had received outside  the courtroom, including his prior conviction for robbing a jewelry store and  attempting to murder an exotic dancer to collect on a life insurance policy.  </P> <P> It said Von Villas' attorneys attempted to question two former jurors who  invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. In denying a motion for a  new trial, Judge Darlene E. Schempp ruled that jurors who convicted Von Villas  were not influenced by that knowledge or any other information they received  outside the courtroom.  </P></p>

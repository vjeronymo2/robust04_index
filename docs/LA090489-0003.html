			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. USERS AND COLOMBIAN 'WAR'  </P> <P> University students in Colombia have taken to the streets to protest the  drug-related violence that has become endemic in their country. An article in  The Times reported that one of the banners carried by students read, "If You  Have Consumed Drugs, You Killed (Luis) Galan" (the Colombian presidential  candidate killed Aug. 18). These words are true for anyone who has ever used  illicit drugs.  </P> <P> The United States provides the monstrous market for these drugs and therefore  is directly responsible for the drug-related carnage in Colombia. Every time  one of us uses cocaine or marijuana, he or she perpetuates this virulent  market.  </P> <P> SHARON WELBY, Oceanside  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Prince's campaign builds up shape YESTERDAY'S launch of the Prince of Wales's Institute of Architecture continues the prince's campaign to improve architectural standards. The institute, which will open in October, represents a significant development in his interest, which has so far been confined mainly to speech-making. Prince Charles dropped his first bombshell on the architectural world in 1984 by attacking the entire profession at a dinner to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects for incompetence and inhumanity. Speaking at St James's Palace in London last night, he explained the need for an alternative school of architecture. He wants it to bridge the divide between the professionals who design and those who build. He said he hoped his institute would encourage 'an architecture of the heart'. He said: 'I hope it can be based on real principles.' His school would place considerable emphasis on learning craft skills, and training architects in history and fine arts as well as technology. He believes that modernist training, which has monopolised architectural schools for 50 years, has over-emphasised functional and industrial aspects of design at the expense of spiritual and human values. The prince added: 'It is in bringing together the best traditions of the past, and the diverse technological potential of the future, that I hope my institute may become a crucible in which the architecture of the 21st century can begin to be forged.' The institute has grown out of two Prince of Wales's summer schools in Oxford and Rome. Their students showed frustration with the system. The head of the institute, the base for which is planned in two Crown Estate houses designed by John Nash in Regent's Park, London, will be Dr Brian Hanson, the prince's architectural secretary for the past four years. The teaching staff includes some radical tutors representing a wide range of philosophies: Mr Christopher Alexander from the University of California; Mr Keith Critchlow from the Royal College of Art; Mr Abdel Wahed El-Wakil, a distinguished Islamic architect; and Mr Leon Krier, who is master planner for the Duchy of Cornwall's new-town development at Dorchester, Dorset. The school will begin with a one-year foundation course for 150 students. Fees have not been disclosed but are expected to be comparable with those of other institutions. Private donations have enabled this school to be launched at a time when higher education is being forced to make economies.</p>

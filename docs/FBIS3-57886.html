Mr. Boucher made this statement upon his  arrival, with other members of the diplomatic corps, at the  Presidential Palace where they were received by President  Glavkos Kliridhis on the occasion of the New Year. Mr. Boucher  also said that State Department's Coordinator Robert Lamb will  visit Cyprus, but the time has not been set.    When asked by correspondents if he had any statement to  make,  British High Commissioner David Dain confined himself to  expressing good wishes for the New Year.    Russian Ambassador to Cyprus Boris Zenkov expressed the wish  that 1994 will be the last year of Cyprus' division. Asked  whether Russia intends to appoint an observer to the Cyprus  issue, he said that his country will wait until the talks begin  and then consider how it can offer more help.</p>

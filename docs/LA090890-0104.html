			<p><P> September 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRAISE FOR L.A. FESTIVAL  </P> <P> It has been my pleasure to attend three L.A. Festival performances this week.  </P> <P> My hat is off to Sellars and the entire organization.  </P> <P> For the performances we attended, no one paid admission and the productions did  not cost the federal taxpayer a nickel.  </P> <P> My question is why has The Times' festival coverage been so negative? When an  event this important to the cultural life of the city comes off this  successfully it should be celebrated, not criticized.  </P> <P> TOM PRENDIVILLE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

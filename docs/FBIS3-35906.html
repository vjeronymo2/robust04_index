			<p>Language: <F P=105> Estonian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Petr Rozhok, Zhirinovskiy's [Russian Liberal  Democratic Party leader] representative in Estonia, has appealed  to retired Estonian servicemen to form defense units. Rozhok  said that should it occur to some Estonian official to deport a  Russian officer, the latter should look after himself first and  foremost. If -- as he puts it -- some police control official  or devil knows what kind of a representative should turn up, the  officer will simply have to kick them out of his flat by force.  In Rozhok's opinion, Estonia continues to be an ancient Russian  territory. According to him, the Uusikaupunki peace treaty [of  1721] and the 1975 Helsinki treaty have not been repealed by  anyone. For this reason the retired Russian servicemen and  reservists living in Estonia must know that they are living on  ancient Russian territory.    Rozhok also thinks that all Russians living in Estonia  should  apply for Russian citizenship so as to feel the protection and  support of the great Russia. According to Rozhok, he has been  persuading Zhirinovskiy not to insert phrases like: Let us  bring our tanks but threaten Estonia only with economic  sanctions.    Commenting in the SILLAMAE GAZETTE on the claim that it is  first and foremost Russian industrial workers who would be hit  by economic sanctions, Rozhok says that the Russians have  nothing else to lose anyway.    Speaking about Russian-speakers' organizations in Estonia,  Rozhok rates highly the activity of the Russian Citizens' Union  in Narva and its leader Yuriy Mishin, while calling the  [Russian-speakers] Representative Assembly [in Estonia], an  academy engaged in destroying Russian movements, parties, and  organizations, under the baton of the Estonian Government.</p>

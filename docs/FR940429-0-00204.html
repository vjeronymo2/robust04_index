			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A dozen commenters objected to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that institutions have written procedures or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information regarding several key aspects of the administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Title IV, HEA programs. Most of these commenters stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the proposed requirement was burdensome and would create a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lot of paperwork with no discernible benefit. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that communications processes and structures are dynamic by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature and thus subject to frequent changes. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed concern that the Secretary was trying to dictate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pattern and frequency of communications among college offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This commenter added that while development of written procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as those proposed would be good management practice, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary should not regulate such practices. Some of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters recommended that this proposed requirement be removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entirely. Other commenters recommended that the requirement be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imposed only on institutions that did not have a record of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administering the Title IV, HEA programs successfully or only on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> larger institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that institutions be able to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show compliance through their computer systems. One commenter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerned that the time required to provide detailed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> documentation would take valuable time away from the smoothly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> running delivery of aid, recommended that general delineation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities be considered sufficient. Another commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that institutions be permitted to work out the method  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and frequency of communication. One commenter asked that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary clarify how this provision relates to multi-campus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions if the proposal were retained in final regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary is not persuaded that mandating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written procedures or information covering certain aspects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA administration is an inappropriate or unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative standard. However, the Secretary appreciates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concern of commenters who perceived certain areas of the proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be unduly burdensome. The Secretary agrees that the burden to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution of having to prepare written procedures for or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written information indicating the nature and frequency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communication of pertinent information among all the offices that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have an impact on the administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs outweighs the benefit that this provision would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Secretary. The Secretary also agrees that, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance problems relevant to the listed responsibilities are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified, institutions may satisfy the requirement that an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution have written procedures for or written information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicating the responsibilities of the various offices with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to the approval, disbursement, and delivery of Title IV,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HEA program assistance and the preparation and submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports to the Secretary by a general written description of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibilities of the various offices.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The requirement that an institution has to prepare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written procedures for or written information indicating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nature and frequency of communication of pertinent information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among all the offices that have an impact on the administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Title IV, HEA programs has been removed from these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A number of commenters discussed the issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate separation of awarding and disbursing functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many of these commenters said the prohibition on having family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> members perform the two functions would be onerous, particularly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a small, family-run institution. In a similar vein, some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters noted that in a small institution the owner works and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has responsibility over all facets of the institution. At small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, it is very difficult to provide for organizational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independence. Many commenters suggested deleting the new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language that references family members and individuals that have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control over both functions and relying on the annual audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process to test for adequate internal controls.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This standard was strengthened to provide additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deterrence to collusion, which is a big problem at institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that engage in fraud and at many institutions that fail to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refunds. The strengthened language also gives the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> added, needed authority to terminate institutions that engage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Secretary understands the concern of small family-run institutions that arranging for someone outside the family to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform one or both tasks will be burdensome, the suggestion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary delete the new language and rely on the required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial and compliance audit is not realistic. At very small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, the auditor would probably conclude that there are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no internal controls because there are only two or three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employees_often the owners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary received in excess of sixty comments on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provisions that address satisfactory academic progress. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vast majority of commenters were opposed to the proposed addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of &sect;668.16(e)(3)(ii)(B), which stipulates that undergraduate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students would be expected to complete their educational programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 150% of the published length of the programs as a standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for measuring a student's satisfactory academic progress. They  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommended that the proposed new provision be removed. A few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters argued that implementation of the provision would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an infringement of the academic freedom of institutions. Many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> others asserted that requiring this level of detail in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's satisfactory academic progress standards is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unwarranted, because it interferes with institutions' academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, and argued that the proposed new requirement bears no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discernible relationship to administrative capability standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters opposed the inclusion of any satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic progress requirements in the standards for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative capability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters were opposed to the proposed new criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> governing the maximum time frame because they believed that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not take into consideration the academic career patterns of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nontraditional students who work and have varying hours, attend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part-time, or need remedial academic help, often interspersing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developmental courses with courses taken for credit. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter contended that this provision would discriminate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against students who change majors or eligible programs. Some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters argued that implementation of the proposed provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would result in the cut-off of Title IV, HEA program funds to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students in these categories even though the students may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious and highly motivated. Thus, students who would otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to complete an eligible program would be denied that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity because they could continue with their education only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if they received Title IV, HEA program assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters recommended that students be permitted to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal this provision on a case-by-case basis. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concurred with the provision as written and stated the standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is part of the current policy of the commenter's institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the required increments of time for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishment of a maximum time frame in which the student must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete his or her educational program do not work for a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such as court reporting, where the time it takes students to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete a given amount of work may vary from 3 to 12 months.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because students are required by Title IV of the HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to maintain satisfactory progress to receive Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program assistance, it is only logical that an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to administer Title IV, HEA programs must be judged, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, on the existence and implementation of an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactory progress policy. The proposed addition is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codification of longstanding policy and is consistent with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the Student-Right-to-Know Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

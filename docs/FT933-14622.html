			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt bourse sets a new three-year high INSTITUTIONAL enthusiasm for German equities, and the interlinked strength of the US dollar gave bourses a reasonably good day, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT extended its official session to make up for early technical problems, and ended the official session close to its best. The DAX index closed another 20.76 higher at 1,818.17, its highest for nearly three years. German turnover fell back to DM10.6bn after Friday's DM14.3bn. Mr Nigel Longley of Commerzbank in Frankfurt credited G7 tariff cuts, and apparent agreement about the prospect for further interest rate cuts between the Chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, and the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, for the changing tide of US, French and domestic investment opinion about German equities. 'A couple of weeks ago,' he said, 'everybody had decided what to buy in Germany - once the market had consolidated between 1,650 and 1,680. It did not consolidate,' he added, 'and it impressed a lot of people that German institutions were buying strongly in the latest rally'. The institutions were apparent yesterday when share price rises were mixed in scale but the market leaders, Daimler, Siemens and Deutsche Bank, rose by DM16 to DM666, DM12.20 to DM655.50, and DM9 to DM734.50 respectively. A number of the big blue chips, including the Bavarian mortgage banks, and BMW and Hoechst, did relatively little; and Volkswagen actually fell DM1.80 to DM371.80 on news that papers had been found in connection with allegations of industrial espionage against VW by the General Motors subsidiary, Adam Opel. VW was as much as DM9.50 lower on the Ibis market where, after hours, profit-taking took the indicated DAX to 1,806 before it closed at 1,808.81. PARIS took little inspiration from domestic news, either the slightly better than expected June inflation data or the three times oversubscription for the 'Balladur' bond. In spite of continuing pressure on the franc in the currency markets the CAC-40 index moved up 6.52 to 1,992.22. Roussel-Uclaf eased FFr17 to FFr558 as the stock was requoted following the sale by Rhone Poulenc, up FFr3.30 to FFr149.00, of its 35 per cent stake which was priced at FFr563 per share. Accor gained FFr19 to FFr642 on news that an Australian group planned to purchase its hotel interests in the Asia-Pacific region. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index gained another 0.6 points to 117.3 with strong overseas interest seen in DSM. The chemicals group put on Fl 4.20 to Fl 99.30 as it benefited from recent interest in cyclicals. The shares have risen by more than 46 per cent since they hit an all time low in March. MILAN remained subdued ahead of today's expiry of options contracts, while investors were also awaiting details of the government's budget proposals which are expected later this week. The Comit index closed up 1.76 at 546.00. Many of the budget details have already leaked out in the domestic media. According to NatWest Securities in London, the proposals are expected to bring further spending cuts, rather than new taxes. Fiat gained L77 to L6,482 at the fix, before easing back to L6,435 on the kerb as profits were taken. There have been repeated rumours that the Italian group might be considering a strategic alliance with Peugeot. Ferruzzi fell L46.10 to L416.70: an executive of a subsidiary was arrested at the weekend in connection with the wide-ranging investigation into bribery. BRUSSELS outpaced most bourses as foreign buying took the Bel-20 index up 16.77, or 1.3 per cent to 1,318.33 in high turnover of BFr1.2bn. Ms Alison Kirk at Williams de Broe said that the share price gains were broadly based, reflecting the potential effect of German interest rates, and a rising dollar on the Belgian corporate economy. STOCKHOLM closed at a new high for the year, mainly in reaction to the strength of the dollar. The Affarsvarlden general index gained 12.40 or 1.1 per cent to 1,127.60 as turnover dropped to SKr755m from Friday's SKr871m. Ericsson B shares, the day's most active issue, rose to an all time high with a gain of SKr4 to SKr352. The building and construction sector rose by 4 per cent on hopes of economic recovery, with Skanska up SKr7 to SKr125. VIENNA's ATX index ended 8.36 higher at 876.75, but the move did not reflect the market's real gains as four stocks went ex dividend, including the miner, Veitscher, which rose Sch10, ex a Sch6 dividend, to Sch272 and the builder, Universale, which fell Sch5 to Sch935, ex Sch20. ISTANBUL recovered some of last week's losses, although most investors remained nervous in spite of an indication from the government that tougher action would be taken against the Kurdistan Workers Party, which is seeking a separate homeland in south east Turkey. The composite index gained 462.9 or 4.5 per cent to 10,745.0 in turnover down to TL554bn from Friday's TL839.5bn.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices July 12 THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1230.06  1230.66   1231.42  1231.83 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1274.12  1276.51   1276.53  1276.52                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1234.54  1234.69   1233.56  1232.90 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1278.67  1277.56   1275.62  1274.63  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Jul 9     Jul 8     Jul 7     Jul 6     Jul 5 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1230.56   1225.73   1211.33   1203.04   1197.01 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1274.12   1270.80   1260.04   1257.80   1253.51  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1235.95; 200 - 1280.47 Low/day: 100 - 1229.80 200 - 1273.57.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] During meetings with several Western ambassadors at  the PLO headquarters in the Tunisian capital, brother leader  President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] stressed the need to ensure  international protection for the Palestinians of the occupied  territories. He underscored the role Europe can play to ensure  this protection. These remarks were made in the aftermath of  the martyrdom of six Fatah heroes in the Jabalyah camp the day  before yesterday, Monday, at the hands of the terrorist  undercover units affiliated with the Israeli Army.    Brother President Abu-'Ammar also underlined the need to  implement UN Security Council Resolution 904, which provides for  international protection for the Palestinian people. He held  the United States and Russia, cosponsors of the peace process,  responsible for providing this protection.    Brother leader President Abu-'Ammar described the  assassination of the six Fatah heroes in the Jabalyah camp as a  new massacre. He added: In this regard, the first possibility  that comes to mind is that Rabin might have been well aware of  the plans to commit these massacres. He might have chosen to  condone them. The second possibility is that these massacres  were committed by Israeli Army units without Rabin's prior  knowledge. One can derive no comfort from either possibility.  This has grave repercussions on the entire peace process, he  maintained.</p>

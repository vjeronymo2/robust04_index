			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Royal Insurance back in the black at Pounds 143m Royal Insurance, one of the UK's largest composite insurers, is back in the black after three years of heavy losses. The company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 143m, against a deficit of Pounds 27m last year and losses of nearly Pounds 600m since 1990. A final dividend of 7.5p is proposed, compared with 5p in 1992 and a forecast of 6.5p at the time of the rights issue last year. Like Commercial Union and Guardian Royal Exchange, Royal's turnround hinged on a marked improvement in trading conditions in the UK. UK underwriting losses were reduced from Pounds 259m to Pounds 15m, with most lines of business underwritten profitably. Mr Richard Gamble, chief executive, singled out a particularly good performance by The Insurance Service, the Bristol-based telephone motor insurer, which increased its sales by 15 per cent, made profits of Pounds 5m and now has 370,000 motor policyholders. Royal increased its UK premium income to Pounds 1.62bn (Pounds 1.55bn), but shed some market share in home and private motor insurance, where income fell to Pounds 605m (Pounds 615m) and Pounds 231m (Pounds 239m) respectively. Profits in Canada fell slightly from Pounds 23m to Pounds 21m. The US also showed a decline, from Pounds 24m to Pounds 15m, while other territories edged ahead to Pounds 40m (Pounds 38m). Reserves to meet potential claims stemming from US pollution were increased by Dollars 37m to Dollars 248m (Pounds 170m). Higher than expected losses of Pounds 87m at Royal Re, where claims continued to mount on business underwritten in earlier years, were despite the subsidiary's withdrawal from most markets. Losses of Pounds 16m (Pounds 33m) by Royal's estate agency subsidiary also marred the picture. Life assurance profits rose to Pounds 31m (Pounds 29m). Overall last year, premium income at Royal's general insurance subsidiary rose to Pounds 4.04bn (Pounds 3.75bn). Underwriting losses fell to Pounds 371m (Pounds 588m). Investment income increased to Pounds 521m (Pounds 486m), and income from associated undertakings rose to Pounds 27m (Pounds 21m). COMMENT On several counts the immediate future for Royal looks rosy. Mortgage indemnity and reinsurance losses should fall further this year. Much of Royal's exposure to the personal motor market, where rates could begin to soften, is through its very competitive direct telephone-based insurance subsidiary. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 290m for 1994 appear well within the company's grasp, giving a prospective multiple of only 7. Investors will have been encouraged by the rate of yesterday's dividend increase. A pay-out of 10p next year puts the shares on a prospective yield of 4.4, reducing the gap with higher yielding rivals. The main question mark concerns Royal's well-known exposure to potentially substantial US pollution claims. The company says its reserves are adequate. If you accept that, it becomes difficult to justify the sizeable discount to net asset value and the shares look cheap.</p>

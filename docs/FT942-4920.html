			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil prices ease back as demand begins to slacken Oil prices weakened yesterday amid signs that demand from refiners was beginning to ease after a period of strong buying in preparation for the summer holiday season in the US. The price of light crude futures in New York fell below the pyschologically important Dollars 18 per barrel level. That helped to undermine the price of the benchmark Brent Blend, which was quoted at around Dollars 16.25 a barrel in late London trading, down from its close last Friday of Dollars 16.37. Earlier the International Energy Agency left unchanged its demand forecasts for the remainder of the year. It was the first time in recent months that it has not revised the forecasts upwards due to strong demand in the US. But the forecast for full year demand in the industrialised countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development of 39.7m barrels a day remains well above the 39.1m b/d recorded last year, the IEA said. In its latest monthly oil market report the Paris-based IEA also reported that refining margins in the OECD countries were being eroded as '. . . average product prices rose less strongly than crude prices' in April and May.</p>

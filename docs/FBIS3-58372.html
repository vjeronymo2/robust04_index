			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The withdrawal of the German UN  contingent in Somalia will begin in early February via a  combined land, air, and sea transport operation, German Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe told the Bundestag Defense Committee in  Bonn today. Personnel as well as sensitive equipment unsuitable  for maritime shipment will be transported back to Germany by  air. Seven ships are envisaged to bring back the bulk of the  materiel.    During the withdrawal, the troops will make use of a  stopover  point halfway between Mogadishu and the German base at  Beledweyne, as well as organize air and sea transshipment in the  Somali capital. The last ship is due to leave Mogadishu on 19  March. [passage omitted]</p>

In a special  interview with YEDI'OT AHARONOT, Rabin says: "I am willing to  discuss with the PLO any interpretation of the Declaration of  Principles [DOP]. I will not enter a debate on any  interpretation of the agreement.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Have the negotiations encountered a  crisis?    [Rabin] In Cairo, they seemed to agree on a paper, which  required the approval of Tunis and Jerusalem. We regard that  paper as an agreed-on joint paper, and not as PLO people are  trying to present it -- as Israeli proposals. The paper  addresses Israel's responsibility for external security. It  speaks -- as we did in the DOP -- of coordination on the issue  of border crossings. For me, the main things in the crossings  issue are: a security check of people; the inspection of VIP's  and luggage; and the prevention of a mass influx into the  territories of Palestinians who are not from the territories.    Right now, in view of what happened in Cairo, it seems that  some PLO people view the paper as Israeli proposals. Meanwhile,  Major General Shahaq and Nabil Sha'th sat down and attempted to  put down in writing some of the agreements reached in Cairo. On  Thursday [30 December], Sha'th sent us from Cairo a fax with his  own formulation. I have not had a chance to study it yet, and I  am not even certain that Sha'th's fax had the approval of Tunis.  I believe that had the meeting between President Mubarak and  'Arafat concluded in accord, Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa  would have arrived here by now. There was talk about that.    I have made up my mind: As long as there is no Tunis  approval for the paper which we view as an agreement, there will  be no Jerusalem approval. Otherwise this paper will become the  start of future negotiations. Unless there is approval from  Tunis, everything we said in that paper will be open to revision.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] In that case, what is your next move?    [Rabin] The starting point is the two sides' commitment to  the DOP. It has not changed. Both sides have a vested interest  in adhering to it. Therefore, we will pursue the dialogue.  There will be difficulties. I do not propose to wait with a  stopwatch. Either in terms of days or weeks. Personally I  think the Palestinians should have the same interest in the  agreement as we do. Perhaps even greater. Israel can tolerate  the current reality. We are in control of the territories.    What we have here is perhaps a Middle Eastern bazaar.  Therefore, patience is needed. We will not give up on the  vital things: responsibility for external security, coordination  and partnership in border crossings, everything connected with  settlement security, and Israelis' safety on roads. And on the  other hand, we are prepared to let the Palestinians run their  own lives.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Haven't the negotiations with the PLO  been your worst nightmares about that organization come true?  Their inability to decide, their disrespect for documents, the  extortion in the negotiations?    [Rabin] I knew from the start that they would not be an easy  partner. I differentiate between the two things. Basically,  the PLO has adhered to its pledge to stay away from terrorism.  PLO personnel has been involved in three acts of terror since  13 September, the most serious of which was the murder of Hayim  Mizrahi. We know it for a fact that these acts were not carried  out on orders from the PLO; in fact, they were against PLO  orders. Therefore, I differentiate between their disavowal of  terror and the Middle Eastern bazaar. I still believe that we  will eventually arrive at the implementation of the agreement,  even if it takes longer. We need patience and stamina in the  face of terror.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Do you think 'Arafat got cold feet and is  trying to shake loose of the agreement?    [Rabin] I will not engage in speculations. I do not have an  X-ray machine to test the intentions of the Palestinians, or the  Arabs, or even the Israelis. I will judge the situation by the  results and by implementation.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Would it be true to say that 'Arafat is  now personally blocking an agreement?    [Rabin] One thing is entirely clear: 'Arafat is the  dominant figure. He is the decisionmaker. Also, I suggest we  stop writing the PLO off. The PLO was written off many times in  the past, and yet nothing has happened.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Are you considering U.S. mediation?    [Rabin] Absolutely not. We do not need mediation. We made  the Oslo agreement on our own, without mediation, and to a great  extent, even without the knowledge of the Americans. The  responsibility is ours. We will find the solution. So the  Egyptians are helping a bit, but President Mubarak himself  cannot replace either the Palestinians or us. The  responsibility is ours.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] What do you expect the meeting between  President Clinton and President al-Asad to achieve?    [Rabin] We are not committed to the agreement with the PLO  only. We want to attain peace treaties with three countries:  Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. I will be glad to learn that the  al-Asad-Clinton meeting may lead to another breakthrough.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] Is Israel holding any contacts with  Syrian officials?    [Rabin] Unfortunately, there have been no meetings.    [YEDI'OT AHARONOT] In what state do you think Israel will be  in a year, on 31 December 1994?    [Rabin] We will have a crossroads year in 1994. That year  will decide whether the Middle East is headed for peace,  security, and development, or rather to a stalemate which will  eventually increase the danger of war. I think it is our duty  and the duty of our Arab partners to adopt our view of the  matter. [sentence as published] There will be no solution  without common interests.    [Tel Aviv MA'ARIV in Hebrew on 31 December also publishes a  "special" interview with Rabin on page 3. In the interview,  conducted on 30 December in an unknown location, correspondent  Hemi Shalev asks: "Do the security arrangements specified in  the document satisfy you? You speak of Israeli security checks,  yet according to the document, the checks are only  half-Israeli." Rabin replies: "The truth is that there is oral  stuff, in addition to the written one. I act on the assumption  that the oral stuff exists, in which case the security checks  are reasonable." Shalev then asks: "Does this mean that the  paper was not all there was? That there were other  understandings?" Rabin replies: "Other understandings on which  there was consent, according to reports I have received."    [Asked later whether a meeting with 'Arafat would not be  advisable, Rabin says: "In view of the experience of 12  December, when big gaps between the sides were revealed, I do  not want to hold another meeting that will reveal gaps, because  another meeting between 'Arafat and me that does not culminate  in an agreement will have a negative effect on our chances to  clinch the matter."]</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMPOSER AND MUSIC CRITIC VIRGIL THOMSON DIES AT 92  </P> <P> Virgil Thomson, the critic and composer who mixed the historical ingredients of  music into a blend of luxuriant harmonies that stood in stark contrast to the  wild experimentation of his time, died in his sleep early Saturday at his  apartment in New York's Chelsea Hotel.  </P> <P> Thomson, who as a newspaper commentator once described Jascha Heifetz's oeuvre  as "silk underwear music," was 92. He was said to have been one of the prime  reasons the world of international art accepted the modern American musical  idiom.  </P> <P> Thompson succumbed to a "long-term illness," according to his secretary,  Jeffrey Adelson.  </P> <P> Thomson, who never married, is survived by a niece, Betty Stouffer, of  Longwood, Fla. He will be buried in a family plot in Slater, Mo. A memorial  service is planned at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan on Nov.  25.  </P> <P> For 70 years, either by himself or with such literary legends as Gertrude  Stein, the cherubic sage of American music churned out a large number of  operas, ballets, symphonies and chamber works, melding into them American folk  tunes, hymns and even cowboy songs.  </P> <P> They proved permanently palatable if not outrageously popular.  </P> <P> And from 1940 to 1954 -- as he continued to compose memorable melodies -- he  also manufactured acerbic and provocative prose as the New York Herald  Tribune's music critic in a style one writer likened to "letters home to Aunt  Phyllis."  </P> <P> Some of those "letters," however, might have offended that maiden aunt's  sensibilities. Such as the time he wrote that Sibelius' Second Symphony was  "vulgar, self-indulgent and provincial beyond all description." Or the review  of "Porgy and Bess" that noted that "its faults are numberless but its  inspiration is authentic, its expressive quotient high." Or that a Vladimir  Horowitz trill was "in every way the berries."  </P> <P> His feud with Heifetz ended only with the legendary violinist's death in 1987  and reflected only a minor portion of the Thomson credo, one he had formed in  his youth and never abandoned: that the quality of the music is vastly more  important than the capabilities of the performer.  </P> <P> He also offered not just critiques of music and musicians but his feelings  about the composers themselves.  </P> <P> "Mozart," Thomson once fumed as he summed up his view of the personal failings  of the major composers of the Western world, "was not, like Wagner, a political  revolutionary. Nor was he, like Beethoven, an old fraud who just talked about  human rights and dignity but who was really an irascible, intolerant and  scheming careerist. . . . unjust toward the poor, lickspittle toward the rich,  dishonest in business, unjust and unforgiving toward the members of his family.  . . . "  </P> <P> More important to 20th-Century criticism than the postulations themselves was  the historical position of their author.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wrote About Modern Music  </P> <P> Virgil Garnett Thomson came into the critical arena when it was dominated by  men who considered anything written after 1899 unworthy of note. Thomson not  only caught the world's attention with his scathing diatribes but in his  travels wrote of such postwar composers as the German Carl Orff and the  Frenchman Pierre Boulez. The masses were reading of the music of their own time  -- and thus making of Thomson a major figure in the modern music movement.  </P> <P> By the end of his tenure at the Herald Tribune, he had established critical  credentials as impressive as those he had earned earlier for his music.  </P> <P> Probably the best known of the hundreds of works the prolific Thomson composed  were three operas: "Four Saints in Three Acts," "The Mother of Us All" and  "Lord Byron" plus, curiously enough, some film scores. One of them, "Louisiana  Story" in 1948, was awarded the only Pulitzer Prize for distinguished musical  composition ever given to a film.  </P> <P> That disparity is typical of the Thomson diversity. If his music shares a  common thread at all it is one linked to his boyhood years in Middle America.  He was born there -- in Kansas City, Mo., the son of a postal clerk who had wed  a woman whose English ancestors settled Virginia. The lure of Americana was  intrinsic.  </P> <P> He took his first piano lessons when he was 5 and by 12 was performing  professionally at churches and local concerts. Thomson was an academic prodigy  as well, and showed an early interest in composition, which he would follow at  college.  </P> <P> He attended officers school at Columbia University after enlisting in the Army  in 1917 but the Armistice prevented him seeing active service.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Studied in Paris  </P> <P> He enrolled in Europe, took classes in musical composition and writing and,  inspired by Amy Lowell's poem, "Vernal Equinox," managed his first composition,  a song. He also was a singer and toured Europe with the Harvard Glee Club. When  the others returned he remained to study with Nadia Boulanger in Paris.  </P> <P> He eventually came home, graduated from Harvard in 1923 and taught there while  writing music and articles on music for Vanity Fair.  </P> <P> When his financial situation failed to improve he told friends that if he were  to starve as a composer he "preferred to starve where the food is good." He  returned to Paris and settled on the Left Bank where he composed "Sonata da  Chiesa," a traditional piece in contrast with the dissonance prevalent in music  of the 1920s.  </P> <P> Thomson, the critic Harold C. Schonberg of the New York Times once observed,  wrote on the "white keys" in "a period when desperate dissonance was in  fashion."  </P> <P> In 1926, he was introduced to Gertrude Stein. He already had become attracted  to her experiments with language and, after meeting her, wrote a cantata based  on her "Capitals, Capitals."  </P> <P> The following year they began work on what most critics believe will be  Thomson's most enduring musical legacy: "Four Saints in Three Acts."  Essentially it was an opera of nonsense, blending humor and metaphor in what  alternately is America and 16th-Century Spain. The allegory is filled with  Stein-isms (its most famous "Pigeons in the grass alas") and its production  marked the melding of the talents of John Houseman (director), Frederick Ashton  (choreographer) and Florine Stettheimer (the immortal cellophane and glass bead  sets).  </P> <P> It was half acting and half dance as the saints erect their cathedrals in a  setting that Thomson said was "like the artistic life that we (the Bohemian  expatriates of Paris) were all living."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Performed Six Years Later  </P> <P> Finished in 1928, Thomson's haunting masterwork -- which features closer to 40  than four saints and involves four, not three, acts -- was not produced until  1934. When it was, Thomson's tuneful score juxtaposed against Stein's  avant-garde, free-spirited libretto made him an overnight sensation.  </P> <P> (The original cast was all black, creating additional tempest at a time when  blacks were used only in black-related themes and not in hymn-like and hypnotic  ventures into things theological. Blacks were used, Thomson said in a 1981  interview because of their "beauty." "Blacks sing so beautifully and they look  so beautiful.")  </P> <P> Although it is resurrected occasionally, "Four Saints," has never been staged  at the Metropolitan Opera or New York City Opera.  </P> <P> More popular, successful and more frequently performed was a second and much  later collaboration with Stein, "The Mother of Us All," an operatic paean to  Susan B. Anthony written in 1946-47. In it Thomson sprinkled American dances,  marches and hymns and folk songs in quilt-like manner. The critic Schonberg  said it "may be recognized as one of the few examples of genuine Americana on  the lyric stage."  </P> <P> Thomson spent the years after "Four Saints" in Paris, leaving only when the  Germans invaded France. Although it was a relatively bleak period in his  professional life as far as performances were concerned, with the dissonant  writers in fashion, Thomson did write music for New York shows including  "Macbeth" in 1936, in which Orson Welles directed a black Federal Theater cast.  </P> <P> After returning to the United States in 1940, he wrote some radio background  music, particularly for the CBS Workshop broadcast of "The Trojan Woman" and  then reunited with Stein for "The Mother of Us All" which has been staged more  than 3,000 times.  </P> <P> In addition to "Louisiana Story," other films Thomson scored included "The Plow  That Broke the Plains" and "The River," both with Midwestern backgrounds much  like the composer's own, "The Goddess" and "Voyage to America," actor-director  Houseman's documentary about immigrants to America.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Musical 'Portraits'  </P> <P> He also began working on his "portraits," scores of musical piano tributes of  people he admired. They ran the gamut from Picasso to Aaron Copland to Fiorello  LaGuardia.  </P> <P> He wrote a ballet -- "Filling Station" -- for Lincoln Kirstein's Ballet Caravan  in 1937, preceding Copland's scoring for such American dance pageants as "Billy  the Kid" and "Rodeo."  </P> <P> In 1972 he wrote his third opera, "Lord Byron," a tribute to George Gordon  Byron, the defiant, melancholy British poet. It was performed by the Juilliard  School in 1972 but seldom seen again.  </P> <P> Thomson's 85th birthday, in 1981, sparked a series of parties and the  publication of "A Virgil Thomson Reader," a 582-page anthology of the best of  his written criticism. The 5-foot-5 composer was saluted at parties throughout  New York and interviewed by fellow critics in the old-fashioned elegance of the  Hotel Chelsea in Manhattan where he had lived for years.  </P> <P> His 90th birthday was less frenetic but did result in more desultory interviews  in which the lifelong bachelor refused to evaluate himself or his music for  posterity. He did tell a writer for New York magazine that "it (the music)  lives its own life. But I suspect that long from now, when things have settled  down, Copland's ballets and my operas will remain."  </P> <P> As to his unique and distinctive career as both artist and critic, Thomson  observed "it takes three people to make music properly: one man to write it,  another to play it and a third to criticize it.  </P> <P> "Anything else is just a rehearsal."  </P></p>

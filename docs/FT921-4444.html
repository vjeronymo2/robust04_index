			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: MTM The recent behaviour of MTM and its advisers is a little disturbing. When the specialist chemicals company made a profits warning last week, its efforts to blame an accounting quirk rather than the recession helped limit the markdown in its shares to a mere fifth of their value. Yesterday MTM offered the more damaging opinion that, after all, there might be a significant fall in trading profits separate from any accounting matters. The market's reaction - the shares ended 42 per cent lower - was understandably severe. While last week's promise of a 10 per cent dividend increase must already be in danger, the most pressing issue is why the trading position was revealed so belatedly. It is scarcely conceivable that MTM's senior managers were unaware of difficulties, even if a serious problem only emerged during the fourth quarter. The position of Robert Fleming, MTM's main adviser, is equally awkward: if it did not know, then arguably it should have. Investors are left with the hope that there has been nothing worse than a lack of disclosure for which MTM has now paid a heavy price. They might also reflect that they were warned. When MTM was floated in 1986, sceptics noted that it was difficult to identify where stated profits came from. That reservation was subsequently overshadowed by a sextupling of its market capitalisation to Pounds 250m, masterminded by the go-ahead and acquisitive management of Mr Richard Lines. Whether he can now continue to combine the offices of chairman and chief executive is an open question.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / National Grid workers 'win 7.5%' NATIONAL GRID, the privatised operator of the electricity transmission system in England and Wales, has awarded its 5,400 workers pay rises averaging 7.55 per cent, union officials said yesterday. As part of the deal, involving sweeping changes in working practices, employees will receive a 2.95 per cent wage increase backdated to February 1. The company has also allocated Pounds 5.7m as an investment to fund lump-sum payments averaging 1 per cent of salaries as well as transition payments averaging Pounds 760 per person in return for staff co-operation in accepting changes in their contracts of employment. The company says the deal is worth 3.95 per cent plus an average Pounds 760. But the Engineers and Managers Association, which represents 40 per cent of the staff, says the deal will boost pay packets for workers, who on average earn Pounds 21,000 a year, by just over 7.5 per cent. The unions have accepted there will be a common salary structure for all, and the introduction of 'single-table' bargaining through the creation of a company council. The deal also involves paying all staff monthly directly into their bank accounts. The first steps are also being taken to end all overtime pay within two years. Increments are being abolished and replaced by individual performance-related pay bonuses. A wide range of cash allowances are also being scrapped or cut in value. The unions have also agreed to a system of voluntary binding arbitration over pay and conditions. This falls short of being a no-strike guarantee, but the company says there is 'a clear understanding' that staff cannot withdraw their labour in certain key areas. The Engineers and Managers Association's members voted by 66 per cent to 34 per cent, on an 80 per cent turn-out, to back the deal. Mr Nigel Petrie, the company's general manager, said the extra money invested in the deal would be recovered through efficiencies and improved profits within four years. 'We have to ensure we remain competitive and reduce our pay bill', he said. He envisages a cut of a further 1,000 in staff numbers over the next two years. Mr Petrie added that the company and unions had signed 'a modern agreement , appropriate to the employment of staff in a major company in the 1990s.' He claimed it would provide for 'greater unity of purpose and team working'.</p>

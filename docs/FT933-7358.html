			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Travel: Naxos: an island waiting to burst - Nicholas Woodsworth took a spring sojourn on a Greek island and found its out-of-season promise preferable to summer's sybaritic fulfilment IT WAS too early in the year for crowds. Later, in July and August, the boat decks and lounges, gangways and cabins of the Apollo Express would be crawling with island-hoppers. But for the moment - 8.30 on a blowy spring morning - the beautiful people of the Aegean summer were relegated to kitchen dishwashers, commuter buses and lecture halls a world away from the port of Piraeus. I was virtually alone on the ferry's upper boat deck. The only other passenger braving the cold wind as the Apollo slipped its moorings and headed south was a bearded young backpacker holding a paperback. It was Carlos Castenada's A Yaqui Way of Knowledge. I was astonished. It was the same book that bearded young backpackers were reading on boat trips out to the Greek islands more than 20 years ago. Summer wanderers, package tourists, sun-seeking nudists, fun-seeking jet setters, holidaying students - all are hardy perennials that survive from year to year. But what, I wondered, was left of the islands that have been their playground for decades? The last time I had visited Ios, once my favourite island in the Cyclades, I had given it up for lost. There were too many people, too many establishments with names like Homer's Discotheque. Was the whole Mediterranean turning into a gigantic Costa? I hoped that on the island of Naxos, in spring, the answer would be No. From the quayside at Naxos the eye of the newly-arrived visitor is first drawn by a massive marble gateway - all that is left of a seaside temple of Apollo - at one end of the port. It moves onwards to the long sweep of white-washed buildings that run the length of waterfront, then rises upwards to the cube-shaped houses that climb, disorderly, to the top of the hill that makes up the old town. My own eye, though, ran anxiously over the shopfronts, restaurants and businesses along the harbour-front - usually the maddest of places when holiday madness overcomes islands. There was no Homer's Discotheque. Any number of other establishments, though, firmly placed Naxos in the frenetic heart of the late 20th century. A sign at the Veggera Bar invited me to sample one of its exotic cocktails - 'Sex on the Beach', 'Never on Sunday' or the 'Indiana Jones Pina Colada Special.' Next door I could rent a beach buggy or a screaming off-road dirt bike. Further down the harbour was the Day and Night Club, Popi's Grill, the Smile Fast Food and a gathering of restaurants, boutiques, film processors, jewellery shops and other outlets designed for the satisfaction of modern hungers. As Anthony Quinn's Zorba described the numerous and inevitable imperfections of modern life, this was, in short, the complete catastrophe. Or was it? For indulgence in sybaritic consumption the setting was perfect. Just one element was missing: the sybaritic consumer. The only idle people about were a few Greeks fiddling with worry beads and sipping tiny cups of coffee. The feeding-frenzy atmosphere of the resort in high season was absent. Instead, quietly hanging over Naxos was an atmosphere of expectation and preparation. Cafe owners were busily splashing new coats of whitewash on to winter-weathered walls. Newsagents were replenishing wheeled sidewalk racks with fresh stocks of postcards: one rack for the breasts and bottoms of seaside cheesecake, another for the stark blue and white images of the unspoiled island idyll. In the window of the Zas travel agency, winter ferry timetables were coming down, summer ones going up. Naxos was a town waiting to burst. The promise, I was sure, was preferable to its fulfilment. Here was a bright blue sky, a white-horse-capped sea, and sunshine that bounced blindingly from one white wall to another. Here were most of summer's pleasures with none of its maddening and claustrophobic inconveniences. Not even the strong north wind that blew constantly for the next few days put me off. If the simple and sensual Greek island world exists, it exists out of season. There is a wonderful thing about Mediterranean island tourism - it is almost wholly oriented towards the Mediterranean. Most escapees from the cold, misty cities of the north are mad about warm water and sun-drenched beaches. While they are willing to undergo almost any kind of overcrowding just to lie there and baste, summer insanity wanes proportionally with distance from the water. Out of season this is true even in the town of Naxos itself. Move just two streets back from the waterfront and the hubbub of modern commercialism abruptly dies. In a steep, stone-flagged maze of narrow streets I meandered through a town that was sunny, deserted and silent. Naxos is a town of great age. Over the millennia the island has seen the coming and going of Mycenean, Persian, Ptolomaic, Roman, Byzantine, Venetian and Turkish rule. I walked up worn marbled stairways banked with bright red geraniums; through arched stone passageways into hidden, cobbled squares; past tiny blue-domed churches where sweet incense wafted from the door; on to whitewashed terraces where cats sat sunning themselves high over the sea. The postcards do not lie: the Aegean is both the cheesecake found everywhere and a simple beauty found nowhere else. If Naxos' main town boasted only a sprinkling of pre-season visitors, the rest of it seemed left entirely to its 16,000 island inhabitants. Some 70kms long and topped by the 1,000m-high Mount Za, Naxos is the largest island in the Cyclades. With more than 40 villages there is room not only for frantic seaside tourism but a slower, older pace of Greek life as well. Coast, inland plateau or fertile valley? Bouncing around in a beaten-up hired Jeep I tried to decide which sounded more appealing. In the end, I tried and liked them all. I drove south to the sea at Agia Ana, past sloping fields dotted with windmills and cactus and ablaze with a spring carpet of wind-whipped daisies and poppies. The beach tavernas and pensions were boarded-up, their terraces thick with sand. I walked, the only soul on a stretch of golden beach 5km long. I climbed the lonely headland of Mikri Vigla. Almost blown over at the summit, I gazed across an Aegean wild and frothy with whitecaps. To the east, I drove upwards into the wide, tawny-green bowl of the Tragea, the most fertile farming land in the Cyclades. Surrounded by dry, flinty hills, there are dark green citrus groves here, orchards of gnarled olive trees, and on every promontory and hill a gleaming white church. My favourite place, though, was the valley of Potamia. If, as myth has it, Dionysus settled down to a life of bucolic charm with Ariadne on Naxos, it might have been here in this fold in the rocky slopes below Mount Zas. Water has turned the valley into an oasis; as it flows down through shady, stone-lined channels from one village to the next and out into terraced fields, it sustains the same life it has for ages. Amid a profusion of flowering orchards and trees laden with lemons, I followed a clattering, fodder-laden donkey past the houses of Ano Potamia. In Kato Potamia an old woman who spoke not a word reached up and picked half-a-dozen oranges for me. In Meso Potamia I watched a procession led by a bearded monk in black robes parade gilt-covered images of St George through the village. It is a walk I would like to do again in the autumn, when the Day and Night Club is deserted, Popi's Grill is closed - and Naxos is quiet once more.</p>

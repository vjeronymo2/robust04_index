			<p>BFN     [Text] Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur has decided to  delay the opening of Israel's borders for free passage of  agricultural produce from the autonomy until satisfactory  compensation is provided to Israeli farmers.    According to the agreement, the borders were to open this  week for free passage of fruit, vegetables, cattle, and flocks  -- apart from poultry -- eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and  potatoes, which will gradually be allowed in under quotas. The  Ministry of Agriculture is to approve the import of vegetables  from the Gaza Strip into Israel in a few days time. Tests show  there is no danger in the vegetables and the farmers there do  not use pesticides. Agriculture Minister Ya'aqov Tzur is to  instruct the ministry to publish all information concerning  laboratory tests on agricultural produce as of tomorrow.  Recently, tests of fruit and vegetables showed the remnants of  dangerous pesticides have been found in several Israeli  agricultural products. The contaminated produce was destroyed  and the farmers were fined.</p>

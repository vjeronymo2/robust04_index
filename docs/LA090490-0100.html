			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YELTSIN OFFERS CRASH PLAN TO REVIVE SOVIET ECONOMY  </P> <P> Boris N. Yeltsin, president of the Soviet Union's vast Russian Federation, on  Monday unveiled a crash 500-day program aimed at reviving the country's  collapsing economy by selling off most state property, freeing prices to  respond to supply and demand and sharply cutting spending on defense.  </P> <P> Yeltsin told the republic's legislature, newly convened for its autumn session,  that its work on economic reform would mark the beginning of "a new political  course -- this is the course to Russia's revival."  </P> <P> Yeltsin, whose Russian republic spans two-thirds of the Soviet Union's  territory, presented the 500-day plan as the country's best hope of salvaging  its crumbling economy, and he has warned that he will not wait for the central  government if it tries to delay reform.  </P> <P> "Russia gives the impulse for change to the entire country," Yeltsin told  lawmakers. "The center can no longer ignore this and discard everything done by  us."  </P> <P> If adopted, the plan will be put to the legislatures of the other 14 Soviet  republics withthe goal of beginning its implementation on Oct. 1, the start of  the Soviet fiscal year.  </P> <P> Newly disclosed elements of the program's first 100 days, if adopted  nationwide, would include:  </P> <P>  -- An immediate 10% cut in the defense budget and 20% cut in funds for the  KGB, the Soviet intelligence and security agency.  </P> <P>  -- A 75% cut in foreign aid.  </P> <P>  -- The quick selloff of government cars and various other property.  </P> <P>  -- The sale on the world financial market, probably for a fraction of their  nominal value, of the debts that other countries owe to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> In opening this push to get the program approved by the Russian legislature,  Yeltsin jumped ahead in his competition with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for  leadership of the nation as it reshapes its economic system.  </P> <P> The 500-day plan distributed to Russian deputies on Monday would allow private  ownership of land and businesses, which now are virtually all state-owned, and  begin the selloff of apartments, plots of land and enterprises by the end of  the year.  </P> <P> In a key move, it would gradually remove state control of prices to allow the  market forces of supply and demand to work and entrepreneurship to replace  government management of most of the economy.  </P> <P> The Yeltsin program incorporates many of the most radical proposals put forward  over the last two years of debate on economic reform and ties them to a strict  timetable that will give people confidence that the harsh measures at the  outset would bring a better life within two years.  </P> <P> The program, in a major shift of power, would also force a devolution of  decision-making from the central government to the governments of the country's  constituent republics and local authorities.  </P> <P> Yeltsin said he wants the Russian legislature to vote on the plan on Sept. 11  -- the same day Gorbachev and Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov will present  their reform proposals to the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature.  </P> <P> Gorbachev told reporters last week that the more conservative plan prepared by  Ryzhkov's government has good points and should be integrated with the 500-day  model.  </P> <P> Yeltsin replied Saturday that that would be impossible -- the plans are too  different, he said -- and he called for Ryzhkov and his Cabinet to resign  because the public had lost faith in them.  </P> <P> Russian Premier Ivan S. Silayev, explaining the 500-day plan to the republic's  legislature Monday, acknowledged that the Ryzhkov government had made sharp  changes in its thinking, including the ideological acceptance of private  property, once anathema to orthodox Communists.  </P> <P> But it retains a top-to-bottom approach instead of allowing maximum freedom for  local bodies, Silayev said, and still relies on the old-style bureaucracy to  promote reform.  </P> <P> "We are appealing to you to survey this set of programs attentively and discuss  it as fast as possible," Silayev said, calling for quick approval of the  program.  </P> <P> Although the major points of the Yeltsin plan had been under discussion since  his advisers first outlined it in June, the plan underwent major changes last  month as it was fine-tuned in a commission jointly sponsored by Gorbachev and  Yeltsin to outline urgent reforms, according to the independent Soviet news  agency Interfax.  </P> <P> Silayev said the radical economists working on the plan were hindered by the  outright refusal of several key government agencies that were asked to provide  information, including the Defense Ministry, Foreign Trade Bank and State  Planning Commission. Even direct instructions from Gorbachev failed, he said.  </P> <P> Gorbachev created a set of new task forces Monday to deal with the burning  economic problems that cannot wait until the compromise plan he wants is worked  out. The three commissions, created at a meeting of the Presidential Council,  the top policy-making body, will tackle the shortages of virtually all consumer  goods from cigarettes to bread, the growing gaps between suppliers and their  customers and the increasingly stormy relations between Moscow and local  authorities.  </P></p>

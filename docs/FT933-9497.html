			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Indonesia's power scramble - The battle for market share in the energy sector COMPANIES supplying Indonesia's fast growing electric power sector have entered a fierce battle for market share. At stake is investment in the power sector which the World Bank estimates will total Dollars 33bn in the current decade. The country's most recent contracts have been for contracts for three gas-fired power stations in Java worth about Dollars 1.5bn, to be built by mid-1995. Indonesia's Government wants to double the grid's capacity in that time to about 20,000MW. It hopes that one-third of future investment in the national grid will come from the private sector. The timetable for new capacity, however, has been upset by slow negotiations for the large Paiton plant in East Java, which would launch a programme of privately built, owned and operated stations. Paiton's first 1,200MW stage, worth Dollars 2bn, had been due for completion in 1995 but is now unlikely to begin operating before 1998. Already faced with a substantial backlog of customer connections, PLN, the state-owned power company, faces an acute power shortage. Last month, the Government announced negotiations with Mitsubishi and Sumitomo of Japan, and Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) of Germany, for three gas-fired power stations on Java - to be owned and operated by PLN - made up of open cycle (solely gas-fired) and combined cycle (gas-fired and steam-driven) units. ABB and Mitsubishi will build two 800MW plants at Mawar Tawar, West Java and Pasuruan, East Java respectively. Sumitomo will construct a 500MW plant at either Tambak Lorok or Cilacap in Central Java. PLN says the three stations are being contracted on a repeat-order basis in recognition of the three companies' proven track record in Indonesia. But the decision not to widen negotiations to other manufacturers has provoked squabbling among the foreign companies seeking contracts. Last month (July), parliamentarians requested the contracts be reviewed after GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French power equipment company, made a cut-price uninvited offer to supply the new stations' open cycle units. 'Every time there is a new contract the government says it is a repeat-order. When will the other manufacturers get a chance? It's about time other suppliers came in to ensure more competitive pricing,' says an official close to GEC-Alsthom. He argues the companies which win contracts for gas-fired plants are operating a cartel, keeping in close contact when negotiating projects with the Government and lobbying to exclude others. Members of the alleged cartel point out that GEC-Alsthom participated and lost in an open tender for two earlier gas-fired stations, the 1,500MW plant at Gresik in East Java and the 1,180MW plant at Tanjung Priok in Jakarta. In May, PLN sought government approval for the three stations. PLN said the companies - ABB and Mitsubishi - - had offered the open cycle units at Dollars 6m per megawatt. In early June, GEC-Alsthom wrote to President Suharto offering the open cycle units at Dollars 5m per megawatt and with an earlier delivery date. The presidential office initially welcomed the proposal but the company has since been told by the Ministry of Mines and Energy that its offer will not be considered. Government officials say negotiating directly with ABB, Mitsubishi and Sumitomo is the safest way of ensuring the looming power crisis is avoided. The three companies are already constructing gas-powered plants in Java. While items such as land clearance, associated infrastructure and design specifications could account for some increase in project costs, industry observers are concerned the government is not always getting value for money. The fault may not lie with PLN negotiators who have been overstretched by the sudden demand for new capacity. To use an open tender process for the new gas-fired plants would require at least a dozen proposals to be analysed. Industry observers say, however, that ministers should reconsider a policy which favours companies already entrenched in Indonesia and which blocks other manufacturers wishing to supply the sector.</p>

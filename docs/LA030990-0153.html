			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> 'PARTY OF ONE' BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCES  </P> <P> Morris Bobrow has something good to say about being single at 50.  </P> <P> It inspired him to write "Party of One," the long running San Francisco hit  that will be produced by the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre at The Elizabeth North  Theatre on Wednesday.  </P> <P> "It occurred to me that there was no musical comedy that had been written about  being single," said the San Francisco native, who flew into town to give advice  to the Gaslamp on its production.  </P> <P> The show clearly filled some kind of void in San Francisco, where it is now in  its fourth year at the Zephyr Theater.  </P> <P> "Lots of ideas were gleaned from male or female friends about experiences  they've had and some of the pressures that they've felt about being single,"  Bobrow said.  </P> <P> Bobrow also keeps composing songs from the show, which gives the producers the  ability to pick and choose from a larger body of work.  </P> <P> Bobrow is currently working on a show about putting on shows because he has  found it to be, what he calls "an amusing and frustrating experience." His  earlier shows included musical revues "Mixed Nuts" and "With Relish," which  were produced in Los Angeles in the early 1980s.  </P> <P> If response to his work keeps up, Bobrow said it may even persuade him to give  up his other career -- that of a lawyer specializing in estate planning.  </P></p>

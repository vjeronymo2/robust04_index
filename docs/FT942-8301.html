			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Survey of Greek Banking and Finance (11): Overshadowed by the budget deficit / Review of bond markets As Europe's last emerging bond market, the Greek drachma sector has attracted much attention in recent months. Not only have four supranational borrowers and two corporate borrowers raised Dr65bn in bonds since February, but the Greek government is now planning to deepen the market by issuing fixed-rate bonds with maturities of over one year. However, while the sector's double-digit yields are expected to attract a growing number of international investors, it remains overshadowed by Greece's massive budget deficit, stubborn inflation and currency instability following the recent removal of currency controls. Nevertheless, the growth of a fixed-rate drachma bond market 'is a very, very positive development,' says Ms Miranda Xafa, an analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. 'For the first time, Greece will have a yield curve.' That is important for business investment, as it will allow entrepreneurs to gauge the cost of longer-term capital. 'It is very important for the government to tap this market,' says Ms Xafa. 'If it starts issuing three- to five-year bonds, its cost of funding will drop from 18 1/2 per cent to around 16 per cent. This will lower the cost of funding the budget deficit.' The European Investment Bank opened up the foreign drachma bond market - dubbed 'Marathon' market - in February with an issue of 17 1/2 per cent five-year bonds. With a double-digit yield attracting huge investor demand, the bonds put on a stellar performance. Other supranationals - the World Bank, the International Financing Corporation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development - soon followed, taking advantage not only of international demand for high-yielding bonds, but also of swap opportunities which allowed them to achieve funding at a significantly wider sub-Libor margin than in other currencies. Bayerische Vereinsbank and Abbey National followed, in effect opening a Eurodrachma market outside Greece. Their arrival provoked a chorus of disapproval from bankers in London and Athens, not only because they tapped the market at the same time as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), making that issue harder to place, but also because the Eurodrachma escapes the control of the Greek authorities. Marathon bonds are listed in Athens and require approval from several regulatory bodies; Eurodrachma bonds are listed outside Greece and in effect are unregulated. Thus, the creation of an offshore drachma market is seen to weaken the Greek authorities' control over their money supply and currency. Moreover, a growing Eurodrachma market could exhaust demand for drachma bonds and crowd the government out of the market when it chooses to issue its bonds, bankers warn. In the domestic market, the government currently issues bonds with maturities of up to seven years, but all bonds over one year pay floating interest rates pegged to 12-month Treasury bills. One-year bills currently pay a coupon of 18 1/2 per cent, and seven-year floaters pay 200 basis points above that. Under its new borrowing plans, the Greek government intends to issue fixed-rate bonds with maturities of up to three years initially, and has planned to lengthen the yield curve as inflation and interest rates continue declining. However, while inflation has fallen significantly in recent months - to a year-on-year rate of 10.4 per cent in April from the 1993 average of 14.4 per cent - Ms Vincenzina Santoro, economist at JP Morgan in New York, warns that inflation pressures could revive later this year. 'Agricultural prices are sprouting, wage pressures may resurface and the budget deficit is widening because the tax measures may not reap sufficient revenues this year,' she warns. She expects consumer price inflation to dip briefly below 10 per cent, but to average 11 per cent in 1994. The main risk now lies in the tumultuous state of the currency market, where heavy drachma selling by domestic and foreign investors has forced the government to hike short-term interest rates sharply after lifting its reserve controls last weekend. On Monday May 16, overnight rates rose as high as 70 per cent to stem the selling. Until recently, the Greek authorities have pursued a policy of a controlled depreciation of the drachma, aiming to reduce the extent of the depreciation each year. It went from a decline of 12 per cent against the Ecu in 1990 to a depreciation of 6.5 per cent in 1993. Although the Bank of Greece still appears committed to its 'hard drachma' policy, some observers warn that a one-off depreciation may now have to take place to take pressure off the currency. More importantly, however, the Greek authorities will have to undertake stringent fiscal tightening, market observers say. 'The current mix of monetary and fiscal policy is not sustainable - interest rates are very, very high, but fiscal policy is not very tight at all,' says one analyst. 'They have to do something about their fiscal deficit - and quick,' he adds. 'There is not prospect for lower interest rates until they cut the deficit.' Greece continues to grapple with a debilitating debt burden which it finances at high interest rates, thus further inflating its growing budget deficit. Greece's debt-to-GDP ratio was 138 per cent at the beginning of the year - by far the highest in the European Union. In February, concerns over Greece's fiscal position prompted Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to place the foreign currency debt rating of the Bank of Greece (the government's borrowing conduit until 1994) under review for possible downgrading. It said the review was prompted by the continued deterioration in the country's fiscal balances, exacerbated by a rapidly growing debt burden. After the general budget deficit grew to 14 per cent of GDP in 1993 - nearly double the 7.9 per cent budgetary target - most observers say this year's 12.8 per cent target is also unlikely to be met, despite the government's attempts at shoring up its revenues through a recent tax reform. Indeed, some fear the deficit could rise as high as 18-20 per cent of GDP. While the recent tax reforms will bolster state revenues, 'in themselves they are highly unlikely to enable the government to achieve its budget deficit target,' says Mr Colin Warren, European analyst at HILFE, an economic and political research house in London. He says a mini-budget in the second half of the year may be needed if the government is to stand any chance of staying below its 12.8 per cent ceiling. The government may be reluctant to get tough on the fiscal front in order to preserve its popularity ahead of the European elections in June and presidential elections in May 1995. If no two-thirds majority is found for any one candidate at the presidential elections, a general election must be held. However, according to Salomon's Ms Xafa, politics is not the problem. 'We had a change of government in October but that hasn't caused a change of direction. All parties know the constraints - with that volume of debt, they don't have much room for manoeuvre.'</p>

"This was something we expected (North Korea to do)," Chang  Chae-yong, director-general of American Affairs at the Foreign  Ministry, said in reaction.    "We don't feel the need to say anything about it. We have to  wait and see," Chang said.    North Korean first Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-chu said  the envoy exchange is not part of the agreed preconditions for  the high-level talks, slated for March 21 in Geneva.    Seoul, Pyongyang and Washington announced a set of joint  measures this week after North Korea allowed entry by a team of  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors. But  Washington made a separate announcement that while the date for  the high-level negotiations has been set, successful IAEA  inspections and an inter-Korean presidential envoy exchange are  two prerequisites.    "North Korea agreed that Washington would make this separate  announcement," Chang said.</p>

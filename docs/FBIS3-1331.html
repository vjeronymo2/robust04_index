IEC chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a news  conference in Pretoria the IEC was convinced that only severely  limited balloting in kwaZulu/Natal would be possible.    The IEC was therefore awaiting appropriate political and  governmental action following its failed mission on Wednesday to  convince the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly that free  electioneering should be allowed in the homeland. Mr Justice  Kriegler addressed the news conference immediately after he  briefed President F. W. de Klerk and African National Congress  [ANC] President Nelson Mandela on the IEC's Ulundi mission,  during which he was repeatedly booed by kwaZulu Legislative  Assembly members.    Mr Justice Kriegler told the news conference that in order  for the IEC to conduct free and fair elections in kwaZulu/Natal,  the requisite degree of stability and co-operation had to be  established in the region as a "matter of urgency".    Referring to kwaZulu Chief Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi's  reported conditional agreement to allow the IEC to prepare for  the election, Mr Justice Kriegler said: "The inference is  irresistible that the (Ulundi) proceedings were orchestrated so  as to create, on the one hand, an impression of willingness to  comply with the law, but on the other, make it plain that there  would in fact be widespread and sustained resistance to the  electoral process in kwaZulu."    The IEC's ability to organise, administer and conduct free  and fair elections in that province would remain "severely  curtailed", Mr Justice Kriegler said. He did not want to  elabrate on what the IEC viewed as appropriate political and  governmental action. The IEC would continue with its  preparations for the elections in the whole of the province.    "It (the IEC) does so under manifest constraints and has  conveyed its concerns to each of the governmental and political  bodies with whom the power and responsibility rest to enable the  IEC to fulfil its mandate in kwaZulu/Natal, Mr Justice Kriegler  said.    Responding to a question that the toppling of ex-president  Lucas Mangope's Bophuthatswana government had followed an IEC  visit to that territory, Judge Kriegler said that was a  "malicious and uneducated" perception. The IEC had also failed  on that mission, he said, adding there was no link between the  visit and subsequent events in Bophuthatswana.    Judge Kriegler ruled out the possibility that the April  elections could be postponed because of the Natal/kwaZulu issue.  It was not the IEC's function to pull free and fair elections  "out of a hat".    In spite of differences, political parties should realise  that South Africans had a common destiny and the new South  Africa should be ushered in by substabtially free and fair  elections.</p>

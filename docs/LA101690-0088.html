			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL EARNINGS: AMWEST'S 3RD-QUARTER PROFIT DOUBLES FROM '89  </P> <P> Amwest Insurance Group Inc., a Woodland Hills marketer of bail bonds and other  surety bonds, said its third-quarter profit more than doubled from a year  earlier, to $1.76 million from $729,000.  </P> <P> The higher earnings in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 were largely due to a  onetime gain of $797,000 that stemmed from Amwest's termination of a previously  established reserve account.  </P> <P> The reserve was set up in case Amwest had to pay rebates under Proposition 103,  the insurance-reform initiative that is being debated in the courts.  </P> <P> In August, however, legislators exempted surety companies from major provisions  of Proposition 103, enabling Amwest to close its reserve account.  </P> <P> Amwest's first-quarter net premiums earned -- an insurance industry gauge of  total revenue -- rose 25% to $12.1 million from $9.68 million. For the first  nine months of 1990, Amwest's profit jumped to $3.41 million from $2.31  million, and its net premiums earned rose 29% to $34.5 million from $26.8  million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: QUIBBLES &amp; BITS  </P> <P> Last week, we referred to a CBS miniseries on the Walker spy ring as "Family of  Five." It should have been "Family of Spies." Sorry!  </P> <P> Julian Schlossberg, business rep for Elaine May stated that, contrary to a  reference in Calendar, his client had "nothing to do with the 'Dick Tracy'  script" currently being filmed by Warren Beatty.  </P> <P> . . . KTTV News tried to pass off as news coverage a shameless hype job on the  Fox syndicated show "Cops" -- which aired, of course, on KTTV.  </P> <P> . . . KABC's garrulous Gary Franklin tells us about popping into a Cannon-owned  porn theater in Glasgow while on vacation -- and finding that "all the  (hard-core) sex scenes had been cut" from the film. Returning Stateside, he  called Cannon to complain about not getting his money's worth. Postscript:  Cannon sent him a 5 note!  </P></p>

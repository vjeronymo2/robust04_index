			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Initial Decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Role of Disability Claim Manager  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal would assign full responsibility for claim development and initial decisionmaking to a disability claim manager. It also stresses the need to develop the record for decision as completely as possible at this stage. The Conference has consistently encouraged the development of as complete a record as possible, as early in the process as possible. Assigning that responsibility to a single well-trained person is consistent with the Conference's recommendations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Conference suggests that claim development practices be undertaken consistent with Conference Recommendation 89&hyph;10, which emphasizes the importance of full and complete factual development of disability claims, in particular the medical aspects of such claims. Recommendation 89&hyph;10 also supports the current team approach to disability decisionmaking, and suggests an enhanced role for medical personnel in both claim development and disability determination. As discussed in more detail below, the Redesign Proposal retains a role for medical personnel as consultants to claim managers. The Conference recommends that claim managers be directed to consult with medical sources regularly on medical matters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Proposal would allow third parties to help develop the information necessary to decide a claim. This concept is a reasonable one, so long as the claim manager retains ultimate responsibility for developing an adequate record and for making the decision on benefits based on the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Role of Medical Personnel as Consultants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Redesign Proposal suggests that claim managers may use medical consultants for advice on medical issues. The Conference, in Recommendation 89&hyph;10, suggested that the evaluation of medical evidence and decisions on medical issues should be made by a medical professional (physician or psychologist), who should also have responsibility for developing such evidence in the record. This recommendation was based on the two-member team approach currently in use at the state Disability Determination Service level. The Conference continues to believe that medically-trained personnel should have an important role in the decisionmaking process on medical evidence. Although the Proposal does state that disability claim managers will call on the services of medical consultants, it contemplates that the final decision on all matters, including the resolution of disputed medical issues, would rest with the claim manager. The Conference continues to stress the need to ensure that adequate consultation with medical experts takes place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appropriate guidelines for such consultation should be developed. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  The Conference also recommends the establishment of guidelines that set priorities for the use by claim managers of treating physicians, examining physicians, and nonexamining physicians, including specialists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Recommendation 89&hyph;10(A)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference supports the aspects of the Proposal designed to improve the quality of evidence provided by medical sources for disability adjudications. Many of these improvements and proposals track suggestions included in Recommendation 89&hyph;10. For example, the Conference has recommended that physicians be adequately compensated for their work, and that all contacts be documented routinely in writing and included in the record.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Predenial Notice With Opportunity for Face-to-Face Interview  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference supports instituting the opportunity for a face-to-face interview between the claim manager and the claimant at the initial stage. <FOOTCITE>19</FOOTCITE>  Such an opportunity will not only provide the claim manager with relevant information and the chance to ask for and get information efficiently, but it should also give claimants more confidence in the fairness of the process, by giving them an opportunity to be heard. This may have the effect of reducing appeals, even when benefits are denied, because the process will be seen to have increased legitimacy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 19 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Recommendation 89&hyph;10(4)(b); see also Recommendation 91&hyph;3(2), and preamble at B(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference also supports the Redesign Proposal's concept of a predenial notice. The Conference has long supported the idea that claimants should be made aware of the deficiencies in their applications, and provided the opportunity to correct them. <FOOTCITE>20</FOOTCITE>  Such steps are likely to lead to more accurate early decisionmaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 20 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations 78&hyph;2(B)(4), 89&hyph;10(b)(4), 90&hyph;4(1), 91&hyph;3. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Issuance of Full ``Statement of the Claim'' Decisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference supports the issuance of full decisions on disability benefit claims. The proposed contents for ``Statement of the Claim'' decisions are consistent with those the Conference recommended in Recommendation 90&hyph;4. Providing sufficient information to claimants helps them make informed decisions about future action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Elimination of the Reconsideration Step  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference has also previously recommended that the reconsideration stage be eliminated if the claimant has an opportunity for face-to-face contact with the decisionmaker at the initial stage. <FOOTCITE>21</FOOTCITE>  The Reengineering Team's proposal to provide such opportunity and to eliminate the redundancy of reconsideration is an important and positive step.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 21 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 89&hyph;10(A)(4)(b), (B). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. The Administrative Appeals Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Use of Prehearing22 Officer to Prepare Claim for Appeals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference has long supported the concept of developing the record for an appeal as early in the process as possible. <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  Thus, the approach of designating someone to prepare the claim for appeal is one the Conference supports. The Conference also supports the idea that claims be granted based on evidence in the record without a hearing. <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference recommends using the term ``prehearing officer'' rather than ``adjudication officer.'' The term ``adjudication officer'' suggests another level of decisionmaking, which, even under the Redesign Proposal, is not a completely accurate description. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendations 78&hyph;2(B)(1),(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Recommendation 90&hyph;4(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Conference also recommends that prehearing officers not be required to be attorneys, although knowledge of the legal system and of applicable law would appear to be relevant qualifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

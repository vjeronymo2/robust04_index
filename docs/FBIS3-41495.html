In reality, however, the  limits on pesticides or heavy metals are observed only  infrequently. It is the desire of the EC Commission to ease the  requirements by amending the 1994 guidelines. The nub of the  debate is the stringent limit on pesticides. The EC guideline  laid down over a decade ago allows a maximum of 0.1 g (one  microgram = one millionth of a gram) of a single pesticide per  liter of drinking water. If a number of substances are present  simultaneously, the total pollution should not exceed 0.5  /l.  In the final analysis, that value implies that should not be any  pesticides at all in drinking water, since even using the most  up-to-date methods, it is impossible to detect anything less.    Even in West Germany this stringent limit has not been  upheld  for a long time by all waterworks. And that is even more so the  case in other EC countries. Additionally, Bonn's Federal  Association of German Gas and Water Works [BGW] classifies ``as  serious'' the number of times the limit is overstepped in the  new federal states. DM27 billion is the estimated cost of needed  rehabilitation measures in this area.    The EC is now deliberating amending the drinking water  guideline and likewise the anti-pollution guidelines for lakes,  rivers and canals. The controversial opinions of the different  interest groups surfaced at an experts meeting at the end of  September in Brussels. Environmentalist groups and broad  segments of the water industry want not only to uphold the  stringent limits but also to apply them to ground water and  surface waters. Contrariwise, some member states, farmers and  manufacturers of pesticides consider the standard unrealistic.    In the future, the Commission is calling for accurate cost  estimates for safeguard measures in order to assess whether the  expense is still in a tenable ratio to the resulting benefits.  Dr. Hans-Gerd Nolting of the Federal Biological Institute in  Braunschweig summarized the results of the conference thus:  ``The stringent parameters for pesticides can be altered without  thereby scaling back health safeguards.''    It is the view of a number of observers that the total  parameter of 0.5 g/l for all pesticides will probably come  down. The value for individual pesticides is disputed since it  is valid only as a precautionary value. If it is overstepped,  that still does not constitute any threat to the health of  consumers. The EC drinking water guideline hews to the values  proposed by the World Health Organization [WHO] for substances  contained in water such as arsenic, chlorine or chlorinated  hydrocarbons. This is the principle that the Frankfurt Farm  Industry Association [IVA], representing pesticide manufacturers  in the Federal Republic, is advocating also for pesticides. For  the WHO's standard values are predicated on the quantities of  each substance that pose no human health risk, based on current  knowledge, to even infants or sick people, even if consumed  daily for an entire lifetime. Practically speaking, that means  different limits for individual pesticides. In the interim, the  WHO has proposed such standard values for a number of pesticides  that are currently in use. They are very distinct for the  individual substances and are 10 to 20 thousand times the  current EC rate limits.    In the opinion of environmentalist groups, while such WHO  values may avoid harm to health, they still do not make any  allowance for ecology. Peter Kleemeyer, spokesman for the WWF  Germany environmental foundation, tosses out for consideration:  ``It is often only after many years that undesirable side  effects show up.'' Too little is still known about the  interactions of the by-products of the substances. Besides,  higher limits for drinking water would inevitably facilitate an  accumulation of pesticides in untreated waters.    Environmentalists are calling for an agriculture that  systematically scales back the use of pesticides. Kleemeyer  points to the Swedish model: ``Since 1986 they have succeeded  there in cutting the use of substances by 65 percent and, in  fact, without loss of yields.'' In West Germany too, the use of  pesticides is waning, according to the IVA, by one third per  hectare since 1989.    Water supply companies are calling for limits on pesticides  in ground and surface waters. For them, it is a dilemma that,  while there are stringent values for drinking water, there are  only inadequate requirements for protecting rivers, lakes and  canals. As BGW vice-president, Dr. Friedel Baurichter, remarks:  ``Pollutants have a cumulative effect on water prices.'' The  price of water has soared by nearly 20 percent in the past three  years in the former federal states. In the new federal states,  meanwhile, prices have already risen tenfold because of the  rehabilitation measures that have been introduced.    Also of concern to the BGW are the EC Commission's proposals  for the authorization of pesticides. Products that have meantime  been banned in the Federal Republic are on the list proposed for  EC-wide marketing: Atrazin, Simazin, Lindan, etc. Supposedly  also, approval will be given even to substances for which there  is still no analytical method of detection. Since 1987, when the  pesticide law took effect, that has been the pre-requirement for  approval in the Federal Republic. Nolting observes: ``The  Federal Biological Institute no longer gives approval for  pesticides if values exceeding 0.1 g/l can be expected from  the substances themselves or from problematical by-products.''    The EC Commission is presently deliberating tougher limits  for lead contents in drinking water from the current 50 g/l  to 10 g/l. In this case it will follow the recently  established recommendations of the WHO. At present, in the  Federal Republic, critical lead values can still be anticipated  only in old dwellings where no one has bothered to replace the  lead pipes. In the meanwhile, the lead pipes up to the house  connection have been replaced area-wide. The decisions of the EC  Commission and the establishment of the new limits will come  about at the start of the new year at the earliest.</p>

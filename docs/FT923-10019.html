			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Q&amp;A, Briefcase: Cost of coin collecting A relative of mine has a coin which she acquired many years ago and has now been valued at in excess of Pounds 10,000. If she sold the coin, could she be liable for capital gains tax? I understand that sterling is non-taxable normally, but does this apply if the coin is no longer legal tender? She acquired the coin in pre-decimalisation days. Yes, demonetised coins are within the scope of CGT. Your relative will find general guidance in the free pamphlet CGT14 (Capital gains tax: an introduction) which is obtainable from tax inspectors' offices. The free pamphlet CGT16 (Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988) will also be helpful. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

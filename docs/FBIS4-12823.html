			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Ties with Iran"] </F>   [Text] Addressing a press conference in Islamabad, the  visiting Speaker of the Iranian Majles, 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri  has talked about a wide range of matters relating to Pak-Iranian  relations. However, the thrust of his pronouncements was to  explain away what has been widely seen in Pakistan as a `tilt  towards India' in Iran's foreign relations. Ever since the  Iranians changed their mind at the eleventh hour in Geneva and  expressed inability to vote for Pakistan's resolution on human  rights abuses in occupied Kashmir, albeit they were said to have  brokered a face-saving compromise, opinion leaders in Pakistan  have been trying to comprehend the implications of the odd  phenomenon. And, notwithstanding Islamabad's endeavour to play  down the Iranian dissidence, there have been apprehensions that  a strategic shift in Iran's perception of regional alignments  may well be on the anvil. The Iranian speaker has been candid  enough to acknowledge that relations with India have assumed a  special significance for his country. "We cannot ignore the  Muslims living in India," he said. Whether or not his alibi for  a drift towards closer cooperation with India was convincing,  Hojjat ol-Eslam Nuri did not mince words to put across the  message that the Iranians did not share Pakistan's perception of  India's role in the region, and were willing to take initiatives  which may be deemed as pro India by Pakistanis at large. Though  he was eager to underscore that Iran's relations with other  countries, particularly India, will not affect friendship with  Pakistan, the new-born pragmatism in Iran's outlook on  friendship and alliances calls for a review of Islamabad's  foreign policy agenda.    Given the fraternal bonds of religion and culture and the  geopolitical compulsions, Iran is not likely to dump Pakistan  for the sake of securing a regional arrangement with India, but  what needs to be accepted as a fait accompli is the signal that  Iran will not necessarily go along with Pakistan on issues of  discord in the region. The overriding concern in Tehran appears  to be to break its international isolation and play a  significant role in regional politics. The offer to mediate on  Kashmir is a veritable indication of Tehran's urge to play the  honest broker in regional disputes and acquire a measure of  leverage in power politics. Thus, Islamabad will have to reckon  with Tehran's growing quest for self-assertion and its agenda  thereof for seeking new power alignments.</p>

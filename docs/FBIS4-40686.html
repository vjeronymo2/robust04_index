			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Vardiko Nadibiadze by </F> unidentified correspondent at the Gonio training ground in  Batumi on 17 June, where a joint Georgian-Russian military  exercise took place -- recorded]    [Text] [Nadibaidze] The most important thing is that the  first step was made today toward cooperation with the Russian  Army. All deputy defense ministers and many brigade commanders  took part in this large training session [zanyatiye] of the  Group of Russian Troops in the Transcaucasus. It was a very  useful and well-prepared session, and there was a lot to see and  learn there. It displayed many aspects of the soldier's life.    We brought our brigade commanders with us here. We, I mean  Georgian Army officers, have never been involved to such an  extent in sessions like that. This is the most important thing  about today's session. [Words indistinct] before we left for  Batumi, I gave them an assignment to introduce such training  into the Georgian Army. Before the end of the year we plan to  hold a similar training session involving the 11th Brigade. We  are now forming a model brigade with battalion personnel  [sentence as heard]. As I said, we are planning to hold a  similar session by the end of the year and invite our Russian  friends to it, as they did today.    [Unidentified correspondent] Mr. Nadibaidze, the Defense  Ministry issued a statement yesterday [16 June] saying that  following the Supreme Council session, the transfer of Russian  troops to Gali Rayon was delayed.    [Nadibaidze] There was no delay. As planned, sapper groups  are now being formed. We will be represented by Colonel  Kalandadze, the head of the Defense Ministry's engineer service.  Preparatory measures to be taken ahead of the deployment of  troops are being implemented on a full scale and according to  plan. There was no delay and there will not be any delay in the  future. Everything will develop as planned in advance. All  tasks discussed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev during  his visit to Georgia are being implemented stage by stage. On  the 19th or 20th June all troops will be in the region.</p>

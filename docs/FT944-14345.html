			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Ageing execs become 'predatory managers' The ageing executive's fear of being sacked is creating a new breed of predatory manager seeking to break away from an existing employer and buy into other companies, a report says today. According to the report by 3i, the investment capital group, the most common targets for predatory managers are family-run businesses. The 3i research shows that the structure of company purchases by outside managers has changed markedly in the past five years. The report says that the so-called management buy-in, where a group of outside managers buys a company from its existing owner, has become an established means of transferring ownership, accounting for about 600 company sales in the past five years. Family businesses are the most common target for a buy-in, comprising 43 per cent of the 285 management buy-in deals backed by 3i between 1986 and 1993. Analysis showed that 33 per cent of such deals involved privately owned non-family companies and 17 per cent were disposals from quoted companies, with another 7 per cent covering other types of business. Not only have buy-ins grown bigger - the average annual turnover of companies acquired has more than doubled since 1989 to Pounds 6.5m - but a growing feature of such deals, according to 3i, is the involvement of existing internal managers of the target companies. The proportion of these deals - what 3i calls 'buy-in management buy-outs'  - has doubled since 1990 and now represents half of all buy-ins. Mr Patrick Dunne, director in charge of 3i's buy-in programme, said they had become a driving force in the medium-sized business sector. The involvement of existing management increased motivation and meant that the buy-in team was better informed about the business. More recent buy-ins featured the use of non-executive directors and what 3i called 'second-time entrepreneurs' - people who had built up a successful enterprise, sold out, and were keen to apply their talents in a new venture.

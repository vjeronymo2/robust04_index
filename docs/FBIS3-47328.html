			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Following a decision at the new multilateral trade  negotiations (Uruguay Round) to lower the tariff rate on beef, a  Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] source  disclosed on 8 January that Japan had reached an agreement with  beef-exporting nations, including the United States and  Australia, regarding a new safeguard (emergency import  restriction) which Japan can apply when beef imports increase  rapidly. Reportedly, Australia, which is a beef-exporting  nation, basically approves. Since requirements for its  application will be eased, and definite action can be taken, the  MAFF hopes it will be able to minimize the adverse affect to  cattle farmers of lowering the tariff rate.    Currently, a 50-percent tariff is charged on beef but it  will  be reduced to 38.5 percent during the six years starting in  1995, thanks to the agreement at the new round.    Under the new safeguard, Japan will be able to increase the  tariff rate to 50 percent, which is the current rate, if an  import amount, calculated on the basis of beef imports for every  quarter period, increases by 17 percent or more compared to that  of the same quarter of the previous year. Under the current  safeguard, which was introduced under a Japan-U.S. accord in  1988, the tariff rate can be increased by 25 percent if the  annual import quantity grows by 20 percent or more. Domestic  cattle farmers are critical of the current safeguard, saying  that "requirements for its application are severe and it is not  a definite measure."    Moreover, the new safeguard can be applied to chilled and  frozen beef separately.    However, the reality is that the quantity of imported beef  is  rapidly increasing even though the tariff rate is 50 percent.  Moreover, it seems that cattle farmers may have doubts about the  effect of the new safeguard should primary factors of beef  import expansion, including further appreciation of the yen, be  felt.</p>

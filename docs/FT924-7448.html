			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Amato gets pat on back from IMF THE Italian government's credibility will hinge on the speed and transparency of privatisation, and its removal from political influences, according to the preliminary conclusions of the International Monetary Fund's annual mission. The report, handed over yesterday, was released by Mr Giuliano Amato's government to strengthen its hand in what promises to be a serious confrontation in parliament over privatisation. The government's programme, which would radically reduce the state's two-thirds control of the banking system and eventually wind up IRI, the largest state holding company, was sent to parliament at the weekend. Parliament now has 15 days to pass judgment on a programme that seeks to raise L27,000bn (Pounds 13.12bn) for the Treasury and half as much again for recapitalising the IRI companies and lowering their debts. The IMF report is cautiously encouraging about the government's 1992/3 fiscal packages, noting that there is 'a very different climate' compared with 'the sense of deja vu' last year. It says the quality and credibility of the adjustment process just initiated 'will be greatly enhanced by privatisation'. Success will depend 'on the speed with which privatisation is begun, the transparency of criteria and procedures, and the effective depoliticisation of the process.' The seriousness of the government will be judged by its willingness to take unpopular decisons, including liquidating companies. The IMF says pointedly: 'Italy is now paying the price not only of past excessive borrowing but also of repeated failures to live up to its promises. . . . this government appears to be prepared to make a break with the past and, if action is sustained, it will be rewarded.' Fears about company closures and job losses in the privatisation process yesterday provoked a warning from the three main union confederations. It said the unions accepted privatisation as inevitable but there was the risk of creating 'disastrous' unemployment without a clear industrial strategy. Union officials said 150,000 jobs were at risk. In contrast, Confindustria, the industrialists' grouping, warmly endorsed the privatisation programme while insisting the scope could still be much broader. The Milan stock exchange index rose more than 2 per cent, with sentiment encouraged by privatisation prospects. Goverment officials said they were concerned about excessive speculation in the run-up to privatisation and this was one of the reasons why names of specific companies to be sold off had not always been included in the programme submitted to parliament. Both Mr Amato, prime minister, and Mr Piero Barucci, treasuary minister, said yesterday they hoped privatisation would stimulate the bourse, allowing wider ownership and the proper development of pensions funds. Mr Amato said a combination of divestments by IRI and ENI, the state oil concern, plus the shake-up in banking, should create a more modern corporate structure in Italy. Instead of the long-standing four large private groups and two big state holdings dominating the economy, he believed 14 or 15 largely Italian groups could evolve.</p>

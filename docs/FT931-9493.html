			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: BP to spend Dollars 840m upgrading refinery British Petroleum is to spend Dollars 840m (Pounds 556.2m) to upgrade its Singapore refinery so that it will be able to produce more environmentally-friendly fuels. Mr Russell Seal, BP Oil's chief executive, said the project would position the refinery as a benchmark in the region and enable the company to take advantage of the growing market for transport fuels. The refinery is on the southern tip of Singapore at Palau Merlimau. The Japanese Gasoline Corporation, which originally built the plant, has been awarded the contract to upgrade the 220,000-barrel refinery. The work is due to be completed in 1995. The refinery is a joint venture between BP, the Singapore Petroleum Company and Caltex - a partnership between Chevron and Texaco. The improvement will involve the construction of a residue cracker which will enable the plant to process heavy fuel oil and turn it into petrol - including unleaded - and diesel. It will also include a hydrofiner capable of reducing sulphur levels in diesel to acceptable levels. The south-east Asian market for oil products has been one of the few areas to show growth over the past two years and oil demand remains strong while it has been stagnant in the US and Europe.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Why the whites handed over their power: Last month South Africa's white rulers agreed a new constitution which will end white hegemony. Patti Waldmeir explains how it happened South Africa has delivered itself of a political miracle: sometime in the dark hours of November 18, almost imperceptibly, white hands let go their 350-year grip on the baton of power. The combined forces of history, economics, demography and morality had decreed the end of white rule; and South Africa's leaders had the grace - or the good sense - to recognise the inevitable. The story of their conversion - which began in the late 1970s and reached a climax the night before the new constitution was signed - is strange and wonderful. History provides few enough examples of the triumph of pragmatism over ethnicity, or religion, and South Africa's National Party was scarcely famous for good sense in the decades of apartheid. But in the pre-dawn hours of November 18, white hands seized black ones, offering the cult handshake of the African National Congress to seal a pragmatic new constitution; and the two men who struggled for months to complete the deal - Cyril Ramaphosa, ANC chief negotiator, and Roelf Meyer, his government counterpart - danced until the early hours, in an atmosphere heady with emotion and exhaustion. In the days that followed, Meyer and his colleagues have continued to laud a constitutional deal which included many last-minute reverses for the National party - a deal which, in essence, permits what the party had always said was impossible: the handover of state power to blacks. Pleased now to have any deal at all after a tough four-year struggle, they are convinced that the voluntary power-sharing promised by the constitution will give them real clout. Some days after the momentous night on which the new South Africa was born, I watched as a Meyer - boyish, handsome and charming - ducked into the ANC's private lavatory to fix his hair before posing for a victory photo. Moments later, the equally youthful and charming Ramaphosa did the same; then the two set off together, laughing, for their appointment with the photographer. I reflected on the extraordinary trust and goodwill built up over the last four years of momentous change - and which will no doubt come under serious strain once the two parties start cohabiting in government - and recalled my first experience of South Africa: the day in 1985 when Archbishop Desmond Tutu (while I stood near) intervened to stop a township crowd burning a man to death during a political funeral. That year - had I but known it at the time - marked perhaps the first inevitable step to black rule. When in 1985 President P W Botha promised equal citizenship to all South Africans, including blacks, the death knell sounded for apartheid, which had decreed that blacks must live separately as citizens of distant homelands. It was not the first step away from white hegemony: as early as the late 1970s, the Afrikaner establishment - through its secret society, the Broederbond (Brotherhood) - had begun to debate sharing power with mixed-race Coloureds and Indians, but not with blacks who formed the vast majority of the population. A participant in one of the early Broederbond meetings on power sharing remembers, with a rueful chuckle, that it took place in the holiday home of H F Verwoerd, the late prime minister and grand architect of apartheid. Reflecting on the irony of history, the participant remembers that Prof Gerrit Viljoen, then chairman of the Broederbond and a prime mover of reform under President F W de Klerk, sat beneath a portrait of Verwoerd as he argued for an end to exclusive white power. Then, in 1986, Pretoria opened secret negotiations with Nelson Mandela, serving his 23rd year in prison. His first interlocutor was, ironically, Kobie Coetsee, the hardline Minister of Justice who is known to oppose many provisions of the constitution agreed last month. Later, Botha set up a four-man committee to negotiate with Mandela, including two figures who remained prominent in the final negotiations: the sharp and ruthless Neil Barnard, former head of the National Intelligence Service and now head of the department of Constitutional Development, and Fanie van der Merwe, eminence grise in the government negotiating team. Mandela told me and a few colleagues over breakfast in 1992 that he did not tell his fellow ANC leaders he had met Barnard and van der Merwe. 'They would have refused,' he said. Members of the committee say their aim in talking to Mandela was to discover whether he was committed to peace, and whether he was a communist. By 1989, Pretoria had clearly concluded, in spite of his continuing refusal to end armed struggle, that Mandela was essentially a man of peace. In July that year, he was taken to the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town to meet President Botha (who resigned from office weeks later). Mandela remembers the meeting fondly, recalling that President Botha 'poured the tea himself.' From the day Botha left office, reform proceeded apace. For, although he laid the basis for the changes of the 1990s - repealing the nefarious influx control regulations which kept blacks out of cities, and which forced them to carry the hated passbook; legalising mixed marriages and relaxing residential segregation - he left the biggest risks untaken. History will laud President de Klerk, who took office as acting president in August 1989, for having the courage to leap where President Botha stood still. Reform came in a rush with de Klerk's election on September 6, 1989. Mass public protest was legalised, political prisoners were released, the ANC and South African Communist Party were unbanned (on February 2 1990) and finally, on February 11 1990, Nelson Mandela, the world's most famous political prisoner walked free. Speaking days before Mandela was released, Con Botha, the senior Nationalist politician who is now administrator (governor) of Natal province, told the FT that he and his colleagues felt a great weight lifted from their shoulders. 'We have to make peace with our black people while we still have the chance.' F W de Klerk, who according to some of his colleagues was no early convert to reform, leapt at the chance to make peace before it was too late. Prof Viljoen, who retired last year because of ill health, remembers that the strongest impetus to change came after the 1989 demise of communist regimes which had been the ANC's main military backers. 'We recognised it as a unique opportunity in the course of history, a God-given opportunity - we thought of it very much in Christian terms - to ensure that conflict in South Africa could be resolved.' De Klerk drew the parallel with Rhodesia: 'When the opportunity was there for real constructive negotiation, it was not grasped,' he said in February 1990. 'We are determined not to repeat that mistake.' With Mandela's release, negotiations began in earnest - always on the basis, according to de Klerk, that whites 'were not prepared to bow out apologetically from the stage of history.' His aim, argues Heribert Adam, the political scientist, was to pre-empt revolution: not to negotiate himself out of power, but into power under different circumstances which would have left whites with a veto over major issues, or at least substantial blocking power in cabinet). Such a deal may well have been on offer early in the negotiations - although senior Nats argue that an early deal would have prevented the process of building trust with the ANC, the main business of the last three years. That process has undoubtedly been successful: intense relationships developed over the months with government and ANC negotiators withdrawing regularly to bush hide-outs for cozy consultations. Their improved relations were shown on one fishing trip - which Ramaphosa claims was arranged without his knowledge - when the tough Ramaphosa removed a hook from Meyer's finger. But by the eve of the deal, entrenched power sharing was no longer on offer. In the end the balance of advantage shifted decisively towards the ANC. This shift began after the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, the multi-party negotiating forum, fell apart in May last year. At its May 15-16 plenary conference, the National Party staged a high risk gamble for power, and lost. Speaking after the conference ended in disarray, de Klerk seemed oddly confident of his strength; but the events of the succeeding months undermined his position. 'The Nats peaked at Codesa,' says a senior ANC negotiator. 'At that point, the ANC had serious problems: its members were complaining about negotiations, (Ronnie) Kasrils still had dreams of insurrection, the regime was dizzy with international invitations, Inkatha was still intact as its negotiating ally, and the Nats had high hopes of forming a non racial party.' Everything went downhill from there. International opinion turned against de Klerk after the June massacre at Boipatong, for which he was indirectly blamed; the ANC bolstered its confidence through mass action; and then in April this year, ANC leader Chris Hani was assassinated, permanently tilting the balance in the ANC's favour and allowing them to extract the crucial concession from government: agreement that elections would be held on April 27 next year. That was a trap, from which the government proved unable to escape. 'In the end, time made it impossible for them to hold out,' says Joe Slovo, eminence grise of the ANC team. His November 1992 decision to persuade the ANC to offer a deal based on power-sharing was a crucial step on the way to last month's deal. He argues that power sharing is necessary because: 'All we will achieve when we have won the election is to gain political office. We would not gain state power in the sense of having a complete transformation on day one of the police, the armed forces, the judiciary and the civil service'. To ensure compliance from those constituencies, the ANC needs the National Party: so Slovo has assured Government negotiators, and so, crucially, Mandela has assured de Klerk. But power-sharing will be purely voluntary: 'We won the battle for an executive which at the end of the day is based on majority decision making - something I thought we would not win. None of us thought, even a week (before), that we could win that,' says Slovo. 'Power sharing? Madiba cracked him,' says another senior ANC negotiator, referring to the 11th hour meeting between Madiba (Mandela's clan name) and de Klerk on the eve of the deal. ANC negotiators had let it be known that they would agree to a requirement that important issues be passed by a special majority of Cabinet (which would include other parties like the NP). But Mandela offered no such concession; power would be shared voluntarily, or not at all. Mandela would seek consensus where possible; 'but in the end, if we differ, we are not required to listen to them,' another senior negotiator concludes. He disputes the definition of power sharing offered by a prominent Nationalist: 'Whites will still have one hand on the tiller. There will be other hands and the white hand won't necessarily be the strongest, but it will be there.' 'How can that be?' asks the ANC man, who is too senior to be named without embarrassment, 'if it's not in the constitution?' 'We must make ourselves indispensible - that is the recipr for the future,' counters Meyer while Con Botha adds: 'The failure of apartheid has shown us the folly of relying on laws alone to sustain yourself.' 'Once you've crossed the Rubicon, you have to move forward fearlessly in another direction, even though it is into uncharted waters.' Another prominent Afrikaner completes the metaphor, and sums up the cautious optimism which is the true fruit of negotiations: 'We're still between the devil and the deep blue sea. But at least we've got a raft to take us through the rapids.'</p>

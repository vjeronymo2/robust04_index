			<p><P> May 25, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH VETOES AMTRAK BILL AS STEP BACKWARD  </P> <P> President Bush on Thursday vetoed a bill authorizing $2 billion in spending by  Amtrak, complaining that the bill's expansion of federal regulation over  railroad acquisitions "represents a step backward for the entire rail  industry."  </P> <P> Bush took issue with a provision that would require the Interstate Commerce  Commission to approve the acquisition of railroads by non-railroad companies.  </P> <P> "This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the financial  restructuring of the railroad industry," Bush told Congress in a veto message.  </P> <P> Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said the veto would have no effect on daily  train operations because the national rail passenger service is working with  money that Congress already had appropriated for 1989-1992.  </P> <P> But the veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter line between  Washington and its Northern Virginia suburbs, Black said. The bill contained  technical provisions necessary for the project to open.  </P> <P> It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He returned 10 bills to Congress in his first  year in office. None has been overridden.  </P> <P> The vetoed legislation would have authorized a new, three-year government  subsidy of $2 billion to Amtrak. Actual spending levels are set by separate  appropriations bills.  </P> <P> Black said Amtrak supports the provision that prompted Bush's veto, although it  applies only to private freight railroads.  </P> <P> The spokesman said Amtrak relies on private freight lines for its tracks  outside the Northeast corridor and "does support ICC oversight of takeovers of  railroads by non-railroad companies."  </P></p>

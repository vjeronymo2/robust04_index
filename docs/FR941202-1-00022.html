The proposed regulations, as amended, will provide guidance to taxpayers who must comply with section 162(m), which was added to the Code by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Written comments with regard to the amendments to the proposed regulations and requests for a public hearing must be received by March 2, 1995. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send submissions to: CC:DOM:CORP:T:R (EE&hyph;61&hyph;93), room 5228, Internal Revenue Service, POB 7604, Ben Franklin Station, Washington, DC 20044.

The proposed regulations were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 20, 1993, at 58 FR 66310, with a correction published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on February 14, 1994, at 59 FR 5370. Additional guidance was provided under Notice 94&hyph;2, 1994&hyph;2 I.R.B. 25, and Notice 94&hyph;68, 1994&hyph;26 I.R.B. 1. In Notice 94&hyph;2, the IRS provided transition relief relating to the requirement that a performance goal based on a period of service be ``preestablished.'' In Notice 94&hyph;68, the IRS announced that the final regulations would provide similar relief on a permanent basis. Notice 94&hyph;68 also extended the transition period during which a corporation can treat disinterested directors as outside directors until the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs on or after January 1, 1995. Section 1.162&hyph;27(h)(2) of the proposed regulations defines a disinterested director as a director who is disinterested within the meaning of Rule 16b&hyph;3(c)(2)(i) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (including the provisions of Rule 16b&hyph;3(d)(3), as in effect on April 30, 1991). Under &sect;1.162&hyph;27(h)(2), the transition rule for disinterested directors originally was scheduled to expire upon the first meeting of shareholders at which directors were to be elected that occurred after July 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  These amendments provide guidance on the definition of the term ``outside director.'' The amendments also extend the transition relief provided in Notice 94&hyph;68 until the first meeting of shareholders at which directors are to be elected that occurs on or after January 1, 1996. Thus, corporations can treat disinterested directors as outside directors until that first meeting of shareholders. Other modifications are also included that reflect a number of the comments received on the December 1993 proposed regulations. The IRS and Treasury will continue to consider comments previously received on the December 1993 proposed regulations on issues other than those addressed by these amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The December 1993 proposed regulations, as amended by these amendments, are generally intended to address broad issues that are important to most taxpayers in complying with section 162(m) and, thus, are not comprehensive. To the extent that an issue is not covered by the proposed regulations, as amended, taxpayers should follow a reasonable, good faith interpretation of the statutory provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

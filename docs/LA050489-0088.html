			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PORTER RANCH PROJECT: DEVELOPER'S FOLLY  </P> <P> If the Los Angeles city fathers are silly enough to approve the proposed huge  Chatsworth-Porter Ranch project, I predict that the quality of life will  dramatically decline for every person living north of Roscoe Boulevard and west  of Interstate 405. That's how big an area it will negatively affect.  </P> <P> Who can be naive enough to believe the folly being foisted on us by the  developer, such as predictions that adding another 155,000 car trips per day  will result in less traffic congestion than we now have without them. Their  "traffic mitigation plan," which will supposedly produce this miracle, includes  some new stripes on certain streets and some computerized traffic lights. Too  bad they forgot to include one minor item -- enough roadway surface to hold all  the cars.  </P> <P> It is unfortunate that L.A. planners never learn from their past mistakes. One  look at the Ventura Freeway, clogged from end to end by the 20-year buildup of  Warner Ranch and Ventura Boulevard, shows what the north Valley will look like  in the years ahead, traffic congestion, high-rises and all.  </P> <P> At recent public hearings, allies of the developer repeatedly said how nice it  will be to have nearby Schubert-type theaters, shopping and parks in Porter  Ranch. If that's what they want, I have a suggestion for them: Move back East  to Manhattan. They'll find theaters no one can afford to attend and huge parks  unsafe for anyone without previous commando training.  </P> <P> As for me, I left the original (pricey) Schubert Theater and Central Park of  Manhattan 20 years ago so I could live in a suburban community where my life  style included low-density housing, equestrian and other outdoor recreational  facilities, non-crowded streets and unspoiled foothills. That's the Chatsworth  I was promised when I moved here, and that's the one every resident I've talked  to still wants.  </P> <P> I'm not against sensible growth, and I am not a member of the Sierra Club or  any other similar organization, but I wonder if we'll ever find a vaccine for  the strange disease that seems to afflict every California land developer --  you know, the one that causes them to hyperventilate and have recurring  nightmares every time they run across an unused piece of land, an unclogged  road or a place where things are just fine the way they are now.  </P> <P> I'm not fooled by the tactics being used to ramrod this project through the  approval cycle: It was kept a secret until just a few months ago, years after  the developer bought some cheap land zoned for low-density housing and  concocted a get-rich scheme whereby if he got the zoning changed to include  millions of square feet of commercial use, he'd make millions, or perhaps close  to billions. No, he's using a sham of asking for the stars and settling for the  moon. They'll cut it down a million or so square feet, but the congestion will  remain.  </P> <P> Hal Bernson faces a problem though. His so-called Citizens Advisory Committee  orchestrated this fiasco and almost all the area's residents are against it. As  soon as he realizes how many, look for him to make a back-room deal whereby he  votes against it to save face, while (according to the predicted script), all  his fellow councilmen vote it in. Hal, baby, it won't work!  </P> <P> Haven't we got enough traffic and other problems in L.A. already? Why create  more until we fix them? The night before the mayoral election, defeated  candidate Baxter Ward said we should hang big signs reading "Closed for Repair"  on all roads entering Los Angeles. What a delightfully refreshing approach.  </P> <P> DAVID PELTZ  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Station Reporter (Zhao Xinting) learned of the facts  from the provincial overall agricultural development work  conference that over the past years, Jilin Province has made  satisfactory achievements in comprehensively developing  agriculture.    Over the past years, the province has developed five major  agricultural auxiliary service projects, such as cultivating  fine seeds and offering service of farm machines and explored  new ways for providing a good-quality and high-efficient  operation mechanism for the agricultural production areas.  Simultaneously, the province has made serialized development in  such 10 major aspects as farming, breeding, and processing; and  created 500 million yuan of output value and 160 million yuan of  profits and taxes through the development.    Sang Fengwen, vice governor of the provincial government,  made a speech at the provincial overall agricultural development  work conference that was held on 23 March.    He pointed out in his speech: The overall development of  agriculture is an important strategic measure of the state for  regulating and controlling, on a large scale, the development of  agriculture as well as an important means for helping the  peasants seek wealth and become fairly well-off. This year, the  second-phase overall agricultural development project of the  province should pass through the state acceptance test, and the  third-phase project will comprehensively start. Therefore, this  year is a key year serving as a link between past and future.  At present, we should emphatically grasp the work in the  following few aspects. First, we should attend to the  winding-up work of the second-phase project and make  preparations for the third-phase project. Second, according to  the guidelines of the national overall agricultural development  work conference, we should ceaselessly strengthen and improve  new methods for management of agricultural development. Third,  we should ensure the supply of funds for development. From now  on, we should try every possible to arrange, in a coordinate  manner, the development of the overall agricultural development  items, the items involving the loans granted by the World Bank,  and the items involving the capital provided by the  international agricultural development fund so as to solve the  difficulties in providing necessary funds for these items.  Simultaneously, we should make a unified plan to arrange the  special agricultural loans, increase the [words indistinct]  efficiency of loans, and reduce the losses from loans. Fourth,  we should strengthen organizational leadership. The overall  agricultural development is a task with various departments  involved, large amounts of work load, and strict demands. So,  the governments at various levels should strengthen the  leadership over this work and support this work so as to  accomplish this task with high standards, high quality, and high  efficiency and to create a new overall agricultural development  situation.</p>

			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / International Company News: First-half advance at Hyundai Motor Hyundai Motor, South Korea's largest manufacturer of cars, reported net profits of Won68.2bn (Dollars 85m) for the first half of 1994, a 343 per cent advance on the corresponding period last year, during which the company was hit by almost two months of industrial action. Sales rose by 27 per cent to Won4,270bn, buoyed by strong demand in the domestic market, one of the world's fastest-growing. Exports have also increased as a result of the weak Korean won boosting foreign sales at the expense of Japanese models, sales of which have been hit by the strong Japanese yen. However, Hyundai Motor Service, the group's sales and maintenance subsidiary, suffered a 30 per cent fall in net earnings to Won13.8bn because of generous financing terms offered to customers as part of a marketing war among the country's car companies. Sales rose by 23 per cent to Won2,269bn. Kia Motors, Korea's second-largest car producer, suffered a 30 per cent fall in profits to Won3.8bn because of investment costs as it expands its car facility at Asan. Profits were also affected by the higher cost of importing Japanese components as a result of the stronger yen, which also caused foreign exchange losses on the company's yen-dominated debt. Kia is 8 per cent owned by Mazda, the Japanese car company. Sales rose by 23 per cent to Won2,300bn. Asia Motors, the Kia-controlled commercial vehicle manufacturer, achieved a 229 per cent increase in profits to Won4.4bn, while sales rose by 28 per cent to Won608bn. A recovery in facility and public infrastructure construction has increased demand for its range of heavy trucks and other construction vehicles.</p>

(Gaviota), with a proposed effective date of February 14, 1994. The Producer Group complains that the failure of Gaviota to file a tariff prior to February 4, 1994 was in violation of the Interstate Commerce Act for which appropriate sanctions should be provided. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Producer Group states that Gaviota has been operating since June 1991, and had not submitted a tariff to the Commission until it made its February 4, 1994 filing, notwithstanding that it is an interstate oil transportation company subject to the terms of the Interstate Commerce Act. The Producer Group states that oil pipelines, such as Gaviota, are obligated to file their jurisdictional rates for the Commission's examination, and that Gaviota, for almost three years, provided oil transportation service without a tariff being on file. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Producer Group requests the Commission to establish a reasonable rate for the period during which Gaviota operated without a tariff and to order refunds for any past payments in excess of that rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said complaint should file a motion to intervene or a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 214 and 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 CFR 385.214, 385.211. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before April 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Answers to this complaint shall be due on or before April 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Linwood A.

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television An evening strong on factual programmes contains two series devoted to this season's favourite subject: sex. Best by far is A Secret World Of Sex (7.30pm BBC2), a series dealing with the awful guilt, fear and persecution connected with all matters sexual in the early years of this century. Vastly inferior is ITV's Good Sex Guide (10.40pm) which seems more concerned with getting a succession of familiar telly faces on to the screen than with the standard of its journalism. Horizon tries to establish how the Egyptians built the pyramids (8.00pm BBC2). World In Action investigates the grubby activities of the Conservatives during Clinton's presidential campaign (8.30pm ITV). Cutting Edge (9.00pm C4) goes into insurance claims, especially the fraudulent sort. And Panorama weighs in, somewhat late, with a report on the British monarchy (9.30pm BBC1). BBC1's new comedy series Bonjour la Classe (8.30pm) is about a school teacher, which brings to mind 'Whacko' and 'Please Sir]'. Nigel Planer splutters energetically but to little effect.</p>

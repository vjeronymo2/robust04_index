			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Faint glimmer of hope in electricals Japan's integrated electrical companies, with products ranging from heavy electrical machinery to semiconductors and audio-visual goods, have suffered badly in the depression of recent years. Last year some were forced to report their third or fourth year of falling profits. But a glimmer of hope has appeared as they reported still weak but, in some areas, improving results for the year to last March. Mixed fortunes have also been evident along sector as well as company lines. What saved many and enabled some to report better results, was strong demand in the US for computers - which in turn supported buoyant sales of semiconductors - firm sales of components in south-east Asia, demand from domestic public utilities and the companies' own cost-cutting efforts. With economic slump damaging core business, companies' overseas earnings have been battered by strong yen. Every Y1 rise of the Japanese currency's value lops off Y1.5bn off sales at NEC, the company said. Persistent weakness in domestic private capital spending, slow consumer demand and fierce price competition put a damper on sales of many mainline products. In computers, Fujitsu and NEC, for example, suffered decreases in expensive items, such as mainframes and minicomputers. Fujitsu, which is Japan's largest computer manufacturer and the world's second-largest (after IBM), saw demand for its computers decline by 10 per cent in the domestic market, under severe price pressure. Orders for minicomputers were almost half the previous year. NEC saw shipments of minicomputers drop 26 per cent, with office servers and mainframes down 9 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. Consumer electronics was another sector which dragged down earnings. Sales of air conditioners dropped as a result of Japan's unusually cold summer last year, while audio-visual equipment suffered intensifying price competition amid the market slump. NEC Home Electronics, the company's struggling consumer electronics division, reported a loss of Y8.7bn - although this was an improvement over its Y16.7bn loss previously. Mitsubishi Electric suffered a 12 per cent drop in consumer products, and Toshiba saw an 8 per cent fall. Fujitsu's car audio division reported an 11 per cent fall in sales, largely the result of the domestic slump in cars. On the positive side were strong overseas markets and sales of a few specific products. In the US, there was a strong rise in sales of semiconductors and liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The growing popularity of advanced software such as Windows, which use more memory capacity, meant that demand for semiconductors rose more than PC sales. The shift to colour notebooks increased demand for LCDs, a sector dominated by Japanese manufacturers. Toshiba, which uses colour for more than half its notebooks, said demand for LCDs was so strong it could not be fully met. NEC's US subsidiary, which makes electronic devices, saw sales surge more than 70 per cent. The US market also pleased Toshiba with strong demand for its notebook and sub-notebook computers. Demand for electronic devices from south-east Asia was another positive factor. Toshiba reported a 9 per cent increase in exports, despite the yen's appreciation, due largely to strong south-east Asian demand for semiconductors and other components. Public utility investment helped support the companies' heavy electrical machinery divisions, with Mitsubishi Electric seeing sales rise 7 per cent. Efforts to reduce costs were a significant factor where there was an improvement. For NEC, which fell into consolidated pre-tax loss the previous year, a return to profit was achieved partly by cutting selling, general and administrative costs by 5 per cent. Prospects for the year ahead are still uncertain. Most companies expect a slow and gradual recovery in Japan, rather than a strong rebound. However, there are sectors which promise continuing strength and many electricals are planning aggressive investment in those areas in the hope of reaping further benefits. NEC, for example, is investing a further Y125bn in electronic devices, a level that is close to the company's 1992 investment peak of Y131bn. Toshiba is investing Y90bn in semiconductors alone.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------        Japanese electrical companies: Year to March 1994 (Y bn)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                Consolidated    Parent   Consolidated                               sales     sales        pre-tax  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fujitsu 1993-94             3,139.3   2,172.9           44.1 1992-93                     3,461.9   2,397.5          -16.1 Hitachi 1993-94             7,400.0   3,739.5          228.4 1992-93                     7,536.2   3,811.5          234.7 Mitsubishi Elec. 1993-94    3,105.4   2,394.0           71.4 1992-93                     3,260.3   2,493.6           79.5 NEC 1993-93                 3,579.8   2,899.3           25.1 1992-93                     3,514.9   2,869.5          -37.7 Toshiba 1993-94             4,630.9   3,256.2           90.2 1992-93                     4,627.5   3,150.6           85.9  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                      Parent    Consolidated    Parent                             pre-tax             net       net  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Fujitsu 1993-94                28.9           -37.6      17.0 1992-93                        -8.7           -32.6      -7.3 Hitachi 1993-94                71.8            65.3      45.9 1992-93                        78.1            77.3      57.4 Mitsubishi Elec. 1993-94       30.0            20.6      11.5 1992-93                        32.3            28.5      22.0 NEC 1993-93                    31.8             6.6      16.7 1992-93                        18.1           -45.2      16.5 Toshiba 1993-94                53.7            12.1      31.4 1992-93                        54.8            20.6      25.3  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Company reports  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

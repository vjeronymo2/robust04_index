			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Survey of Residential Property (1): Why estate agents long for meaty bones - When confidence blossoms the housing market will burst into life, predicts Gerald Cadogan, but big price rises are unlikely MOTHER HUBBARD'S bare, boneless cupboard offered no joy for her or her dog. Estate agents sympathise. They long for more meaty bones to throw to the many would-be buyers on their lists, who have to continue living in rented houses or flats, sustained by the hope that eventually vendors will find the same confidence to sell as they show by trying to buy. When that confidence blossoms, a true trading market will burst into life. But it is far from certain that it will bring large price increases from today's 'realistic' post-1980s levels. It is an odd situation. Encouraging signs abound. The UK appears to be the first country in the EC to be coming out of recession and, since last autumn, foreigners have shown their confidence - and taken advantage of the devaluation of the pound - by buying in London. For British owners and buyers, lower interest rates lighten the mortgage burden and houses are more affordable than for many years. But reluctant vendors are frustrating these strong stimuli. Even the stock market's sharp rise has little effect, however much it frees investors from shares that plummeted on an unexpected profits warning the day after they were bought, and releases cash for bearish sellers who think the rise will not hold. Have shares affected houses? Not yet. From June 1989 to June 1993 agents Savills' index of prime country houses (castles to cottages) has markedly underperformed the FT-Actuaries All Share index, although in the period 1979-1989 the two kept pace with growth of 16.2 per cent compound (houses) and 16.1 per cent (shares). For the whole period 1979-1993 the figures work out at 9 per cent compound (houses) and 13.2 per cent (shares), or more now with the the stock market rising sharply. Since the general election in April 1992 it has been a fractious market across the UK, trying to settle but changing tack from month to month. John Major's return produced an optimism which lasted only a few weeks. Vendors in April and May last year were lucky. Then came the season of green shoots, nipped whenever they budded. Prices continued down - as did buying once stamp duty relief for houses up to Pounds 250,000 had stopped. There was a slight upturn in September, until Black Wednesday. That was the nadir. As autumn became winter, real changes began. Foreign buyers came to London, and in the shires British farmers realised that, overnight, devaluation had turned farming to profit. Collecting more 'green pounds' from EC support payments originally expressed in Ecus, they started buying any fields offered for sale, at rock-bottom prices. At the beginning of this year, good news reached the country, often hard of hearing, that there were London buyers and that interest rates had come down. Agents reported better winter business than for many years, and looked forward to an upswing. It did not happen. Completed sales measured by the Corporate Estate Agents Property Index peaked in March. Since it has been a dance of 1 1/2 steps forward, pirouette, and one step back, to judge from the up and down news and views of the construction industry and the sometimes agreeing, sometimes conflicting Halifax and Nationwide property indices. Mild optimism prevails, which would be much stronger if more good houses were available for sale. A few houses in the country have sold for more than their asking prices when buyers were competing, as happened notably with Tennyson's Aldworth House, in Surrey, offered at more than Pounds 600,000 and sold by 'best and final' offers at more than Pounds 1m. Seven bidders were in the ring. It helped that it is in Surrey which was one of the first counties to suffer in the property downturn and is now recovering ahead of the rest of the country. The reverse is that there are still houses which are having their asking prices cut, because they were too high in the first place, and houses where agents propose a realistic 1990s price which the vendor rejects as it does not meet his 1980s-conditioned expectations. It makes it hard to sell the house, but the vendor may strike lucky. If so, he will be convinced he was right all along. An alternative that should be used more often is to have an auction with energetic marketing beforehand, thus ensuring that there are several bidders in the room. Prime country house prices showed a slight rise in the first six months of 1993, Yolande Barnes, head of Savills' residential research, says. An average increase of 2.2 per cent reversed a downward trend that had lasted 3 1/2 years. Values that were at mid-1987 levels at the beginning of 1993 are now back to autumn-1987 levels. But it would take two years of boom growth before they reach mid-1988 prices, when Savills' index had jumped 36.2 per cent from June 1987, or the peak of mid-1989 when it was up a further 2.6 per cent. Barnes expects the recovery to continue hesitant, even in the south east, and be patchy in the north and Scotland, where prices fell less and so have less to recover. In Devon, Tim Burrage, of agent Stags, reports that 'many properties are selling for a good 10 per cent more than they would have made at the end of last year.' Barnes says that, if political and economic conditions are right, prices should strengthen appreciably in 1994, as Tony Snarey and Bill McClintock must expect in buying the Cornerstone chain of estate agents from Abbey National. Earlier in the summer Snarey, went into association with Humberts in Lincolnshire and adjoining counties. In the meantime the market is soggy, as Mary Still, of relocation agent Stacks, put it. Vendors must jump in if prices are to find firm ground. Why do they hold back? Waiting until the market goes up is a large part of the story. Once bitten by negative equity, if they bought their house three to six years ago, they are now twice shy about committing themselves again. If you must move, but have negative equity, be brave. Talk to your lender. There are ways to rearrange loans. If the price of your present house has come down, so probably has the one you want to move to. You may find your pounds buying a room or two more and a larger garden than they could in 1988. Other worries may be more inhibiting. How safe is your job? Are we out of recession? Does the government really know what to do? Is it in charge? Think 'no' once, and 'no' again until the question that needs 'yes' wakes you in the middle of the night. Is it stupid to chance it now? Yes, yes, yes resounds in your head. But if the market can shift gear this autumn, house prices will probably go up a little and more people will be able to live where they wish. That will mean plenty of business for the agents and make Snarey's purchase of Cornerstone look singularly well-timed.</p>

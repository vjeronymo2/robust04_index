			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: PaineWebber and Samuel Montagu to co-operate US SECURITIES house PaineWebber and the London-based merchant bank Samuel Montagu yesterday announced plans to co-operate in the transatlantic mergers and acquisitions business. The idea is to give Paine-Webber's US clients access to strategic investors, acquisition candidates and merger partners or acquirers in Europe, while offering similar access in the US to Samuel Montagu's customers. The two companies' corporate finance departments PaineWebber has been looking to build a presence in Europe, particularly in the European bond markets. The deal will also enable Samuel Montagu to expand its horizons into the US. During the 1980s, Samuel Montagu - now part of Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation - had a reputation for working on ambitious M&amp;A deals, such as bids by UK advertising group WPP for rival US companies Ogilvy &amp; Mather and JWT.</p>

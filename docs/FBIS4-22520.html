			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Valentin Dyuryagin, president of the </F> joint-stock company Federal Chamber of Gold Trading  Transactions, by DELOVOY MIR correspondent Vladimir Kalinkovich;  place and date not given: "Supplied With Gold--A Pleasant  Surprise From the Brokers"]    [Text]    [Kalinkovich] Valentin Viktorovich, what is the point of the  work you have done to create a futures market for gold? To what  extent is all of this topical for the current Russian economy?    [Dyuryagin] In cooperation with the republic timber  exchange,  we decided to establish and properly adjust an instrument for  the gold futures market and titles of ownership for gold.  Insofar as futures trading in freely convertible currency is  developing fairly successfully in Russia at present, in  particular for the American dollar and German mark, we concluded  that the time has come to provide the opportunity for those who  so aspire, to accomplish the preparatory work for possible  liberalization of gold trading in accordance with the  president's decree on creation of the precious metals exchange  and formation of the gold market. The creation of such a futures  market seems entirely realistic to us, insofar as gold is a  commodity even more liquid than freely convertible currency. As  we know, the state is not yet regulating the free circulation of  gold in the country. Therefore, trading session participants  have decided to provisionally consider as gold "gold  certificates" of the Ministry of Finance and their shares issued  by certain banks.    [Kalinkovich] What structures are participating in the  futures trading?    [Dyuryagin] Today 36 participants have joined together in  the  futures market for gold. These are mainly insurance and  financial companies and banks. In the present stage, we see our  main objective as developing the technology of exchange futures  trading in gold. It is important here to have a certain  technological base, and in the event the Council of Ministers  adopts a resolution on creation of a "gold exchange," we will be  prepared to conduct full-fledged futures trading based on  accumulated experience. This is our strategic objective. As far  as today is concerned, market participants have the opportunity  to gather together twice a week in the exchange building and  carry on futures trading. This is purely an exchange game in  which all the participants have the opportunity to derive profit  from short-term price fluctuations. I would particularly like to  emphasize that the entire operation is built on pure enthusiasm  insofar as there is no ready market, you understand, and we all  have a sense today of being pioneers in this endeavor.    [Kalinkovich] How do your brokers feel?    [Dyuryagin] The fact that brokers working in the exchange  would so accurately divine the dynamics of price changes with  respect to futures right from the initial sessions, I will state  candidly, was a pleasant surprise to me. Their assessments  coincide virtually entirely with the conclusions of their  colleagues on the New York exchange. And today, now that a month  of operation has gone by, I find it pleasant to realize that we  are acting in unison with people who have far greater  experience. Despite the fact that there has been no shortage of  forecasters in Russia in recent times announcing the imminent  and rapid rise in price of gold to $410-450 per troy ounce, the  predictions of our brokers turned out to be the most  accurate--in actuality the price fluctuated between $380-390 per  troy ounce, which coincided virtually entirely with the dynamics  of world prices for gold. Incidentally, the recent drop in  prices at many world exchanges was accurately divined by the  brokers at our exchange. And the price has dropped here as well  over this time.    [Kalinkovich] So the fact is--all 30 or more trading session  participants do not lose? They only win?    [Dyuryagin] Naturally, winning and losing are two sides of  the same coin. But here is where the chief meaning behind the  exchange game lies. I will note that the banks that participate  in our trading sessions do not play with the assets of their  clients, but rather with their own money.</p>

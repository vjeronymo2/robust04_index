			<p>921105 FT  05 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris climbs on further rate cut hopes A TECHNICAL reaction to the Clinton victory pushed a number of bourses lower. However, the volatility of the dollar affected late-closing markets in different ways, and a late domestic boost allowed Paris to maintain its uptrend, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS was pulled up in the last hour of trading following remarks by the prime minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, that Monday's quarter-point cut in the Bank of France's lending rates would not be the last. The CAC-40 index ended 17.14 higher at 1,804.07 in turnover of FFr2.7bn, of which FFr2bn was reportedly generated late in the afternoon. LVMH was volatile on futures and options-related activity, falling to FFr3,625 before ending FFr122 or 3.3 per cent higher at FFr3,772. Peugeot fell another FFr7 to FFr504 following October's poor car sales data. There were also fears that the November data would be even worse. Eurodisney came off a low of FFr78 to close 20 centimes higher at FFr80.20 on news that its 1991-92 results would be announced on November 19, earlier than the market had expected. FRANKFURT moved with early losses on the dollar, the DAX index closing 12.31 lower at 1,472.69, against a backcloth of mounting gloom on the German economy and fading hopes of interest rate cuts. Turnover eased from DM3.7bn to DM3.6bn. Bad unemployment data added to Tuesday's chambers of commerce report, which said that west German companies were gloomier about the economy than they had been for 10 years. In addition, senior Bundesbank officials had listed a string of conditions for new interest rate cuts on Tuesday, while yesterday's central bank repo tender left short-term rates steady. Daimler was the worst blue-chip performer, falling DM16, or 3.1 per cent to DM507.50. Dealers said that the fall might reflect a forecast of lower profits from MAN, which also has truck-making in its portfolio, and which announced 4,500 job cuts. MAN fell DM2.20 to DM242.80. MILAN lost 2.7 per cent in active trading as widely-expected profit-taking emerged ahead of the close of the trading account next Friday. The Comit index fell 12.03 to 438.58 in turnover estimated at L283bn after Tuesday's L264.4bn. Among leading stocks, Fiat eased L52 to L4,548, Montedison dropped L41 to L1,201 and Generali fell L650 to L28,750. The investment bank, Sopaf, attracted buying interest after news that consolidated net profit for the fiscal year ended June 30 rose 5.4 per cent and that it was paying an additional, extraordinary dividend of L100 on both savings and ordinary shares. Its savings shares rose 7 per cent or L119 to L1,820 while the ordinary shares eased L10 to L2,900, but rose in after-hours trading. AMSTERDAM ended lower and blamed earlier softness in the dollar as the CBS Tendency Index lost 0.9 to 102.3. Short-covering helped Philips ahead of its third-quarter results, due today, as the shares added 20 cents to Fl 19.10. KLM, down 70 cents at Fl 22.10, reports its second-quarter figures today. Hunter Douglas fell 30 cents to Fl 33 as the company said, just before the close, that it expected 1992 profit to be significantly lower than the Fl 71.4m of 1991. ZURICH finished below its day's highs after profit-taking late in the session. The SMI index of leading shares added 8.5 to 1,941.8 after a high of 1,948.0. Dealers said that sentiment was buoyed up partly by the eventual rise in the dollar, but mainly by foreign orders for the index heavyweights Roche, where the certificates gained SFr20 to SFr3,780, and Nestle, where the bearers closed SFr15 higher at SFr1,050. The aluminium and chemical group, Alusuisse, responded to a favourable forecast it made at a presentation, with the bearers up SFr13 to SFr361. MADRID had a generally tranquil day, the general index closing 0.49 higher at 200.14, but the news that Huarte had won one of its biggest projects ever in a Pta60bn contract to build a workers' town in Indonesia left the construction group DM71 or 11.4 per cent higher at Pta696. STOCKHOLM retreated in moderate trading on profit-taking after its recent gains. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 2.0 to 727.8 as turnover dropped to SKr413m from SKr766m. Volvo B shares fell SKr2 to SKr252, seeing SKr250 in London later after news that the carmaker planned to close two Swedish assembly plants. Astra fell on profit-taking, with the A shares falling SKr2 to Skr587. OSLO reflected the early dollar and lower prices for Norway's North Sea oil as the all-share index dropped 6.32 to 346.10 in thin trading. HELSINKI continued to soar on strong investor interest, the Hex index putting on another 5 per cent to close 40 higher at 838.6, with the banks and finance house index up 17.3 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- November 4                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open      10.30        11.00       12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1034.33     1035.21     1036.35     1034.57 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1105.95     1106.36     1105.87     1104.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00       14.00       15.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1034.12     1035.36     1037.46     1037.06 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1104.24     1105.26     1104.40     1105.82  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Nov 3     Nov 2    Oct 30    Oct 29    Oct 28  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1038.76   1032.82   1028.47   1025.26   1028.09 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1105.49   1095.06   1090.07   1086.76   1091.64  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1037.46 ; 200 - 1107.31 Low/day: 100 - 1033.48  200 - 1100.75  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

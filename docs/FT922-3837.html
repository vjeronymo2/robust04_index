			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Botnar held 'talks' with Ford executive MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chair-man and managing director of Nissan UK, negotiated with a senior executive of Ford of Britain to head the company, it was disclosed in the High Court yesterday. Mr Ernie Thompson, sales director of Ford of Britain since 1986, said he held two meetings with Mr Botnar in April and May 1986. Mr Thompson was subpoenaed to give evidence on behalf of Mr Stan Cholaj, a former Missan UK assistant managing director, who is seeking Pounds 1m in damages for wrongful dismissal and breach of contract. Mr Thompson said Mr Botnar explained that he was seeking to negotiate the sale of Nissan UK to Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker. The Ford executive said Mr Botnar realised that 'due to the somewhat acrimonious relationship between him and the Japanese, it would be impossible for him to remain in Nissan UK, if and when the Japanese bought it'. Mr Thompson told the court he negotiated to become managing director of Nissan UK, with Mr Botnar becoming initially chairman and chief executive. He said discussions stopped when he heard that the negotiations for a takeover by Nissan Motor were not progressing.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Paris theme park woes hit Disney chairman's pocket The financial troubles of the Euro Disney theme park near Paris have claimed a new victim: Mr Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, collected no bonus in 1993 for the first time in almost 10 years as head of the Hollywood company. Walt Disney owns 49 per cent of the loss-making Euro Disney, and is involved in negotiations with the company's creditor banks for an emergency restruc-turing of its debt. Walt Disney reported a sharp drop in 1993 net income last November, to Dollars 299m from Dollars 816m, largely because of the problems of Euro Disney. It took a Dollars 350m fourth-quarter charge to cover difficulties at Euro Disney, and lost Dollars 514m on its investment in the full year. The downturn meant the company failed to meet the financial targets necessary to trigger Mr Eisner's bonus scheme, which is calculated according to a formula based on net income and return on equity. Mr Eisner received a salary of Dollars 750,000 and exercised options during the year on Disney stock valued at Dollars 202m. In 1992, Mr Eisner's bonus was Dollars 6.7m, while the year before that it was Dollars 4.7m and in 1990 it totalled Dollars 10.5m. In an interview published last week by the French magazine Le Point, Mr Eisner warned that the closure of the Paris park would be a possibility if Euro Disney failed to reach an agreement with its creditor banks.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Consumer spending boom still remote, says Mintel A CONSUMER boom is still a long way off in spite of signs of increased consumer borrowing, Mintel, the market analyst, says today. Consumers who found credit acceptable in the 1980s now regard it as debt, and their cautious attitude should dampen hopes of a rise in consumer confidence for a long time to come, Mintel argues. It finds that the recession has changed perceptions of credit for anything other than a mortgage. 'Mortgages are seen as a necessary source of debt and quite separate from other forms of borrow-ing, a sort of unavoidable evil,' according to the report. Nevertheless, it finds that many young people who have not yet taken out a mortgage are willing to live with their parents rather than commit themselves to the financial burden. Many potential new buyers are particularly put off by friends who have been caught in the negative equity trap, where the value of their mortgage exceeds the price of their home, while others are waiting for house prices to fall further. 'While home ownership remains the long-term aim, many young people are apparently willing to stay out of the market in the short term,' Mintel says. Mintel suggests that the effect will be an easing of house prices during 1993 or, at best, price stabilisation. Consumers have become wary about borrowing to buy consumer durables. Interest-free credit, however, is becoming increasingly popular, as consumers view it more as an advantageous sales-and-marketing tool than as credit, according to the re-port. Mintel also notes that the use of debit cards is rising rapidly, as attitudes towards credit cards have changed. Borrowing has shown a significant decline since 1990. Mintel estimates that there are still 1.8m households in debt in the UK, owing a total of Pounds 2bn to 3.3m creditors. It finds that consumers are trying to reduce their debt against a background of fears of rising unemployment. Figures released by the Central Statistical Office this month showed that consumer borrowing had increased unexpectedly to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 232m in March - the highest since April 1991 - from Pounds 54m in February. Mintel, however, expects the prevailing caution to persist for several years and for consumer spending to remain sluggish for the next two years. Debt] 1993, Mintel, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE.

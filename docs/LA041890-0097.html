			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> STRICTLY BUSINESS: Perish the thought that Orange County developer Barry G. Hon  bought all those golf courses because he's a golf fanatic (D1). . . . The $967  million that he'll pay for 19 golf courses and other real estate was purely a  business investment, he says. . . . "I don't play enough golf to have a  handicap. I set the record for losing golf balls wherever I play. I can hit any  pond of water anywhere in eyesight." Steve Emmons and David Reyes  </P></p>

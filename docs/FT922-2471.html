			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: SFO can compel answers REGINA v DIRECTOR OF THE SERIOUS FRAUD OFFICE, EX PARTE SMITH House of Lords (Lord Templeman, Lord Bridge of Harwich, Lord Ackner, Lord Lowry, and Lord Mustill): June 11 1992 THE SFO can compel a person who has been charged with fraud to answer questions and provide information for the purpose of a fraud investigation, and is not required to caution him. The House of Lords so held when allowing an appeal by the Director of the Serious Fraud Office from a decision of the Divisional court of the Queen's Bench Division that the respondent, Mr AP Smith was not obliged to answer questions in a fraud investigation and must be cautioned first. LORD MUSTILL said Mr Smith was the chairman and managing director of Wallace Smith Trust Co Ltd. On April 30 1991, he was charged with being party to carrying on the company's business with intent to defraud creditors. On May 7, he was admitted to bail. In June, he was served with formal notice by the SFO that he was required to answer questions or furnish information in matters relevant to a fraud investigation. The notice stated: 'Failure without reasonable excuse to comply with these requirements is a criminal offence.' The interview was to take place on June 26. Mr Smith sought certiorari to quash the decision to seek to enforce compliance. Pursuant to section 67 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Secretary of State had issued a Code of Practice for the Detention, Treatment and Questioning of Persons by Police Officers. By paragraph 10 of the Code, a person suspected of an offence must be cautioned before questions were put to him: 'You do not have to say anything unless you wish to do so, but what you say may be given in evidence.' By paragraph 16.5, questions might not be put to a person after he had been charged unless necessary to minimise harm to others or clear up ambiguity, or in the interests of justice. Before they were put he must be cautioned. By section 2(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, the SFO had power to 'require' a person whose affairs were to be investigated to answer questions or furnish information. By section 2(8), his statement might only be used in evidence against him on a prosecution (a) for making a false or misleading statement, or (b) for some other offence in which he gave evidence inconsistent with the statement. The expression 'right to silence' did not denote a single right, but referred to a disparate group of immunities which differed in nature, origin, incidence and importance, and as to the extent to which they had been encroached by statute. Distinct motives had caused those immunities to become embedded in the law. The first motive reflected the common view that one person should so far as possible be entitled to tell another to mind his own business. Secondly, there was a long history of reaction against abuse of judicial interrogation. Next, there was the instinct that it was contrary to fair play to put the accused in a position in which he was exposed to punishment whatever he did  -if he answered he might condemn himself, and if he refused he might be punished. Finally there was the desire to minimise the risk that an accused would be convicted on the strength of an untrue extra-judicial confession, to which the law gave effect by refusing to admit confessions in evidence except on proof that they were 'voluntary'. The Divisional Court declared that before asking questions relating to an offence with which a person under investigation was charged, the SFO must inform him that he was not obliged to answer, but that if he did, what was said might only be used in evidence against him where he was charged with making a false or misleading statement, or where the answer was inconsistent with any evidence he might give at a later trial. On the present appeal, counsel for Mr Smith had not pressed either of the grounds on which the Divisional Court decided in his favour - namely that the SFO was entitled to ask questions after charge but only after administering a fresh caution (see ex parte Saunders (1988) 138 NLJ 143); and that the caution would be a reasonable excuse for refusal to answer within section 2(13) of the 1987 Act. Counsel was right to take that course. Either the Director was empowered to pose questions and compel an answer, or she was not. If she was, a caution which presupposed an answer could not be compelled would be a self-contradictory formality which Parliament could not have intended. If she had no powers of compulsion after charge, the issuing of another caution made no difference. For Mr Smith it was submitted first, that on the true interpretation of the statute, the investigation and hence the Director's compulsory powers, came to an end when Mr Smith was charged (see A v HM Treasury (1979) 1 WLR 1056). The Director's powers under section 2(2) and (3) were to require the person to answer questions and furnish information or to produce documents, with respect to 'any matter relevant to the investigation'. Nobody could expect the police simply to cease work on the case and rely at trial only on the material revealed up to the moment of charging. The Director's powers of investigation were concerned with 'the affairs' of the suspect, and those must extend beyond the matters which caused the charge to be laid. The second submission was that whatever the words of the Act might mean, they must be understood as qualified by a tacit exception, preserving the ancient right of silence. There was a strong presumption against interpreting a statute as taking away the right of silence, but statutory interference with the right was almost as old as the right itself. If Mr Smith was to succeed he must show a qualification to be implied into section 2(2), that nothing in the Act should require the person under investigation to furnish information with respect to any suspected offence for which he had been charged, except to the extent permitted by the Code. That large implication was said to be justified because Parliament must have intended to preserve the long-standing immunity against questioning after charge. The argument was unconvincing. First, the notion that the moment of charging marked a watershed in the relationship between suspect and police was not strictly accurate since the duty to abstain from questioning ceased as soon as the officer considered there was sufficient evidence for a prosecution to succeed, and there might then be an interval before the decision to charge. Secondly, this particular im-munity was much less ancient than other rights of silence. It appeared to reflect a practice developed in the latter part of the 19th century, to abstain from questioning not after charge, but after the suspect had been taken into custody. Paragraph 16.5 of the Code was not directly linked to the ancient and deep-rooted privilege against self-incrimination. That privilege aimed to protect all citizens against being compelled to condemn themselves. It was in essence a development of the law relating to the admissibility of confessions. Once that was recognised the reasoning in Mr Smith's argument fell away. There was no reason to force on to section 2 an unspoken qualification with which it had nothing to do. As a matter of interpretation the Director's powers did not cease with regard to the questioning of a person under investigation when he was charged. The general provisions of the Code yielded to the particular provision of the 1987 Act in cases to which the Act applied. Neither history nor logic demanded that any qualification of what Parliament had clearly enacted ought to be implied. The appeal was allowed. Their Lordships agreed. For Mr Smith: Andrew Collins QC and David Hood (Garstangs). For the SFO: Sidney Kentridge QC and Nigel Pleming QC (Treasury Solicitor). Rachel Davies Barrister</p>

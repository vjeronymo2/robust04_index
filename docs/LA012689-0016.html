			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INAUGURATION  </P> <P> It's hard to believe that this is a democracy. Watching the activities and  ceremonies in Washington it seemed more like a coronation than a mere result of  a presidential election.  </P> <P> In the meantime, there were shootings and riots in Miami, children shot in a  California school by a madman who was able to buy a gun without any trouble,  and the homeless in Washington fed scraps from the presidential feast.  </P> <P> Outgoing President Ronald Reagan says we are celebrating "a successful  revolution" of "200 years ago."  </P> <P> Once again, Reagan has things backward, I think. I doubt whether our Founding  Fathers, who objected to the ostentatious life style of King George, would have  fought a revolution in order to emulate his hoopla in every election to a  four-year term of office.  </P> <P> I doubt whether they would have fought a revolution if "success" meant the  presidency would bring back the power and trappings of royalty.  </P> <P> SYLVIA SHAPIRO  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

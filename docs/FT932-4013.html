			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Lloyd's tightens rules on EGMs LLOYD'S OF London yesterday amended rules under which its Names can call extraordinary general meetings. The move came amid fears that such gatherings could undermine the confidence of potential investors at the insurance market. The decision increases the minimum number of signatures of Names - the individuals whose assets support the market - needed for a meeting to be called from 100 to 1,500. It is not retrospective, however and does not affect the EGM called by supporters of Mr Claud Gurney and arranged for July 5. Mr David Rowland, chairman, said: 'I am very concerned with the disruption. I must do everything I can to maintain confidence.' The changes had been introduced 'to bring Lloyd's more into line with company procedures giving members of Lloyd's rights similar to shareholders in companies'. An EGM organised last year had cost more than Pounds 130,000, and had disrupted the business of the market. Mr Rowland added: 'I can't begin to explain the enormous diversion of management time. If we are going to take the society through to a better future we have to be free to run it.' The decision met a mixed response from Names. Mr Neil Shaw, chairman of the Association of Lloyd's Members, the biggest Names' organisation, said that the change 'must not muzzle criticism or blunt reform of Lloyd's in any way'. He said, however, that the council 'has made a commonsense response in changing this unrealistic byelaw, and we believe the membership will benefit'. Mr Richard Astor, a lawyer campaigning on behalf of Names, said that the change would not thwart his own efforts to hold an EGM calling for the liquidation of Lloyd's. 'Lloyd's can run but not hide,' he said. 'This pathetic attempt to compare itself with company procedures will rebound.' Mr Astor also disclosed yesterday that he was organising legal action against at least two former chairmen of the insurance market. He would not reveal the identity of the former chairmen concerned but said Names intended to issue procedings alleging deceit soon. 'The chairmen owed fiduciary duties which they breached. They obtained the deposits of Lloyd's Names by deception,' Mr Astor said.</p>

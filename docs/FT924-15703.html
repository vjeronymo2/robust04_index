			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (20): Network matches skills to needs - User View; Regional Health Authority PERSONNEL and payroll are just two out of 25 systems which are interlinked as far as possible at East Herts Health Authority. Since becoming a NHS trust and moving its computing away from North West Thames Regional Health Authority, East Herts has installed a network of 20 DEC Vax and Microvax computers and around 200 personal computers. It has adopted an open systems computing strategy designed to enable any system to work with any other and with any data, where appropriate. This strategy led to the choice of Peterborough Software's Open Door human resources product, designed for open systems users running the Unix operating system, which enables software to be moved between different computers. East Herts had already settled on the Ingres relational database management package for other systems and chose Peterborough Software partly because Open Door runs with Ingres. 'The linking of systems means, for example, that we are not just running Open Door to pay people but also using the information in other ways from day to day,' says East Herts computing consultant, Mr Mohan Solomon. 'For instance, data is used by the nurse rostering system to match skills to needs. Previously this was done manually and a ward might get two senior sisters allocated to it.' The integration of systems also means all activities can be costed accurately; such information can be useful when it comes to looking at contracting out individual activities.</p>

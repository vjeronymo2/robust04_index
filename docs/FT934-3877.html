			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Saatchi &amp; Saatchi shares fall after profit warning Shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the heavily-indebted advertising group, fell by 23p to 157p yesterday following a profits warning. The loss of two large accounts in the US, worth Pounds 30m in revenue for 1994, plus pessimism about client spending, will lead to more redundancies. An extra Pounds 10m of severance costs in 1993 comes on top of the previously-expected Pounds 5m, said the group. Saatchi is to vacate its offices in Berkeley Square, in the West End of London, which will save Pounds 1.2m annually from 1994. Last week the group announced that Mr Charles Saatchi, who has played little part in the day-to-day running of the business, would step down as a director. He will draw a salary of Pounds 312,500 but has given up his entitlement to twice that. Analysts had been forecasting pre-tax profits for 1993 of between Pounds 24m and Pounds 29m. Mr Neil Blackley, of Goldman Sachs, who had been forecasting Pounds 25m, said Pounds 19m was now more likely. The 1993 results are due in March. His forecast for 1994 is likely to be revised downwards from Pounds 42m to Pounds 35m. Mr Blackley said yesterday: 'Everyone loses business. The problem is they haven't been winning any. It's like a football game. You're always going to let a few goals in but you've got to keep scoring more than you let in. That's what Saatchi has not been achieving.' The 1992 results, excluding the Pounds 600m of goodwill written off by the group, showed underlying pre-tax profits of Pounds 18.9m. No dividend was paid, but Mr Charles Scott, who took over as chief executive in April, has committed the group to paying a dividend in 1994. The two large accounts lost in the US were from Chrysler, the carmaker, and Helene Curtis, the haircare products company. The group has also taken soundings among its 13,000 clients and is pessimistic about spending on advertising for 1994, particularly in continental Europe and in the US. Saatchi is pitching for several large accounts, including Burger King, the hamburger chain. The warning was announced in New York at the Paine Webber media conference, attended by leading industry figures. Market, Page 38</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Christa Friedel: "Halon Disposal on </F> Verge of Being Launched"; Subheadline: "Extinguishing Agents  Harmful to Ozone and Climate Eliminated in Plasma Jet"]    [Text]Duesseldorf, 13 May 1994 -- Halons harmful to the  ozone and the climate have been banned in Germany since the  start of the year. What is to be done, however, with the nearly  8,000 tons [t] from fire extinguishers and extinguisher systems?  Solutions are now looming for the elimination of the especially  stabile chemical substances.    The use of halons as a fire extinguishing agent in the event  of a fire was a sure recourse for a long time for chemical  firms, computer centers, the federal railway and even for many  automobile operators. Halons extinguish quickly and reliably,  they do not produce toxic gases and do not damage systems and  equipment. Their special contents deserve the credit for all of  that: chemical compounds that release chlorine, bromine and  fluorine at high temperatures, putting a stop to the combustion  process.    Those times are gone: since the start of the year, the  ordinance prohibiting fluorochloro-hydrocarbons [FCKW] has  banned the production, circulation and use of fully halogenated  halons as an extinguishing agent. For such substances, similar  to FCKW, are so chemically resistant that they rise undecomposed  to an altitude of 20 kilometers [km] and destroy the protective  ozone layer there, doing so considerably more rapidly than FCKW.  Halon 1211 has been assigned an ozone destroying potential [ODP]  that is triple that of R 11, the comparable FCKW substance;  halon 1301's ODP, in fact, is higher by an order of magnitude.  Additionally, both of them contribute to a large degree to the  greenhouse effect.    For practical purposes three different halons basically  matter: bromochloro-difluoromethane (halon 1211),  bromotrifluoromethane (halon 1301), that had been used mostly in  the former laender, and chlorobromomethane (halon 1011) from the  new laender.    Making it particularly difficult to eliminate halon is its  strong chemical resistance. Although in principle elimination in  special waste incinerators is feasible, such a facility still  can handle only limited amounts of input. "After all, halons are  fire extinguishing agents," as Dr. Holger Brackemann, halon  expert in Berlin's federal department of the environment, tosses  out for consideration. More promising in this respect is a  process of Plasmactor Umwelttechnik limited company [GmbH] from  Britz in Brandenburg. In cooperation with Martin-Luther  University in Halle, Merseburg college and a research institute  in Minsk, White Russia, the firm has developed a plasma process  that was just introduced for the first time at the Hannover fair.    In it the halon molecules are broken apart in a plasma jet.  The plasma jet is generated in a plasma arc torch with air  serving as plasma gas. At 10,000 degrees Celsius [C] the  airborne oxygen splits up into avid radicals. Those radicals  react in a reaction chamber that is approximately one meter in  length with the halons and split off chlorine and bromine. Left  over as resultants are hydrochlorine (HCl), hydrobromine (HBr),  hydrofluorine (HF) and carbon dioxide.    In the second step, a sodium hydroxide solution is  introduced  through a nozzle at the end of the reactor chamber. HCl, HF and  HBr acids react with the sodium hydroxide to yield sodium salts.  This is followed by a cooling down to under 200C.  Solid-state salt that can be recycled in the industry is  recovered from the salt solution via intermediate condensers and  a number of filtering steps.    "Plasmactor's" special feature is use of a rotating plasma  jet generated by two plasma torches in a staggered formation  relative to one another. They ensure intense turbulences that  powerfully intermingle air and halons so that reaction time is  minimized and the conversion rate is increased. Plasmactor  managing director Reinhardt Schulz succinctly states: "99.9  percent of the halons are converted."    Selection of materials that have to be especially resistant  to heat is critical for the operation of the plasma reactor. The  reactor consists of a double casing of high-grade steel through  which the coolant flows. It envelops a 10-millimeter [mm] thick  interior tube of aluminum oxide that is blended with a limited  amount of other oxides. According to Schulz: "The interior tube  is capable of withstanding reaction temperatures of nearly 2,000  degrees C without any problem." On the one hand a cooling  jacket, and on the other hand the high flow rate of the gas in  the tube counteract any overheating. According to Schulz,  disposal costs are about seven German marks [DM] per kilogram  [kg].    The "Chemical Reverser" of the Concentric Maschines [CM]  firm  in Treuchtlingen in Bavaria operates according to the same  principle. In this case too, halons are broken apart in a plasma  torch, this time under pressure at approximately  2,000-3,000C. CM uses natural gas as plasma gas. The gas  releases reactive hydrogen radicals that split apart chlorine,  fluorine and bromine from the halon molecules. The resulting  hydrogen halides are neutralized with a solution of caustic soda  or caustic potash and cooled to 60C in the process.  Zettner's secret material is an inner lining of "a non-oxide  ceramic" for the reactor that is to aggressive halides. Like  Plasmactor managing director Schulz, CM developer Michael  Zettner too hopes that the resulting potassium or sodium salts  will find industrial customers.    In cooperation with Deutsche Aerospace AG [DASA], two CM  facilities, each with 1,000 tons yearly capacity, are supposed  to start operating on DASA sites in Treuchtlingen and in  Schrobenhausen in Bavaria. According to Zettner: "The  authorization process for one of the facilities is under way."  In this connection he is pinning his hope on the effect of the  new law facilitating investment that is supposed to scale the  period for authorization down to a few months. Zettner's  prognosis is: "We could get going with the disposal in the  second half of the year."    But elimination of the substance solves only one side of the  halon problem. Just as important is a dense network of  collection and return centers for extinguishers. And that could  be problematical: most of the 1.6 million portable fire  extinguishers in private residences, business and vehicles in  West Germany, in which close to 6,000 t of halon 1211 are lying  dormant, are unregistered and as a result are beyond any  monitoring. And whether the nearly 3,000 fixed extinguisher  systems containing nearly 2,000 t of halon 1301 will be properly  disposed of depends not least on the environmental awareness of  the respective owners.    It will be even harder to bid adieu to the ozone destroyers  in the new laender. Partially halogenated halon 1011 that is  widespread in them is not encompassed by the Montreal Protocol  and its production and use continues to be permitted.</p>

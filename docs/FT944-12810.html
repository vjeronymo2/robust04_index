			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / People (Names in the News): Cosmopolitan adviser at Daimler All change at Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest company, where Edzard Reuter steps down next May to be supplanted as chief executive by the boss of the aerospace division Jurgen Schrempp, writes Katharine Campbell. As Schrempp assembles his own, younger, team, the chief financial officer, 62-year-old Gerhard Liener, moves off the board in order to become the new broom's principal adviser on international affairs. The assignment is not inappropriate for the man once tipped to run the colossus himself. His role in teaching the local Swabians to think internationally has been seminal. The product himself of a solidly international background, Liener (below) studied extensively outside Germany, lived in Chile in the early 1960s before he joined Daimler, and has travelled very widely since. He is, for instance, honorary Mexican consul for the State of Baden Wurttemberg. The brains behind the co-operation with Mitsubishi, and fluent in English, Spanish and French, he masterminded last year's New York Stock Exchange listing. He is also the progenitor in the last couple of years of the company's move towards global sourcing. Now that Liener is relegated to an advisory role, however, who will pipe up at board level to ensure the company continues its fight against provincialism? Instead of looking outside, perhaps for a non-German, the supervisory board is expected to confirm in the position Manfred Gentz, a 42-year-old lawyer who has spent his working life at Daimler in seemingly solidly domestic jobs. While he has run Debis, the service and computer software subsidiary, for the past four years, the company is unforthcoming on the subject of Gentz's linguistic abilities.</p>

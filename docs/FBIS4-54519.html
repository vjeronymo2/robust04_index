			<p>BFN     [Text] The Hungarian and Slovak prime ministers have met in  Komarom. As planned originally, no agreement has been signed at  the talks between Peter Boross and Jozef Moravcik. However, the  two discussed the situation of the Hungarian minority in  Slovakia, the Boes [Gabcikovo] Dam, the elimination of double  taxation, and the opening of new border crossing points.    At the joint news conference it was said that the greatest  achievement of these Hungarian-Slovak prime ministerial talks is  that a new phase will begin in bilateral relations. The meeting  made possible the settlement of the disputed issues at a later  stage, it was said at the press briefing.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DRESS CODE DISPUTE PUT ON HOLD FOR HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> Student indignation over a new dress code at Peary Junior High School in  Gardena, which was to be capped with a sit-in by protesters last Friday, was  defused when Principal Alvin L. Hayes Sr. offered to discuss the new standards  with the students after the winter holidays.  </P> <P> A group of about 20 students had planned the sit-in to protest the code on the  last day before winter break, but classmates failed to join them in a walkout  after roll call.  </P> <P> "I think they were afraid," said Michele Martinez, 13, who waited with other  students for more than an hour for their classmates to join them. "There were  police everywhere."  </P> <P> Two unmarked Gardena police cars and four patrol cars were sent to the campus  after school security officials requested backup, said Lt. David Morgan of the  Gardena Police Department.  </P> <P> The protests were prompted by a revised dress code imposed by the school's  shared-decision-making council -- a group of parents, teachers, community  members, the principal and one student.  </P> <P> Nearly 180 students walked out Dec. 12, and about 15 students walked out the  following day, Hayes said. Students said more protesters scaled fences to leave  campus on both days.  </P> <P> The dress code, which went into effect Dec. 11, prohibits such clothing as tops  that expose bare midriffs, garments printed with suggestive language and items  associated with gangs, including hats, hair nets, bandannas and gloves.  </P> <P> Students objected most vehemently to restrictions banning a single earring,  which school officials said is sometimes a symbol of gang affiliation, and  clothing with holes, including blue jeans with tears.  </P></p>

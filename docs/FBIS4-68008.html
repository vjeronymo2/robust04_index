			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- President Richard von Weizsaecker has  amnestied terrorist Bernhard Roessner (47), who was sentenced to  life term of imprisonment. This was announced by the  President's Office in Bonn on Monday [2 May] upon inquiry. The  amnesty of Roessner, who was involved in the attack on the  German Embassy in Stockholm in 1975, will become effective on 16  May.    Roessner has been in prison in Straubing for almost 19  years.  In November 1992 Justice Minister Sabine  Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger ordered a suspension of the sentence  for 18 months because of Roessner's state of health. Since then  he has been undergoing urgent therapeutical treatment near  Kassel.</p>

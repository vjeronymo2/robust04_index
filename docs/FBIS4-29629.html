			<p>BFN     [Text] Nusa Dua, Bali, June 16 (OANA-ANTARA) - Indonesia  hopes that every signatory of the General Agreement on Tariff  and Trade (GATT) will participate in all GATT meetings, open its  market, and abide by all GATT regulations.    The Indonesian hope was expressed by Coordinating Minister  for Industry and Trade Ir. [academic title] Hartarto in his  speech read out by his assistant, Kosim Gandataruna, during the  closing ceremony of the 10th International Apparel Federation  (IAF) convention here on Wednesday.    The minister said that in the next 10 years when the Uruguay  Round is already completed, there would be stiffer competition  in the domestic market.    "But for Indonesia, he said, "it would not then be a new  thing as the country has already made it as a policy."  [quotation marks as received]    He said we are only trying to resist now to be able to  compete either in price or quality.    "Industries should do their own homework, while the  government gives support by providing a better climate for  investment," Hartarto said.    He also pointed out Indonesia's textile and its product  (TPT)  as one of the country's basic export goods and that it could  well be improved for better international market competition.  [sentence as received]    The IAF convention which was opened by President Suharto was  held from June 14 to 15. It was attended by some 300  participants from 20 IAF member countries.</p>

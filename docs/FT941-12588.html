			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Gummer council order unlawful, says court The government's review of local authorities in England was seriously damaged yesterday after the High Court ruled that Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, had acted unlawfully in calling for the two-tier structure of county and district councils to be abandoned in all but 'exceptional' circumstances. Two-tier local government now seems likely to remain intact in most of rural England, outside counties such as Avon and Cleveland, created by the last reorganisation in 1974. But the Department of the Environment said it intended to continue with the review, which aims to produce plans for restructuring all non-metropolitan England by the end of this year. The new authorities are set to start in April 1996. The decision came as opposition to the Local Government Commission's reforms built up rapidly among Conservative MPs, especially in the Yorkshire region and the West Country. Sir Marcus Fox, MP for Selby and chairman of the 1922 committee of Conservative MPs, said backbenchers were 'generally very concerned'. Mr David Rendel, Liberal Democrat local government spokesman, called for the government to abandon the review. 'This farce has gone on long enough,' he said. 'Local government does need reform, but not in this way.' The High Court judgment followed an appeal by Lancashire and Derbyshire county councils against guidance Mr Gummer gave to the commission last September. This said: 'In some areas the commission may wish to recommend a continuation of the existing two-tier structure. But the government expects that to be the exception, and the result will be a substantial increase in the number of unitary authorities in both urban and rural areas.' The court said Mr Gummer exceeded his powers in saying this, because the legislation, introduced in 1992 when Mr Michael Heseltine was environment secretary, had instructed the commission to find out whether public opinion in an area favoured reform before making recommendations. It stated no preference between unitary and two-tier councils. Mr Gummer may appeal against the ruling. Sir John Banham, chairman of the commission, had already attacked the guidance, saying ministers had been 'pushed into a position where they are predicting the outcome of the review'. He added that there was nothing to stop the commission recommending the status quo for many more English counties, if this was supported by public opinion. They could 'opt in' to the review at a later stage, via a petition of residents, once other unitary authorities had been established. But this proposal was rejected by Mr John Major, the prime minister, last July.</p>

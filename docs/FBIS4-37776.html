			<p>BFN     [Text] Over the last four months there has been a sharp  drop in the number of attacks and disturbances in the Gaza  Strip, Judaea, and Samaria. This was said today by Chief of  Staff Ehud Baraq to the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense  Committee. Lieutenant General Baraq is not convinced that the  present situation will continue over the long term. He says we  must prepare for the possibility that Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] and the rejectionist organizations will increase their  activity. Our correspondent Tamar Asalem reports from the  Knesset:    [Begin recording] [Asalem] The Knesset Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee was today presented with figures pointing to a  decrease in the number of attacks in Judaea, Samaria, and the  Gaza Strip, as well as inside the Green Line. During April, 108  attacks were registered in Judaea and Samaria, compared to 78 in  May, and 47 in June. The respective figures for the Gaza Strip  were 120 in April, 48 in May, and 10 in June. In the Green Line  there were 38 attacks in April, 15 in May, and 5 in June. The  chief of staff noted this is a significant drop in the level of  terrorism. He added, however, that we cannot rule out a  possibility of an increase in the number of attacks in Judaea  and Samaria, excluding Jericho.    [Baraq] I would not build on this decrease over the long  term. I sincerely hope this situation continues to prevail in  Gaza and Jericho. We must prepare for the possibility, however,  that I will be proven wrong and that Hamas and the rejectionist  organizations will try to increase their activity in Judaea and  Samaria or inside Israel.    [Asalem] Regarding Hamas activity, the chief of staff added  his impression -- which is based on the Palestinian impression  -- that Hamas influence in Gaza and Jericho is waning. Perhaps  this is related to Israel's withdrawal from those areas. The  Palestinian police have also played a part in this development.  Baraq added, however, that activity in the mosques continues as  usual.    Asked about extending the autonomy area in future, Baraq  said  the issue is still far off on the agreement's agenda. Baraq  said that Israel's security interest in Judaea and Samaria goes  beyond safeguarding the settlers and has to do with deployment  for the event of a war on the eastern front.    Lt. Gen. Baraq also spoke about the situation in south  Lebanon, saying that Israel is doing everything possible to make  life difficult for Hizballah by dictating terms for it.    [Baraq] Over the recent past, since the abduction of al-  Dirani, the Air Force attack, and other successful operations,  Hizballah has suffered a series of severe setbacks and lost  dozens of its fighters, with many dozens being wounded.  Obviously they continue to seek for ways of retaliation.  Yesterday they attacked us successfully from their point of  view, and painfully from ours. We will have to do everything  possible to prevent the recurrence of such attacks. At the same  time we must realize that the struggle in the security zone will  continue.    [Asalem] The chief of staff was asked whether Syrian  involvement in south Lebanon is growing deeper. His answer was  negative, but he added that in his opinion Syria is pleased with  every successful Hizballah attack against Israel. [end  recording]</p>

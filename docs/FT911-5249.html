			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Competing with Germany: A hard act for Britain to follow - The difficulties of transplanting positive features of Germany's 'social market economy' to other societies The Leuna works in east Germany offers some instructive messages for foreign observers wondering how Germany's consensus-based approach to economic and social management is facing up to the challenge of unification. Last year it was thought that the vast, outdated complex, near Leipzig, which marks its 75th anniversary next month, would eventually be dismantled and closed under the murderous pressure of western competition. Now, although the original 27,000-strong workforce will be cut by half, the German government is spending hundreds of millions of D-Marks to keep large sections of the plant functioning. President Richard von Weizsacker, who recently toured the Leuna works, last week hailed 'exemplary' co-operation on the site 'between men and women, east and west, management and unions'. Mr Wolfgang Schultze, vice-chairman of the German chemical workers' union IG Chimie, who is deputy chairman of Leuna's new supervisory board, says boldly that the company's resurrection will demonstrate the success of the 'German model'. For Britain, the principles at the heart of the German 'social market economy' - costly but co-operative relations between both sides of industry  -represented the antithesis of the policies of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. Under the leadership of Mr John Major, official British scepticism to the German system has given way to outright admiration. Last month, in a speech in Bonn, Mr Major went out of his way to praise Germany's 'social solidarity' in the organisation of the economy. Although Britain has by no means ditched Thatcherite belief in enterprise and self-help, the Major government believes that German-style consensus can improve rather than weaken economic efficiency. Britain's change of heart comes at a time when there is increasing pressure on the German system. Amid rising unease over large-scale unemployment east of the Elbe, it is still far from clear whether west Germany's 'social market economy' can put down roots in the former communist-run east. There are similar difficulties in transferring the 'German model' to the UK. Tied to Germany through the D-Mark link in the European Monetary System, the UK now faces the challenge of importing the positive parts of the German consensus system, while rejecting those elements that are plainly wasteful or inappropriate. Wholesale introduction of expensive and bureaucratic German-style consensus into land unprepared for it, or unable to pay for it, can have disastrous consequences - as east Germany is finding out. Total west German social expenditure last year came to roughly one-third of gross national product. 'We are a rich society, and we are willing to pay a certain price for social peace,' as Mr Karl Otto Pohl, president of the Bundesbank, puts it. The extent to which methods of running societies can be transferred across national borders is also questionable. Germany's consensus system is a product of Germany's own specific history and culture. The traditional charitable role of the Roman Catholic church, or Bismarck's social legislation of the 1880s, leaves deep imprints. Industry-wide collective bargaining between employers and workers' representatives has its roots in the wage negotiating system set up in 1918 to help bridge social fissures left by defeat in the First World War. Strong checks and balances in German decision-making are partly a product of post-war federalism. Economic power has been deliberately decentralised. One reason for firm German advocacy of an independent central bank is the memory of Third Reich totalitarianism, when the Reichsbank was subjugated to Adolf Hitler. It is uncertain how many German organisational precepts can be transferred to Britain. In view of Britain's lack of experience in running an autonomous central bank, if the Bank of England were made independent, 'it could upset the markets", comments Professor Forrest Capie of the City University Business School. Another German trait which may prove difficult to export to Britain is 'long-termism' in relationships between companies and banks and other institutional shareholders. Shareholders' willingness to maintain their corporate links over long periods, paying less attention to short-term performance, has its origins in the final decades of the 19th century, when many of Germany's largest concerns were founded. Shareholders not only are less demanding in their criteria for return on investment; German company legislation also gives them fewer rights to check and control management than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents. One result is that west Germany is estimated to have only 3.5m individual shareholders (7 per cent of the adult population), against 12m (24 per cent) in Britain. (The UK figure is considerably boosted by the large number of small and inactive shareholders who acquired privatisation stocks during the 1980s.) German business leaders freely proclaim the virtues of the German approach - especially now that the image of British and US stock markets has been dented by too many free-wheeling takeovers in the past few years. Similarly, there is now near-consensus in the UK that lack of 'patient long-term money' has contributed to Britain's relative industrial lag. Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of the Deutsche Bank, scathingly describes as 'financial acrobatics' the tactics of acquisitive UK groups such as Hanson. He points to the benefits of the bank's long-term relationship with companies like Daimler Benz, in which it has a 28 per cent stake. 'For some companies in difficult phases of growth and restructuring, it can be very useful to have a stable shareholder who accompanies them benevolently through this phase - and does not complain about the need to maximise pay-outs or profits every quarter.' Despite the strength of much of Germany's collegiate management, even corporate spokesmen like Mr Kopper acknowledge that unduly cosy ties between German companies and shareholders can reduce market disciplines. In parts of the economy, 'we need more pep,' Mr Kopper admits. The large number of areas where British and German structures remain far apart underlines the difficulties of grafting the German 'model' on to the British economy. But they also set out an agenda for Britain to learn from the German experience: Regional development. German decentralisation has spread economic growth more equitably. The most prosperous part of Britain - south-east England - has increased its share of UK gross domestic product over the past 20 years (from 35.1 per cent to 35.6 per cent) while poorer northern regions have fallen further behind. By contrast, North-Rhine Westphalia, the German state with the largest population and the bulk of German industry, has fallen during this period (from 28.5 to 26.2 per cent) - and formerly lagging regions like Bavaria and Rhineland Palatinate have come to the fore. Education. In contrast to comprehensive schooling dominating British education, the principle of 'streaming' prevails in most of Germany, reflected in the numerous types of secondary schools. Whereas during the 1980s the majority of British children left full-time education at the age of 16, about 55 per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds in Germany remain in school. Labour relations. German industry-wide trade unionism and 'co-determination'  -representation of trade unions on supervisory boards - remain powerful factors dampening labour flare-ups. The number of registered trade union members has risen slightly in west Germany in recent years to 9.5m at the latest count, whereas the total in Britain has slumped to 10.2m. During 1987 to 1989, for every 1,000 employees, west Germany lost an average three days per year in labour disputes - compared with 169 per year in Britain. The German strike pattern could nevertheless deteriorate as a result of worsening economic difficulties in east Germany. Vocational training. The German 'dual system' - where young people undergo in-company training combined with technical and general courses at outside colleges - is one part of the 'model' which Britain is already trying actively to imitate. There are about 15m trained German workers, three times the figure in Britain. There were 65,000 apprentices in British manufacturing industry last year, together with 41,300 other trainees. The number of apprentices in German manufacturing, by contrast, is about 610,000. Housing finance. In the UK, financial deregulation and incentives for home ownership spurred an unparalleled surge of bank lending for mortgages in the 1980s. This was one factor behind the 1983-88 credit-driven boom - and the inflation at the end of the 1980s. British commercial banks' real estate lending rose from 12 per cent of total loans in 1980 to 23 per cent in 1989, with housing loans up from 4 per cent of the total to 12 per cent. There has been no such diversion of resources into property in Germany. About 65 per cent of UK homes are owner-occupied (compared with 50 per cent in 1971), whereas the proportion in Germany is only 40 per cent. Even though Germany is suffering from a severe housing shortage, banks' real estate lending remained steady as a proportion of their overall loans during the 1980s. Technology. According to Mr John Dryden, head of the scientific, technical and industrial statistics division at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD): 'There is a realisation in Germany that the right kind of infrastructure for innovation and technical progress has to be put into place. And this is concentrated in the sectors where the rewards are likely to come.' West Germany's annual research and development spending came to between 2.8 and 2.9 per cent of GNP towards the end of the 1980s, compared with 2.3 per cent in the UK. Mr Heinz Riesenhuber, the German technology minister, says he misses not having a British opposite number. The famed German cultural bias towards the engineer may be a reality. This is nevertheless not borne out by the biographies of some of the countries' captains of industry. Only two of the chairmen of Germany's top companies measured by turnover have a scientific education (one as a chemist, the other as an engineer), whereas four are lawyers. In the UK, three of the top 10 chairmen have a scientific or technical background - and only one studied law.</p>

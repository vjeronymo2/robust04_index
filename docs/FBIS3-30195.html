The national door must be opened even wider when  market-oriented production is the common trend in the world. In  this trend, the thought of producing everything for our  consumption is not beneficial. [passage omitted]    How can we change social production to a social possession  form? Historical reality shows that it is a natural development  process of the production force. Only the strong development of  the production force can create the absolutely necessary  requisite conditions for socialism. Marx said poverty will be  common if these requisite conditions do not exist. Deprivation  will exist and the need to fight for necessary materials will  return. People will plunge into their old garbage dump.    Our country is transitioning to socialism without a  capitalist regime. It means that we do not have enough of those  absolutely necessary requisite conditions. These conditions  must be understood in light of the background that the world is  entering its third millennium. We must open our door because of  that very basic reason. Determination, even iron-like  determination, is not enough to build the necessary material  requisite conditions. Worse still, it is too little. Together  with that iron-like determination, we must have giant material  establishments, hundreds of billions of dollars in capital, and  modern techniques and technologies. Otherwise, economic lagging  will be certain. We must also have a broad external market and  socioeconomic management knowledge that is suitable to  civilization. But these are things that our country is severely  deprived of at the moment. And the opening of the door is  mainly to reduce deprivation or, as Lenin said, it is a method  to seek the contribution of external hands to our undertaking.    But will we be able to implement our intention? The  historical reality and results of years of renovation have given  us an affirmative answer. During the Leninist era, while Russia  was in the aiming sight of imperialism, there were people  entering the country, not from their charity, but from their  greed.    Today, according to the French Communist Party's judgment,  imperialism is still an economic and political imperialism.  Moreover, it is also a justice imperialism, as remarked by  Ramsay Clark, former U.S. attorney general. [passage omitted]    A special character of our living at this time is the world  economic race in the background of competition and cooperation  on the basis of mutual existence. This background, together with  challenges, is creating favorable opportunities for us. The  increasing dependence among different nations means that we need  them, but that they need us as well.    Therefore, opening the door is necessary and possible. But  how to open so the owner is not blown away by hurricanes and the  house does not become a hut in the wilderness? What can we do  so that we do not lose ourselves? That is where the key issue  rests. Can we manage in a way such that only we receive the  benefits? Lenin denounced this idea by saying that whoever  wants to sign a land lease agreement on the basis of communist  principles should be put in a mental hospital.    According to a review of the Committee for International  Processing Zones, good processing zones must have favorable  labor conditions such as low wages, good workers, and  concessional taxes. In conclusion, both economic and political  benefits must be favorable. And this should be made clear.  Even former U.S. President Richard Nixon, in his strategy to  destroy the USSR, said clearly in 1988 that the requisite for  material aid and its use was aimed at provoking the fight for  national rights in the USSR; if the devil of self-esteem and  national hatred was aroused, the door for peaceful evolution  would be widely open.    Everybody must seek their own benefit. Therefore, the  dominating principle is bilateral benefit. There can be winners  and losers when the door is already open. The important thing  is that we have to realize the changelessness and the content  and limit of the benefit upon which the two sides have agreed.  We need to have a clear concept of our benefit, realizing  temporary and long-term benefits and fundamental and secondary  benefits. The fundamental and long-term benefit to our country  is that we have to develop our production force at all means to  build socialism. That means that we cannot fall on the concept  of one-sided economy and one-sided marketing. Every economic  development step must be a better step for the implementation of  social fairness to strengthen economic independence and social  stabilization. [passage omitted]    Under present conditions where our country is adopting a  market-oriented economy and an open-door policy, the legislative  system must create a safe corridor of laws for various trade  activities to create a favorable and safe environment for  foreign investment in Vietnam and to maintain order in economic  management. It is necessary to make extensive use of principles  in civil laws by harmoniously combining the long-lasting  character of principles with necessary institutional renovation  to suit changes in economic relations and to ensure the  feasibility of projects, and so forth. [passage omitted]    We need laws and also economic strength to protect  ourselves.  We must create economic spearheads in the context of  interdependence and in the internationalization of production.  Although we need the assistance of other countries, we should  not allow ourselves to be viewed as less important by them  because this will make it impossible for us to avoid being  dependent on the outside. The self-governing character in the  open-door period must also be guaranteed for various substantive  issues. In his time, Lenin came up with many specific  stipulations such as on the question of land lease; on how to  improve the livelihood of workers; restore and develop the  working class, market products, and fix sale prices; on  conditions for hiring local and foreign workers and for ensuring  their material life and payment; on whether local specialists  could be allowed to work for foreign countries; on regulations  governing scientific and technical activities and trade union  organizations, and the like.    Although there are many other specific matters to be taken  into account, the quality and abilities of the persons involved  in this field of activity are, after all, deciding factors.  This is because political incapability and ignorance will be  reasons for failure. As the country is just opening its door, so  many noteworthy incidents have occurred. Price bargaining is a  fact of life. But if workers of certain factories place their  boss above all, if both the host and guests collude with one  another in turning their joint venture into a site to consume  obsolete machinery and equipment and unsalable goods of other  countries for the purpose of tax evasion and tax fraud, if 70  percent of the total machinery imports are the kind that need to  be thrown into a junk yard as cited in NHAN DAN, we hardly will  be able to protect ourselves from succumbing to the influx of  foreign money and goods.</p>

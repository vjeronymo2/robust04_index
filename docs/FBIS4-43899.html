			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- According to Defense Minister Volker Ruehe,  the European countries must cooperate more closely in the field  of armaments. At a hearing of representatives from the German  arms industry, Ruehe said in the Bundestag Defense Committee on  Thursday [23 June] that in view of the armed forces in Europe  becoming increasingly multinational, it is neither sensible nor  worthwhile for states to make single-handed efforts at equipping  their armies with modern material. The minister demanded that  minimum capacities be preserved in the German defense industry.    Ludolf von Wartenberg, the main manager of the Federal  Association of German Industry (BDI), demanded that the arms  industry be given security of planning and a "clear  orientation." The committee agreed that a "defense technology  basis" must be preserved in Germany. Ruehe pointed out that the  German arms industry must maintain its capacities for the  construction of aircraft, helicopters, tanks, submarines, for  the production of modern ammunition, and in the field of  electronics for modern weapons.    The minister said Europe simply cannot afford several  competing weapons systems of the future generation. All  countries need fewer and different weapons, and they have less  money and over capacities in the arms industry. According to  Ruehe, almost 100,000 people in Germany have lost their jobs in  the arms industry since the beginning of this decade. The  current employment figure of some 140,000 could be further  reduced by 30,000 to 40,000.    In order to keep the Bundeswehr modern and operational, a  sound relationship between operating costs and investment is  necessary, Ruehe emphasized. The share of investments in the  defense budget, which has dropped to almost 20 percent, must be  increased toward 30 percent again. The German armed forces must  cut down on personnel costs and use all possibilities of  rationalization. The crisis reaction forces must be given  priority with equipment. The deficit is to be removed gradually  in this field, Ruehe said.</p>

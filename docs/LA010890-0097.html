			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SUSPECTS NABBED AFTER CHASE  </P> <P> A 17-year-old suspected of robbing a convenience store today was arrested after  driving a stolen vehicle off a freeway embankment during a high-speed police  chase, authorities said.  </P> <P> The suspect, whose name was withheld because of his age, was treated for minor  injuries.  </P> <P> A passenger, Brian David Hall, 19, is in critical but stable condition at Long  Beach Memorial Hospital, Officer Richard McMillen said. Both are from Corona,  he said.  </P> <P> Police responded to a robbery call from the Circle K market on Stanton Avenue  near Manchester Boulevard in Buena Park about 4:15 a.m. today, McMillen said.  The manager of the store said about $60 was taken. Witnesses said the robbers  drove off in a white Ford.  </P> <P> Police saw a vehicle matching that description entering the Riverside Freeway  westbound from Beach Boulevard shortly after the incident. The driver refused  to stop for police, and a chase reaching speeds of 90 m.p.h. ensued, McMillen  said.  </P> <P> The pursuit lasted less than five minutes and ended with the Ford driving off  an embankment near the 1700 block of Ardmore Avenue in Bellflower, he said.  </P> <P> The youth was in Juvenile Hall after being booked for suspicion of robbery and  possession of a stolen vehicle, and Hall is to be booked for the same crimes  when he is released by the hospital, police said.  </P></p>

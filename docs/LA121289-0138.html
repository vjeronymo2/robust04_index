			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HAZELWOOD CAN'T CLAIM IMMUNITY IN OIL SPILL, JUDGE RULES  </P> <P> An Alaska judge today upheld state criminal charges against Joseph Hazelwood,  skipper of the Exxon Valdez supertanker responsible for the nation's worst oil  spill.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone ruled at a pretrial hearing that the  43-year-old Hazelwood is not entitled to immunity under a federal law designed  to protect those who report oil spills.  </P> <P> However, Johnstone has yet to rule on other defense motions to dismiss up to  six felony and misdemeanor charges filed against the fired master of the  987-foot tanker that ran aground March 24 in Prince William Sound.  </P></p>

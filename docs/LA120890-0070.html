			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: LUGGAGE CARTS NOW FREE FOR LAX FOREIGN  TRAVELERS  </P> <P> In a move to make Los Angeles International Airport more "passenger-friendly,"  Mayor Tom Bradley announced this week that luggage carts are now available free  of charge to travelers arriving from foreign countries.  </P> <P> Until this week, tourists from abroad and others arriving at the airport's Tom  Bradley International Terminal had to pay $1 to rent the carts, which are  generally free at the nation's other major airports.  </P> <P> "Now those who come into this terminal are going to be able to get their  luggage out of this terminal without any further complaints to me and I'm happy  about that," Bradley told a news conference.  </P> <P> For those travelers who did not carry U.S. currency, arriving at LAX was often  a frustrating experience because they had to claim their baggage and go through  Customs -- sometimes a drawn-out ordeal -- before they could exchange their  money and retrieve a cart.  </P> <P> Now, travelers will be able to collect a cart as soon as they disembark.  </P></p>

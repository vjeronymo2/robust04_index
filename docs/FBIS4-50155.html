			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive interview" by XINHUA reporter Huang Huizhu (7806 </F> 1979 3796) with Russian State Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin:  "Developing Russian-Chinese Relations Suits the Interests of the  Peoples of Russia and China"]    [Text] Moscow, 11 May (XINHUA) -- Russian State Duma  Speaker Ivan Rybkin will lead a delegation to make his first  official visit to China on 14 May. On the eve of his departure  for China, he enthusiastically agreed to give an exclusive  interview to this XINHUA reporter at the Duma building in the  center of Moscow.    Rybkin entered the State Duma as a representative of the  Agrarian Party in last December's Russian parliamentary election  and was later elected speaker of the State Duma.    When entering his large and bright office, people will  immediately notice a large map of Russia. His furniture is  plain and simple. A three-color Russian national flag stands  beside a large desk. Rybkin is 47 years old, wore a black suit,  and appeared to be prudent, competent, and experienced.    Naturally, Sino-Russian relations are the major topic of our  interview. Rybkin pointed out that Russia and China are two  great neighboring countries. The two countries should get along  harmoniously and amicably, develop extensive cooperation, and  deepen mutual understanding. Development in this regard suits  the interests of the two countries' peoples. He maintained that  currently, Russian-Chinese relations are normal. However, to  further develop Russian-Chinese relations and to achieve better  results in bilateral cooperation, both sides still have a lot of  work to do, and they should make joint efforts to resolve some  existing issues. Rybkin resolutely pointed out, "The successive  visits to China by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin and myself fully  demonstrate that Russia truly wishes to deepen the friendship  between the peoples of Russia and China and to develop mutually  beneficial Russian-Chinese cooperation in various fields."    Commenting on the purposes of his first visit to China,  Rybkin indicated that he is very eager to establish and develop  friendly relations between Russia's new parliament and China's  National People's Congress, and to enhance exchanges and  cooperation between various parliamentary committees of the two  countries. "I want to see for myself how China's legislative  and executive organs cooperate with one another."    The Russian State Duma speaker has been very interested in  the experiences and accomplishments of China's economic reform,  especially rural reform. He said, "I have studied China's  reform carefully and have found that its experiences are very  significant to Russia because there are many similarities  between Russia's and China's economic structures." "Why has  China's reform been able to accomplish remarkable results? Why  has China been able to maintain political stability while  carrying out reform? Why has China been able to attract so many  investors?..." Rybkin hopes to learn the answers to these  questions during his short visit of a few days.    When commenting on Russia's domestic situation, Rybkin  stared  at the large map of Russia on the wall and said pensively,  "Russia has a vast territory and abundant resources. Russia  will be able to extricate itself from crises as long as every  Russian makes efforts to increase harmony in an all-round  manner, to realize true stability, and to pursue pragmatic and  feasible economic reform policies."    Brought up in rural areas by Volgograd, Rybkin still  cherishes rural life. He insists on planting some potatoes  every year when he has free time. He likes to play chess and is  good at repairing cars. He has a happy family. His wife is a  schoolteacher, his first daughter attends college, and his  second daughter is a high school student. The whole family's  valuable treasure is their home library, which has lots of  books. The common temperament, interests, and hobbies that he  shares with this wife have brought warmth and harmony to the  whole family. Rybkin regrets that after he became the Russian  State Duma speaker, he was forced to give up his hobbies.    At the end of the interview, Rybkin expressed once again his  hope that his trip to China will further enhance the  understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two  countries.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Takeshi Domon, critic: "By Year 2000, Imports </F> Over 2 Million Tons May Be Constant"]    [Text] Dogmatic Agricultural Policy    Let us try retracing the recent "Heisei rice riots" just a  bit. That a gap would appear quite early in the supply and  demand for domestic rice had long been predicted. Probably it  was early July 1993. About then, the people involved had seen  that rice imports could not be avoided. By late July, there was  even talk of the volume imported possibly being over a million  tons. By mid-July things were such that the Food Agency director  rushed off on an inspection of crop conditions. Quite recently,  the Food Agency director of that time has frankly admitted to "a  tardy decision on importing."    Why was it so slow? It was because the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries [MAFF] agricultural policy  was a "dogmatic farm policy": We won't accept the import of even  one grain; we'll maintain food security guarantees and domestic  self-sufficiency in rice. (Preserving self-sufficiency is not  dogmatic, however.) -- At that juncture, the Uruguay Round  negotiations were being held and would get down to serious  business in the early fall, so that in the ministry they could  not say a word about imports. The general elections were held in  July, and on 7 August the Hosokawa regime was born. It was about  20 August that officials ended their summer vacations and were  back in their offices. Then, slowly and reluctantly, they had to  get to work on imports.    And yet, having a dogmatic agricultural policy, they had not  checked on which countries raise how much of the rice that  Japanese can eat, or how much of it is exportable. Only in  September did all newspapers carry the data that the Food Agency  had hastily prepared. That was statistics from the FAO [UN Food  and Agriculture Organization] (United States Department of  Agriculture) [as published]. But, according to that data, 14  million tons of Japanese rice were produced in 1992. That pads  the actual figure by as much as 40 percent. All they had in hand  were such flimsy statistics. Then they urged trading companies  to collect information on rice produced everywhere, and it may  have been about 10 September that they were finally becoming  prepared. Next, they had the trading companies make purchases.  It was mid-September when that finally began operating. It was  about 20 September when the Chicago grain market price shot  upward, underscoring this.    How much was bought as a result? As for rice produced last  year, in the United States and Australia most was raised under  contract. Thailand produces just a little Japonica rice. Next,  making the confusion worse, they bought processed rice, saying  it was for staple food, and made the public eat that. Moreover,  it was at such extralegal prices... It is blunder after blunder.    So, why did it go so far as "rice riots"? From about the  time of the 1992 crop they knew that rice stocks were  inadequate. So, the open-market rice price was high in early  1993. What did the Food Agency do then? They quit publishing  their supply and demand program. Things turned strange from that  point; and since they were keeping the data hidden, instability  on the market evoked even more instability. The reason the  instability did not quiet down after the uproar began, no matter  how many appeals the Food Agency and MAFF made on television,  may have been because of their keeping all the information  secret and not agreeing to make it public.    The elderly want to eat the domestic rice they have consumed  for many years. So, they frantically tried to get domestic rice.  This is natural for consumers. And yet, the Food Agency is now  trying to shift responsibility for that to some of the free rice  dealers. However, that is wrong; and, particularly because they  had kept the information hidden until the panic broke out, the  instability grew more violent. That means the responsibility of  the Food Agency and agricultural policy is greater. They opened  up a gap of as much as 2.7-2.8 million tons and still their  after-the-fact handling was almost haphazard.    So, how will it be this year? To predict that, one must  better analyze the structural reasons for why we had a crop  failure last year. It is wrong simply to pass it off by saying  it was the bad weather.    There are a number of primary factors, the greatest being a  structural cause: a decline in farmers' technological  capacities. Since farmers for whom that is a secondary or side  job are the overwhelming majority, they squeeze rice planting in  during the May holidays. For both Aomori and Iwate, where the  index of planting conditions was extremely bad, the best time  for rice planting was about 18 May; but they did it during the  early May holidays since they could not get time off. When they  plant before temperatures have risen, damage will be great even  from slight weather fluctuations.    There also are problems with the varieties planted. Farmers  say they cannot sell rice which is not the tasty Koshihikari  strain of rice. This tendency grew strong especially with the  market created in Tokyo and Osaka from December 1990. Yet, what  we call agriculture has its basis in the proper land and proper  crops. That is being disregarded.    So, one cannot attribute the rice shortage of 2.7 million  tons to weather factors alone. The extreme decline in farmers'  technical abilities made it even worse. And the primary causes  for the decline in their technical abilities are the food  control system which postwar farm policies created and the paddy  reduction policy. So long as these structures are not quickly  changed, it is quite possible that the same kind of damage will  emerge hereafter, too.  <H5>  Agricultural Policy Reform: Year One </H5>   I believe this year is a very vital one for Japan's rice  farming. Last December, the rice issue in the Uruguay Round was  resolved in the form of a partial opening. I divide the time  after that into three stages. First, 1994 is the first stage.  1995-2000, the period of minimum access, is the second stage.  And 2001 and beyond is the third stage, that of tariffication.    I think this first-stage year should be year one for reforms  in agricultural policy. Which is to say that during the six  years starting next year agricultural policy reforms will be  required, differing from the past by giving answers within set  time limits. Then, in 2001 tariffication will begin. The MAFF  says it has not necessarily promised tariffication, but that is  false. It may have been given a grace period for the very reason  that it gave a secret promise of tariffication. All the more  reason why it must take on reform of agricultural policy with  firm resolve.    What should it have done first this year? I think it should,  in principle, have abolished paddy reduction and let rice be  produced freely. Having the least price flexibility, grains need  production coordination. But, there are problems in enforcement  by community units, disregarding the individual's capacity for  ingenuity, as our country's paddy-reduction policy has done. The  MAFF says it has not used compulsion; but it has simply avoided  soiling its own hands, using other ways to make local  governments and agricultural cooperatives do it. Farmers have  been angered by repeated paddy reductions, and the best young  people have all left.    What is vital is to let them produce freely. Also, subsidies  would not be given to those producing freely. Instead, they  would be allowed to sell freely. That is the foundation and is  so-called optional production regulation. For those agreeing to  production regulation, a set subsidy would be given. It is quite  unfair to treat farmers with small farms and large-scale farmers  the same in this.    Yet, the government says that in the Uruguay Round  negotiations last year it reluctantly agreed to market opening.  That is false. The Food Agency well knows that if the market is  not open there will be major trouble with its supply and demand  program after the year 2000. They have done a certain simulation  but are hiding it carefully. It says that, even if paddy  reductions all cease after the year 2000, there will be constant  shortages of two to three million tons just like last year's.    One proof of that is in the pamphlet Points of a New  Policy, which they put out. In it is to be found "Trends  and Outlook for Those Engaged in Mainline Agriculture." This is  a simulation, which the MAFF based on the 1990 census, of how  the number of persons engaged in mainline agriculture will  change by the year 2000. For example, persons including both men  and women under age 60 engaged in mainline agriculture numbered  1.62 million in 1990. By 2000 they will number 810,000--just  half as many. If those engaged in agriculture fall by half, a  simple calculation would show that current productivity cannot  be sustained unless the area each person farms doubles. Will it  double in the next seven years? That is hopelessly impossible.    If they cannot reform agricultural policy hereafter, a  supply  shortage of 2.5 million tons of rice will become an established  fact, even if paddy reductions are eased. An era in which, if  one eats four bowls of rice one would be imported rice, would  come to stay after 2000. Not only that, but if we have slightly  unusual weather like last year there could be shortages of 4-5  million tons and we could even see an era where one of every two  bowls of rice would be imported rice.    So, was not such a to-do created now because their awareness  of the situation was too easy going? That is how hard-pressed  Japan's agriculture is becoming.  <H5>  Induction of Competition Principle </H5>   Naturally, reform of the food control system will be  necessary. Indeed, rather than reform, first it should be  abolished. After that there should be thorough discussion in the  nation about how food controls should be. The government's role  is to maintain emergency reserves. If the government takes  responsibility as an independent nation for minimal reserves,  could it not win public approval for that? Of course it would be  the government's duty to have a rationing system in times of  emergency. Yet, keeping the distribution of all rice under its  control by a staff of as many as 12,000 even in normal times is  anachronistic in the extreme.    Moreover, food control and distribution is multi-tiered and  based on farm cooperative organizational lines. The basic form  is, first, from the primary collection agents to the economic  associations, national farm cooperative association,  wholesalers, retailers, and finally to consumers. Among other  products, there are few that go through a distribution process  of five to six stages. The stance is clear of vainly claiming a  role for food controls in times of emergency and then protecting  entrepreneurs with interests which they cling to. Farmers, too,  should think about what merits the food control system has for  them as producers.    Aside from this year, a 72-liter sack of ordinary rice is  33,000 to 34,000 yen at the retail stage. With the producing  farmers' take at 20,000 yen, a margin of 13,000 yen or almost 40  percent being added on is itself fundamentally strange. Is as  much as 40 percent in intermediate distribution costs necessary?  This should be thoroughly debated. The distribution of other  products has been considerably rationalized, with pluses for  producers and consumers alike. And yet, the food control system  benefits neither producers nor consumers. The intermediate  entrepreneurs in agricultural cooperative organizations and in  wholesaling and retailing are taking a considerable margin. As  all are licensed tradesmen, the competition principle ultimately  does not operate.    Henceforth we will enter the era of tariffication. Imported  rice will come in constantly. Dramatic arguments will fly about  such as that imported rice is risky and domestic rice is safe.  This campaign waged by the central body of the national farm  co-ops mocks producers and consumers alike. From now on, price,  safety and flavor are things the consumer will choose. That is  what the age of tariffication will be. The period for getting  ready for that should be thought of as that of minimum access.    What are we to do specifically to reform agricultural  policy?  First of all, we should abolish the food control system, and the  government should play a minimal role, such as keeping a set  amount in reserve. A staff of 3,000 would suffice. Then, freeing  up domestic distribution, it should quickly accept the entry of  new wholesalers and retailers. Competition principles would be  introduced also for agricultural cooperatives. All should be  competing. If that is done, rice consumption will surely grow.  To reform agriculture or distribution while limiting new entries  and protecting vested interests would be like spitting into the  wind.    With the farm population declining, we must devise measures  for the successors with firm resolve. New entries have increased  considerably in truck farming. Their not increasing in rice  farming is due to the existence of the food control system and  paddy reduction policy and always taking actions that limit  competition. To make rice farming something with appeal we will  make the competition principle prevail. If we do so, excellent  young people will come and join in. They will want to make money  in agriculture.  <H5>  Turn Attention to Farmland </H5>   Problems with the farmland law may become the biggest topic.  The farmland law is a bottleneck because it makes expansion in  scale difficult. All have had their focus diverted to food  controls and paddy reduction; but more attention should be  directed at farmland, and public discussion should develop on it.    The price of farmland is too high relative to its product.  That is because it is a price valuated as a farmer's asset  rather than as a means of farm production. So, they do not want  to let go of it. Thus, they cannot buy farmland and cannot  expand in scale. If they try to lease land, no one will lend it  to them.    One more problem is that of basic maintenance. The MAFF so  far has invested much money in basic maintenance. On average its  standard is 30 ares per paddy field; but this will not fit well  with an era of tariffication. To date, an international sense  and point of view on continuing to protect Japan's agriculture  beyond the present day may have been wanting.    Then, what should be done? In principle, it is to ease  limits  on farmland ownership and instead tighten restraints on usage  and prevent diversions. Also, for farmers wishing to expand in  scale the government should provide 100 percent financing. In  exchange, resale would be barred for a certain number of years.    The biggest point for farm administration reform henceforth  is the course of rice prices. Now is a time of peak prices, so  that eventually rice prices will fall. As of the year 2000, the  price for domestically produced rice may fall by one-third of  today's price. It is seen that in Hokkaido it will be 10,000  yen, 15,000 yen in average locations, and the Koshihikari rice  from Uonuma County in Niigata will possibly top 20,000 yen. The  question will be whether, at an average of 15,000 yen, farm  management will be commercially profitable. Farm managers must  create this management plan.    What should be done to make it pay? The one thing to do is  expand in scale. And make direct sales, eliminating the  middleman's margin in distribution. However, since costs for  farm direct sales such as home delivery charges are too high, I  think that in any case it will die down unless substantial added  value is applied to it. After all, will it not be desirable for  the agricultural cooperatives to do it collectively or for  large-scale producer groups to make direct sales as wholesalers  and retailers?    Most important now is to incorporate as a system the  conditions that will cause young people to come in and let their  individual ingenuity be fully exercised. I think that is a real  burden-carrying measure. We need to change the approach of  agricultural policies treating the community as their  foundation, using compulsion and subsidies to make people  listen. We must definitely have MAFF officials become aware that  farm policies have failed because of these things.    Speaking of the agricultural cooperatives, basically they  make money on rice and financing. Agricultural co-op finances  are extremely exposed to competition and troubled by holding  large sums in bad loans. The same holds true, too, for  rice--their other pillar of support. Last fiscal year more than  2 million tons of rice were imported; so their commissions were  down for fertilizer and other farm chemicals for domestically  produced rice. What are agricultural cooperatives to do about  this? Moreover, tariffication of rice, while a plus for  producers with get-up-and-go, may ultimately see the MAFF also  giving priority to investing in farmers who have been selected  out. At such time, if the agricultural cooperatives do not take  countermeasures they will suffer their worst damage.    What is important is for the agricultural cooperatives  themselves to use this six years of minimum access era to create  low-cost production and distribution systems. Without that, when  tariffication begins in the year 2001 it will set up conditions  under which they would not even be in the arena of competition.  In name and fact it would mean the agricultural cooperatives  would be completely forsaken.    There are a variety of limiting conditions; but if reform of  agricultural administration can be accomplished, superior  farmers will thrive. Nor must the agricultural cooperatives fear  competition. It is competition that is the wellspring of  development. So, may not the only way to survive be to make a  100-percent change in past ways of doing things?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [As received via ANSASERVICE database] </F>   [Text] Rome (ANSA), 7 Dec -- Electric Porter, a vehicle  that combines Piaggio's 20-year experience in this specific  sector of mobility and transport, is making its debut at the  Bologna motor show. Developed in collaboration with the  Micro-Vett company of Imola, Electric Porter has been presented  in the four or six-seater minibus version, a transport van with  a 500-kg load capacity, and a pick-up garbage truck with a  400-kg load capacity. All the versions have a compact and  silent M100 electric engine developed by Mico-Vett, which has a  10 kw capacity practically without any need for maintenance.  The management of the engine unit is handled by a high  frequency electronic control unit that is highly reliable and  silent and that permits the vehicle to provide a more than  appreciable performance in urban traffic. In order to maximize  its acceleration and range the maximum speed has been contained  at 55 km per hour. In addition to the normal braking system,  Porter Elettrico has an electric braking system which, in  addition to slowing down the vehicle, transforms part of the  kinetic energy that develops when braking into electric energy  that goes to automatically recharge the batteries. Particular  emphasis has been placed on the range of the vehicle. It is  exempt from car ownership tax and its insurance rate has been  reduced by 50 percent, therefore it costs only 50 lire per  kilometer. The on-the-road selling price for the minibus version  of Electric Porter is 35,280,000 lire. Sales will begin in  January from Piaggio's sales network.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / International Company News: Danish insurer improves but passes dividend TOPDANMARK, the Danish insurance and financial service group, will not pay a dividend for 1992 in spite of a substantial improvement in the group's performance last year. The group has given no explanation for the cancellation after paying 10 per cent in 1991, but it is understood that it is a gesture to the group's employees following a reduction in staff by 18 per cent last year in a rationalisation programme. Topdanmark, which is a participant in the European Eureko insurance alliance, cut its loss in 1992 to DKr53m (Dollars 8.68m) from DKr273m in 1991. The group's two insurance divisions were profitable last year.</p>

			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> MAYOR WILL REQUEST CHANGES TO CHARTER  </P> <P> Fulfilling a campaign pledge, Mayor Sally Anne Sheridan tonight will try to  start undoing a 1987 ballot measure that calls for the direct election of the  city's mayor.  </P> <P> Sheridan, Irvine's second directly elected mayor, will ask City Council members  to approve a City Charter amendment that would return the job of filling the  largely symbolic position to the City Council.  </P> <P> Her proposal also calls for the city election date to be moved from June of  even-numbered years to November.  </P> <P> If the council approves Sheridan's request, the proposed charter amendment  would go before Irvine voters this November. Electing a mayor creates the  impression that the position carries a great amount of authority, Sheridan  said.  </P> <P> "I'm sitting in the seat now, and the amount of perceived power that individual  has in this system is awesome," she said. "I think it can be destructive to the  city manager form of government."  </P> <P> Irvine, like most Orange County cities, is run on a day-to-day basis by a city  manager hired by the council, which makes major policy decisions. Having a  directly elected mayor creates an illusion that the mayor wields more power  over the city than does a regular member of the council, Sheridan said.  </P> <P> By returning selection of the mayor to the way it was before 1987, she said,  the city also would solve problems created by Measure D. Voters approved  Measure D in 1988 to spell out an alternate process of replacing a council  member who runs for mayor and wins, leaving an unexpired seat on the council.  </P> <P> A lawsuit and legal wrangling over how to interpret Measure D have cost the  city $163,000.  </P> <P> "It's been a fiasco," Sheridan said Monday.  </P> <P> A 1987 law said the council opening would be filled by the runner-up in the  City Council race. But Measure D added a proviso that if residents could gather  signatures from 7% of the city's registered voters, the position would be  filled through a special election.  </P> <P> Sheridan's proposed charter amendment would delete Measure D.  </P> <P> If approved, the charter changes would begin with the November, 1992, election,  leaving Sheridan as mayor for the next two years. Two council seats set to  expire in July, 1992, would have their terms lengthened five months because of  the change in the election date.  </P> <P> Larry Agran, whom Sheridan defeated for the mayoral post last month, supported  the measure to have an elected mayor. He said that it would eliminate the  back-room politicking among council members and that it would make the mayor  more accountable to voters.  </P> <P> Instead, Sheridan said, Agran used the seat to try to wield more power over  city administrators.TOM McQUEENEY  </P></p>

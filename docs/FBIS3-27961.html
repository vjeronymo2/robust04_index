This is a topic of press commentaries here today.    In a commentary titled "Arrest in Public and Release Through  Back Door," NODONG SINMUN says:    The traitor Kim Yong-sam shouted himself hoarse about  "reform" and "eradication of irregularities" under the  "civilian" veil. This was, however, no more than a  popularity-hunting tactics to improve his public image and a  base "political retaliation" to revenge himself on political  forces that had laid obstacles to his seizure of power and  remove them from the political scene.    Whenever the rulers changed in South Korea, a loud  advertizement was made about the "uprooting of irregularities,"  but it got nowhere anytime. [sentence as received]    If there was anything different in case of the traitor Kim  Yong-sam, it was the greater pomp in the advertizement about  "eradication". But it has turned out to have been an empty  slogan as he set free the criminals.    It is an unpardonable crime of the traitor Kim Yong-sam to  have fooled the popular masses with the signboard "uprooting of  irregularities."    The traitor Kim Yong-sam is stringing out a high-flown  jargon  to appear "upright." But he is the chieftain of irregularities  and the target of overthrow.    The traitor is not "liquidating irregularities" but  persecuting and arresting people of conscience who exposed them.    Noting that the Kim Yong-sam group released the criminals  who  had been prosecuted under arrest on the charge of bribe taking  and irregularities in personnel affairs of the Army in less than  one year, MINJU CHOSON says: This shows that the puppets'  patronage of the suspects of irregularities has entered an open  stage.</p>

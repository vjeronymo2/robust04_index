			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Week in the Markets: Zinc price rally goes into reverse for the time being at least. The rally sparked off two weeks ago by news of an Australian output cut became history this week when prices at the London Metal Exchange slipped back to the levels ruling before the cut was announced. The zinc market had been trading sideways for some time before it was wakened from its slumber on January 28 by Pasminco's announcement that it was restructuring its loss-making lead and zinc operations at Broken Hill, New South Wales, with the result that zinc production would be reduced by 25,000 tonnes a year. While the tonnage involved looked unimpressive when set against the 1m tonnes of zinc in western world stocks the news raised hopes that enough companies would follow Pasminco's lead for substantial inroads to be made into those stocks. Those hopes were nourished last week when Cominco of Canada, and Ruhr-Zinc of Germany, a Metallgesellschaft subsidiary, weighed in with cuts amounting to 80,000 tonnes this year. That was enough to keep the three months delivery price near the post-Pasminco peak of Dollars 1,137 a tonne, but the market was still looking for more, much more. In the absence of further cuts this week - the only production announcement was about a 70,000-80,000-tonnes-a-year rise planned by Spain's Asturiana de Zinc - the market went into reverse. As LME warehouse stocks of the metal rose by another 12,300 tonnes on the week to a record 537,225 tonnes the three months price slid close to Dollars 1,070 before finding support yesterday. At the close it stood at Dollars 1,082 a tonne, down Dollars 46 on the week. The copper price was supported early in the week by the threat of a strike by workers at Poland's KGHM, but it went into decline when the strike plan was called off and the three months position, which had peaked at Pounds 1,585 on Tuesday, closed yesterday at Pounds 1,581.75 a tonne, up Pounds 26 on the week. However, sterling's weakness was again the main support of copper; in terms of the US currency the price was down Dollars 8 on the week. Dealers said hopes raised by improving US economic data were counteracted by low European physical offtake of copper and by the continuing high level of CIS shipments. The strongest LME contract was nickel, which reached four-week highs early on and moved on to Dollars 6,170 a tonne for three months metal in midweek as concern about tight scrap supplies in western Europe was backed up by bullish technical factors. The investment fund buying that had fuelled the rise then dried up, however, and the price dropped back by about Dollars 100 before recovering yesterday to Dollars 6,152.50 a tonne, up Dollars 225 on the week. Among the precious metals palladium was the liveliest performer as supply tightness, widely attributed to reduced Russian shipments, encouraged Japanese buyers. The London price climbed to Dollars 119 a troy ounce, adding Dollars 4.10 to last week's Dollars 2.75 advance, before falling back Dollars 3 yesterday after a Russian official insisted that his country was still meeting all contracts to supply the metal to world markets. Traders had earlier suggested that increased Russian sales to the Far East had reduced availability for the US and Europe. The gold market tried to break through both ends of its recent narrow trading range this week. Physical offtake prevented a breach of the Dollars 327-an-ounce level on Monday and a move above Dollars 332 on Thursday ran into determined selling. Yesterday the price fell back Dollars 3.30 to Dollars 328.45, up 45 cents on the week, and some traders were predicting a renewed test of the Dollars 327 support. At the London Futures and Options Exchange's robusta coffee market bearish technical factors continued to vie with bullish fundamentals - and a narrow verdict went in favour of the former. Heavy selling in New York's arabica coffee market on Monday night was followed by a dip to Dollars 853 a tonne for London's May delivery position on Tuesday. But the buyers were soon back and the price touched Dollars 945 a tonne on Thursday. Yesterday saw another swing of the pendulum, however, and the London price closed at Dollars 916 a tonne, down Dollars 15 on the week. Thursday's strength had been encouraged by news that Brazilian coffee exports dropped sharply in January compared with the same month last year. Shipments were down 71.2 per cent, from 2m bags (60 kg each) to 578,000 bags. With an average price of Dollars 53.88 a bag, compared with Dollars 68.95 in January 1992, revenues were down even more sharply, by 77.5 per cent. In addition to reduced supply, the drop was blamed on a seven-day port strike, according to the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters. Latin-American coffee-growing nations were yesterday expected to sign a declaration aimed at kick-starting stalled efforts at reaching a new economic coffee pact, Venezuela's deputy foreign minister said in Caracas, according to the Reuter news agency. Mr Fernando Gerbasi said the statement would be directed at the International Coffee Organisation and would be signed by regional presidents who are in Caracas to forge a free trade pact between Central America, Venezuela and Colombia. 'Our intention is to make a call for us to once again enter into negotiations, especially with important countries that have a special weight on production,' he said.  ---------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  ---------------------------------------- Aluminium      +3,675  to  1,639,300 Copper         +1,500  to  318,875 Lead           +1,400  to  235,200 Nickel         +486    to  80,304 Zinc           +4,900  to  537,225 Tin            -25     to  16,930  ----------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / International Company News: Italian carrier acquires 30% stake in Malev ALITALIA, Italy's state airline, yesterday cast aside its long-declared policy of avoiding alliances and equity stakes in other airlines by buying a 30 per cent share in Malev, the Hungarian national carrier. A further 5 per cent is being bought by Simest, a recently-created Italian state agency to promote investment abroad. Together the consortium is paying Dollars 77m for a combined 35 per cent share. The value of the deal to Malev has been enhanced by Alitalia's undertaking to transfer routes to the Hungarian airline, increasing the total value of the transaction to around Dollars 100m, bankers said. Alitalia will gain three seats on Malev's nine-member board as well as appointing two of the seven representatives on its supervisory board. The Italian carrier will be 'deeply involved' in strategic decisions taken by its Hungarian partner. However, Mr Andras Pakay, managing director of Malev, said important strategic decisions would be taken jointly. Malev will also retain its national identity. The Italian offer easily beat a rival bid from Lufthansa, the German flag carrier, which was prepared to pay Dollars 59m. Only Dollars 9m-Dollars 10m of that would have been in cash and an association with Lufthansa would have almost certainly quashed Malev's ambitions to develop intercontinental routes. The deal is the latest in a series of equity links between west and east European companies. Earlier this year, a consortium headed by Air France took 40 per cent of CSA, the Czechoslovak carrier, for Dollars 60m. LOT of Poland and Balkan of Bulgaria have also appointed financial advisers to search for western partners. Alitalia and Malev intend to integrate their services starting from the summer 1993 timetable and develop Budapest as a third hub alongside Rome and Milan. Alitalia will also gradually transfer to Malev exclusive rights to fly between Italy and Hungary. The two companies gave no estimate for the impact on sales and earnings of the tie-up. Malev's pre-tax earnings of over Dollars 28m last year made it eastern Europe's most profitable airline. The company's 1m passengers last year contributed to sales of Dollars 315m. Alitalia, one of west Europe's largest airline with over 17m passengers, lost L35bn (Dollars 25m) in 1991 on sales of almost L6,000bn. Malev will use the proceeds to finance the 15 per cent down payment on two new extended-range Boeing 767 aircraft due for delivery next year and for further computerisation. Malev currently operates 18 Russian-made Tupelov jets.</p>

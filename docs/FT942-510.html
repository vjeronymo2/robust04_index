			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / US stirs plutonium dispute 'Reactor grade' plutonium - produced in commercial reactors - can be used to build nuclear bombs, according to information released by the US Department of Energy. The US government has revealed in a 200-page statement declassified on Monday that it detonated a nuclear bomb at its underground test site in the Nevada desert in 1962 using 'reactor-grade' plutonium from a UK reactor. The UK government has argued that plutonium from civil reactors does not pose a security threat because constructing a bomb from the fuel is extremely difficult. The UK's Department of Trade and Industry, which is responsible for British Nuclear Fuels, said yesterday: 'This test proves that it (using plutonium from reactors to make bombs) is possible. But our understanding is that the difficulties involved in practice were such that no one would really dream of trying it.' The plutonium used in the US test was derived from military work carried out by the UK Atomic Energy Authority at the Calder Hall reactor at Sellafield, the DTI said. BNF said yesterday: 'We have always said you need considerable skill to make bombs from reactor-grade plutonium, not that it is theoretically impossible'. But the Washington-based lobby group Nuclear Control Institute called on Britain to 'halt. . . needless production of weapon-usable plutonium'.</p>

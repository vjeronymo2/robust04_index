			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Ceasefire 'survives' as US aircraft fire missiles in Iraq US aircraft again fired missiles yesterday at an Iraqi air defence battery that had turned on its radar, but neither side seemed anxious to declare that the ceasefire ordered by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had broken down. Iraq said it had no missile batteries in the area. US officials said the activation of the radar could be a deliberate provocation by Iraq, but added that it was also possible that an individual anti-aircraft battery had not received or had disobeyed the ceasefire order. Orders issued to US, French and British aircraft patrolling the two air exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq have not changed since the new US administration of President Bill Clinton took office on Wednesday. Pilots may fire to protect themselves in the event of any hostile or threatening action by Iraqi aircraft or ground defences. Threatening action certainly includes 'lock-on' by fire control radar attached to anti-aircraft missile batteries. Pentagon officials say a pilot on the receiving end of these high frequency radars generally knows he is seconds away from being a missile target. It is less clear whether coalition aircraft are also authorised to fire when they are 'painted' or 'illuminated' by search radar, which operate at much lower frequencies. US aircraft on Thursday attacked a radar which had merely illuminated them, but immediately before the radar was switched on they had come under anti-aircraft artillery fire. President Clinton and his advisers have made clear that they are sticking to the policy of insisting that Iraq comply fully with United Nations resolutions, and of responding to any threat against allied aircraft in the no-fly zones. James Whittington in Baghdad adds: Diplomats in Iraq said yesterday the regime seemed to have reversed its former aggressive tone towards settling the crisis, but questioned whether it would last. All heads of the remaining diplomatic missions in Baghdad were yesterday summoned to the Iraqi foreign office to be told by the foreign minister, Mr Mohammed Sa'id Kazin al Sahhaf, that Iraq intends to stick to its ceasefire. The minister denied that its army had triggered Thursday's attack in the north by switching its radar on. The regime has published an opinion poll showing that 82 per cent of Iraqis said they supported Mr Saddam Hussein's peace initiative while 18 per cent said they wanted further military confrontation.</p>

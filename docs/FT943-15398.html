			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Xenova forced to scale down flotation in US Xenova, the Berkshire bio-technology company, has been forced to scale down its flotation in the US as a result of the weakness of the stock market. The company said yesterday that it had raised about Dollars 10m (Pounds 6.5m) through the sale of 1.25m American Depositary Share units at Dollars 8 each. The price values Xenova at about Dollars 80m and the units are trading on the Nasdaq market. In February, when plans for the flotation were set in motion, the company had hoped to raise about Dollars 45m. Xenova now has Pounds 30.7m in cash, enough to last about 18 months. The company is likely to have to raise more cash, but is likely to seek corporate partners rather than make further share issues. Each ADS unit, representing one Xenova share, is accompanied by an ADS conversion right which will convert on July 14 1995 into a maximum of 0.22 of an ADS based on the performance of the unit price compared with quarterly target prices. The company has long planned to float in the US, where investors are more accustomed to biotechnology companies characterised by years of losses before a product reaches the market. Xenova specialises in the rapid screening of large numbers of potential drugs derived from fungi, bacteria and plants. The company's advisers in the flotation were Paine Webber, Lehman Brothers, Cowen and James Capel.</p>

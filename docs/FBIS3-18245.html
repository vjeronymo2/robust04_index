Yesterday night, rather unexpected riots broke out in Brussels.    They were caused by two events occurring close to each  other.  On the one hand, there was a lecture (with a movie performance  of Schindler's List) by Jewish Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in  Hotel Metropole at the Place De Brouckere, and on the other hand  a demonstration of the Anti-Imperialistic Union, associated with  the PvdA [Belgian Party of Labor], and of Youngsters for  Palestine at the Place de la Monnaie. The latter learned about  Wiesenthal's lecture, and headed for the Place De Brouckere.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yelena Tregubova: "`Reputation' Is Marching in </F> Step with the `Patriots'; The Airing of a Victory Day Show on  the Moscow Network Has Been Postponed"]    [Text] On 3 May the editorial staff of the Moscow  Television Network (MTK) apologized to the viewing audience for  the "teleplay" of the Continent Russia Studio that had been  shown on the "Reputation" program on 1 May. I will remind our  readers that the host of "Reputation," Emil Kotlyarskiy,  complained about the plethora of shopkeepers in Moscow and said  that he, "a native Muscovite," could remember "when the capital  smelled only of tangerines and lollipops" and advised the  creation of a "volunteer corps of crime-fighters." Furthermore,  Mr. Kotlyarskiy went on to name the chief criminals. In his  opinion, they are the leaders who caused the collapse of the  great Union and the disbandment of the KGB. At the end of the  program he declared that when this corps begins to fight for "a  people's victory," the loss of human lives will be inevitable,  but "these losses will be justified."    Just four days later the MTK management had to acknowledge  that the producers of the program had effectively issued a  televised appeal for violence and had thereby violated, at the  very least, the law on the media. As MTK Program Director Igor  Arbuzov assured the SEGODNYA correspondent, he saw the show for  the first time when he was "watching TV at home." The Continent  Russia Studio of the Congress of Russian Communities pays for  the air time and furnishes its own videotapes. According to Igor  Arbuzov, studio Chief Kotlyarskiy was supposed to bring the film  to the MTK editorial office three days before it aired, but he  brought it only on the morning of the day it was shown "and  because of this our technicians did not have a chance to review  it."    Emil Kotlyarskiy himself, however, assured the SEGODNYA  correspondent that Mr. Arbuzov has always allowed him to bring  the tapes for "Reputation" in on broadcast day because "the  program director and MTK Editor-in-Chief Aygar Misan have  treated the Continent Russia Studio with great affection and  trust from the very beginning of our association."    Igor Arbuzov did not conceal his "affection" for the  "patriotic creative team." He explained with pride that it was  the MTK that had agreed to broadcast Kotlyarskiy's "extremely  talented film" about Vladimir Vysotskiy a year ago (the message  of which, viewers will recall, was that if Vysotskiy were alive  today, he would support today's "Russian patriots"). The  "Reputation" program has been part of the MTK broadcasting  schedule since February of this year. One of the earlier shows  was also debated by Muscovites for a long time because of the  question the "Reputation" hosts had asked Vladimir Zhirinovskiy  and Chairman Dmitriy Ragozin of the Congress of Russian  Communities: "Would it be better to be born a Jew or not to be  born at all?" Incidentally, Mr. Arbuzov had this to say about  that show: "There is no question that the boys have their own  ideas about everything, but the program was quite interesting!"    The latest show, however, which justified the sacrifice of  human lives for the sake of some kind of "people's victory by  the native Muscovites" was, as Igor Arbuzov put it, "a bit too  insensitive." It is true that Emil Kotlyarskiy said, just a few  days after the broadcast, that what he had in mind was just the  creation of "people's brigades, which would request permission  to bear arms legally and would protect people from gangsters  when they come home late at night: They could meet them at the  subway station and walk them home, or, perhaps, screw in new  light bulbs in dark entryways...." When he spoke of "justified  losses," the filmmaker apparently was referring to people who  might be killed by an electric shock when they screw a light  bulb into a faulty fixture.    In the fear of possible legal action, the MTK program  director reported that he was removing the next episode of  "Reputation" from the program schedule for 8 May and would not  air any other Continent Russia shows until he had "received a  precise explanation of what had happened from the producers."  Judging by all indications, however, this statement was purely  declarative, and the "patriotic studio's affectionate  association" with MTK will continue. Emil Kotlyarskiy confided  in the SEGODNYA correspondent: "Arbuzov assured me on the phone  that very day that the next episode of 'Reputation' will be  shown on 15 May." It is interesting that the show that was  planned for 8 May and was "removed from the schedule" was made  especially for Victory Day, which many communists and "patriots"  have chosen as "the first day of the decisive offensive." The  25-minute program, according to Mr. Kotlyarskiy, was an excerpt  from his film "Barricades on the Ruins of the Empire," with the  October armed rebellion as the "main theme," interspersed with  clips from newsreels showing, for instance, Marshals Zhukov and  Rokossovskiy marching in the Victory Day Parade." The director  acknowledged that the show also included "a few of my own  comments," and that is why the film, which was supposed to have  been shown on the eve of the communist demonstrations in the  center of Moscow, was not only about the victory in the  Patriotic War, but "about victory in general...."    Even if this film is removed from the schedule for 8 May, as  the MTK director promised, Mr. Kotlyarskiy feels "it is certain  to air a short time later." He said that "another appropriate  date for a show on victory has been recommended to us: 24 June,  the anniversary of the parade in Red Square commemorating the  victory in the war."</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CYPRESS DOWNS DEVELOPMENT BALLOTING TODAY  </P> <P> The polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. today in Cypress as voters decide  the fate of the controversial Cypress Downs development, a proposed 167-acre  business and recreational complex surrounding Los Alamitos Race Track.  </P> <P> The only item on the special election ballot asks Cypress' 23,491 voters  whether a zone change should be approved for one of the largest remaining open  spaces in northwestern Orange County.  </P> <P> Supporters of the project spent more than $215,000 in a mail and publicity  campaign, all but about $645 of the money contributed by SDC Co., the Newport  Beach firm that will buy and develop the land if the measure passes.  </P> <P> The opponents, Concerned Citizens of Cypress for Greenbelt and Open Spaces  Preservation, raised only $25,989, which was less than its $38,870 campaign  debts. They contend that the Cypress Downs development will increase traffic  and lower property values. Under present zoning laws, the land may be developed  only for public or semipublic uses.  </P></p>

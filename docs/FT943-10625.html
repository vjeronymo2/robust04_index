			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Three die as strike shuts down Lagos Government offices, banks and factories in Nigeria's biggest city, Lagos, were deserted yesterday, the first day of an indefinite general strike which has been called to force the military government to release the detained opposition leader, Mr Moshood Abiola. There were outbreaks of violence in the city, as police attempted to dismantle barricades and diperse protesters, leaving three people killed in clashes. In Abuja, the capital, the trial of Mr Abiola, the unofficial winner of last year's presidential election, was adjourned again, this time until August 16. He is being tried for treason after he declared himself president on June 12, the anniversary of last year's vote. The judge said he needed time to decide whether the court has jurisdiction to try an offence allegedly committed in Lagos. At last week's hearing, the prosecution was forced to admit that it lied to the court when denying that it had received the defence's petition. As the prosecution case falters, Gen Sani Abacha's government seems unsure how to end the deadlock. It appears to have rejected a strategy whereby Mr Abiola could be released and installed as head of a government of national unity. Mr Abiola's family, who are allowed access to him in detention in Abuja, say that he has twice refused release on condition that he keep silent about claims to the presidency. Support for the strike is strongest in the south-west, where members of Mr Abiola's Yoruba tribe see a chance to wrest political power from the north Hausas and Fulanis who have dominated government. Northern branches of the National Labour Congress are disregarding the strike which they say is not in the national interest. The shutdown has completed a process begun over a month ago as a combination of fuel shortages, lack of transport, and earlier political strikes have been gradually bringing the commercial capital of Lagos to a halt. People going to work risk intimidation or reprisals from gangs roaming the streets or being caught in sporadic violence, as anti-government protesters are becoming more mobile to elude armed police. A strike by air traffic controllers and lack of aviation fuel in the south grounded domestic flights but military air traffic controllers have kept the international airport open. Labour union representatives are due to hold talks with the military government today, and central to the discussions will be the disruption to oil production, which is down by at least 20 per cent. The oil workers' unions, who went on strike a month ago, have made it clear that the release of Mr Abiola will not get them back to work. They are pressing for the regime to make way for elected civilian rule and for the government to pay arrears to the oil companies estimated at Dollars 800m which have led to job losses and recession in the industry.</p>

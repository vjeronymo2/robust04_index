			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: YOUTH CHARGED IN MURDERS 'NOT HARDENED,'  COURT TOLD  </P> <P> A 16-year-old Long Beach youth was "an accident waiting to happen" from  emotional problems caused by the murder of his sister, a psychiatrist testified  Monday at a hearing to determine whether the teen-ager will be tried as a  juvenile or as an adult for shooting two deaf brothers, one fatally.  </P> <P> But Dr. William Vicary said that Joey Paul Bellinger is "not a hardened  anti-social individual" and could be rehabilitated by the California Youth  Authority.  </P> <P> Bellinger is charged with murdering Cesar Vieira, 30, and attempting to murder  Edward Vieira, 25, with a .25-caliber pistol during a confrontation in Granada  Hills after the Palmdale brothers traded insults with five teen-agers,  including Bellinger.  </P> <P> "This kid is falling apart," Vicary -- called by Bellinger's attorney --  testified in the fitness hearing in Pasadena Juvenile Court. "That is why you  see him doing something so stupid -- something really out of character for  him."  </P></p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Clarke faces chorus of opposition to tax rises BUSINESS leaders, retailers, and MPs united yesterday to warn that extending indirect taxes could be disastrous for consumers, industry and the government. Their comments followed remarks by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, on Monday in which he clearly hinted that any tax increases in the Budget would be on spending rather than incomes. But Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said that, while the British economy was growing, 'recovery is patchy and still fragile. We need a Budget for investment.' The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of UK retailers, has written to Mr Clarke and says it is 'completely opposed to any extension of the VAT base'. Many retailers, including Argos and Sears, have warned that increases could damage consumer spending. They also fear that the move of the Budget to November could devastate Christmas trading. Extending VAT onto exempt products such as children's clothing, basic foods, and books was seen as highly emotive. 'VAT on children's clothes is nothing less than a tax on the growth of our children, and that is immoral,' said Mr Bryan Green, executive director of the National Childrenswear Association, representing manufacturers and retailers. Mr Paul Dowling, corporate affairs director of Asda, said: 'I can't believe Mr Clarke would want to be remembered as the man who put tax on a bottle of milk.' Mr Tim Godfrey of the Booksellers Association warned that imposing VAT on books would be a tax on reading. 'Economists predict consumer sales of books would fall by at least 15 per cent. That would mean there would be fewer books around, fewer books in the home, and standards of literacy would deteriorate.' Booksellers and publishers have launched the Books Add Value campaign to lobby MPs in the next few weeks . Increases in excise duties on tobacco, alcohol and petrol were also strongly opposed. Mr John Cryne, national chairman of the Campaign for Real Ale, called for members to write to MPs demanding a cut in beer duty. He says duty has risen 37 per cent since 1979, while consumption has fallen 15 per cent. 'Britain's beer drinkers are being hammered into the ground by tax rates that threaten the future of breweries and pubs,' he said. The chancellor's comments sparked an immediate reaction from rightwing Conservative MPs. Mrs Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay, said higher taxation would be absolutely devastating for the Conservative party. 'The way to deal with this problem is not by more taxation but by the government cutting public spending in Whitehall and the town halls.' Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, said increasing taxes would be 'a breach of faith with the British public.' Lord Howe, the former Conservative chancellor who raised VAT to 15 per cent in his first Budget, said it was 'right in principle to prefer taxes on expenditure to taxes on income'. But he added: 'When you begin putting it into practice, it becomes a great deal less popular and a great deal more difficult.'</p>

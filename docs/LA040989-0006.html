			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EMPIRE OF THE OLD  </P> <P> While I do enjoy Modern Maturity and acknowledge the efforts of AARP in getting  legislation passed to benefit senior citizens, I also feel that AARP exists  primarily to promote their revenue-producing services.  </P> <P> I am not eligible for Medicare and have no health insurance through employment.  I wrote to AARP for clarification of their so-called health insurance, which,  (I conclude) from reading the slick advertisements, covers only an  insignificant amount while in the hospital and does not mention anything about  actual medical and doctor expenses. I never had a reply.  </P> <P> DOROTHY SHEA  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Jose Ayala Lasso, the high commissioner for  human rights [name and title as received], visited the Rwandan  capital Kigali this week. During his visit he held talks with  the rebel leader, Paul Kagame, and met senior army and  government officials. Jose Ayala Lasso succeeded in obtaining  the commitment of the various parties to enable the departure of  the 20,000 civilians who detained like hostages at Kigali's  stadium or at the Mille Collines Hotel. Assane Diop asked Jose  Ayala Lasso where these civilians could take refuge if these  commitments were respected:    [Begin recording] [Lasso] This will have to be one of the  factors under consideration since they will not only need  guarantees concerning their personal safety to leave, but they  will also have to go to a place where they will be safe. All  this must be considered, assessed, planned, and implemented.    [Diop] Would it be in Rwanda or in neighboring countries?    [Lasso] This will depend on these people. Some want to leave  for a foreign country. However, all this must be assessed in  conjunction with the means at our disposal to guarantee safety,  and also with the possibility to move within the country.    [Diop] Would the United Nations be ready to pay for the  costs  of displacing so many people inside or outside Rwanda?    [Lasso] I have no doubt that the high commissioner for  refugees or other UN agencies will be able to support this  scheme. [passage omitted]    [Diop] Beyond obtaining the freedom of these hostages you  have also attempted to obtain a cease-fire. You have met senior  Rwandan military and government officials, did you also meet  senior RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] officials?    [Lasso] I met General Kagame of the RPF. I did not go there  with the idea to negotiate or to put forward a cease-fire. I  went there to bring my message as high commissioner for human  rights, that is: Stop the violence, respect the rights of all  and everyone. Obviously, all this is closely tied to the  cease-fire and it is only for this and in this context that I  said that it was necessary for both parties to take measures to  reach an agreement for a cease- fire.    [Diop] Did the rebels commit themselves to sparing lives?    [Lasso] The rebels say that a cease-fire does not  necessarily  imply an end to the violence, because massacres have gone on  even during the cease-fire. They believe that the cease-fire  must be included in a process that should, first, be aimed at  ending violence. Naturally when they say that, they are  accusing the other party. The same position, with some slightly  different nuances, is being held by government soldiers.  [passage omitted] [end recording]</p>

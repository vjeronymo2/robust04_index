			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Soap and chips However else it may be remembered, 1994 will probably go down as the year the gloves came off in international business. VW and GM at loggerheads over an itinerant purchasing director; Unilever and Procter &amp; Gamble slugging it out in the European detergents market; now Intel and IBM are at each other's throats over alleged flaws in Intel's Pentium personal computer chip. At one level these battles have little in common, beyond the obvious fact that markets for goods and services are getting fiercer, as they become global. But the year's two great marketing struggles - the 'soap war' over Unilever's Power detergent, and the dispute between Intel and IBM - do offer other, broader lessons. One is that global marketing is uniquely challenging. Launching a product more or less simultaneously across a continent, or the world, as is increasingly the trend in consumer markets, demands that companies attain a flexibility and focus that few have yet achieved. If something goes wrong in one national market, the chances are that the problem will spread rapidly - as Unilever, recently reorganised along continental lines, found to its cost. Another lesson is that technology can be a marketing curse as well as a blessing. Companies seize on technological innovations as a unique selling point for products, especially in mature, oligopolistic markets, such as European detergents. Yet unless they subject their new products to the most rigorous testing - looking, as Unilever patently did not in the case of Power detergents, for flaws that a ruthless competitor might expose - the invention may blow up in their faces. Then there is the question of communications. Both Unilever and P&amp;G have learned in recent months that they can no longer hide behind the carefully manipulated image of their brands; they have to explain themselves and their activities more effectively to consumers and the wider public. Even where technology is the only obvious selling point, as with Pentium chips, there is a risk that over-ambitious marketing claims, without adequate information, will simply confuse the consumer. How many PC users had worried about possible flaws in the inner workings of their computers until Intel started trumpeting Pentium? How many users of soap powder noticed that washing damaged their clothes before Power came along? It does not matter how mundane the product. Consumers are more demanding than ever before - and competitors more ruthless. The manufacturer that fails to appreciate these facts will go to the wall.</p>

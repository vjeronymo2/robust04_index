			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / People: Board shuffles at Flagstone Kevin Leech has been appointed chairman of Flag-stone Holdings, the USM-traded leisure company, which last week reported a big drop in 1993/94 losses. Leech has exercised his option to purchase 20 per cent of the company from David Kirch for Pounds 2.2m, equivalent to 1.5p per share. Flagstone shares closed  1/4 p higher at 2p yesterday. Kirch's interests on the board are represented by Kenneth Ineson, who is away from the UK. Kirch has undertaken to procure Ineson's resignation on his return. Under the board reorganisation, Stuart Sim, group finance director of ML Laboratories who was yesterday also appointed deputy chief executive, has been appointed a non-executive director; John Harding and Andrew Duquemin have resigned. Sim says Leech would be reviewing the company strategy and taking a 'hands on' approach to the growth of the business which, he says, has just returned to a 'modest level of profitability'.</p>

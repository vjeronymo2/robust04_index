			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Business and the Environment: Black Sea's dark future - The conflict between economy and ecology is coming to a head in Odessa Arkadia beach on the Black Sea may have snow-white sand beloved by tourists, but it is strewn with rusty metal drums; sludge and algae are visible on the water. Now, a row is brewing over sustainable development in a region so damaged by pollution that it is on the brink of ecological death. After committing itself to a Black Sea clean-up, the Ukraine government has angered environmentalists with plans to build an oil terminal near Odessa, up the coast from Arkadia, to handle up to 40m tonnes of oil per year. The new terminal would help Ukraine reduce its dependence on Russia for supplies. As ministers and parliamentarians bicker over the plan, President Leonid Kuchma last month gave his 'categorical' support for the new terminal now awaiting approval from parliament. The incensed green lobby argues that Kiev takes a cavalier approach to the environment and dangerously promotes large industrial projects, just as the Soviet Union did before Ukraine gained independence in 1991. Valery Mikhailov, director of the Ukrainian Scientific Centre of Marine Ecology, says Ukraine has failed to carry out the necessary environmental impact study required by a declaration signed by all six Black Sea rim states. He adds that Ukraine cannot guard against oil spillage. Opponents of the plan argue that oil terminal leaks and tankers bypassing weak regulation by dumping ballast water into the harbour would jeopardise the health of 800,000 people who visit Odessa each summer. The United Nations notes that the 'illegal discharge of ballast and bilge and accidental spills during loading and unloading' account for far more oil pollution than any land source. 'We should have beaches and resorts here,' says Mikhailov. 'They should put it somewhere else. It is a disaster for Odessa.' Environmentalists fear the threat to the ecosystem: it is on the Odessa bank that about 60 per cent of the sea's fish and 70 per cent of the biomass reproduce. Flexing their new democratic muscle, the opponents have formed a committee to try to block the project. Odessa's city council also protested, by declaring the land could not be used, but it was overruled by the national parliament. According to mayor Eduard Gurvits, the former commercial port city founded by Catherine the Great 200 years ago has to put industrial development first. The situation in Ukraine is matched in Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Georgia and Turkey, which this year approved a Black Sea Convention setting up the legal conventions for maritime pollution control but who all, except Turkey, must deal with the economic legacy of the Soviet Union's collapse. 'They all express the same kind of impotence,' says Laurence Mee, who leads the Environmental Management and Protection Programme of the Black Sea in Istanbul. 'You cannot do anything about the environment when you have an economy that cannot afford it.' Among the world's ecological problems, many of which are in the former Soviet sphere, the Black Sea's are formidable. Industrial waste from 17 Black Sea basin countries fed in by several large rivers, especially the Danube and the Dnieper, has killed fishing stock and devastated animal and plant life. Oil, toxic waste and ship ballast water emitted around the rim compounds the Black Sea's lack of a good drainage system to bring in fresh water. Incoming nutrients, as well as poisons, are killing off species, such as oysters and clams, that would help clean the sea. Yuri Kastenko, Ukraine's environment minister, defends Ukraine's record, pointing to a Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.4m) effort to clean up the Dnieper river. That is not enough, critics say. The Sea of Azov, just off the Black Sea, is even more polluted by steel, coal and other industries of the Ukraine's Donbass region. But as environmental enforcement has failed to improve under independence, local concern is now centring on new oil projects, such as at Odessa, but also an off-shore drilling exploration near the Crimean peninsula by JKX Oil and Gas, a UK-based exploration company working mainly in the former Soviet Union. The UN deems offshore drilling a big potential hazard because of the 'risk of blow-outs, fractured undersea pipelines, and other accidental oil spills' that might further contaminate the sea. This anxiety applies to the new project despite a relatively good aerial monitoring system used in Ukraine. Hamish Curren, general manager of JKX Oil and Gas, concedes that 'the consequences of a major accident are dire, but the chances of that happening are possibly overstated'. He adds that bad experiences of developments under the former Soviet Union, typically drilling in the Caspian Sea, are misleading. 'The philosophy of that kind of operation is very different from what western operators apply.' Included in the Black Sea debate have been efforts to substitute tourism for industry, since both the oil projects are so close to traditional resorts in Crimea and Odessa. During the summer Odessa sponsored a conference on developing tourism. Ecotec, a UK consultancy, found the Black Sea coast 'possesses all the key geographic resources including good climate, an excellent coastline and landscape features' to expand tourism. But the poor environment was a problem. Frank Joyce, chairman of Ecotec, has observed that the local administration must do a better job of tourism planning and coastal zone management along Ukraine's 2,500km coast. The other industry hurt by the environment is fishing. Only five species of fish remain of the 26 caught in the 1960s when the Black Sea was one of the world's mmost fecund sources. Total catch dropped from 900,000 tonnes in 1986 to 100,000 tonnes for all six Black Sea rim countries in 1992. Altogether, the World Bank estimates the cost in bad health, poor fishing and reduced tourism at around Dollars 1bn per year. But as Ukraine moves ahead with the oil terminal, the ecologists throw up their hands. Mikhailov reckons the clean-up would take up to 'two or three times Ukraine's national income'.</p>

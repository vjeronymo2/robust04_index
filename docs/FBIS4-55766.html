			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- It is uncertain what kind  of governing coalition, if any, will be formed after the May 29  run-off of the parliamentary elections. One thing is certain:  Voters have dismissed the coalition that governed the country  over the past four years, Gabor Kuncze, prime minister candidate  of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), told a news  conference in Papa, western Hungary, today. What will be at  stake on May 29 is whether voters will authorize the Free  Democrats to represent their interests with an appropriate  weight, Kuncze said.    In his view, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) insists on  a strategy which gained plenty of votes for the Hungarian  Socialist Party (MSZP), the winner of the first round of the  elections.    Failing to withdraw its candidates without any chance in the  second round and frightening voters with a communist  restoration, the MDF plays into the hands of the Socialists, and  proves that it gives priority to party interests over national  ones, Kuncze said.    SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar, meeting reporters in  Miskolc today, said the second round would decide whether a  balanced political culture emerges which makes it possible to  form a stable government and a coalition based on partnership  for the next four years, or the MSZP gains an absolute majority  in parliament. For a balanced governing coalition to be formed,  the SZDSZ must fare well in the second round of the elections,  Magyar said.</p>

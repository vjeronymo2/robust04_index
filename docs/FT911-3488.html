			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Taylor Woodrow There have been opportunistic rights issues aplenty this year, but Taylor Woodrow's takes the biscuit. The company has presumably looked on in wonderment as the market lapped up paper from less worthy competitors, understandably concluding that it would be silly to miss out on the market's appetite. No less than Pounds 1bn has been raised by housebuilders, property companies and building material suppliers since early January. It cannot be long before the market begins to tire of it. It may be, of course, that Taylor Woodrow is right in claiming that there are excellent opportunities to be snapped up in commercial property and housing. But if the bottom has been reached, shareholders are entitled to ask why their investment is not being geared up with borrowed money. The balance sheet may be a little less comfortable than at the end of last year, but it is hardly strained. The group can at least point to the fact that it has read the property market shrewdly in the past couple of years. It went into the downturn with most of its property let and - unlike several rivals - with little development in progress. But shareholders who take up this issue will need patience.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / International Company News: Coal &amp; Allied feels effects of lower prices Coal &amp; Allied Industries, which is majority-owned by CRA, the Australian mining group, yesterday reported an 86 per cent fall in after-tax profits to ADollars 5.9m (Dollars 4.4m) in the six months to end-June. This compared with ADollars 40.7m in the same period a year previously. Operating profit after tax, but before abnormals, stood at ADollars 14.3m, compared with ADollars 37.3m, while abnormals amounted to a ADollars 8.4m loss, resulting from the restructuring of the open-cut mines. In the previous year, there was an abnormal gain of ADollars 3.4m. The company said total production in the six-month period was 5.1m tonnes, down from 5.7m tonnes a year earlier, although part of the reduction was due to the sale of certain operations. Reduced coal contract prices and the stronger Australian dollar meant that sales for the half-year fell from ADollars 334.5m to ADollars 283.4m. Coal &amp; Allied said the still-lower coal prices negotiated with leading Japanese buyers earlier this year and the stronger currency would mean that profits remained under pressure in the short-term. However, 'increased demand coupled with low stockpiles is expected to increase prices in the next 12 months', it said. The dividend was cut to 25 cents a share from 44 cents.</p>

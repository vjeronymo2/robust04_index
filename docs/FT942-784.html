			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Taiwan pledges to ease curbs on foreign banks Taiwan has promised to relax controls on foreign banks' operations on the island in a bid to join the future World Trade Organisation and become a regional financial centre, but bankers cautioned it was unlikely that changes would precipitate an influx of foreign banks. A Finance Ministry official yesterday said that regulations would be revised to eliminate the limit on the number of foreign banks allowed to set up branches. At present, a maximum of three banks may open a first branch each year. Restrictions on the number of branches foreign banks may establish in each city will also be lifted, said Mr Sean Chen, deputy director of the Finance Ministry's monetary affairs bureau. Taipei-based foreign bankers greeted the announcement with guarded optimism, describing the moves as an effort to make Taiwan more 'user-friendly'. They cautioned, however, that the authorities had been sending out conflicting signals in recent weeks, promising to relax some regulations while simultaneously hinting at tightening others. For instance, it is widely believed that the minimum capital requirement for foreign banks to set up a branch will soon be tripled to Dollars 9m (Pounds 5.9m). The head of a US bank dismissed the planned relaxation measures as 'form over substance'. 'They're twitching little buttons here and there, but this isn't going to make setting up a branch in Taiwan one-tenth as easy as it is in Hong Kong,' he said. In any case, many bankers view the local market as over-banked. Sixteen new privately-owned banks opened in 1992 and, as a result, competition for business has become ferocious. 'There are a lot of crazy bankers in this town,' said the head of a North American bank's Taipei branch. Few foreign banks are expected to seek multiple branches across the island, as none apart from Citibank seriously targets the consumer market. At present 37 foreign bank have branches and 22 have representative offices in Taiwan.</p>

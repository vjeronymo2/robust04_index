			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Refocused Bunzl leaps to Pounds 45m A REFOCUSED Bunzl, the paper and packaging group, more than doubled pre-tax profits, from Pounds 21.1m to Pounds 45.1m, for the year ending December 31. Sales fell back from Pounds 1.4bn to Pounds 1.3bn due to a series of disposals which took place last year. Mr Anthony Habgood, chief executive, said the group had completed its rationalisation programme and refocused the business. 'We are now looking at a series of strategic acquisitions'. Trading profit increased to Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 49.7m before exceptionals) with average margins rising from 3.6 per cent to 4.4 per cent. Bunzl's biggest earner, the papers and plastics operations, increased operating profit from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 31.6m. Fine paper's profits slipped from Pounds 14.2m to Pounds 13m. Mr Habgood said the division's expansion in Germany was proving difficult in the midst of a recession. Cigarette filters increased profits from Pounds 7.4m to Pounds 10.4m and recently expanded by opening a US factory. Building supplies reported a fall in profits, from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 700,000, after taking the costs of further restructuring through the trading line. Net borrowings fell from Pounds 108.8m to Pounds 100.6m, representing gearing of 46.7 per cent. A strong focus on working capital increased net cash flow from Pounds 8m to Pounds 34.7m. Shareholders' funds rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 215.3m - the first year-end increase in six years. Earnings per share rose to 6.7p (1.5p). The final dividend is maintained at 2.2p making an unchanged total of 4p. COMMENT Bunzl's new management has achieved what it set out to do 18 months ago. But after identifying the core businesses following a big restructuring programme, investors may be wondering how the increase in earnings can be sustained. Although most of the rationalisation has been completed, Bunzl has by no means exhausted the opportunity of tightening operational procedures and increasing efficiency. If this continues then so should the increase in margins. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 57m, the shares, up 2p to 132p, are on a prospective multiple of 16.3. With its continued potential to move forward, its premium to the market looks justified.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equities hold steady in nervous trade SUDDEN FEARS that ICI will hit the stock market with its Pounds 1bn rights call this week, rather than waiting for completion of the planned demerger, dominated the UK equity sector yesterday. ICI shares fell heavily but failed to drag down the rest of the stock market which was helped by a Pounds 200m-plus trading programme from Smith New Court, weighted on the buy side and effectively the largest such deal seen in London for several months. The setback in ICI, which took about 3.8 per cent off the share price, reflected growing worries over funding prospects for Zeneca, the proposed pharmaceuticals and high tech part of the planned demerger. Pharmaceutical stocks continued to fall yesterday in New York and on Continental European bourses as well as in London. A decision from ICI on fund-raising is likely on Thursday when it reports trading results. The stock market moved nervously in narrow margins throughout the session, rallying towards the close as the trading programme, a portfolio of share trades by an institution via a marketmaking firm, passed across the trading screens. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,838.3 for a net loss of 1.7 points. Seaq volume increased smartly at the close as traders caught the hint of the large programme trade, to record a final total of 553.2m shares against Friday's 532m. A sharp jump in non-FT-SE deals to around 65 per cent of the Seaq total confirmed that activity had increased in the second-liners where the unidentified investment institution appeared to be switching out of the cyclical sectors and into the defensive stocks. Although the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was 0.7 off at 3,049.0, there were gains among utilities and food retailers, matched by falls in breweries and chemicals. The steadiness of the market in the face of the fall in ICI was helped by the favourable outcome of the rights issues announced recently by Asda and Burton; Asda's Pounds 347m issue received 94 per cent acceptances and Burton's Pounds 163m a 90 per cent take-up. Traders believe that the stock market is prepared to further rights calls - even the large one predicted from ICI - but fund managers are likely to be hoarding cash balances in anticipation of such developments. There was a strong performance from the bank sector where some analysts are hoping for better news on the domestic debt situation when National Westminster reports progress today. This optimism flowed over into the property sector which extended the recovery seen since the turn of the year. The continued slippage in sterling was seen in the stock market as a further sign that the next base rate cut will come at the time of the UK Budget, now only weeks away. The consensus on equity prospects is that share prices will drift up towards FT-SE 2,900 although economic recovery in the UK may be 'very weak', according to Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko. The strategy team at Strauss Turnbull, noting that the equity market found support at just below FT-SE 2,800, said yesterday that the important corporate results now pending could provide evidence of the benefits for overseas earning companies of the devaluation of sterling since its departure from the the ERM network.</p>

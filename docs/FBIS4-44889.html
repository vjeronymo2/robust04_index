			<p>CSO     [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd. and Mitsubishi Heavy  Industries, Ltd. have received an order from the National Space  Development Agency (NASDA) for a mobile launcher (ML) for the  large domestically built H-2 rocket. Total cost of the order for  both companies is 3 billion yen. The ML will be built next to  the assembly tower at Yoshinobu Launch Complex of the  Tanegashima Space Center (Kagoshima Prefecture) to have a spare  rocket on stand-by. The season during which rockets can be  launched is restricted to 90 days, including both summer and  winter, in order to comply with regulations that protect local  fishing rights. NASDA hopes to improve launching efficiency by  expanding the launch facilities.    Not only can the ML be used to assemble rockets, it also can  transport rockets excluding satellites and fairings from the  assembly tower to the launch pad and be used as a launcher as  well. ML No.2 with a spare H-2 rocket will be built as a  stand-by next to the ML No.1 which was used for the H-2 launch  in February 1994.    Main features of ML No.2 include:    1) launch deck (ML body);    2) travel device and machine equipment including a launch  stabilizer;    3) cooling water facility.    The launch deck is 22 meters wide, 18 meters long, and 4  meters thick. The travel device can move at a maximum speed of 8  meters per minute on tracks.    KHI's contract includes production and engineering of the ML  body, travel device, relief tracks, and lighting equipment, as  well as orbital replacement work. The cost of the order is 1.55  billion yen. On the other hand, MHI's contract for equipment,  including the ambilical service pod to supply liquid oxygen and  liquid hydrogen to the rockets, engine exhaust, upper deck, and  cooling water facility to cool the launch stand, totals  &yen;1.45 billion.    Construction of ML No.2 is scheduled for completion in  December 1994, in time for use during the third H-2 launch in  early 1995. In case the rocket on ML No.1 runs into trouble, the  rocket standing by on ML No.2 can be launched, thus avoiding  launch delays of various experimental and future commercial  satellites.</p>

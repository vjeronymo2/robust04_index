The amount of radioactivity released by the materials  already  imported has not actually been measured but both company and  state officials believe the concentrations of radioactive  elements are so low as to pose no danger to public health.    However, for safety's sake, the materials will reportedly be  transported to Bangkok today to be used by the Office of Atomic  Energy for Peace (OAEP).    Thai Tantalum Co Ltd imported the waste last year as raw  material for the extraction of tantalum pentoxide and columbium  pentoxide -- used to make electronic capacitors -- at its  factory in the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate.    But company president Yut Eamsa-at said it was only a "free  sample" and had not been used because it was low-grade. He  agreed yesterday not to import any more of the substance.    Officials from the Department of Industrial Works' Office of  Hazardous Substances (OHS) were informed about the shipment and  issued Thai Tantalum an import licence. But they were not told  that it contained radioactive substances, or that it came from a  hazardous waste site.    "We believe Thai Tantalum was just looking for cheap raw  materials and they are not interested in importing any more of  the waste," OHS Director Virah Mavichak said yesterday. "The  amount of radioactivity is believed to be low, but we are  unhappy that it came from a waste site. So we will revoke the  import licence."    According to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)  documents, the shipment originated from a hazardous waste site  in Muskogee, Oklahoma which contains roughly 21 tonnes of  thorium and nine tonnes of uranium, both highly radioactive  substances. The waste site belongs to Fansteel Inc, a former  producer of tantalum and columbium products which now supplies  Thai Tantalum with technical expertise.    Thai Tantalum officials yesterday could not say for sure how  much radioactive matenal was in the waste brought into Thailand.  According to Jim Hill, a former employee of Fansteel now working  as Thai Tantalum's lab manager, the thorium and uranium were  unevenly distributed through Fansteel's sludge ponds, which were  "the size of a football field" and contained 13.4 million kg of  mostly solid waste.    An X-ray analysis of the imported materials carried out by  Hill revealed with "90 percent certainty" that uranium and  thorium made up less than 0.2 percent of the sludge, or 5.5 kg.  He said some of the standards needed to carry out the analysis  were lacking.    However, Thai Tantalum has never actually measured the  radioactivity of the imported materials, or of the estimated 60  kg of radioactive materials it puts in its state-of-the-art  landfill every day, because it does not have a geiger counter.    But Yut sought to assure the public that the low  concentrations of radioactive material, combined with the  factory's hi-tech waste treatment system, meant that the area  was safe. The company's former plant in Phuket was burned to  the ground in 1986 by protestors afraid of being exposed to  radioactivity.</p>

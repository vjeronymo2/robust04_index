			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / Arts: Lear sans court at the Court - Malcolm Rutherford enjoys Max Stafford-Clark's swan song production MAX Stafford-Clark, the departing artistic director at the Royal Court, says that he had been thinking about performing King Lear there for a good five years. It is an intriguing idea and one can see why it was so long in gestation, for the Court, although the stage is very tall, is a relatively small theatre and Lear is by all conventional standards a very large play. Clearly the challenge was to find a new approach appropriate to the place. Stafford-Clark has pulled it off. This is not the classic Lear of grand poetry and sweeping gestures. It is more a bourgeois soap than a regal tragedy. But for the first time in my experience it comes across as a cracking good story. The pace of the production is prodigious - it lasts barely more than three hours. And because of deliberately going down a notch or two in the social scale, the capacity to move is if anything enhanced. There are some dramatic transformations of the stock version of the play. At the start Goneril and Regan seem entirely justified in their dislike of their father's habit of bringing 100 unruly retainers to their country seats. They want to get on with giving their dinner parties and running their homes in peace. A more subtle change is is that they are not remotely look-alikes, hardly even recognisably out of the same stable. Lia Williams's Goneril is svelte, blonde and notably well-dressed. Saskia Reeves's Regan plainly cares less about her appearance. But they are both enamoured of the same man: Edmund, the bastard son of the Earl of Gloucester, played with a northern Irish accent by Adrian Dunbar. Here is soap of a very high order. Tom Wilkinson's Lear does not look like an old man, certainly not at the beginning. He is red-faced, has a large moustache and seems rather coarse, more a country squire than a king. This belies what is to come. Wilkinson plays the final scenes with Cordelia with magnificent pathos. By then, he has aged. The key to his character is that he seems genuinely to fear going mad. When he does it is the onset of madness that makes him first feel for other people. The 'poor, naked wretches' speech is the beginning of his understanding. Wilkinson takes the verse in his stride; he does not pander to it, but never squanders it. His triumph in the acting is that he is a distressed human being; the kingship is secondary. There are some wonderful moments. The scene where Edgar leads his father to the brink of suicide over the cliffs of Dover can scarcely have been better done. The tension in what by now has become a thriller is breath-taking. Played by Iain Glen, Edgar has a claim to being the most outstanding actor in the production after Wilkinson's Lear. Eccentricities crop up. The Fool is presented by Andy Serkis as a drag queen. If there is subtlety here, I missed it, though one has always wondered about Queen Lear and her influence on the family. With the line 'My poor Fool is hanged', the Fool's body is seen suspended from a rope high up in the background. Perhaps only fidelity to the text let the Fool be retained; it is the least satisfactory role in the Stafford-Clark interpretation. The dress is spread across the 20th century to about the late 1950s: trench coats, British military uniform, green army jumpers and jodhpurs. Cara Kelly's Cordelia comes back from France kitted out like a colonel's lady on an afternoon's ride. There is no obvious reason for the wardrobe, except that they have to be dressed in something. The thunder and lightning are terrific, using the height of the stage to the full, and there is an authentic whiff of cordite, guns being employed along side swords. In short, this is probably the most exciting production of Lear you will ever see. It is also the most enjoyable one of a play which, apart from some of the verse, I have always disliked intensely. Here paradoxically is Lear at the Court without the court, an experience unlikely to be repeated. Go] Royal Court Theatre, (071) 730 1745</p>

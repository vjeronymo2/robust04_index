			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The March `Basket'"] </F>   [Text] The Committee for Labor and Social Issues has  calculated the minimum living (physiological) standard for  March. According to statistics, the average wage in February was  115,300 rubles [R] with an average per capita income of R79,200;  its correlation to the minimum living (physiological) standard  was 158 percent. The same January index stood at 175 percent,  which means that a decrease in people's earnings followed. In  March, the minimum living (physiological) standard was R58,000,  which exceeds the February rate by R7,800, or 15.5 percent.    The minimum living (physiological) standard for specific  groups of people stood at R51,900 for families with children  under six years of age; at R69,400 for families with children  between seven and 15 years of age; with men between 16 and 59 --  at R68,300; for women aged 16 to 59 years of age -- at R58,900;  and with pensioners -- at R40,100.    The increase in the minimum living (physiological) standard  was primarily caused by a rise in prices for bread and flour  products (42 percent), dairy products (20 percent), potatoes (19  percent), and meat (10 percent).    Members of the aforementioned committee conclude that the  financial security of college students, people receiving minimum  pensions, and families with many children has considerably  worsened due to the increased prices. Scholarships and special  state allowances, which are issued to college students,  compensate for 38.3 percent of their minimum living  requirements; scholarships issued to students of vocational  schools -- 27.4 percent; and allowances issued to mothers --  only 16.4 percent.    A minimum pension along with compensation payments stood at  R34,300 (which is 85.5 percent of the minimum living standard).    It should be noted that in the majority of colleges and  vocational schools, scholarships and compensations are usually  delayed from one to two months. Over the first three months,  allowances to mothers were delayed at many enterprises.  Managers of enterprises attribute this to a lack of finances,  even for issuing payments to employees, and the delayed transfer  of assets designated for paying allowances to mothers.  According to members of this committee, delays in paying  scholarships, allowances, and wages trigger social tension.    The committee predicts that in April a 10-percent increase  in  prices will follow. Per capita income will remain at R87,000  and its correlation to the minimum living (physiological)  standard will stay at 136 percent. The standard of living will  gradually decrease and will correspond to the level of the first  six months of 1993.    In April, some 22 percent of Kaliningrad Oblast residents  will live at or near the poverty line (in January -- 7 percent).  These people will require social assistance from the state. In  the meantime, some rayons of the oblast are experiencing  exceptionally dire problems in providing social assistance to  families which are poorly off. In Zelenogradskiy Rayon, for  example, school meals were suspended and there is money to  provide financial assistance to those who need it.</p>

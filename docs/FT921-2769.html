			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Uncovered dividend retains its attraction: One of the more contentious trends in the current company results season The decision of George Wimpey, the UK construction group, to maintain its final dividend without the earnings to pay for it, has confirmed one of the more contentious trends of this results season. T&amp;N, the motor components and engineering group, epitomised the dogged mood of companies last week by holding its uncovered dividend, even though the stock market was until recently braced for a cut. Mr Colin Hope, its chairman and chief executive, said that to do other than maintain 'would have been totally incorrect'. Shareholders deserved to be rewarded for their loyalty. In paying an uncovered dividend, T&amp;N was following in the footsteps of several other engineering concerns - Glynwed, Rolls-Royce, GKN and BICC. And yet before the results season started, the case for dividend cuts was stronger than at any time in the past decade. Falling earnings had left average cover at less than two, lower than in the last recession. Balance sheets had been stretched, cash conservation was a priority and there was no economic upturn to back up a message of confidence. Companies could have cited exhortations to be prudent from many analysts and commentators, not to mention the governor of the Bank of England. Even Mr Paddy Linaker, chief executive of the M&amp;G fund management group, often depicted as a hard-line advocate of dividend maintenance, had softened his stance. In a recession that 'has been worse than most of us thought likely, we are not suggesting that companies should irresponsibly maintain their distribution'. Mr Paul Myners, chairman of Gartmore Investment Management, has said that the long-term interests of shareholders are not served 'if maintaining the dividend starves the company of important investment'. But in spite of all the sympathetic noises, the market has with very few exceptions applauded dividend maintenance and decried cuts. On this basis, the decisions to maintain have been right, at least in the short term, and individual companies have not been short of explanations. First of all, as Mr Hope said, there is the obligation to shareholders. M&amp;G is one of T&amp;N's shareholders and, in spite of the softer tone, its fundamental line is that the importance of dividend income to investors is 'blindingly obvious'. None of the companies mentioned has raised its dividend significantly since the 1989 payment, so there has already been a real fall. To try investor patience further would risk souring a possible source of funds for the recovery. A second important factor in the dividend equation is that the actual amount paid is comparatively small. Take GKN, the UK motor components and industrial services group: the total bill of Pounds 51.8m is minuscule compared with turnover of Pounds 2.43bn. The Pounds 14.9m knocked off reserves reduced shareholders' funds by less than 2 per cent and is only a 10th of the amount transferred the other way in the happy years of 1987-89. Third and probably most important, the company needs to have the cash available to make the payment. At GKN, a cash inflow helped to reduce net debt by Pounds 45m to Pounds 175m and gearing fell to a 15-year low of 26.4 per cent. Bulges in spending on capital equipment and reorganisation were largely over. Those two items cost GKN about Pounds 110m less last year than in 1990. In other words, it could afford to pay. T&amp;N had strengthened its position with the help of a rights issue (leaving aside questions about paying shareholders with money raised from them, in a tax-inefficient way). Wimpey had reduced debt by disposals. While institutional wishes and affordability explain many of the one-off decisions to maintain, there is also a longer-term theme that ought to justify companies' actions. In the good years, the theory goes, dividends need not be increased in line with earnings; in the bad years, they need not track them into the abyss. The yield then provides a nice support when the share price is hit by poor results. All the companies in the chart have underperformed the market since the October 1987 crash. But it is on the point of ironing out the peaks and troughs that some of the arguments begin to unravel. The chart shows the smoothing out process at work in previous recessions. Cushions had been created through dividend rises failing to keep pace with earnings. But after 1982, dividends kept tracking earnings upwards, as well as outstripping inflation. The failure of dividends to respond to the fall-off in earnings since 1989 is pronounced. With the market yielding more than the inflation rate and the gap between its yield and that of gilt-edged stock historically narrow, the question is: are dividends too high? The answer is yes in some cases. Mr Myners, at GIM, says that some companies have become locked into an excessive level of distribution and should reduce the payment to a level from which it can grow. An additional problem is that the absence of a recovery has made it difficult for companies to point to prompt restoration of dividend cover. Rolls-Royce was an exception in stating that the decision reflected the company's confidence in its future, backed up by civil aero-engine orders. And the background for resumed earnings growth may be less propitious than after the last recession. Mr Nick Knight, at Nomura Securities, said: 'Post ERM, companies will have less currency depreciation and less price inflation to push up earnings,' while increases in interest rates could truncate growth. But whatever the rate of recovery, the fundamental ingredient in the dividend equation - cash - could be in shorter supply on the way out of recession. Cuts in capital spending and work in progress have helped to fund uncovered dividends, but working capital will come under strain as demand picks up. With banks in cautious mood, companies' internal resources will become all the more important. This will put uncovered, or thinly-covered, dividends under pressure for some time to come. Even if maintenance retains its hold, the date for renewed dividend growth could be pushed back into 1994, or later.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SHARE PRICE PERFORMANCE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     Black      Mar 17,       Actual      % change                    Monday       1992        % change    relative to                    Oct 1987   Opening price               FT-A                    (pence)     (pence)                  All-Share Index  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GKN                 374          344          -8.00        -17.40 BICC                374          325         -13.10        -21.96 Rolls-Royce         182          146         -19.78        -27.96 Glynwed             358          225         -37.15        -43.56 T &amp; N               203          115         -43.38        -49.15 Wimpey (George)     253          131         -48.22        -53.50  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

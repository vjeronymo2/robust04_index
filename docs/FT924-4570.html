			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / EC to renew calls for growth push: The Community will grow by just 1.1% this year MR Henning Christophersen, the EC economics commissioner, will today press plans for a growth stategy in both western and eastern Europe to revive slumping public investment and give hope to the emerging democracies in Poland, Hungary and the Czechoslovak Federation. Mr Christophersen is expected to reveal that the Community will grow by barely 1.1 per cent in 1992. Growth next year is likely to be between 1.0 per cent and 1.5 per cent, with a threat of near stagnation of output. In an interview yesterday, Mr Christophersen called upon EC governments to work more closely on co-ordinating economic policy, boosting public works programmes and 'reorienting resources' by scaling back state aid to industry or curbing public sector salaries, notably in Germany. The Danish commissioner also issued a plea to the Community to look favourably upon the requests for membership made by Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia. He called too for more east-west infrastructure spending on roads, railways and telecommunications to correct what he identified as a north-south bias. As Danish minister of foreign affairs and then EC Commissioner in 1985, Mr Christophersen was intimately involved in negotiating the terms of membership for Greece, Spain and Portugal. Although he stopped short of offering a firm timetable, the Commissioner said the EC should not be narrow-minded. They should tell Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia that 'you are on your way to becoming EC members'. Mr Christophersen's views on enlargement are not widely held in the EC, but his comments reflect unease that the Community is so preoccupied with its internal problems over the Maastricht treaty that it is not paying attention to its eastern neighbours. Mr Christophersen has been working with Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission President on a new growth strategy to be presented at the EC summit in Edinburgh next month. Britain broadly supports the Brussels initiative, particularly plans to set up a new European Investment Fund which would provide loan guarantees under the auspices of the European Investment Bank. But UK officials are anxious about Community plans to borrow up to Ecu5bn (Dollars 6.2bn) on the capital markets which could feed into budget deficits. Mr Christophersen stressed yesterday that his plan consisted mainly of 'supply-side' measures which in no way undermined the need for fiscal discipline. The UK is also worried Mr Delors might 'hijack' the summit with a high-profile growth package, distracting attention from other pressing issues. Mr Christophersen explained yesterday that he had not as widely reported - called for a Ecu50bn investment package to revive the EC economy. He had noted only that EC investment had fallen from 4 per cent in 1991 to a negative  3/4 per cent in 1992. The figure of Ecu50bn was the amount of investment needed to 'move' the EC economy and prevent an increase in unemployment, he said.</p>

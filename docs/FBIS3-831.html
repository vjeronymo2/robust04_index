Ciskei government spokesman Cedric Harrop allayed  fears of an uprising.    "There's orchestrated political incitement to scare people  stiff about their pensions, but it's totally under control and  everything is back to normal," he said.    The Ciskei Civil Servants Association (Cisa), however, said  there was still cause for concern about pension payments.    On Thursday and Friday soldiers from 1 Ciskei Battalion  demanded a direct address from the homeland's military ruler,  Brig Oupa Gqozo, who later spoke to them.    Senior civil servants in the homeland said soldiers wanted  to  be paid their accumulated pensions before the April elections,  to secure their money before a new government took control. Mr  Harrop said a new government could not interfere with the fund  because it was independently managed by an international  company. "It's immune from interference from this or any other  government." He said the only people who could benefit from the  fund were Ciskei civil servants after retirement.    Other sectors of the civil service had expressed disquiet  about their pensions in the past, and the soldiers' protest was  just another ripple of general discontent. Mr Harrop said:  "Ciskei people, particularly civil servants, occasionally get  excited when they've had a bit to drink, but they calm down  after a while."    Cisa spokesman Mthimkulu Mashiya said although Bisho was  calm, there was no telling how civil servants would react to  decisions made about their pensions, especially because the fund  was controlled unilaterally.    He said a meeting was planned next week when civil servants  would address the pension fund issue directly. The fund was  administered without workers' representation and "I don't see  how they can be happy with it", he added.    Rumours of an uprising were doing the rounds in Bisho on  Thursday, some prompted by events in Bophuthatswana and others  by South African Minister of Law and Order Hernus Kriel telling  a meeting there was talk of a Ciskei coup.    Mr Harrop said as far as he could gather the soldiers were  satisfied and had returned to their posts -- "the flags are  still flying."</p>

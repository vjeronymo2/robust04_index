			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Jordan piqued at being left out of Gaza deal Jordanians had to sit through five news items on Wednesday evening before state-run television presented a report on the historic signing ceremony in Cairo which makes way for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to have their first taste of self-rule. The occasion was brushed aside by an official spokesman as an 'independent Palestinian affair' and criticised by others in government for the lack of co-ordination with Amman. The Lower House of Parliament cut short a debate on a draft sales tax law to issue a statement which condemned 'the sale of Palestine'. Again, Jordan is in a fit of pique for being overlooked by the Palestine Liberation Organisation in its plans to govern the occupied territories. Despite numerous pledges between Jordan and the PLO to co-ordinate over implementing the self-rule agreement, Jordan's fears of marginalisation are growing stronger. There is a general feeling of conspiracy in Amman that the long and bitter rivalry between PLO chairman Yassir Arafat and King Hussein is causing Mr Arafat to sideline Jordan. The kingdom's frustration at being left out is based mainly on historical precedent and demography. Jordan ruled the West Bank from 1948 to 1967, when that region was occupied by the Israelis following the six-day war; only in 1988 did King Hussein decide to sever legal and administrative links with what was half of his kingdom west of the Jordan River. Out of Jordan's population of about 4m, over 60 per cent are of Palestinian origin and many have strong family ties in the West Bank. As a result, Jordan feels it has a natural role to play in any resolution of the Palestinian problem. So far, this looks increasingly unlikely. Not only have the promises of co-ordination with the PLO failed to bear fruit, but agreements signed by the PLO and Jordan have been overtaken by PLO talks with Israel. Last week's PLO/Israeli economic agreement, for instance, negated in many ways the economic accord signed with Jordan in January. A free trade policy between Jordan and the self-rule areas was replaced by quotas and taxes now to be levied on Jordanian goods. Newly-opened banks which were to be run by the Central Bank of Jordan are now to be under a Palestinian monetary authority. The Jordanian dinar seems to have been replaced by the Israeli shekel as the main legal tender.</p>

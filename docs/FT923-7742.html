			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Gardening: Sound advice on the merits of a sage - Robin Lane Fox explores the multi-faceted salvia family NATURALLY, gardening columnists know what they are talking about but, this week, I feel as if I am launching on to half-explored waters, hoping that I can encourage you to join the journey. The aromatic signposts point to S for salvia, the family of garden sages. I suppose I should offer you sage thoughts, sage advice and proven sagacity, but there are now so many varieties that, like most of you, I am lost. I do know one sage fact: you can always tell a salvia by stroking it. Every single one of them has a rectangular stem, a regularity which you can feel but not see. I also share a sage prejudice. Salvias have been given a bad name by one stiff and harsh variety. Do not condemn them all because of those plumes of severe scarlet flower on the bedding salvias which are so popular in Europe and the worst of Britain in Bloom. These varieties are a tiny fraction of a superior family and are no more typical than red-hot pokers are typical of pokers at large. Grand gardens now use dozens of types of sage to carry their borders into autumn. I am backing them as one of my top families for the next ten years of original planting. Most of the best forms are not completely hardy in Britain, but they seem to be ignored almost everywhere else. At Villandry, one purple-blue bedding sage called salvia Victoria has found its way among the ornamental cabbages. In warm European gardens, we ought to be able to do better than that. Salvias are naturals for expatriate pots and dusty borders, but gardeners in hot weather seem slow to exploit them. Last year, my eyes were opened by the range of salvias in the care of Jimmy Hancock, the National Trust's head gardener at Powis Castle. Short spikes of glowing red-orange or deep, vivid blue brought colour and a long season to Powis's long borders and large urns: I coveted the deep blue salvia cacalifolia and the short orange spikes of confertiflora. The blue one has just burst into flower among the fuschias in a huge pot of my own. Neither of these forms is hardy, but they are perpetuated easily from cuttings taken now and sheltered indoors during winter. If you live within scenting distance of the Mediterranean, these two salvias ought to be spectacular. So are the reds - not the reds with stiff plumes of flower from seed but the reds with small, hooded flowers on plants which grow into nearly-hardy shrubs. This year, I am growing several, but the best is one called microphylla Newby Hall. The leaves and flowers are larger and the scarlet red is particularly clear. It will not survive a hard English winter, although it is named after one of Yorkshire's finest gardens. Another good scarlet form is neurepia, which also is a wonderful flower; grahamii is almost hardy, although I still muddle-up their names. Is grahamii the nearer of the two to a cherry red ? Certainly, they both root with ridiculous ease from cuttings and I cannot think why we do not use them for bedding out as broad bushes at their best from early August onwards. There is no point in buying big plants of these salvias this month as they are not safe in autumn frosts. What you need is a cutting from an older plant which you can root now in a pot and keep indoors until next May. All the blues and hooded reds are worth this small effort, as is the tall sky-blue salvia guaranitica and a particular charmer called discolor, the flowers of which are a mixture of black and pale green. Up to this point I know what I am doing, but sages are not standing still. New ones keep turning up from fresh collections in the fields. In 1987, visitors to China brought back a tall form called Przewalskii which has blue spikes and is said to be hardy. In 1990, a colony of pink cousins was discovered in Yunnan and is being released into the trade, although the colours may vary. Half-hardy sages are not even half the story. Hardy ones are multiplying also and, once again, I am struggling to keep up. After four years of experiments, I can see there is merit in one called blancoana, which spreads widely with pale grey leaves and spikes of pale lavender blue. On dry soil it is certainly hardy, and would combine well with many of the older shrub roses. To my eye, the flowers are a bit too feeble, best suited to a pussy-cat planting of pastel pinks and pale mauves. Pussy-footers would also like two of my recent acquisitions called Amethyst and Purple Rain. They are thought to have a great future, but I find their spikes of gentle pink-purple too muted for my taste. Out in deep water, new catches await all of us. What about the meadow sage, pratensis, which has a special form called Lapis Lazuli with flowers that are pink, not blue? What about bulleyana, which is said to be coarse with flowers of purple and yellow? I know some of the special forms of the violet-purple sages which are hardy in borders: May Night shows the usual lack of logic by flowering until October if you dead-head it. But what about Rose Queen, which has flowers of pale pink and ruby above grey leaves: is it really hardy, as my supplier has just assured me? Expert fellow-travellers know their square-stemmed sages by touch: with my eyes shut, I certainly know one which happens to be essential to every garden. Now is the right time to be planning your salvia turkestanica for next year. It is just setting seed and, if you sow it outdoors, it will grow on for transplanting early in spring and will then give you a huge spire of mauve and white flowers late in June to a height of 3 ft. It is so good because it continues to look pretty even when the flowers have faded and died. You cannot possibly miss it. It has the most mysterious scent: the pungent flavour of hot humanity in a crowded space. Whatever the future holds in this family, this fine variety is one which I will always recognise a mile off.</p>

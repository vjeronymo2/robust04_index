This was  the first time the ruling parties held a dialogue with the U.S.  Government on this issue.    Mondale said during the meeting, "We are interested in  policy, and not in market share," expressing high expectations  on the policy package to expand domestic demand and liberalize  the market that the Japanese Government is working on.    The ruling parties expressed the opinion that the United  States should change its attitude of asking for immediate  action, saying "the U.S. Government should attach importance to  the negotiation process, and not to the results." However, the  ambassador said, "The United States is not satisfied with the  process of Japan-U.S. economic negotiations so far. We need an  early solution." He reiterated a call on the Japanese  Government to come up quickly with radical measures to effect a  breakthrough in bilateral relations.    At the meeting, Mondale also commented on the issue of  nuclear inspections in the DPRK (North Korea). He expressed his  concern, saying: "The (North Korean) leaders are isolated. We  have worked hard to reach a peaceful solution. This situation  is indeed distressing."    Regarding steps to be taken from now on, he said, "The  deployment of Patriot missiles is purely defensive. While I am  in favor of conducting the Team Spirit exercises, this will not  be the solution. It is one of the options." He also stated that  "economic sanctions may have to be imposed."</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / People: Riddell for Invesco 'Some people say you should never go back,' says Norman Riddell, 'but it worked well for me once before.' The new 45-year-old chief executive of Invesco MIM's UK and European operations, replacing Nicholas Johnson who resigned over policy differences in December, is an old Britannia hand himself. He left in 1986, before the link-up with MIM and Invesco, but will still recognise one or two faces on the board of the now much-enlarged fund management group, notably Lord Rippon, one-time Britannia Arrow Holdings chairman. But the first time he returned to familiar territory was in 1987 when he set up Capital House Investment Management for the Royal Bank of Scotland, his first employer when he left school. Riddell says he had already achieved a lot at Capital House, where he started as the first employee shortly before the 1987 crash. Funds of Pounds 1.4bn have now grown to Pounds 4.4bn - still, however, nowhere near critical mass for a competitive fund management business. 'In a sense the fun part starts now - Capital won its first Pounds 100m account only last week.' But apparently the Invesco job, 'coming out of the blue', was too good to resist. Despite the blight on the UK business, including the Maxwell involvement as well as a long-running investigation by the self-regulatory body Imro, he is attracted by a bigger company and 'a more global business'. Invesco manages Pounds 40bn of assets worldwide, although only Pounds 7bn fall in Riddell's new area. He thinks he will get on well with his bosses in Atlanta, Georgia, despite the unpromising first approach by chief executive Charles Brady which took place over an 8am breakfast - on a Saturday. And he tries to appear unconcerned by the Imro investigation: 'There are risks inherent in any new position.' While the Royal Bank has sold its merchant banking arm Charterhouse, he stresses there are no such plans for Capital House. Paul Field, 47, currently managing director of the retail operations at Capital, was yesterday named as his successor.</p>

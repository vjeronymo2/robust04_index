			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Serbian Enclaves With Territorial </F> Autonomy"]    [Text] At yesterday's news conference of the Democratic  Party of Serbs in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM], the party President Dragisa Miletic  expressed suspicion about the regularity of the coming census.  He pointed out the Interior Ministry has yet not delivered  citizenship notifications to about 85 percent of the Serbian  population in Macedonia. Miletic attacked media in Macedonia  for writing of Macedonia being allegedly endangered by Serbia  and of putting pressure on Serbs in Macedonia to declare  themselves Macedonians at the census. According to him, the  names of some Serbs, especially those living a longer period in  Macedonia, are being changed. Miletic also spoke of existence  of Serbian enclaves in Macedonia, which presently have a status  of national communities, but, if necessary, will turn into  territorially independent enclaves.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Turkey to resume wheat imports FOR THE first time since the drought of 1989, Turkey is to import wheat for the domestic market, a direct result of the more active exporting strategy pursued by the country's grain board in 1992. The decision, announced last week, is not a cause for alarm. However it does underline the structural problems of the Turkish wheat market, where the state is subsidising farmers to produce lower value grains unsuited to the increasingly sophisticated tastes of the domestic consumer. In lifting the restrictions on imports for a 6-month period, Turkey is seeking to make up a domestic shortfall of hard wheats while continuing to export from its reserves to poorer neighbours in the Caucasus and Central Asia. The move is also the result of a poorer harvest this year and a radical change in the way the government intervenes in the domestic market. Through changes in pricing policy, the Turkish Soils Products Office (TMO), halved the amount it bought from farmers in 1992, thus reducing the agency's burden on the central government budget. On June 1, the first day of the harvest, the TMO announced an average support price for wheat of TL1,200 (9.5p) a kilogram. The official price was to be increased by TL50 a kilogram a month to account for inflation. The government promised to pay farmers in full on delivery rather than in installments as before. In 1991-92 Turkish production is estimated to have been between 14.5m and 15m tonnes, down from 16m tonnes in 1990-91. Under the price support scheme, the TMO purchased 2.45m tonnes or 25 per cent of the 10.3m tonnes offered by farmers to the market, compared with 4.5m tonnes in 1991. The balance of the crop is made up of wheat retained as seed and animal feed, together with harvest losses. Equally important, the private sector granaries have been forced to become more active in the cereals market. The move represents a rare example of a state agency withdrawing from a commercial activity better handled by private enterprise. Moreover the change has been achieved without the government reneging on its election commitment to help the farming sector. For the last few years in supporting the farmers the TMO has paid well above international prices. Worse still, in both 1989 and 1990 it financed these purchases on the local market using foreign commercial borrowings. While still higher than world prices, this year's support levels at 58 per cent up on 1991 dropped in dollar terms, given an inflation rate of 70 per cent. The catch was that the TMO also announced it would sell back the wheat on the open market at 15 per cent above the support price. Merchants thus had an incentive to go directly to farmers at harvest time, incurring the warehousing costs but avoiding paying the TMO premium. 'Today it's the private companies which have the stocks, not the TMO,' says Mr Ergun Erzurumlu, the TMO deputy head and inventor of this new scheme. Officials estimate the cost of the 1992 operation at about TL2,900bn, or TL3,800bn if all grains are included. Part of the finance was provided by direct support from the budget. Two international tenders for a total of 1.5m tonnes raised a further Dollars 213m. Traders say TMO managed the sale well, realising high prices - Dollars 113 a tonne for the first tender in mid-May and Dollars 125 in mid-June. The TMO now has a contract for 1.1m tonnes with Azerbaijan - 500,000 has already been shipped. Negotiations are continuing on a 2m tonne deal with Uzbekistan, with a similar size offer to Turkmenistan.</p>

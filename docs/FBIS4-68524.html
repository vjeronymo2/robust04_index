			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article prepared by "Russia's Choice" Duma faction: "The </F> Apparatus Ruminates Beyond Its Means; Duma Faction `Russia's  Choice' Has Prepared and Distributed the Following Document"]    [Text]  <H5>  On State Wastefulness and Means of Combatting It </H5>   The financial situation in the Russian Federation continues  to remain difficult. The federal budget deficit is increasing.  State debts are not being repaid on time. Vital social programs  have been frozen or are being only partially funded. Once again,  the rate of growth of inflation is increasing. Under these  conditions, as never before, our state needs a program of  comprehensive economy of funds(...)    In 1994 the relative share of expenditures for state  administration within the federal budget was increased by 1.5  times as compared with the budget for 1993 (not taking into  consideration the construction of new and reconstruction of old  administration buildings). The expenditures for capital repair  of the government residence and its relocation have not been  reflected in the budget. Expenditures are growing in the central  apparatus and in the local areas. The number of central organs  of administration is increasing. The edicts of the president and  the government calling for a 20 percent cutback in the apparatus  of the president and the government are not being fulfilled. The  apparata of the president and the government duplicate each  other's efforts and the functions of the ministries. At the same  time, new subdivisions are being created, which also duplicate  each other's efforts.    The local administrative apparatus has totally gone out of  control. In many cities, the number of local administrations has  increased threefold. Re-equipment of administrative buildings is  going on everywhere. Large purchases of imported computers,  furniture, telephones and automobiles are being made. In the  federal budget alone, the expenditures for buying equipment for  various state and judicial institutions are to be increased by  12.25 times, for their capital repair--by 30.3 times, and for  the construction of new buildings--by 19.5 times. Aside from  this, huge amounts of money are being spent through  extra-budgetary funds and through utilization of credit  resources for other than their intended purpose.    In 1993, thousands of foreign automobiles costing $20,000 -  $40,000 each were purchased at the rayon administration level.  There were many cases of buying "Mercedes Benz" automobiles at a  cost of up to $130,000.    Individual ministries and departments, as well as state  organizations, use buildings whose area is many times larger  than that specified in the standards. The excess space is leased  out, and the funds received are used for maintaining the  organization. There are frequent cases of leasing at openly  undervalued prices.    As a result, it takes the income tax from 500 workers to  support only one bureaucrat.    We propose:    a) to declare a moratorium on the creation of new  administrative structures;    b) to set limits on the number of state bureaucrats and  limits on their wages at all levels of administration;    c) to limit the purchase of new service automobiles;    d) to urgently and comprehensively verify the utilization of  administrative buildings;    e) to prohibit the purchase of imported automobiles,  furniture and equipment if there are cheaper domestic analogs;    f) to spend only budget funds for the maintenance of the  administrative apparatus;    g) to eliminate administrative structures which duplicate  each other's efforts.    The struggle against excess expenditures must become one of  the key directions of activity of the State Duma, along with  that of the president, the government and the Federation Council.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   One of the members of the RF [Russian Federation]  government,  having read this note, joked: "One gets the feeling that Gaydar  wrote it based on his own recollections." The hint is a  transparent one: When the current leader of "Russia's Choice"  was a member of the cabinet of ministers, he too drove around in  a Mercedes, and not on the trolley.    OBSHCHAYA GAZETA has no other evidence at its disposal to  show that the deputy's "announcement" made any impression on  anyone. The fate of this note is ordinary, i.e., unenviable. Two  weeks later they could not even remember in the State Duma what  kind of paper the "Russia's Choice" representatives submitted  for their attention. Naturally, it does not figure in the  parliamentary budget discussions, and it even took a great deal  of effort to find it. By some miracle, the only copy in the  entire Duma had been saved in the technical section of the Duma  apparatus.    To politely send the authors of the note back to their own  past ("People who live in glass houses...")--that is a rather  widespread means of reacting to unpleasant questions. The  radical democrats who had been in power really had time to show  that they too were not ascetics. However, the results of their  personal practice do not eliminate and do not belittle the  problem itself. One can hide the deputy's note, not let it get  through, but how can one hide the fact that the state apparatus  is becoming ever larger and more wasteful? Having endured the  short-term test of democracy, the Russian bureaucracy has been  able to preserve its main privilege--freedom from control of  society. This has allowed the bureaucracy to quickly restore its  moral forces, its capacity to multiply, and its taste for the  comfortable life. Since notions of comfort are rapidly changing,  the needs of the bureaucracy are growing so dynamically that  soon there may not be enought taxpayers to satisfy them. If the  authorities believe that this threat is not serious--so much the  worse for the authorities.</p>

			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets: Politics sway Venezuela and Mexico THE CARACAS stock market recovered partially yesterday from Wednesday's 6 per cent drop as President Carlos Andres Perez promised political reform and suspended price increases on gasoline, electricity, food and medicine, writes Joseph Mann. Before the Carnival holiday, equities had been recovering, in local currency terms, from a failed coup in February. However, the decline in the bolivar against the dollar accelerated after the failed military rebellion. The currency dropped 4 per cent on Wednesday but showed some strength yesterday. Meanwhile, the Mexican stock market is showing the first sign of jitters this year, writes Damian Fraser. The market opened 0.4 per cent lower yesterday after a 3.5 per cent fall on Wednesday on news that the government planned to sell a further 5 per cent in Telmex, the country's telephone monopoly. News of the offering, which could fetch about Dollars 1.5bn, is scheduled for May or June. Mexican equities fell in spite of a drop in interest rates to a record low of 12.5 per cent, compared with inflation of 17.9 per cent. Interest rates have fallen thanks to growing credibility in Mexico's exchange rate policy. Since November the peso has fallen at an annualised rate of only 2.4 per cent against the dollar.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Clinics continue to distribute Neovitamin II pills  for free in the province, following the arrival of new shipments  of this product. The vitamin's sporadic distribution over the  past two months has been corrected. Health personnel want to  maintain a steady supply of this preventive complex, as has been  done for several months. The people are reminded of how  important it is to take Neovitamin II, which is rich in B  complex and other vitamins the body needs.</p>

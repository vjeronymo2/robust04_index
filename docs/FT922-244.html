			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Letter: Weasel words are no basis for economic and monetary union Sir, Mr Samuel Brittan argues most cogently (Economic Viewpoint, June 25) that 'I am not advocating short-termism but merely avoiding a pretence to knowledge that we do not have'. He also states that, the Maastricht guidelines (on deficit/GNP ratios) 'are probably meant to apply over a cycle as a whole'. Surely we have no knowledge that this is implied by the Maastricht criteria? If it were then we could argue that every country is currently meeting the deficit/GNP targets by virtue of the different lengths of their economic cycles. Such an interpretation would be a gift to finance ministers currently struggling with their own definitions of 'medium term', 'long term' and 'over the course of the business cycle'. An inability to meet deficit reduction targets in both absolute and proportional terms can be blamed on below-trend economic growth or actual declines in output. As this year's UK Financial Statement and Budget Report states: '. . .that judgment must be made in the light of all the circumstances, including the medium term economic and budgetary position.' Can we really move to closer economic and monetary union based on weasel words and is it likely that the German authorities would permit such a subjective interpretation of quantifiable convergence criteria? If European countries want to join a hard-core D-Mark bloc it is entirely up to them. They can all move to narrow bands in the ERM; they could individually move to permanent fixity of exchange rate parities. But to claim that convergence is proceeding were it not for the nasty economic cycle is surely to miss the point. It is the cycle itself we should be concerned about.

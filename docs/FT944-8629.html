			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG gold partners aim to 'optimise' production The joint venture partners in Porgera, the large gold mine in Papua New Guinea's Enga province, have agreed to go ahead with an expansion of associated processing facilities, in an effort to 'optimise' gold production and keep production costs as low as possible. The expansion will cost about 90m kina - slightly more than ADollars 100m at the current exchange rate - and should be completed by the first quarter of 1996. The expansion involves increasing the project's milling capacity, providing an increased oxygen supply for the autoclaves, adding process water storage capacity at Waile Creek dam, and increasing power generation capabilities. The joint venture partners - Placer Pacific, Renison Goldfields, Highlands Gold and the PNG government - said that the work should maintain Porgera's cash production costs at under USDollars 200 a troy ounce. This, in turn, should allow the mine to process more lower grade ore later in its life. 'There is also the possibility of further underground resources being identified that can be economically exploited,' the partners said this week. 'Particularly encouraging is the potential to mine higher grade narrow veins of mineralisation, both inside and outside the pit shell, which are not currently considered part of the reserve.' Porgera is one of the world's largest gold mines. Its production has dipped recently, but in the last financial year gold production still amounted to 1.17m ounces, down 70,000 ounces on the previous 12 months.</p>

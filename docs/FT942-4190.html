			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Survey of Uganda (9): Mood of optimism - Leslie Crawford on seven years of political stability The opening of the Masala Chaat Indian takeaway in Kampala was a grand affair. Its concrete backyard brimmed with the cream of Ugandan society. Government dignitaries mingled with bankers; the US ambassador chatted with Asian and Ugandan families. Ms Mumtaz Kassam, a returned Ugandan Asian, surveyed her restaurant with satisfaction. Her guest of honour, Finance Minister Joshua Mayanja-Nkangi, delivered an effusive inauguration speech. They were celebrating, in a modest way, the seven years of stability which have allowed Ugandans to start rebuilding their lives. Small ventures such as Ms Kassam's takeaway are a psychological boost to a capital still haunted by abandoned villas and boarded-up businesses. Kampala, like the rest of the country, is only a shadow of its former self. But there is a mood of optimism and a sense of renewal which are rare in Africa today. President Yoweri Museveni, the architect of Uganda's newfound stability, is not an easy man to define. An intellectual-turned-soldier, he would be the World Bank's model African statesman - if only he could be persuaded to accept western-style democracy. Mr Museveni advocates an open economy, respect for human rights, a free press and contested local elections, but he does not believe in multiparty politics. In its stead, Mr Museveni offers his National Resistance Movement, a broad church which has taken several political opponents into its fold. At the village level, Mr Museveni has introduced elected 'resistance councils' which decide local tax and spending policies and keep government officials in check. Most Ugandans regard the councils as better than the former system, inherited from colonial rule, in which government-appointed village chiefs were a law unto themselves. The resistance councils in turn nominate delegates to the next tier of government, at parish and district levels. Topping this edifice is the National Resistance Council, which has functioned like a legislature for the past seven years. Participation in the NRM is voluntary, and membership is not mandatory for Ugandans who wish to stand for public office. But by forcing candidates to stand as individuals, rather than as representatives of parties, Mr Museveni ensures there can be no organised challenge to his power. 'This is not a perpetual situation,' Eriya Kategaya, the NRM's national political commissar, says in defence of the 'movement system' of government. 'We do not rule out a multiparty system for Uganda in the future, but for the time being, people still associate the old political parties with chaos. 'The NRM does not seek to obliterate ethnic or religious differences,' Mr Kategaya adds, 'it wants to obliterate the misuse of ethnicity and religion for political ends.' As a result, the March elections for a constituent assembly to design Uganda's new constitution were not without an element of confusion. Political rallies were banned, and candidates were forbidden to reveal their political allegiances, although these were well known among the voters. Instead, they were allowed to 'debate' their views in meetings organised by local electoral commissions. The most hotly debated issue was a clause in the draft constitution that seeks to ban multiparty politics for another five years. Mr Museveni's detractors - mainly northern and eastern communities which formed the stronghold for Milton Obote, a former president now living in exile - regard the Constituent Assembly as an attempt to legitimise the NRM and Mr Museveni's unelected rule. 'The law has locked us out,' says Mrs Cecilia Ogwal of Mr Obote's Uganda Peoples Congress. 'Why should we have to field candidates clandestinely? Why are western donors backing Museveni's regime? They are apologists for a manipulated democracy.' But Mr Museveni's victory in presidential elections due later this year is already a foregone conclusion. Since the new constitution allows a president to serve for two consecutive five-year terms, Mr Museveni could well be in power until 2004. The fact that this does not alarm a majority of Ugandans speaks for Mr Museveni's unrivalled popularity and for the overriding value placed on peace and stability. Most Ugandans believe multiparty democracy can wait. However, even Mr Museveni's supporters worry about the stability of a political system which hinges entirely on the will of one man. The wounds in Ugandan society run deep, and nobody cares to speculate about what would happen to the country if Mr Museveni were suddenly no longer on the scene.</p>

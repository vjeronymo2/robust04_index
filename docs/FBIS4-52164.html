			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- New party Sakigake  [Harbinger] and the group Seiun launched a unified 18-legislator  parliamentary group in the House of Representatives on Monday [9  May], party officials said.    Sakigake, the 15-legislator party, is headed by former Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura in the preceding coalition  government of former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, who lead  his 37-member Japan New Party.    The three-legislator Seiun, a breakaway from the JNP,  splintered after Hosokawa reneged on his promise to merge with  Sakigake. Now, the new parliamentary bloc has emerged as the  fifth largest parliamentary group in the lower house after the  206-member Liberal Democratic Party, the 130-member Kaishin  (Innovation), the 74-member Social Democratic Party and the  52-legislator Komeito.    Takemura distanced his party from the coalition after  Hosokawa decided to side with the chief coalition strategist  Ichiro Ozawa, who is credited with sweeping his ally Tsutomu  Hata to prime ministership in a policy reconciliation talk that  led up to the April 25 Diet vote.    Ozawa and Takemura have confronted each other over the  wisdom  of proposals to expand Japan's parts [as received] in UN  peacekeeping missions, hike the rate of the consumption tax, and  taking a tougher line over the suspected North Korean nuclear  arms program.</p>

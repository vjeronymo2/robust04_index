			<p><P> October 25, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: POP MUSIC / THOMAS K. ARNOLD;  </P> <P> BRIAN WILSON'S RECORD CONTRIBUTION IS BEACHED  </P> <P> Brian Wilson won't be appearing on "The Stars Come Out For Christmas" after  all.  </P> <P> Last month, Wilson was one of nearly 20 major-league pop, rock and country  stars who had agreed to contribute a song each to the locally produced album of  Christmas tunes to benefit the Children's Hospital and Health Center. The album  is scheduled for a late-November release.  </P> <P> Steve Vaus, the project's coordinator, was ecstatic.  </P> <P> "Brian Wilson was one of the first acts we invited to participate in the  project, not only because he's a tremendous talent, but because of his close  kinship with Southern California," Vaus said.  </P> <P> "Initially, we didn't think we had a prayer that he would be at all interested.  But his office responded almost immediately, asking for more details -- and  then, a few days later, they called back again and said Brian had just written  a song, 'Christmas All Around the World,' that he would like to record here in  our studio and let us use on our album.  </P> <P> "Needless to say, we were thrilled."  </P> <P> Alas, it was not to be. Sire Records, Wilson's label, has since refused to let  the creative genius behind the Beach Boys participate in the project because it  would be against corporate policy.  </P> <P> "We first began to hear rumblings that there was trouble in paradise a few  weeks later, after we had already made arrangements regarding scheduling and  Brian's equipment needs," Vaus said.  </P> <P> "His office called us up and said they were having difficulty getting  permission from the label. Apparently Mo Ostin, chairman of Warner  Communications, Sire's parent company, had stepped in and said he didn't want  Brian to do it.  </P> <P> "I immediately sent Ostin a letter, thinking that perhaps he didn't have a  clear idea of what this project was about and literally pleading for his help  and intervention.  </P> <P> "About a week later, I got a call from his assistant, telling me Mr. Ostin was  just not interested in allowing it to happen. She told me, 'If we say yes to  you, we'd have to say yes to everyone else with a similar request, and we're  simply not in a position to do so.' "  </P> <P> Warner spokesman Bob Merlis confirmed the story.  </P> <P> "It is generally our policy to keep our artists off these types of compilation  albums, and it's not because we are heartless, it's because we are deluged with  these types of requests," Merlis said.  </P> <P> "From an administrative point of view, it's easier to just write a check to the  charity than going through mounds of paper work and delving into our artists'  contracts to make their participation possible."  </P> <P> Vaus is not placated.  </P> <P> "Here we have an artist who is certainly one of the cornerstones of pop music,  an artist who has fought against tremendous odds to make a comeback and now  wants to give something back to the community, and he's not allowed to do so  because of some corporate policy that I have a great deal of difficulty  understanding," he said.  </P> <P> "I'm sure they have their reasons, but still, it just doesn't seem right."  </P> <P> The Rolling Stones might have bypassed San Diego last week during the West  Coast leg of the group's 1989 reunion tour, but contrary to speculation, they  do know we exist.  </P> <P> Airbourne/Zorlac, a skateboard manufacturing company in Kearny Mesa, has just  delivered its initial shipment of Rolling Stones skateboards to specialty shops  throughout the country. The boards were commissioned by the British supergroup  two months ago, after they saw an ad in a national skateboard trade magazine  for the firm's successful line of Metallica boards.  </P> <P> "They saw the things we were doing with Metallica and I guess they also wanted  to capitalize on the whole young-punk skateboard image," said Mark Schmid, the  26-year-old co-owner of Airbourne/Zorlac. "Rock 'n' roll and skateboarding go  hand in hand. The rock 'n' roll people want the image that the skaters have --  it's punk, it's hard-core, it's primitive."  </P> <P> Shortly after being contacted by the Stones' office, Schmid said, "We set up an  agreement: We produce the boards, and they supply the art and get royalties."  The four different designs, he added, are all related to the Stones' current  tour and new album, "Steel Wheels."  </P> <P> Schmid said he's optimistic that the Rolling Stones skateboards will prove as  popular as the Metallica boards, several thousand of which have been sold since  being introduced in 1985.  </P> <P> "The Rolling Stones are such a big deal," he said, "that anything with their  name on it will sell."  </P> <P> Is Airbourne/Zorlac looking for any more rock bands to complement its line of  Metallica and Rolling Stones skateboards?  </P> <P> "They would have to fit in with the image," Schmid said. "Like, we couldn't do  a Bee Gees board, or a Sonny and Cher board."  </P> <P> LINER NOTES: Atlantic Records has just released the first solo album in almost  a decade by San Diego singer-songwriter Stephen Bishop. "Bowling in Paris" was  co-produced by Phil Collins, who also plays drums and sings backup on the album  -- joining a bevy of other notable guest artists, including Eric Clapton and  Sting. Bishop is best known for his two 1977 hits, "Save It for a Rainy Day"  and "On and On." . . .  </P> <P> There's no fancy menu requirements, like pickled lime rinds or Courvoisier VSOP  Cognac, in the contract rider for Vladimir Kuzmin and Dinamik, the Soviet rock  band performing Thursday through Tuesday at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary  Art's Sherwood Auditorium. Just a couple of pitchers of "drinkable water" on  stage during each show. Wednesday night, Kuzmin will be at La Jolla's Hard Rock  Cafe for a welcome party, open to the public, at 10 p.m. . . . The Cramps have  canceled Friday and Saturday night concerts at Iguanas in Tijuana because  guitarist Poison Ivy is still recovering from recent eye surgery, according to  promoter Harlan Schiffman. Schiffman said he hopes to reschedule the dates  sometime early next year. Refunds are available at points of purchase. . . .  </P> <P> Best concert bets for the coming week: a grown-up Donny Osmond, tonight at the  California Theater downtown; the Dynatones, also tonight at the Belly Up Tavern  in Solana Beach; Peter Case and the Walking Wounded, Thursday at the Belly Up  Tavern; Concrete Blonde, also Thursday at Iguanas; Top Jimmy and the Rhythm  Pigs, Friday at the Casbah in Middletown; Jimmy Cliff, Saturday at the Belly Up  Tavern; Flock of Seagulls, also Saturday at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa;  Deborah Harry, Sunday at the Bacchanal, and Bad English, Oct. 30 at the  Bacchanal.  </P></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK tries to calm fears over EC capital rules BRITAIN HAS moved to calm commodity traders' fears that the planned European Community capital adequacy rules could harm their profitability, reports Reuter. Treasury officials said that the government had asked the community for discretion in the treatment of commodity brokerages with regard to the planned regulations. 'We have every confidence we will be able to achieve that,' one said. European Commission officials announced on Wednesday that they had made a significant breakthrough in agreeing capital adequacy rules for investment companies to allow them to operate in the community's single market. Some details have still to be settled, but a final political agreement on the Capital Adequacy Directive is possible at a council meeting on June 29. One of the spin-offs of the planned set of regulations is that it could seriously damage London Metal Exchange brokers. The fact that most LME members trade foreign exchange means they get caught by the directive's net. Mr David King, the LME chief executive, said yesterday that he had discussed the issue on Wednesday evening with the UK Treasury. He was accompanied by, among others, Mr Phillip Thorpe, chief executive of the London Futures and Options Exchange. Mr King said the Treasury told him it was committed to seeking 'some accommodation for commodity business within the directive' or ideally to exclude it altogether. 'We have to weigh up every word, almost down to each dot and comma,' he added. One problem for LME members would be that a broker's net worth for regulatory purposes would be reduced by 8 per cent of the value of stocks it holds. At present LME warehouses hold nearly 2m tonnes of metal worth about Dollars 3bn. Mr King said there was also a potential difficulty on the question of large credit exposures. The International Commodity Clearing House would be deemed to be a counterparty, so the large credits outstanding between members and the clearing house could breach the exposure rule. The clearing house, owned by British commercial banks, clears and guarantees business on London's futures markets.</p>

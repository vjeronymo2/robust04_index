			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hollinger floats parts of N American titles Hollinger, the publishing group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, owner of the UK's Telegraph group, is to offer minority stakes to the public in its US and Canadian newspaper chains. Hollinger expects to raise up to CDollars 40m (USDollars 30m) from a share issue by UniMedia, a wholly-owned subsidiary which publishes about 15 French-language newspapers in Quebec, and a number of North American and European religious titles. Once it goes public, UniMedia will also take over nine English-language newspapers, mostly in British Columbia, published by Vancouver-based Sterling Newspapers. American Publishing, which owns about 230 small-town US daily and weekly papers, has also filed a preliminary prospectus for a public share offering. The terms of the issue, including the amount to be raised, are likely to be decided within the next few months. Mr Jack Boultbee, Hollinger vice-president for finance, said yesterday: 'We don't need the money, but we think it's a good idea to get these companies public when the markets are good.' He said the infusion of outside equity should also help boost Hollinger's share price. The shares climbed 25 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday morning, to CDollars 14.25. UniMedia and Sterling had combined sales of CDollars 108m in 1992, while American Publishing's sales were about CDollars 180m. Hollinger said UniMedia would become its 'preferred' vehicle for the acquisition or start-up of newspapers in Canada. Proceeds from the share issue will be used to expand printing and production facilities, and repay inter-company loans. Separately, a labour dispute threatens to shut down two Vancouver dailies owned by Southam, the Toronto-based newspaper group in which Hollinger and the Telegraph each have a 9.4 per cent interest. Southam management and unions representing about 1,300 workers have filed lock-out and strike notices respectively after a mediator failed to settle the dispute. The unions want assurances that jobs will not be lost to contractors or through the sale of divisions.</p>

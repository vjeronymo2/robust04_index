			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'MORANT' SNAPS TO ATTENTION AT ART THEATRE  </P> <P> The court-martial drama, "Breaker Morant," was an Australian play before it was  a movie, and the stage version is making an auspicious L.A. debut at the Los  Angeles Art Theatre.  </P> <P> Actually, the play was seen locally last winter -- CalRep in Long Beach had the  U.S. premiere. That was a strong show, and this production is equally arresting  and for essentially the same reasons: The texture is lean and hard and the  action is vocally punctuated like riffs from a snare drum.  </P> <P> Australian playwright Kenneth Ross' true-life story, set in 1902 South Africa,  is about a trio of bush-ravaged Aussie soldiers who are tried by hypocritical  British forces for murdering Boer prisoners of war.  </P> <P> The production crackles under John Hertzler's visceral direction (not to  mention his flinty, musty set design). This is a show of barrel-chested gusto.  The actors playing the three defendants are Aussies, and many of the voices in  the 15-member cast ripple in the air and certainly carry. This is significant.  You seldom hear distinguished diction on L.A.'s stages.  </P> <P> Curiously, the weak vocal link is Robert Bruce in the searing role of  horseman/soldier/poet Breaker Morant. Bruce too often mushes and swallows his  words. He's also a touch long in the tooth for the fiery Bushveldt Carbineer.  </P> <P> But, as producer, he cast the show with pearls. Steffen Gregory Foster's  earnest defense counsel is heartfelt, Peter Lindsay's physically imposing  soldier-on-trial is dynamic. David Grant Hayward's arch, smirky aide to Lord  Kitchener is deliciously pompous, and Granville Ames plays a poised, silky  witness who reminds you of Robert Taylor.  </P> <P> Unlike CalRep's off-stage military execution, here we see the craven act, see  sparks flare from the fired blanks and freeze on the tumbling bodies. You may  flinch but the production doesn't.  </P> <P> The play was originally performed by the Melbourne Theatre Company in 1978. The  film followed the next year.  </P> <P>  At 11305 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m., and  Sundays, 7 p.m., through April 15. Tickets: $17.50. (818) 763-3101.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Survey of Poland (7): Shaping up for the first free, multi-party elections - Christopher Bobinski and Anthony Robinson examine the emerging post-communist political geography BY ONE of those ironies of fate Poland, which was the first former Warsaw Pact country to break away from communist rule, is now the last to hold free, multi-party elections. Even Albanians have been to the polls, while post-communist Poland's political geography will become clear only after elections this autumn. This means that parliament is still dominated by deputies from the old communist establishment who were guaranteed a two-thirds majority in the lower house by the so-called 'round table agreement' between the Solidarity movement and the Communist party two years ago. Mr Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-communist prime minister, decided to keep this agreement intact and patriotically concentrated on solving Poland's pressing economic and other problems rather than dissolve parliament and call new elections. But he fell foul of the presidential ambitions of Mr Lech Walesa and mounting economic difficulties as his government pushed ahead with a tough IMF-backed economic stabilisation plan named after Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, the finance minister. So instead of parliamentary elections Poland held presidential elections last November and December at the insistence of Mr Walesa, Solidarity's historic leader. After an unexpectedly tough challenge from Mr Stan Tyminski, a previously unknown Polish-Canadian businessman, Mr Walesa won 77 per cent of the vote in the second round to become Poland's first elected president. He inherited the powers of his communist predecessor, General Wojciech Jaruzelski. Mr Mazowiecki's government resigned and the new president virtually hand-picked a new government. It is led by Mr Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, a former Solidarity underground activist and 'liberal' free marketeer from Gdansk, but retains Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz from the old government. His IMF-backed economic stabilisation plan, while fiercely criticised during the presidential election campaign, is recognised as a key element in Poland's international credibility. The outcome of this autumn's elections will hinge largely on the eventual shape of the electoral law now being debated in parliament. Behind an apparently arcane debate on the relative merits of proportional or first-past-the-post voting systems lie important political considerations affecting the future division of powers between the presidency and the parliament. Mr Walesa makes no secret of his admiration for Poland's pre-war strongman, Marshall Jozef Pilsudski, or his interest in the presidential powers once wielded by General Charles de Gaulle. But the exact definition of presidential powers remains to be finalised by the next parliament. Proportional representation alone could lead to the proliferation of small parties which would keep parliament relatively weak. But some of Mr Walesa's closest advisers, such as Mr Jaroslaw Kaczynski, now argue that it would be better to have a few large parties and fear that a UK-style first-past-the-post system could also favour candidates like Mr Tyminski, in multi-candidate elections. A rather complex compromise with greater emphasis on the proportional aspect is now being considered. The elections will see a contest between the various political groups and parties which over the past 18 months have evolved out of the former Solidarity movement. Much divides the parties. But they share a fear of Mr Tyminski, who won a quarter of the vote in the first round of the presidential elections, beating Mr Mazowiecki, the then prime minister and Mr Walesa's main rival, into third place. 'His appeal is so primitive that people of average intelligence only shrug their shoulders in disbelief that anyone can take him seriously, but it brings in votes,' says Mr Kaczynski, who, as well as being the head of Mr Walesa's presidential office is also the leader of the Centre Agreement, which hopes to develop into a right of centre Christian Democratic party similar to West Germany's Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Mr Tyminski's mixture of nationalism, nostalgia for the old communist-style welfare net and promise of capitalist enrichment struck a sympathetic cord with many threatened by unemployment and falling incomes. He is now busily organising a new party called Party X, which opponents say is staffed by shady characters from the old regime. He will not be able to stand for parliament himself as the new electoral law includes a five-year residential requirement for candidates. The political spectrum aside from the X party is rich and varied and no party can call President Walesa its own. Indeed, he stresses that he wants to play an independent role above the political arena. The old ruling communist party disbanded itself after its election debacle in June 1989. But its post-communist successor, the Social Democrat (SdRP) party, claims a 60,000 membership and hopes to win between 10 and 15 per cent of the vote. It is internally divided, however, between a social democratic fraction, led by Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, and a majority of nostalgics led by Mr Leszek Miller who hanker after a re-establishment of the party's former dominance. The Solidarity trade union, Mr Walesa's old power base and the core of opposition to the communists for a decade, is also looking for a new, albeit more modest, political role and continues to feel that it is the ultimate guardian of the process of change in the country. The battle for the crucial centre ground is shaping up between Mr Kaczynski's Centre Agreement and the ROAD group, which includes former Solidarity activists such as Mr Adam Michnik and Mr Jacek Kuron, who backed Mr Mazowiecki against Mr Walesa and who now support his Democratic Union, the former premier's attempt to re-establish a presence in the next parliament. Away to the right are the nationalist groups, the largest of which is the National Christian Union (ZChN), which is most prominent in support of the Catholic church's campaign to abolish abortion. The Catholic church continues as a political force even though it has been damaged a little by its drive to reintroduce religion into schools and opposition to Poland's liberal abortion laws. The church wants to ensure that the Christian Democratic strain of Solidarity retains a powerful role. Meanwhile, recent weeks have seen renewed attempts to forge a coalition of rural parties angry at the government's farming policies. A united farm vote could win some 20 per cent of the seats, block agricultural reform policies and demand protection from foreign competition. The political picture could change substantially over the next few months, however, should President Walesa decide that the threat from Mr Tyminski is strong enough to construct a purely 'presidential' party. Then many political groups would coalesce around the Belvedere Palace.</p>

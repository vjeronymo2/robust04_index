			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Bulgaria reaches agreement on debt reduction Bulgaria has reached a comprehensive debt and debt-service agreement which could amount to a 50 per cent cut in the estimated Dollars 9.3bn (Pounds 6.24bn) it owes to a group of over 300 commercial banks, Mr Stoyan Alexandrov, finance minister, said in Sofia yesterday. The agreement in principle, reached after months of difficult negotiations with its London Club creditors headed by Deutsche Bank, includes an initial downpayment of not more than Dollars 865m and average annual payments of less than Dollars 300m in the first seven years of the agreement, Mr Chavdar Kanchev, a member of the negotiating team, told Reuter. 'The agreement contemplates a menu of options consisting of a debt buyback at a price to be announced by Bulgaria, a collateralised discount bond option, a front-loaded interest reduction bond (FIRB) option and a comprehensive treatment of interest arrears,' Deutsche Bank added. The discounted bond option offers a 30-year discount bond exchanged for existing debt at a 50 per cent discount at LIBOR plus 13/16 per cent and with full principle and 12 months' interest collateral. The FIRB option, with an eight-year grace period, offers an 18-year bond with a stepped-up fixed interest rate starting at 2 per cent for the first eight years and a floating coupon of Libor plus 13/16 per cent for the remainder, West Merchant bank said. The agreement, still to be approved by the Bulgarian parliament and the boards of several creditor banks, is similar to the kind of deal being sought by Poland for its over-Dollars 13bn commercial bank debt. But leading creditor banks last night insisted Poland no longer qualified for the kind of relief achieved by Bulgaria, which has a much weaker economy and a GDP which is continuing to fall. Poland's London Club creditors offered a 33 per cent debt relief package earlier this year. This was rejected by the Polish side which wants a 50 per cent reduction similar to that already achieved on its Dollars 33bn Paris club official debt. The banks are due to meet shortly to discuss making a revised offer to the Polish team, an improvement on the original 33 per cent relief offer, but still well below the 50 per cent the Poles seek.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of communique issued by the Prosecutor General's </F> Office in Santa Fe de Bogota on 7 April]    [Text] In view of the wrong interpretations that some media  have made regarding the letter sent by Prosecutor General  Gustavo de Greiff to Honorable Judge Sterling Johnson, the  Prosecutor General's Office states the following:    1. [number as published] The Prosecutor General's Office, in  its missive, simply provided the honorable judge with a piece of  information requested by the defense lawyers of Mr. Dandenys  Munoz Mosquera in the sense that a person being prosecuted in  Colombia had claimed responsibility for the unfortunate  incidents surrounding the bomb attack on Avianca Flight No. 203  and that no charges had been filed against the person being  prosecuted in the United States.    Constitutional mandate (Article 250) states that in Colombia  the Prosecutor General's Office is compelled to investigate both  the favorable as well as unfavorable elements surrounding the  case of an indicted person, and, as a result, the prosecutor  general contends it is his duty to inform the honorable U.S.  judge about the information being requested by the defense  lawyers of Mr. Munoz Mosquera without attempting to meddle in  the judge's jurisdiction, let alone to assume the defense of a  person being prosecuted in another country. That is why the  information provided by the Prosecutor General's Office does not  contain statements but, rather, specific verifiable facts that  should be taken into consideration by those in charge of  determining the person's culpability in the incidents.    Just as in the past, the Colombian Prosecutor General's  Office has provided the documents requested by the U.S. Justice  Department that led to the correct identification of Dandenys  Munoz Mosquera and to his sentencing in that country for the  crime of providing false identification. The office has also  provided the list of charges that have been brought against him  in Colombia, including charges against him for his participation  in a band of paid assassins and the judicial charges against him  for the possession of weapons and for assisting in a prison  escape. In this case, at the request of Munoz's defense  attorneys, the prosecutor general is referring to a specific  incident, the Avianca case, for which Munoz is not responsible,  according to the evidence on the case contained in our country's  files.</p>

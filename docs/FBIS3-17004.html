			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Two days of talks on Baykonur between Russian and  Kazakh delegations in Moscow with Ukrainian experts taking part  have been quite successful.    A senior Russian delegate told Interfax on Friday that the  negotiators "agreed on a number of points in the inter-state  accord, on which they earlier disagreed."    In his words, "Kazakh representatives responded with  understanding to Russia's arguments that the launch site should  be leased for no less than thirty years." He also said that a  positive solution to the issue was taking shape among both the  military and civilians at Baykonur.    He pointed out that there was the narrowing of positions on  tripartite cooperation in the exploration of space between  Russia, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The sides are near an  agreement on the joint use of the launch pad for a  Russo-Ukrainian Zenith booster at Baykonur.    He confirmed that the problem of compensation to Kazakhstan  for the use of Baykonur over the previous two years would be  discussed by a special commission separately from the overall  talks.    The Kazakh delegation is flying back to Almaty Friday night  to finally coordinate its position in preparation for further  negotiations in Moscow next week.    According to the Russian representative, it now remains for  the sides to work out the wording of an agreement on terms for  the launch site's lease, and complete their work by March 26  when the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan are to sign the  accord.    He said the negotiators stood a real chance of completing  their job by that date.    As Interfax has learned from a well-placed source, President  Nazarbayev is tentatively scheduled to visit Moscow on March  28-29.</p>

"I just tried to go up strong with the ball in overtime."  </P> <P> Washington finished off what teammates Ollie and Scruggs set up for Crenshaw.  Ollie, a junior, scored 17 points in the second half, and Scruggs, a sophomore,  scored 11 in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Cleveland (21-6) was led by senior guard Eddie Hill, who scored 24 points,  including 14 in the fourth and overtime periods.  </P> <P> Crenshaw (22-4) will play Manual Arts in the final for the third consecutive  season next Friday at the Sports Arena.

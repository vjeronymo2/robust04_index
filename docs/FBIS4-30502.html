			<p>BFN     [Text] Chiang Mai -- Deputy Communications Minister Charat  Phuachuai told KRUNGTHEP THURAKIT that the cabinet in May  approved a budget of 35 million baht for the Communications  Minister to help Laos build a road from Houai Sai District of  Bokeo Province to Luang Namtha Province.    The road is about 255 kilometers long and the survey work  will take about six months to complete. The Lao Government,  being aware of the good intentions of the Thai side, has  notified the Thai Goverment that it is now ready to provide all  the necessary conveniences for Thai survey teams to start their  operation.    The construction of the road is expected to cost more than  1,275 million baht -- 80 percent of which will come from a loan  from the Asian Development Bank and the rest from financial  institutions of the Thai Government.    Charat disclosed that a Thai private firm has conducted a  survey for the road construction two years ago and offered to  get loans to finance the project. However, the Lao Government  is still considering the conditions offered by the Thai company.    Touching on the quadruple economic development scheme, the  deputy minister revealed that two piers, each cost 20 million  baht, will soon be built at Chiang Khong and Chiang Saen  Districts of Chiang Rai Province.    Two Thai-Chinese joint ventures have also received approval  from the Lao Government to operate boat services from northern  Thailand to southern China. Another Thai company will also  operate a passenger boat service along the Mekong River. The  Thai Government will provide assistance in the form of equipment  and communications facilities to these companies.    Meanwhile, the Thai Government is lobbying for the opening  of  aviation services between Chiang Mai Province and China's  Xishuang Banna region and between Xishuang Banna, Luang Prabang,  and Kunming. At present, tourists and business people have to  depend on the regular Chiang Mai-Kunming flight for travel from  northern Thailand to southern China.</p>

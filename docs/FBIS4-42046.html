			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "Exclusive" report No. 26 of 29 June] </F>   [Text] WE WILL BE BUILDING SECULAR DEMOCRATIC STATE,  TAJIK OPPOSITION LEADER    The second round of the inter-Tajik talks finished in  Tehran. It brought no peace to the country. The conflict is  still going on. However, experts believe that negotiations will  also continue. The Tajik opposition was represented by one of  its leaders, Co-Chairman of the Movement for Islamic Rebirth of  Tajikistan, 40-year old Akbar Turajonzoda. He graduated from  the Bukhar Religious Institute (Medrese), the Islamic Institute  in Tashkent and the Shariah faculty of the Jordan University.  During 1989-1992 he was Kazikalon (head of all Muslims) of  Tajikistan. An INTERFAX correspondent Andrey Zharov is speaking  to him.    INTERFAX: First of all, it is interesting to know how would  you assess the talks and their results?    TURAJONZODA: The beginning of the talks itself proves that  the international community recognized the opposition as a  reality. It has realized that not only the Dushanbe regime  represented the Tajik people. In fact, this means that the  authorities in Dushanbe regard us as a real political and  military force defending interests of a significant part of  Tajik citizens. A half a year ago Dushanbe was calling us  criminals with "hands in blood." Now Dushanbe understood that  the situation in Tajikistan could not be settled without  participation of the opposition. It encourages that we have  found certain understanding on the part of Russia. The Russian  leadership also realized that the situation in the republic and  in the region could not be stabilized without a dialogue with  the opposition.    INTERFAX: With who of high-ranking Russian officials did you  meet?    TURAJONZODA: I met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Albert  Chernyshov. We also met a deputy commander-in-chief of the  border defense troops and a deputy defense minister.    INTERFAX: How would you assess the role which Uzbekistan is  playing in the Tajik conflict?    TURAJONZODA: There are many facts proving that the Uzbek  leadership helped the present Tajik authorities come to power by  military means. When we took prisoners some militants of the  People's Front, they often said that they had been armed and  supplied with money by Uzbek representatives. Some units were  formed in the Surkhan-Daryin Region (Uzbekistan).    Before militants were brought to Tajikistan they had a  meeting with the Uzbek interior minister and the deputy defense  minister. We know these facts rather well. These formations  brought the current regime in Dushanbe to power.    INTERFAX: You are blamed for attempts to set up a  pro-Iranian Islamic regime in the republic. Is this right?    TURAJONZODA: I never spoke about this either in my statement  or in my articles. On the contrary, I have been repeatedly  stressing that we will be building a secular democratic state.  The opposition already abolished the Party of Islamic Rebirth.  The Movement for Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan was created  instead of it. Most leaders of the movement are democrats and  not the so-called Islamists. As a believer and a religious  activist I would like to live in conformity with my principles  and Islamic traditions. However, I am a realist.    Our people have gone thorough the long-lasting communist  rule. Islam cannot be imposed. The religion of Muslims does not  make anybody leave in conformity with its ideology and customs.  The communist rule showed that people cannot be forced to  adhere to certain ideology.    Communists had used radio, television and other media, were  bringing up people as Marxists starting from nursery schools.  Still they failed to kill the faith. How can we repeat this  mistake by imposing our ideology?    However, if the people itself wants to bring some of the  country's laws in conformity with Islamic traditions through  elections or a referendum, this is quite possible. However, it  must be realized that nothing new could be invented in the  economy.    Natural difference exists between the culture, traditions  and  vision in various countries. That is why I believe that such  issues as marriage, divorce, division of property, etc. Can be  brought to conformity with Islamic traditions but only by a  civilized way and when the people itself wants this.    This could also be done through the parliament. However, I  am categorically against religious rule in the country. We are  moving towards the 21st century and we cannot go back to a  theocratic state. We will not force women to cover their face.    INTERFAX: How does the opposition see the future of  Tajikistan?    TURAJONZODA: The opposition proposes to create an interim  government in which neither the present leadership nor we would  take part. Those who are not guilty of stirring up the  fratricidal war must come to power. During two years refugees  will return. Political parties, including Communists and those  participating in the current regime will be acting freely. The  media must also be free.    Under the mediation of the UN and monitors from other  countries a new constitution will be created which will say that  Tajikistan is a secular democratic country where religion is  separated from the state and which recognizes the right for  private property. The Fundamental Law will also include  provisions on democratic liberties.    The constitution must say that no political regime will have  the right to change it during the next 30 or 50 years, neither  we nor any other party which may come to power. Nobody will  have the right to build the state basing on other principles, I  told Chernyshov. We regret that Russians are frightening  themselves with a scare-crow of Islamic fundamentalism.    INTERFAX: How do you think the talks between the Tajik  leadership and the opposition can be sped up?    TURAJONZODA: The delegations must be of a high level so that  the talks be not delayed. Now, to tell the truth, the Dushanbe  delegation includes no representatives of the regions from which  the people in power have come.    The leaders of the present regime have all come from one  region - Kulyab. This includes E.Rakhmonov (the Chairman of the  Supreme Soviet), A.Dostiyev (his deputy), the interior minister,  the security minister, the minister for foreign economic  relations, the health minister, the deputies defense minister  and all regional heads. Even in Khojent (former Leninabad -  the Motherland of Turajonzoda) the prosecutor general is from  Kulyab. People from Kulyab have all political, power and, as  they say, beneficial, posts. However, none of them is in the  official delegation.    There is a way to make Dushanbe be more active during the  talks - military pressure, I told Chernyshov. However, most  politicians do not want to see the obvious until there is a  bloodshed.    In particular, the Russian Foreign Ministry's Envoy A.Orlov  affirmed that the situation is calm in Dushanbe and that the  government is controlling the situation. Probably, we have to  display our military force to change this deceitful image.    Many people do not believe us thinking that the government  is  really controlling the situation. However, it is quite clear  that Dushanbe agreed to negotiate ceding to Moscow's pressure.  The present regime needs no talks. Russian troops are  defending the borders. Russia supplies Tajikistan with cash  money and food products. Why will the current leaders resign?  The problem is a heavy burden for Russia and Russian citizens  are killed in Tajikistan as a result.    INTERFAX: What is the attitude of your movement towards  Russia given presence of Russian forces in your country?    TURAJONZODA: The Movement of Islamic Rebirth of Tajikistan  does not oppose good relations between Russia and our country.  We propose an honest variant - appointment of a temporary  government - and are ready to consider candidacy of every member  of the Cabinet together with Moscow and other interested states.  I think that the security bodies have dossiers for every of the  possible candidates and Moscow can easily learn everything about  anyone of them.    We are not Russia's adversaries and recognize its  geopolitical interests in Tajikistan. Our Movement is well  aware of the fact that none of the states of the world can  substitute Russia in the republic. We have no such close  relations with any other state, our economy and infrastructures  are "interrelated" with the Russian Federation.    There are forces in the world which are interested in the  development of this conflict. Unfortunately Russia is being  more and more involved into the war, and this results in the  appearance of national enmity. In addition, the Russian  Federation is forced to spend great funds and forces in  Tajikistan thus distracting from other important problems.    Several countries will assist us in waging this war not  because of their love with respect to us but in order to weaken  Russia. It became especially obvious after the victory of  Zhirinovsky's party at the elections to the State Duma. He  openly declared about his intention to restore the Russian  empire and about his plans to seize territories from  Constantinople to Tehran. Many people in this regions are  greatly concerned over these statements and they are ready to  support us. We spoke about this with Mr A.Chernyshev. I  believe that our task is to bring this information to Russia's  people and Russian politicians are to adopt their decision.    INTERFAX: Several terroristic acts against Russian  servicemen both in the capital and other cities have been  registered over the last period in Tajikistan. Has the Movement  something to do with these acts?    TURAJONZODA: I assert that the Movement for Islamic Rebirth  has not planned any acts with respect to Russian citizens and  Russian servicemen, especially in populated centers. We still  believe that Russia is the major guarantor of security and  integrity of our state and our ally.    I think that these terroristic acts have been accomplished  by  those forces which want to deeper involve Russia into the mire  of the Tajik war, to force it to increase its military presence,  and to encounter great expenditures. In fact, this reminds the  events which happened with the Russian army in Afghanistan when  it was bogged down in the armed struggle with the opposition.  We do not want this. Those circles which do not want to  completely settle the Tajik conflict by political means strive  for this variant. I hope that Russian politicians have enough  sound sense to understand who stands behind these terroristic  acts.    In addition, as far as the recent shelling of the bus with  Russian frontier guards is concerned I can say that if our  people had shot from mortars they would not have missed this  target. I assure you. The attackers probably wanted to  frighten Russians and to aggravate the tension.    INTERFAX: I'd like to return to the subject on negotiations  and I'd like to know what was discussed at the second round of  the negotiations in Tehran?    TURAJONZODA: We were talking only about temporary cease-fire  for the period of negotiations and have not started  consideration of the agenda yet. We have determined that  ceasefire should be kept at least till October 1 but we have  failed to adopt any final decision and have not signed any  document.    INTERFAX: Do you hope that this agreement will be reached?    TURAJONZODA: If we did not hope we did not spend time for  negotiations and deceived our people. We have hope but we have  no conviction.    The delegation from Dushanbe asserts that it strives for a  cease- fire agreement but it does not want to include the word  "temporary" into the document. We believe that such agreements  on cease-fire are senseless if they do not lead to a final  political settlement of the problem.    During the first round of the negotiations in Moscow our  delegation proposed to sign an agreement on a temporary mutual  cease-fire under observance of certain confidence measures in  order to make the negotiations process normal. However, the  other side set forth quite unacceptable conditions. Rejecting  temporary nature of the agreement, the Dushanbe delegation  believes that cease-fire should be observed only by the  opposition and only on the state border. As for us, we want to  develop a serious document which will be in force throughout the  whole territory of the republic but not only within the border  zone.    In addition, our party persists in creation of a control  mechanism to observe this agreement with the involvement of the  UN supervisors and introduction of checking posts in hot-spots  within the republic as well. We believe that re-deployment of  Dushanbe's armed forces and Russian forces should be banned for  this period. The main thing is to mutually observe the  cease-fire regime.    INTERFAX: There are many refugees from Tajikistan in Russia  and other CIS countries. What is your assessment of this  situation?.    TURAJONZODA: The Tajik refugees in the Russian Federation  receive practically no aid. And they do not need it. It's  quite enough for those Tajiks who live in Moscow and other  regions of Russia that nobody makes them return to Tajikistan by  force. For example, over the last time the Moscow militia  captured refugees and forwarded them to their homeland by train.  Can we solve this problem in such a way?    These people will not be able to live in Tajikistan, a civil  war is being waged there, there are no working places for them  and there are many economic difficulties. A forced expulsion of  refugees from Russia arouses a negative attitude towards  Russians as well as among Afghans especially after the USSR army  was waging a war against them for ten years.    Sometimes refugees just have no money in order to buy food  products and clothes. Their houses have been damaged or seized  by other people. Men are forced to go to Afghanistan and to  export contraband, drugs and weapons, in order to sell them.  They are forced to join various combat formations in order to  earn some money.</p>

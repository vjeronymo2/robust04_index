			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marat Galeyev, deputy chairman of the State </F> Committee for the Economy of the Republic of Tatarstan]    [Text] Our young state is an economically developed region  of the former USSR, whose gross social product (in 1991 prices)  is estimated at approximately R53 billion, and in 1993 prices,  at more than R4 trillion. The per capita industrial and  agricultural product in the republic is more than 20 percent  higher than the average in Russia. Tatarstan's economy is  undoubtedly heavily dependent on the stable operation of the  enterprises of many sectors, both of Russia and of other states  that were formerly a part of the Union. An analysis of the  republic's economy requires an examination of common problems,  therefore.    The word "crisis," which has become habitual in recent  years,  is the most common characterization of the state of the whole of  the former USSR, both in the sphere of the economy and in  sociopolitical life. The illusory expectations of an improvement  in life introduced to the consciousness by dishonest politicians  as of the 1980's have led to social fatigue and the apathy of  the majority. It is naive to expect any improvement as a result  of elections, referenda, and so forth. Yet the crisis is not  forever. There is, as a rule, a way out of any crisis, and not  just one even. A society, like any person also, has a choice of  development options. The way out of the present one will be  particularly difficult since the economic and political factors  of development are too intricately intertwined, and the  politicians' actions frequently do not fit within the framework  of common sense and have been, from the viewpoint of the  interests of the majority, of an irrational nature. It should be  obvious to everyone today that the economy will not be  stabilized in a short space of time with painless medicine. What  is needed first and foremost for a way out of the crisis is a  correct diagnosis and then the formulation of measures and  persistent lengthy treatment signifying in practice nothing  other than purposeful, dogged work based on definite priorities.    Speaking of a diagnosis, it is essential to recognize that  two processes are under way simultaneously on the territory of  the former USSR:    1. Transition from the administrative-command state-run  economy to a market economy.    2. The formation and development of a whole number of new  states with their own economic and political interests, which  are being manifested increasingly distinctly and which are  gaining strength.    Both these processes overlay one another, which is leading  to  an intermingling of economic and political problems, and diverse  knots of various contradictions are becoming entangled here,  which is frequently superficially once again, from many people's  viewpoint, assuming an irrational nature. A painful transition  from the domination of one interest--the supreme-power interest,  which was implanted for several centuries, had little in common  with democracy, and was divorced from the individual--to a  polycentrism of interests is under way.    An economy based on the interdependence of the regions, but  with regard to economic expediency, is experiencing, following  the country's disintegration, a particular sort of crisis. The  economy of Tatarstan, as of other states, being a part of the  economic complex of the former USSR, monopolized, isolated from  the outside world, and closely interlinked, therefore, is  experiencing the same difficulties and tackling the same  problems as other regions of Russia and the CIS also.    The slump, therefore, has been caused not only by the  transition to market reforms but also the artificial severance  of economic ties, which has occurred not only on the basis of  market expediency but to a considerable extent on account of a  clash of political interests. It has to be recognized that its  own center of economic and political interests has taken shape  in Tatarstan also, which is the objective basis of the formation  of its statehood. The close interaction of all the republics is  possible today only with regard to a balance of one another's  interests. Attempting to emerge from the crisis without regard  to this and seeking the stabilization of the economy to the  dictation of any center whatever is a lost cause. A particular  feature of the economy of Tatarstan is extensive cooperation by  no means just with the economy of Russia but with all the former  republics of the USSR. In addition, relations are being actively  generated with many countries of the world. Whence Tatarstan's  interest in dealing directly, proceeding from the interests of  the citizens of its republic. It is for this that Tatarstan  today needs the status of subject of international law, which is  recorded in its constitution, which was adopted more than a year  ago and has become an instrument of political stability and  harmony in the republic. Tatarstan's cool attitude toward the  draft Constitution of the Russian Federation, whose authors  completely ignored the wishes of the people of Tatarstan  expressed at a referendum and already recorded in the  constitution of the republic, is not surprising but natural,  therefore. Tatarstan cannot, understandably, forgo the interests  of its citizens to the detriment of its own economy and will  seek to continue negotiations to establish normal relations with  the leadership of the Russian Federation based on a bilateral  treaty.    The program of radical economic reforms of Russia, which  sets  their general tone, put the main emphasis on price  liberalization and assumed that prices would shape the main  production structures. But prices perform this role only in a  developed market economy and with the balance and conformity of  the cost criteria and material structures and also the  equivalent interaction of the domestic and foreign markets. As  we all know, we still have a long way to go to achieve this  ideal.    As of 1992, therefore, the Republic of Tatarstan, proceeding  from the specifics of its sectoral structure of the economy and  possibilities, took a somewhat different path from Russia, and  from the Commonwealth countries also. The maximum coefficients  of an increase in the retail prices of basic foods were adopted,  and this ensured a smoother transition to the market and  supported the population of the republic since prices grew in  line with the increase in personal income.    But the continuing inflation is leading to an increase in  the  cost of living and in the cost, primarily, of basic foods in all  regions of the Russian Federation. Under these conditions the  relatively low retail prices in the republic engendered  speculation and other malfeasance in trade. Protecting the  consumer market became increasingly difficult. There came to be  a situation requiring a serious adjustment of the policy  regulating minimum personal income and preservation of the  interests of the agricultural commodity producers.    In connection with what had been set forth by the parliament  of the Republic of Tatarstan, a program of targeted social  protection of the populace of the Republic of Tatarstan which  was of an innovative nature in the Russian Federation was  adopted. It made provision together with an increase in the  retail prices of basic foods for targeted compensation for  children, retirees, the handicapped, and so forth. In addition,  a big step in the direction of an increase in the purchasing  power of the population was taken, and the minimum wage was  revised and increased considerably.    Thus the idea of the targeted nature of protection during  transition to the market is being realized in practice. Its  further development presupposes the monitoring of the dynamics  of prices and incomes. Specifically, a constant adjustment of  the minimum income at the level of the minimum consumer budget  is contemplated as of 1 January 1994.    A comparative analysis of the weekly cost of a basket of 19  most important foods in various cities of Russia and Tatarstan  on 26 October of the current year shows that the city of  Ulyanovsk and the Republic of Tatarstan remain the cheapest.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Weekly cost of a basket of 19 foods on 26 October 1993 (rubles)              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ulyanovsk                             |2,872                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kazan                                 |3,857                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ufa                                   |4,383                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cheboksary                            |4,630                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nizhniy Novgorod                      |5,243                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Izhevsk                               |5,323                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |St. Petersburg                        |5,897                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Moscow                                |6,280                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Average for the Russian Federation    |5,448                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      The chosen particular path of market reforms, which are to a  large extent of an evolutionary nature, also encompasses  government regulation of the reproduction processes in the  sectors of the agro-industrial complex. The redistribution of  some budget funds to the benefit of the agrarian sector made it  possible in 1993 to overcome the slump, and an increase in  production began in the meat and dairy sectors of agriculture as  of March. Thus production in nine months of 1993 constituted  compared with the corresponding period of last year 102 percent  for meat, 110 percent for milk, and 105 percent for eggs.  Productiveness both in terms of the per-cow milk yields and the  average daily weight gains in animal husbandry increased here. A  relatively good cereals harvest was gathered in (approximately 1  tonne per capita, which is a good indicator by international  standards), and potatoes, sugar beet, and vegetables were  harvested in a sufficient quantity.    The alternative economy is gaining strength in the republic  simultaneously.    In the course of realization of the State Privatization  Program, 286 enterprises with a total statutory capital of more  than R166 billion, which employ 185,000 persons, had been  privatized as of 1 November 1993. In 10 months of 1993  privatized enterprises of the republic's industry had produced  27 percent of the total commodity product. In addition, there  are altogether a further 1,000 large and medium-sized  enterprises approximately operating in a privatization mode,  among which are such important associations as Tatneft,  Nizhnekamskshina, Tatsakharprom, and Tatnefteprodukt.    The work performed on privatization made it possible to  prepare the necessary economic base for the sale to the citizens  of the republic of the 1992-issue privatization checks of the  Russian Federation and the registered privatization deposits  (IPV) of the Republic of Tatarstan, which our citizens began to  receive as of August 1993. Auctions selling off shares of stock  of the privatized enterprises and IPV have been held in the  Republic of Tatarstan. These auctions have shown that the price  of the shares purchased for IPV and for cash has been five-seven  times higher than their face value. Shares of the Nefis Stock  Company (the Vakhitov Chemical Works), the Melita Stock Company  (fur-product works), and the Tatmetall Stock Company have been  given a high quotation. The sale of stock at auction for IPV has  enlivened the securities market. At the present time their  quotation constitutes on average 1.84 of their face value, that  is, an IPV valued at R30,000 has sold on average for R55,000,  and in certain places, for R75,000.    Reform of the military-industrial complex is a sore point. A  fundamental restructuring of the entire technology is needed for  enterprises of the defense sector's transition to the  manufacture of civilian products. The sharp reduction--85  percent and more in a number of cases--in the volume of military  orders has brought the majority of these plants and associations  to the verge of financial collapse.    According to an intergovernmental agreement concluded with  the Russian Federation, Russia and Tatarstan are to provide for  the funding of the reprofiling of the conversion enterprises.  The manufacture of the TU-204M passenger aircraft is being  assimilated with the support of the ministries of industry and  economics of Russia and the Government of the Republic of  Tatarstan at the Kazan Aviation Production Association. Orders  for the manufacture of machinery and components for oil and gas  industry and for the agro-industrial complex are being placed at  other former defense plants, and the manufacture of components  for the new auto assembly works in Yelabug is contemplated also.  But a substantial number of financial problems of conversion has  simply not been resolved as yet. A special fund for ensuring a  stable policy of the structural reorganization of the economy in  the republic was formed recently.    One further lever of structural reorganization and the  stabilization of the economy of the republic is the attraction  for a solution of its problems of foreign capital and an  expansion of the network of joint ventures. The stability of the  domestic political situation and the relatively normal  "temperature" of the economic organism are making Tatarstan  increasingly attractive for Western businessmen. The republic  currently has 103 enterprises in which foreign capital  participates: firms of the United States, Germany, Italy,  Britain, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and others.    The experience of recent years shows that Tatarstan, like  everyone else, has been learning to "swim" under the new  conditions of the simultaneous formation of its own statehood  and market reform of the economy. This period will last for  quite some time. A condition of the successful transition to a  new type of economic system is politicians' capacity for  securing the optimum combination of the objective interests of  the citizens residing both on the territory of Tatarstan and  throughout the space of the former USSR. Proceeding from its  possibilities and the wishes of the people, Tatarstan is  endeavoring here to become a worthy part of the world community  and to develop while preserving the evolved economic, political,  and cultural relationships with Russia and the other former  Union republics.</p>

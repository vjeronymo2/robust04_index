Charles John  Koch, a Cleveland savings bank executive and chairman of the council, said it  would be inappropriate to hold the island meeting " when Congress and the  Administration are working to find a solution to this terrible crisis facing  taxpayers and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp". The group said it  was making plans for a scaled-down meeting in Washington.  </P></p>

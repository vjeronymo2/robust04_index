			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWSBITES / BEVERLY BUSH SMITH: WRITERS SELECT YEAR'S BEST MAITRE D', DINING  ESTABLISHMENTS  </P> <P> The Southern California Restaurant Writers named Karel Vidlak of the Wine  Cellar at the Hyatt Newporter in Newport Beach maitre d' of the year at its  awards banquet in Costa Mesa on Sunday. Meanwhile, five Orange County dining  spots received Golden Scepter awards: the Towers at the Surf and Sand Hotel,  Laguna Beach; the Cellar in Fullerton; Antoine at Le Meridien in Newport Beach,  J.W.'s at the Marriott Hotel in Anaheim and Antonello in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Bacchus winners, for superb wine lists and service, were the Bouzy Rouge in  Newport Beach; the Cellar in Fullerton (again!), the Five Crowns in Corona del  Mar and Mr. Stox in Anaheim. The banquet was held at the Westin South Coast  Plaza. The awards recognize restaurants from Santa Barbara to the Mexican  border.  </P> <P> CHEZ LIVES! Though Chez Cary in Orange closed Saturday after 27 years,  expertise gained from working at the Chez still lives all through the county.  Alumni include James Conway, now maitre d' at J.W.'s in Anaheim; Sean Lewis,  manager of the Cellar in Fullerton; Peter Jepsen, now with Hans Prager at the  Ritz in Newport Beach; John Pohl, director of catering at the Red Lion in Costa  Mesa, and Geril Muller, formerly of Ambrosia in Newport Beach and now focusing  on large-scale gourmet on-site catering. As Mary Lou Frazier, a former manager  of Chez Cary, puts it: "It was the Scandia of Orange County! Everyone came  through the Chez."  </P> <P> SPREADING OUT: Open less than a month, Rumari in Laguna Beach is the third  venture for the Crivello family, who also own the Ciao restaurants in Dana  Point and Santa Ana. They've taken the old Villa James and made it -- in the  eyes of Vince Crivello, anyway -- more upscale, more elegant. With Vince in the  kitchen and brother Salvatore out front, the restaurant is serving dinner  Tuesdays through Sundays. A la carte specialties, which average about $15,  include black linguine with seafood; braciole (roulade of beef stuffed with  Parmesan and pine nuts) topped with pasta; and veal chop with rosemary sauce.  (714) 494-0400.  </P> <P> Be Bop Burgers celebrates its grand opening in West Park Center, Alton Parkway  and Culver Drive, Irvine, this weekend. Entertainers on Sunday will include Jan  and Dean and Dick Dale, "king of the surf guitar." (714) 551-1958.  </P> <P> A new Good Earth will open in August at the Crossroads Center, Barranca Parkway  and Culver Drive in Irvine. Meanwhile, the Good Earths in Santa Ana and Newport  Center are offering a pre-theater menu nightly from 4 to 7 p.m, when you can  order four courses, plus coffee or tea, for $14.95. The regular menu also is  available. (714) 557-8433 in Santa Ana, (714) 640-2411 in Newport Center.  </P> <P> On May 15, Carmelo's in Corona del Mar will introduce a new lounge menu to be  offered Sundays through Thursdays from 5 to 9 p.m. Antipasti will include  carpaccio and rice croquettes. There'll be soups, pizzas, pastas and dumplings,  such hearty fare as hot pepper steaks, and desserts. Prices will range from  $3.50 to $8.95. (714) 675-1922.  </P> <P> David Wilhelm's new Newport Harbor-view restaurant (one of three Wilhelm  projects reported here last month), slated for July, will be named Barbacoa and  promises island-influenced cuisine.  </P> <P> CINCO DE MAYO: On May 5, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., the El Torito Grills in  Newport Beach and Costa Mesa will serve soft tacos and margaritas for 99 cents.  Mariachis will play at Las Brisas in Laguna Beach from 5 to 11 p.m.  </P> <P> "I'M GOOFY AND I'LL BE YOUR WAITER TONIGHT": Disney Character Dinners are back  at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, as Goofy, Minnie Mouse and Chip'n'Dale  visit tables, sign autographs and pose for photos. The dinner menu includes  barbecue ribs and chicken, a build-your-own burger and hot dog bar, fish and  pasta, a salad bar and desserts. The tab: $14.95 for adults and $7.25 for  children 12 years and under. Disney Character Breakfasts are offered Saturdays  and Sundays from 7 to 11:30 a.m. ($10.95 for adults and $6.95 for children),  and arrangements for kids' birthday parties can be made by calling (714)  956-6406.  </P> <P> CHOCOLATE ALERT: It's chocolate all the way this weekend at Le Meridien in  Newport Beach. Stay overnight Saturday and you'll be invited to seminars that  afternoon where 16 pastry chefs will teach you to make truffles, chocolate  tortes and chocolate souffles; a Decadent Chocolate and Champagne Reception on  Saturday evening and, on Sunday, a complimentary chocolate souffle brunch where  you can watch the chefs' "best truffle" competition. The weekend (8 p.m. Sunday  checkout) is $168 per couple plus tax. Reservations: (714) 476-2001.  </P> <P> LEAVING TOWN: After looking for two years for a new site in Orange County,  Sharon and Grant Showley of Showley-Wrightson will leave Newport Beach around  June 1 for Napa Valley, where they've bought the landmark Miramonte restaurant  in St. Helena. Two former Showley-Wrightson employees, Dona Wnuk and John  Riley, are negotiating to take the old place over.  </P> <P> CLOSED: Grappa in Newport Beach.  </P></p>

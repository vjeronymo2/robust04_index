			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Spain's election campaign turns to row over KIO THE COLLAPSE last year of the Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.2bn) investment in Spain by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) has taken centre stage in Spanish politics ahead of next month's election. The opposition is calling for legal action against the prime minister, Mr Felipe Gonzalez, and members of the government for failing to supervise Kuwaiti activities in Spain. The issue threatens to reignite a row over Madrid's responsibility in the collapse of the KIO's Spanish empire, which may yet destroy the country's biggest fertiliser, chemicals and foods companies, with a potential loss of 30,000 jobs. Unions and opposition politicians said last year that the government had been negligent in allowing the Kuwaiti government's foreign investment arm into Spain without scrutinising each of its investment proposals in cabinet first. The government has replied that it did not know that the companies through which the KIO was investing in Spain were controlled by the state of Kuwait. But according to a report published yesterday by the conservative opposition People's Party (PP), which some opinion polls put slightly ahead of Mr Gonzalez's Socialists, the government has been lying. 'The KIO is and always has been a part of the State of Kuwait,' said Mr Francisco Alvarez-Cascos, secretary general of the PP. Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, said earlier this year he had always thought the KIO investments were private. Under Spanish law, investments by a sovereign state require cabinet scrutiny and approval. In the case of the KIO, the Kuwaitis moved billions of dollars in profit and investment into and out of Spain between 1986 and 1992, it seems, without the Spanish cabinet ever once asking to see one piece of paper. Yesterday Mr Alvarez-Cascos produced a letter, written in June 1988 by Mr Manuel Conthe, then director general of external transactions in the Finance Ministry and since promoted to head of the Spanish Treasury, which strongly contradicts the government's current position on the KIO.</p>

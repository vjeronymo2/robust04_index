			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Kholodov: "`Precision Weapon' </F> From the Soviet Military-Industrial Complex: Bow tubes...  Logs... Fire!" Designation "Top Secret" is as published in  original Russian source]    [Text] It is customary to believe that the Soviet  military-industrial complex is something "cool," and that in  contrast to everyday trash, equipment of exceptional quality  goes to the troops. But in the country of the "biggest  microprocessors" and "fastest clocks" it cannot be that one part  of the economy does not work and another works. As it became  known to MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI as a result of investigative  journalism, a file is resting in the Main Military Procuracy  under a "Top Secret" [as published] classification which  overturns the impressions about our military-industrial complex.    All this resembles an anecdote. The Americans contrived the  Mk-48 dual-purpose supertorpedo capable of engaging both  submarines at a depth of more than 900 meters as well as surface  ships at a range up to 46 km. The torpedo was guided to the  target by wires, i.e., its warhead had a television camera which  transmitted an image of the target to the weapon operator. In  addition to remote control, the warhead had the usual acoustic  homing system, which switched on and locked onto the target on  the approach. The torpedo had an onboard computer based on the  microprocessors which had just appeared at that time and which  controlled everything.    The latest Soviet torpedo, also capable of carrying a  nuclear  warhead, evidently was being created to counterbalance the  American one. The electronic circuit of the computer in the  torpedo just did not begin to work and they gave up remote  control right away. It proved incapable of it. Each time in  testing the torpedo suddenly would change course and swim away  in an unknown direction--toward our own cruiser, for example,  instead of toward an enemy cruiser. It was necessary to place an  old, antiquated guidance system on the new torpedo, i.e.,  guiding on its wake. They also had to forget about  versatility--each time, the ship commander had to manually set  the target, surface or submarine, against which to fire. But  even this would have been a small loss. It turned out that the  new Soviet torpedo did not know how to swim. Original, right?  This is all the same as a missile which is unable to fly.   <FIG ID=JPRS-UMA-028-14A>      Figure </FIG>     The statistics are as follows: 70 percent of these torpedoes  sink hopelessly. Imagine, with a nuclear warhead at that! Only  from ten to zero percent of the torpedoes hit the target. But  the money for developing the torpedo already had been spent,  eaten up, and... the new "superweapon" was made operational.  Just think, it sinks--what nonsense! The entire Navy, including  modern Tayfun submarines, which Americans allegedly especially  feared, was outfitted with the innovation. True, you  imperialists around the world should tremble: God forbid that  our submarine should fire a torpedo with a nuclear warhead--you  will wear yourselves out getting it off the bottom later. The  nuclear torpedoes on the submarine Komsomolets, about whose  corrosion so much is being said now, are of this very type. The  Dutch refused to get them even for a billion dollars.    But what about the military, you ask? The sailors of course  were outraged. Each time they would receive "twos" in firings.  The Northern Fleet even took the manufacturer, the Leningrad  Torpedo Design Bureau, to court. The procuracy instituted  proceedings. But this problem, too, was solved, and in our own  way: the inspectors began receiving an order not to give "twos."  CinC Navy Admiral Chernavin actually gave the okay for further  rearming--the new dud torpedoes went to the fleets by the  thousands and filled the depots. The old, rather weak, but  reliable torpedoes were taken out of operation. Now they are  unsuitable: their caliber (533 mm) is smaller and they will  "rattle around" in the torpedo tubes. The criminal case was  closed; from the very beginning they classified it and sent it  off to the archives, where, as we were informed in the  procuracy, it now safely abides. And seemingly everything is in  order--no one knows anything. The Navy is fully armed, as they  say.    And so we rearmed with the new torpedoes. Even logs are  better--at least they float. It is unknown how many such files  are hidden in the motherland's storehouses. It turns out the  state military-industrial complex, untouched by competition a  single time in 70 years, comes from the very same page as "the  freest health care." Only the appetites are different. The  Ministry of Defense now demands increasing the military budget  by 1.5 times, including for that same planned  military-industrial complex for arms deliveries. And the public  just was not given an opportunity to familiarize itself with  items of the defense budget, as is customary in civilized  countries. But the fact is, the fight is for R55 trillion! This  of course is a good figure, half of a lemon from each Russian,  including children and retirees.    And it would be nice if the torpedoes swam.</p>

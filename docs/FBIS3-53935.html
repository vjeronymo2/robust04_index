The delegation of commanders, comprising representatives  from  each political force of Afghanistan, have initiated their peace  efforts some two weeks ago to put an end to the ongoing blood  bath in war battered Kabul. The commanders held a series of  meetings and parleys with the warring factions, including  President Borhanoddin Rabbani and Chief of HIA Golboddin  Hekmatyar and discussed with them a number of proposals and  suggestions to thrash out a viable and amicable solution to the  decade long dispute. After thorough consultation and hectic  meetings with combatants, the delegation of the commanders  finally came out with an eight-point peace formula. First point  being the permanent ceasefire, effective from January 20 from 6  am immediate stoppage of propaganda against each other. Other  points included that warring factions would have to leave their  positions by January 30 by handing it over to the commanders  from Kabul province and finally, Kabul commanders would be  responsible for the security of capital. All the combatant  factions would abide by the peace plan.    According to AIP, a four-member delegation led by  Hash-matullah Mujaddodi has arrived here Wednesday [19 Jan]  which would hold negotiations with high-ranking officials of the  Government of Pakistan besides meeting leaders of the Afghan  political forces. A member of the delegation told AIP, that "we  will not agree to any proposal or suggestion which do not  provide assurance regarding resignation of President Rabbani",  Prof Rabbani's resignation was a must for the maintenance of  peace and tranquillity in Afghanistan, he said.    Other members of the delegation included HIA (Hekmatyar's)  Abdul Hadi Arghandiwal, Abdul Karim Zarn of Gen Rashid Dostum's  party and Muhammad Rasul Talib of Hizbe Wahdat.    Meanwhile, the Hekmatyar led Supreme Coordination Council of  the Islamic Revolution of Afghanistan issued a communique  declaring its stand on the Kabul commanders' Shura.    Since the proposal of the Kabul Commanders' Shura is  guaranteeing the declared demands of the coordination council,  therefore, "we will observe the required ceasefire from 6.00 am  in the morning of Thursday January 20. However, it  (Coordination Council) is anxiously awaiting the implementation  of the other points of the proposals of the commanders Shura.  We commend the efforts of the Kabul Commanders' Shura with  regard to the cessation of hostilities and clashes and the  establishment of permanent and lasting peace. We are happy that  the commanders by issuing their proposal have in fact scorned  the claim for jihad of Rabbani and conversely have verified the  rightful stand of the coordination Council".    The Coordination Council while agreeing to the spirit of the  proposal of the Commanders Shura, emphasises the completion of  the Commanders Council in a way which will ensure the  participation of the Commanders of all parties and sides that  have presence in Kabul.    The Coordination Council once again declares its rightful  stand as follows:    1. That Rabbani has to resign unconditionally.    2. The formation of an interim government through a Shura  representing all parties and sides of the confrontation.    3. The evacuation of all armed groups from Kabul.    4. Administration and security of Kabul be assigned to the  commanders Shura. And the commanders Shura be the host of the  proposed decision making Shura due to be called on February 4,  1994.    5. Holding of elections and the formation of national  Islamic army.</p>

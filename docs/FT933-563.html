			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (3): High-tech is a means, not an end / Review of an admirably balanced examination of innovation in industry NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS, A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS by Richard R Nelson (editor) Oxford University Press Pounds 25.00 541 pages THERE IS a widespread belief in Europe that high-technology industries such as electronics and aerospace have a special economic importance and deserve to be supported by governments. Some influential members of the Clinton administration hold the same view, arguing that the US should be more aggressive in defending what are sometimes called strategic sectors or critical technologies against state-subsidised competition from abroad. Yet as Richard Nelson observes in his conclusion to this admirable study of national innovation systems: 'There does not seem to be strong empirical support for the proposition that national economies are broadly advantaged if their firms are especially strong in high tech and disadvantaged if they are not'. The US economy, Nelson Points out, has been lagging badly for nearly 20 years in spite of continuing dominance in some high-tech industries; France, he suggests, has been economically successful 'more despite her efforts to nurture and subsidise her high-technology industries than because of them'. Even if the existence of successful, nationally-owned high-tech companies is thought to be a desirable objective, the record of government policies in this field is at best uneven. In his chapter on Germany Otto Keck notes that in the post-war period the federal government 'was hesitant in assuming responsibilities for science and technology, and where it did, as in nuclear power, aerospace and electronic data processing, its programmes for supporting industrial technology were ineffective'. Francois Chesnais writes that a large part of French high-tech industry has been shaped by military demand; competitiveness in commercial markets has not been helped by 'the highly customised, non-generic features of military technology and their very low degree of transferability to civilian uses'. He also argues that the overwhelming bias in favour of defence-related technologies has been to the detriment both of the chemical, biological and life-science sectors and of industries such as machine tools which tend to be dominated by small companies. US experience shows that, in certain circumstances, especially when a technology is at an early stage of development, defence-related procurement can be a stimulus to commercial application. This was the case in semiconductors in the 1950s and 1960s, when the existence of a large military demand in the US lowered the marketing-based barriers to entry. Small firms such as Texas Instruments could direct their development effort to the needs of a single large customer and use that business as the basis for building a broader range of customers and applications. The American contributors to this volume, David Mowery and Nathan Rosenberg, suggest that commercial spillovers from defence research and procurement fluctuate over time within a specific technology; the trend in recent years has been for the needs of the two markets to diverge and thus for spillovers to diminish in importance. So what should governments do? Two crucial determinants of a nation's innovative capacity are the education and training system and the macro-economic environment. It was institutional innovation, particularly the close links between research-oriented companies and the science departments of universities, which gave Germany the lead in dyestuffs and pharmaceuticals at the end of the 19th century; some 3,000 chemists were employed in German industry in 1897, far ahead of Britain and the US. In more recent times Korea and Taiwan are examples of education-led growth. Their ability to move quickly from simple to complex products was made possible by the availability of a young, highly-educated workforce. As for the economic environment, fiscal, monetary and trade policies need to be designed in a way which encourages firms to compete in world markets, rather than 'hunkering down' in protected national markets. With the partial exception of the US, exposure to international competition has been a characteristic of most successful innovating nations. In addition, governments have an important role in supporting basis research. Problems arise when they go 'downstream' and back specific industries and companies. In an interesting chapter on Japan, Hiroyuki Odagiri and Akira Goto concede the importance in the 1950s and 1960s of MITI's control over the importation of technology and the restriction on inward investment. These policies probably contributed to Japan's catch-up with more advanced countries, but since the early 1970s the involvement of MITI has been much less and government-business relationships have been weakening. The authors stress internal competition as one of the keys to the country's technical progress. Entry into growing industries has been fast and frequent, inducing in the companies 'a strong sense of crisis and a motivation to be innovative'. Picking winners in the hope of establishing world leadership in an emerging technology is risky and potentially expensive. As Nelson argues, active government policies are often more effective when they are aimed at encouraging industry to take up new technologies than when oriented towards subsidising big breakthroughs. In Germany, for example, after their lack of success in targeting specific sectors, the authorities have recently been focusing on the diffusion of technology and on strengthening cooperation among firms or between companies and public research organisations; the aim is to alert companies to technological frontiers and to create links between suppliers and users of specialised inputs. British policy has been moving in a similar direction. The 15 countries covered in this book include large and small industrial states (Sweden, Denmark, Canada, Australia and Israel, as well as the four bigger European countries, the US and Japan), and successful and less successful developing countries (Brazil and Argentina as well as Korea and Taiwan). As a collection of papers from different authors, the book is unusually coherent in its scope and analysis. It provides a wealth of information not just about technology policies, but about the institutional and cultural factors which influence each country's industrial performance. There is no single route to success. Thus Korea and Taiwan are similar in their commitment to education, but in other respects have followed quite different policies. Korea has encouraged the creation of large conglomerates and resisted inward investment; Taiwan has been less favourable to large firms and has admitted foreign companies selectively. In some cases, as in relations between Japan and the US, differences in innovation systems have become a source of trade friction. But Nelson is surely right to describe as somewhat hysterical the current concern about allegedly unfair competition in high-tech industries. Much of the concern is based on misunderstandings about how governments intervene and about the effects of intervention on competitiveness. This book is an important contribution towards more balanced discussion of high-tech issues and more rational government policies.</p>

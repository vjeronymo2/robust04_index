			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / MPs back separation for roles of City regulators MPs on the cross-party Treasury committee yesterday in a report gave the government, the Securities and Investments Board and the Personal Investment Authority - the proposed new regulator - separate tasks. The government is told that it should legislate to allow SIB to refuse to regulate financial services organisations for which another appropriate regulator exists, instead of such organisations being able to insist on being regulated directly by SIB. SIB would welcome this power, but the government is most unlikely to want to legislate at all on financial services, so its prospects look doubtful. For SIB, the MPs propose conditions to be attached to its decision to recognise the PIA as the regulator for retail financial services. These relate to the public-interest PIA board members. The most important and difficult is to give the PIA board a clear majority of public-interest members, excluding the chief executive. They also propose that SIB approve public-interest appointments and that public-interest directors be nominated by outside organisations, such as the Treasury and relevant consumer interests. SIB and the PIA will consult about these recommendations, and the Treasury will also be involved in the discussions. Mr Joe Palmer, PIA chairman, saw difficulties with an immediate change in the balance of the board, particularly given general agreement that the size of the board should not increase from its current 21. He said the regulator might be accused of 'bad faith' in altering its governance in such a fundamental respect when the board's composition had already aroused strong views in the financial services industry. Many life companies and independent financial advisers had signed up on the basis of a board comprising 10 public-interest members, 10 financial services practitioners and the chief executive. Even though Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said last year there should be a public-interest majority within a smaller board of 15 members - implying fewer practitioners than on the board at present - Mr Palmer said it would be difficult to reduce their number and meet the requirement to have a proper balance of industry representatives. The PIA itself has a longer list of tasks, which include: Completing its rulebook by the end of the year. Maintaining a public and accessible register of individual sales agents and advisers. Maintaining a register of firms offering fee-based advice and keeping a close eye on companies which operate on the basis of commission alone. Ms Colette Bowe, PIA chief executive, said a rulebook would be published next month, though this would contain sections of rulebooks from existing regulators and would be amended in the longer-term.</p>

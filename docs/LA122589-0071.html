			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> UNION-TRIBUNE EMPLOYEES TO STAGE 'WORKING STRIKE'  </P> <P> Employees of the San Diego Union and Tribune had no immediate plans to strike  Sunday evening, but a member of the San Diego Newspaper Guild said job actions  will begin Tuesday that will constitute a "working strike."  </P> <P> "People in every department will be doing everything they can that's legal to  show management that they depend on our good will," said Ed Jahn, guild  president. "Some people may refuse to use their personal cars for work-related  assignments. Others may stop writing their stories at 5:30, when their shifts  are over."  </P> <P> Jahn said a rally has been planned to take place inside the Union-Tribune  building Tuesday, but he declined to give specifics.  </P> <P> "We have never condoned vandalism or intimidation tactics," he said. "On the  other hand, management has to know that we're human beings, and when people get  wrapped tight or humiliated, they may react as they see fit."  </P> <P> Herbert Klein, editor in chief of Copley Newspapers, publisher of the morning  Union and the afternoon Tribune, said: "Whatever they're going to do, we'll be  prepared to handle it. I would presume that their professionalism will  prevail."  </P> <P> Guild members have worked without a contract since June, 1988. No negotiations  have been held between the Union-Tribune management and the guild since talks  broke off early Saturday, when, shortly before 12:30 a.m., negotiators for  Copley Newspapers rejected a guild proposal for a three-year contract that  included a major concession to do away with the closed shop that currently  forces all employees represented by the guild, whether members or not, to pay  dues. The announced strike deadline had been 12:01 a.m. Saturday.  </P> <P> Since then, negotiators for the guild, which represents about 1,150 reporters,  photographers and advertising, circulation and other employees, have said a  walkout could come at any time.  </P> <P> "The most effective strike in the newspaper business is a surprise strike,"  said Craig Rose, a Union reporter and a member of the guild's strike steering  committee. "We want to have an effective strike."  </P> <P> Late Sunday, an answering machine at strike headquarters played this taped  message:  </P> <P> "A meeting was held today to make preparations for a possible strike which we  could call at any time. We've appreciated all of your support so far. We want  people to continue to get ready. Wear your running shoes next week. Take your  strike gear with you to the office. We are getting ready. . . . Keep the  faith."  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOTEL REBUTTAL  </P> <P> I just stayed at the Hotel Amigo recommended in "Brussels is a City Not to be  Ignored" by James T. Yenckel in your June 10 Travel Section. Unfortunately, I  did not have the same pleasureable experience as your writer.  </P> <P> I was quoted the highest price for a single (about $170 U.S.) and assumed I  would have a choice room.  </P> <P> There was no hot water for a bath in the morning. I complained to the desk and  was told there was no problem with hot water. That evening, there was still no  hot water. That night was record heat and there was no air conditioning in my  room. I assumed there was none in the hotel. I learned otherwise by accident  and asked to be transferred. I packed, moved, unpacked and tried the hot water.  None. Four hours later, after complaining again, I had hot water. No price  adjustment, no expression of regret or apology from the manager.  </P> <P> I had arranged for a car to pick me up at checkout to take me to the airport.  The concierge offered this service, but I wanted the driver I had used. My  driver had come but had been sent away by the concierge, who said I was not in  the hotel. These incidents almost ruined a wonderful vacation.  </P> <P> CHARLES M. CHUCKROW  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

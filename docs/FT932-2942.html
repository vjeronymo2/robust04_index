			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets: Catastrophes enrich the top reinsurers  -Shares in Munich Re and Swiss Re have put on speed recently Buoyed by tightening capacity and rising reinsurance premium rates, Munich Re and Swiss Re, the world's first and second biggest reinsurance companies, can look forward to a period of rising prosperity. Their shares have surged ahead strongly in recent months. On past experience the 'turn' in the insurance cycle augurs well for the reinsurers. Between 1984 and 1986, the last time reinsurance rates rose significantly, the share prices of Munich Re and Swiss Re doubled relative to their local stock markets and tripled in absolute terms. With the reinsurance market in a similar state of buoyancy today, reinsurers could be embarked on a similar bull run. Underpinning the upturn is a fall in the capital committed to reinsurance markets, following a sharp growth in the frequency and cost of natural catastrophes. The cost of major storms in the 10 years between 1983 and 1992 escalated to Dollars 52.1bn compared with Dollars 18.9bn between 1980 and 1989. The failure of many Lloyd's syndicates and smaller London market companies - which acted as 'reinsurers of last resort' - has reduced drastically the supply of high level excess of loss reinsurance, leading to cumulative rate increases of up to 800 per cent for high level catastrophe reinsurance over the past four years, and more moderate rises across the board. Messrs Michael Huttner and Angus Runciman, analysts with BZW Research, estimate that capital available to back reinsurance premiums has fallen by some Pounds 4.8bn over the last three years. 'The hard market,' BZW predicts, 'will be sustained for the next three years at least.' The collapse of the London market has led to a 'flight to quality' by buyers seeking greater security from reinsurance companies. BZW expects bigger companies to dominate a 'two-tier market', with the market share of the world's top 15 reinsurers winning market share at the expense of smaller competitors. Reflecting these new market conditions, shares of reinsurers have begun to rise strongly. Last month the share price of Munich Re's registered stock reached DM3,220, an increase of more than 30 per cent from their 1992 average of DM2,510 and in excess of 50 per cent from their 1992 low of DM2,065. The price of Swiss Re's registered shares touched SFr3,100 in mid-April, nearly 50 per cent above their 1992 average price of SFr2,322.50. Analysts are almost uniformly bullish. Mr Tom Bennett, of Paribas Capital Markets, says that following its strong performance in recent months, Munich Re has a further dimension as a heavily discounted investment trust, with its net worth of more than DM5,000 per share based largely on a strong portfolio of German equity investments. BZW suggests that 'Munich Re . . . would probably outsurvive its competitors in the event of the worst possible event (for the reinsurance markets), a Tokyo earthquake' and also recommends investors to buy SCOR, the smaller French reinsurance company, as well as Swiss Re. Mr Peter Constable, an analyst with Flemings Research, also favours Swiss Re, which has recently refocused on to its core reinsurance business, following an ill-fated diversification into service companies in the 1980s. He says the company will be a major beneficiary from recent rate increases. But with foreigners still unable to buy the company's registered shares, and bearer shares thin on the ground, Mr Constable recommends that large investors buy participating certificates issued by the company. Mr Constable, however, sounds a cautious note on Munich Re. He says the company's results in the past two years have been supported by a release of provisions in 1990 and 1991 and by 'abnormally large' realised gains in 1991 and 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A two-day meeting between state delegations of  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia ended in Bonn today. In this  connection, Alija Izetbegovic, president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, made the following statement for  Bosnia-Herzegovina Radio and television:    [Begin Izetbegovic recording] I am on the line from Bonn,  where talks between us and the Croatian delegation ended an hour  ago. I must say that the talks were organized by the German  Government and that they took place with the help from German  Foreign Minister Mr. Kinkel and Cochairmen Owen and Stoltenberg.  These talks took place last night and they lasted for several  hours until midnight last night, because we arrived late  yesterday afternoon, and all day today. They lasted for more  than 10 hours with interruptions.    Nothing special has been achieved. We did not expect much  from these talks anyhow. As far as we are concerned, we drew  their attention to three important issues: the situation in  central Bosnia, Mostar, and access to the sea.    Regarding central Bosnia, we took the line that military  disengagement ought to be carried out by the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO] withdrawing from Vitez and Busovaca. In return,  our army would not enter these towns; they would be entered by a  mixed police force. However, the Croatian side unfortunately  rejected this proposal.    Regarding Mostar, we insisted on a solution that has already  been put forward, that Mostar be administered by the European  Union for two years after the agreement is signed. In that  period, the main job for the European Union would be to return  home all Mostar citizens. This period would be under the slogan  "Mostar to the Citizens of Mostar"; that is, all citizens of  Mostar who have been evicted would return. Their number is huge  -- tens of thousands of people have been evicted, several  thousand families have been evicted from Mostar. They would  return. Now they are scattered; some are in Croatia, some in  Bosnia, and a huge majority of them are now in Germany and in  Nordic countries. Our aim is that these people should return to  Mostar. I would like to stress that we cannot accept any  definition which says that Mostar is only a Croat town. We  cannot accept it. Mostar is a Muslim town. It is a common  town. We will insist on that.    Regarding access to the sea, there has been no progress. The  Croatian side is toughest here. Now they have come up with a  new proposal: to cede for 50 or more years a part of the coast  at the Peljesac peninsula. This actually means leasing it for  50 or more years. This refers to a part of the coast on which  we could build up a port. We took that proposal into  consideration, but of course we did not give any answer.    We also initiated another series of current questions,  primarily the release of all prisoners. According to our  information, we are talking about another several thousand of  our people. The Croatian side claims the figure is not as high,  but it is not denying that a certain number of our prisoners --  which it has promised to release soon -- are still in prisons,  like those at Heliodrom near Mostar, Dretelj, and Ljubusko.    We also insisted on having a hospital sent to us, a large  field hospital in the east side of Mostar, which is currently in  the port Ploce and has been there for a long time. It was said  that this issue has been resolved and that it is now up to the  UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] to transport the hospital, and  that there are no further obstacles. [sentence as heard]    The helicopters are unfortunately still in [Croat-held]  Medjugorje, I mean our two helicopters which arrived there to  pick up the wounded. According to the Croatian side, the  problem there is that we have not released 71 Croat prisoners  who were on the list. We will have to examine this issue again.    I must say that the Croat delegation surprised us with one  of  their proposals. We were taken by surprise by it. It is a  draft agreement on comprehensive cooperation between  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia. They are offering a creation  sometime in the future of a common market, a customs union, and  even a monetary union between the two states. They also  proposed that we have free access to the sea, that there should  practically be no borders between the two states, and so forth.    This is an interesting proposal which, I must say, was made  at an inopportune time. Of course, we did not reject such a  proposal. We did not accept it either. We did not have the  mandate to discuss it. I told them this, but said that we will  examine the proposal seriously, to see all its implications on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, to see what it contains, and what the  political, economic, and other consequences would be. Among  other things, the creation of a so-called common market was  envisaged. This was an interesting proposal that took us a bit  by surprise.    I must emphasize that these talks were talks between the two  state delegations. In our state delegation I had with me  Foreign Minister Ljubijankic and Mr. Komsic. On their side,  apart from Tudjman and Dr. Granic, their deputy prime minister  and foreign minister were representatives of the Bosnian Croats.    This was, in the main, the outcome of the talks which ended  this evening. [end recording]</p>

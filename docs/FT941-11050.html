			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Israel backs 'open skies' policy to encourage tourism: Charter flight rules liberalised Israel yesterday approved an 'open skies' policy liberalising the country's aviation regulations to promote competition and boost tourism. The new policy, which will come into effect on March 1, will encourage competition on fares, give airlines greater freedom to decide the number of flights to Israel, and promote flexibility of charter flights. The reform cancels the obligation for El Al, the state airline, to have an equal number of flights with foreign airlines on a given route and allows international airlines to increase flights to Israel. It gives travel agents freedom to give discounts on tickets and cancels the Dollars 25 (Pounds 16.60) commission on ticket purchases. The policy provides for an increase in charter flights, allows charter companies to carry Israelis as well as tourists and makes licences for peak seasons more flexible. Mr Uzi Baram, the minister of tourism, said the new policy would increase the number of tourists to Israel, which last year reached 2m. He said the policy was 'significant but not optimal'. The reforms, he said, should have been approved six months ago but met objections from El Al until the government agreed to continue paying the state airline 80 per cent of the high costs of its security operations. El Al yesterday welcomed the reform and said: 'El Al feels its efficient operations will allow it to compete on the basis of price and improved service.' El Al is expected to report 1993 profits of Dollars 10m, against the trend in a globally depressed airline industry. The Israeli Ministry of Energy yesterday said it had chosen Sofregas of France to undertake a detailed study on the options of importing natural gas into Israel. The state says it needs at least 3m tonnes of oil equivalent by 1996/97 to convert its power plants to gas and is considering at least four possible gas deals with foreign countries and companies, including Qatar and Egypt.</p>

			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / UK Company News: UK hotel advance for Forte In the second half of its year, which ends on Monday, Forte's UK hotel and restaurant businesses showed some improvement but trading in continental Europe remained difficult, writes Michael Skapinker. London hotel occupancies were healthy but average rates paid had been lower than Forte previously hoped. However, rates had begun to recover in recent weeks. Provincial hotels in the UK had begun to show some recovery but hotels elsewhere in Europe still faced tough trading. Volumes in UK roadside restaurants were static but spending per head had grown. The Relais roadside chain in France had been adversely affected by lower traffic volumes, but the company, bought at the end of 1992, was still expected to be earnings enhancing in its first year. Forte said the maturity of its debt had been further lengthened during the second half of the year and borrowings had been reduced from Pounds 1.3bn in July to less than Pounds 1.2bn.</p>

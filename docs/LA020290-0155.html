			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MALL PROPOSED FOR AREA CITY SEEKS TO CLEAN UP;  </P> <P> REDEVELOPMENT: A RETAIL CENTER IS PLANNED IN SANTA ANA NEAR A STREET THAT  POLICE ONCE DESCRIBED AS 'THE HEAVIEST TRAVELED FOR NARCOTICS.'  </P> <P> One of city's most notorious, drug-infested areas may soon become the site of  an outdoor mall.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday will consider a proposal for an eight-building  retail center on Bristol Street near McFadden Avenue, in an area where the city  plans to launch a separate, $335-million redevelopment project.  </P> <P> The retail mall, proposed by developers Hyun M. Youn and Donald Krotee  Partnership of Santa Ana, would be on the east side of Bristol between Brook  and Cubbon streets.  </P> <P> City staff members are recommending that the council approve the center, which  would be named Bristol Village, as part of the effort to clean up the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Drug dealers used to speed down Brook and Bristol streets to escape police  until the city blocked off the junction of the streets with a concrete barrier.  </P> <P> Police described Brook Street as the "heaviest traveled street for narcotics,"  where dealers waited for their customers who bought drugs without getting out  of their cars. Police resorted to mounted horse patrols on Brook Street in  1988, after children were reportedly playing with bags of marijuana.  </P> <P> The redevelopment project would be developed in three phases, according to a  staff report. The first phase would replace three boarded-up houses. The second  and third phases would require the developers to acquire several properties.  But those buildings would be razed anyway, because they have numerous building  code violations, the report said.  </P> <P> "Vacant land typically becomes an enforcement problem, as (it) historically  (has) resulted in the collection of trash and debris as well as providing  refuge for undesirables to congregate," the report said.  </P> <P> Richard Spix, an attorney at Hermandad Mexicana Nacional Legal Center, said  Thursday that the mall would remove needed housing from the city.  </P> <P> "The city is going to tell the people who currently live there that they are  better off living in a mall," Spix said.  </P> <P> Spix is representing two people in a suit filed Tuesday against the city  seeking to block the 783-acre Bristol Street redevelopment project. The  plaintiffs are Robert Gonzales, an optometrist who has worked in a Bristol  Street office for two years, and Evangelina Avalos, a single parent who lives  on Brook Street with her four children.  </P> <P> Spix said Santa Ana, in its goal to redevelop the city, has "historically  failed to provide replacement housing" for residents who are displaced, or to  pay relocation costs.  </P> <P> "Before the City Council adopts a redevelopment project, they should have had a  plan to help the residents who cannot afford to move," Spix said. "The city is  taking too much away from the residents."  </P> <P> City officials have said that under state law, Santa Ana must pay the fair  market price for the homes taken for redevelopment and must pay to relocate  anyone affected.  </P> <P> Mayor Daniel H. Young, who fought for the Bristol Street project, said: "I'm  quite disappointed in the suit. Richard Spix has had a long record of getting  in the way of a positive agenda in the city."  </P> <P> Young said he has not yet studied the latest proposal for the smaller Bristol  Village and has not decided how he will vote.  </P> <P> "The neighborhood is a very sensitive area," he said. "If we allow anything to  be built on that site, it has to be first-class."  </P> <P> The 28,000-square-foot center would have an additional 100,000 square feet for  parking. It would consist of single line of buildings, topped by a clock tower.  </P> <P> The city and the developers, who are aware of the crime problems in the area,  have been working on plans for the center for three years, a spokesman for the  developers said.  </P></p>

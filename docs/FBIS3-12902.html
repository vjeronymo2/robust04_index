Rabin was addressing a seminar at the Hebrew  University on the subject of the civil service in the time of  peace. Jack Katzenell reports:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] There is no point in  negotiating an agreement if after a short time it can be  reopened, Rabin said, for if that is the case, there must be  serious doubt about the value of any new agreement which will be  negotiated in the future. In the wake of the Hebron massacre,  the PLO has demanded the stationing of an international force in  the territories, the withdrawal of settlers from Hebron, and the  wholesale disarming of settlers as conditions for a resumption  of the talks, but in Rabin's view, this would mean rewriting the  agreements reached in Oslo and more recently in Cairo. This  view was echoed by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the Knesset  this morning, after he appeared before the Foreign Affairs and  Defense Committee:    [Peres] The time, which is evaporating and disappearing, is  a crucial one, and I personally believe that the most  contributing change to the present situation will be the  implementation of the agreement. Instead of opening the  agreement, let's better realize it, and then all of us will see  that we do not have an agreement about a piece of paper, but we  do have an agreement about the new reality.    [Katzenell] Also present at the Hebrew University seminar  today was Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, Dr. Ahmad al-Tibi. He did  not agree that the PLO's demands constituted a reopening of  signed agreements:    [Al-Tibi] At present, 'Arafat and the PLO leadership is  committed to the peace process. We are not talking about  opening agreements; we are talking about a new circumstance that  was created after the massacre. The most important and cardinal  point should be security for Palestinian civilians. This issue  should be solved as soon as possible for the sake of both  parties in order that we will be able to come back to the  negotiating table.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1100 GMT on 7 March carries  a similar report, noting that al-Tibi added "that we are in the  midst of an agreement which, in another five years, will bring  about a Palestinian state in all the territories captured in  1967. During this process, Israel must provide answers to the  burning security issues of the Palestinians in the territories.  Al-Tibi also said that the IDF [Israel Defense Forces], as the  sovereign power in the territories, failed in the defense of the  Palestinian residents."]    [Katzenell] Prime Minister Rabin called on the PLO  leadership to overcome the pain and anger created by the Hebron  massacre and return to the negotiating table quickly. The  longer this is delayed, Rabin warned, the more opportunity there  will be for Palestinian terrorists or, perhaps, another Jewish  madman to exploit the break. [end recording]</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Design industry on show The UK's Designers and Art Directors Association - familiarly known as D&amp;AD  -has acquired a sorry reputation for mismanagement in recent years. Still Britain's premier design trade body, it is now trying to polish its image. D&amp;AD's relatively new chairman - Anthony Simonds-Gooding has been in place for just a year - and president - Aziz Cami, of the London design agency The Partners - are concerned that industry has forgotten the importance of design as a core activity. Cami's and Simonds-Gooding's efforts to raise D&amp;AD's profile come together in an important London event next week. Billed as 'London's first festival to communicate to the business community and the general public the real value of creative excellence,' D&amp;AD will be hosting a variety of lectures and exhibits in a 20,000 sq ft marquee in Bedford Square. Touche Ross is one of a number of sponsors, which between them have chipped in Pounds 250,000. It will be 'a festival for green shoots, aimed at clients and at catching their imagination, to convince them of the importance of design excellence in the businesses, as well as a chance for ordinary consumers to see the way in which design is present throughout their lives,' says Simonds-Gooding. Visitors will be able to sample selections of the best in advertising and design from around the world. Some exhibits will then go on a 12-city global tour to promote the export potential of British design. For Cami the festival has a dual purpose: 'For years Britain has been seen as a centre of excellence in design and advertising. To keep that position we must be more aware of the competition, to stop us resting on our laurels. And the design industry needs to articulate to business the UK's home-grown talent, which needs to be exploited more by industry.' Tickets and further details are available on 081 862 0202.</p>

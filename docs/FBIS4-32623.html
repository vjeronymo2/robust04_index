			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been a further decline in the share of  exports in the national income. According to the National  Polish Bank, at the end of last year the foreign trade deficit  reached over 2 billion zlotys. Maciej Lesny, under secretary of  state in the Ministry for Foreign Economic Cooperation, has told  journalists that this trend is against the government's  intention. Proexport state policy guidelines, which were  prepared recently, attach much importance to economic contacts  with Russia, the opening of the European Union markets, and the  elimination of protectionist measures.    [Begin Lesny recording] First, we will be able to give  export  incentives to large exporters. Second, we will be able to  insure them to cover not only commercial risks but also  political risks, which is extremely important. Third, reputable  exporters or importers will be able to receive refunds of  customs duties and taxes very quickly, if they have to use  imported components for the manufacturing of goods earmarked for  exports. Home producers will be able to receive VAT  [value-added tax] refunds on goods to be exported.    In the near future, we hope to work out solutions that will  enable those who have to import materials in order to export  their products later to avoid paying any charges as a result.

			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Loosening of the corporate web: Japan's company networks, the keiretsu, seem to be adapting to changing conditions Japan has long been criticised for excluding foreign companies from its markets by non-tariff barriers, such as allegedly cartel-like industrial groups and opaque distribution systems. Its US trade critics say that one of the most powerful impediments to the entry of foreign companies into Japan's markets is the keiretsu system of corporate families. These bind together corporate Japan in a web of mutual protection, ownership and alliances, and make Japanese companies all but impervious to hostile takeovers. Now, however, there is evidence that the web is loosening, as alliances that have lost their commercial value are discreetly severed and crossholdings of shares sold off. The keiretsu are reorganising to make more efficient use of management and capital in the aftermath of the worst recession since the second world war. These diversified families of industrial companies are often built around banks and general trading houses like the so-called horizontal keiretsu, the three largest of which are Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. The other model is the vertical keiretsu, which consists of a chain of dealers and suppliers headed by a manufacturer such as Toyota, Matsushita or Nippon Steel. They form a weighty elite in Japanese business life. The top six horizontal keiretsu employ nearly 5 per cent of the Japanese labour force and account for 16 per cent of corporate sales. Because of their vague structure, their boundaries are hard to define, so their influence on the economy is much greater. The links between keiretsu family members are traditionally forged through mutual exchanges of finance, contracts, managers and technology. These are supported by multiple cross-shareholdings, with members typically holding small equity stakes of less than 5 per cent of each other. No single member has decisive control, but total holdings by members of the same keiretsu can amount to an invulnerable 90 per cent of an individual company's equity capital. Keeping it in the family is generally recognised to have been a factor in the postwar success of some of Japan's top companies. It has also contributed to the traditional stability of Japan's capitalism, with its lifetime employment, loyal shareholders and cheap long-term bank finance. Foreign competitors argue that these qualities give keiretsu - by which they usually mean Japan at large - the advantages of being immune to hostile bids and less prone to bankruptcy than themselves. They form cosy cartels at home and abroad and succeed in 'keeping outsiders out and insiders in', complains a recent report for the US congress. Japan's keiretsu appear to have something in common with continental European conglomerates in countries such as France, Germany and Sweden, many of which share their belief in long-term relationships - and their aversion to hostile bidders. But the similarity is deceptive: European conglomerates tend to have a central holding company, where strategy is formed. There has been no equivalent centre for keiretsu since the abolition of the zaibatsu holding companies after the second world war by the US occupying forces (an attempt to eliminate the industrial groups that had monopolised the prewar economy). A consequence of having no holding company is that the disappearance or weakening of a keiretsu member causes little damage to the rest of the group. It resembles a hydra, with no central brain yet equipped with many tentacles, each able to repair itself independently. The European conglomerate has a simpler and more vulnerable design, more like an octopus. Some of Japan's trade critics argue that the banks and trading companies that tend to do business with most members of a keiretsu act as their nerve centres. Each keiretsu also holds a regular, usually monthly, presidential council, when the heads of member companies meet for a chat, another opportunity for co-ordination. But they are diffuse centres, and getting more diffuse at that. Japanese banks, unlike their European counterparts, exercise little boardroom power, unless a company is in serious trouble. There is evidence that the keiretsu system is adapting to the globalisation of its markets. The old corporate groups are becoming more open to doing business with foreign partners. Mitsubishi, for example, is expanding its ties with Daimler-Benz, the German automotive and aerospace group - these are designed to help Daimler-Benz gain a foothold in Japan and south-east Asia, while strengthening Mitsubishi's international competitiveness. There are also signs of a watering down in the system of cross-shareholdings. Keiretsu members sold Y1,550bn (Pounds 10bn) of shares in each other in the first eight months of this year, well on the way to beating last year's record Y2,148bn, itself more than double the previous year, according to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The reduction in mutual equity stakes has been strongest in traditional manufacturing industries where keiretsu are strong, such as paper and pulp, cable, electrical machinery and transport equipment, says Nomura Research Institute. Overall, the crossholdings that NRI has been able to track down fell marginally from 29.3 per cent of the total stock market to 28.9 per cent last year. But the institute suspects that the changes within individual sectors are much bigger and the overall figure itself may be larger because of unreported share sales. If the keiretsu system is loosening up, it is doing so strictly under the control of its main players. Most of the cross-shareholdings sold recently were placed with friendly shareholders rather than in the open market, says Mr Keith Donaldson, director of equity research for Salomon Brothers Asia. Another sign that the keiretsu are changing is that they are broadening their purchasing patterns, buying more of their materials and components outside their groups. According to the Fair Trade Commission, Japan's anti-trust body, the average share of keiretsu members' sales to each other slipped from 7.64 per cent in 1989 to 6.85 per cent in 1992 and is continuing to slide as the yen's strength makes imports cheaper. The trend is especially strong in the car industry, which is more exposed than most to international competition. Toyota has been reducing its dependence on its components affiliate, Nippondenso, since instructing it to start making parts for Nissan four years ago. Last March, Isuzu, the truckmaker, and Suzuki, the producer of minicars, cut their business ties after 13 years of making each other's vehicles, on the grounds that they had outlived their purpose. Some believe this marks the beginning of the end for the system. 'In the next two decades, keiretsu will become a thing of the past. They were good at rebuilding Japan and good at international competition when it was advantageous to have a main bank at the centre of your grouping,' predicts Mr Kazuo Chiba, counsellor to Mitsui, the oldest and most distinguished keiretsu. 'That is now becoming irrelevant.' Yet the pace of change is dictated by the keiretsu themselves, reflecting the instinctive Japanese distaste for uncontrolled competition. There is still a gulf between Japanese capitalism, where allegiance to customers, employees and other group members is what counts, and Anglo Saxon capitalism, where shareholder value comes first. Even if keiretsu were to vanish, that gulf would remain, since the values they embody are at the heart of Japanese capitalism. Much of the stock market value of Japanese companies - keiretsu Mitsubishi or non-keiretsu Sony - lies in unwritten loyalties between management, shareholders, workers and a multitude of special business interests. That is why Japanese corporate culture remains resistant to hostile takeover bids. Such a bid would end up devaluing the company because it would wreck those valuable links. 'Japanese companies are not to be treated as if they are commodities,' explains Mr Katsuhiro Nakagawa, a director-general at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, with long experience of lecturing US officials about keiretsu. As for the presidential councils, Mitsui's Mr Chiba swears that they have become blurred shadows of their former businesslike selves. 'They don't discuss business per se, just information in a general sense. It was more dynamic in the old days,' says Mr Chiba. However, while keiretsu may be an ageing component of Japanese capitalism, they appear to be adjusting to a tougher new environment, in which Japanese business relationships are becoming more sensitive to market forces. It would not be the first time that Japan's adaptability has surprised its competitors.  ------------------------------------------------------------ KEIRETSU: JAPAN'S CORPORATE NETWORK  ------------------------------------------------------------ Sales and Intra-group relations 1993**  ------------------------------------------------------------                  Member    Employees      Turnover        Net               companies       ('000)  (yen '000bn)    profits                                                      (yen bn)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Mitsubishi           25        216.0          30.6        588                     (29)                                 2.26* Mitsui               22        248.1          34.8        679                     (26)                                 2.60* Sumitomo             16        125.3          24.7        167                     (20)                                 0.64* Fuyo                 24        294.2          34.6        385                     (28)                                 1.48* Sanwa                41        376.9          38.4        658                     (44)                                 2.52* DKB                  42        448.3          60.1        585                     (48)                                 2.24*  ------------------------------------------------------------ All Japan                   37,262.1       1,465.1     26,054  ------------------------------------------------------------                  Assets     Ratio of            Intra-group            (yen '000bn)  Intra-group               stock                            sales (%)            holdings (%)                                                  A          B  ------------------------------------------------------------ Mitsubishi         25.0         14.2          1.81       38.2                    2.01* Mitsui             27.0          5.8          1.34       19.3                    2.17* Sumitomo           15.4         11.3          1.56       28.0                    1.24* Fuyo               26.6          5.6          1.29       16.9                    2.14* Sanwa              33.0          3.2          1.41       16.7                    2.65* DKB                45.0          4.9          1.03       14.2                    3.62*  ------------------------------------------------------------ All Japan        1243.7  ------------------------------------------------------------ ** Financial year; figures in brackets include financial firms; * percentage share of financial firms; A = the average ratio of intra-group stock holdings per group firm, including financial firms; B = the ratio of total intra-group stock holdings, including financial firms  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: Toyokeizai Data Bank, Japan Fair Trade Commission  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

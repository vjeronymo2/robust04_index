			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Management: A new concept placed in context - Peter Drucker tells Christopher Lorenz why he considers re-engineering vital for western companies FEW people are more wary of business fads than Peter Drucker. He is rightly jealous of his long reputation as the proponent of a wide range of ideas with real staying power, such as professional strategic analysis, management-by-objectives, the importance of proper marketing and the changing role of managers in knowledge-intensive organisations. So why does the cover of a new bestseller on the latest fashion carry a ringing endorsement from the 83-year-old Drucker that 're-engineering is new and it has to be done'? Face-to-face, Drucker concedes disarmingly that, in one sense, re-engineering is far from novel: that the radical redesign of business processes and their operation by cross-functional teams - which are the twin cores of re-engineering - has been carried out by a string of western companies for at least a decade, especially in product development and manufacturing. Drucker claims some chemical and pharmaceutical companies have used such processes for even longer. And he traces re-engineering back as far as the radical streamlining of retail ordering and stock control which Marks and Spencer pioneered in the 1930s - using an old-fashioned cigar box, rather than today's computer, to store vital information from the tags torn off by cashiers. So why make that claim on the book jacket? And why fuel the re-engineering fashion still further, when Drucker warns against what he calls 'the disease of having a cure-all every six weeks or five years'? The reason is certainly not, as cynics might allege, that Drucker has worked loosely in the past with Michael Hammer and James Champy, the two American consultants who wrote the book, Re-engineering the Corporation*. The man is too honest to exaggerate the importance of something just because of a relationship. In any case, it was his belief in re-engineering which caused him to work with them in the first place. He extols the importance of 'massive re-engineering' in his latest book, Post-Capitalist Society**. 'Look, re-engineering is new because we didn't have it as a concept before', he says in conversation. Only when something is established as a systematic discipline or organisable process, he argues, does it really have an impact  -even if, 'as with all such things' there is a danger that some people will see it as the solution to all their problems. He considers re-engineering to be especially vital for Anglo-Saxon companies, because of their past enthusiasm for innovation at the expense of productivity. As he says, it was only in the 1980s that American industry turned its attention to closing the productivity gap with Japan. Hence its enthusiasm for total quality management, followed in quick succession by 'lean management' and now re-engineering. Recognising the risk that companies will turn their backs on a difficult TQM process in favour of the more glamorous promises of re-engineering, he recalls a famous English historian's comment about a 19th century statesman: that 'he tried to reduce the secret of diplomacy to one law, but that even the Good Lord needed 10'. 'Not one of these things by itself provides the answer,' stresses Drucker. Rather than any one supplanting the other, they are cumulative. Together, he says they form the first of 'the three fingers of keeping an organisation alive. He calls this the 'continuous improvement finger,' which is confusing because re-engineering is far more dramatic than the 'continuous improvement' of TQM. But he is adamant they are close cousins. Whereas this first finger is basically inward-directed, the other two deal more with a company's external strategy. The second is what Drucker calls 'exploitation - or rather, extension'. He sees as the best example 'the enormous product range which Sony has built out of one American product, the tape recorder'. The third finger is genuine innovation - the basket into which America used to put all its eggs. Just as mindful as he was decades ago of the need for companies to balance short and long-term priorities, Drucker sees some danger that re-engineering and other elements of the relatively short-term 'continuous improvement finger' may distract attention from longer-term strategy and innovation. But he welcomes its various facets as 'focusing overdue attention on productivity improvement'. Far more clearly than Hammer and Champy, he discriminates between two types of re-engineering: the re-design of sub-processes, and the really exciting stuff which, by reconfiguring entire processes, also alters the strategic and competitive rules of an industry. Much re-engineering, including order-handling and a Ford parts supply process which Hammer tends to cite frequently, is of the first kind, claims Drucker. 'It deals with very specific operations which are not too different from what we talked about in operations research in the 1950s.' In the second, more far-reaching category he puts the reconfiguration of complete processes such as Wal-Mart's elimination of several levels of retail stock-holding - or, for that matter, Benetton's. These deal with the fundamental question of what work an organisation should do, rather than just with the simpler one of how to do it. As for the hotly-argued question of how to handle re-engineering and other 'change management' processes, Drucker stresses that management structures, as well as the business processes beneath them need to be re-engineered. He is also in no doubt that there is little point trying to change an organisation's 'culture' before altering the tasks of the people within it. He gives two reasons. First, 'culture is very largely dictated by the task - take the very distinct cultures of a hospital or a school'. Second, 'culture is very difficult to change - like the converted drunkard who doesn't hit the bottle again until Monday morning, backsliders always outnumber converts'. True to the erudition which has always delighted his fans, Drucker illuminates this managerial conundrum with a taste of philosophy: 'I grew up an almost extreme believer in salvation by faith - I believed only in Kierkegaard. But I've learned over 60 years that, for most people, salvation by works is much more effective.' * Nicholas Brealey Pounds 16.99. Harper Business Dollars 25. ** Heinemann Pounds 16.95.

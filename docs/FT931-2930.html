			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / 'Ethical' stance helps Co-op Bank THE Co-operative Bank's marketing campaign to brand itself as an 'ethical' bank helped raise its retail deposits by 13 per cent last year, and return a profit after two years of losses. The bank, which has 2.3m customers, made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 9.8m in the year ending January 1993 against a Pounds 5.9m loss the previous year. The value of customer deposits rose above the value of loans for the first time in 20 years. The bank announced in May that it would not become involved with tobacco companies, or those that pollute the environment. It has also taken a stand against blood sports, factory farming and the testing of cosmetics on animals. Mr Terry Thomas, managing director, said it had appealed to some of the most potentially profitable bank customers. These were white-collar and managerial employees aged between 25 and 40 who were classified in the social classes ABC1. 'We know the question of ethics has a ring to them because they are concerned about issues like protecting the environment,' he said. Half of the Co-op's new customers since May mentioned the ethical stance as a motive for opening an account. The bank, which is wholly owned by the Co-operative Wholesale Society, has now issued 173,000 of the gold credit cards which it launched in September 1991. Mr Thomas said he thought it was now the largest UK issuer of such cards. The month before sterling left the exchange rate mechanism last October, the bank announced it would not speculate against sterling. Mr Thomas said foreign exchange profits of Pounds 450,000 for the year reflected this policy. Retail deposits rose to Pounds 1.24bn from Pounds 1.09bn the previous year. The bank cut provisions for bad debts by 10 per cent to Pounds 42m, against Pounds 47m, and its ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets rose to 11.8 per cent, against 11.6 per cent.</p>

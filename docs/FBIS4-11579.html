			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 26 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The National  Police announced today the arrest of two alleged assassins of  Epaminondas Gonzalez, the Constitutional Court president, who  was killed on 1 April.    Deputy Police Director Armando Orellana explained in a news  conference that the detainees are brothers Marlon Oliver and  Mario Rene Salazar Lopez. The arrest of the two alleged  assassins of Gonzalez belong to a "well-organized band" of car  thieves, and there is "enough evidence" of their alleged  implication in the magistrate's murder, according to Orellana.  The police added that Marlon was arrested on 11 April and Mario  was arrested two days later in Monserrata neighborhood, southern  Guatemala City.    According to Orellana, the masterminds of Gonzalez'  assassination used a red Japanese-made car, which hours before  the crime was stolen from Rolando San Ramon and was later  intentionally set on fire.    In the vehicle [words indistinct] -- three remain to be  seized -- and according to the investigations, Mario Oliver  Salazar was the one who fired the .38-caliber automatic at  Gonzalez for resisting the theft of his vehicle, according to  the deputy police director. He explained, however, that it will  be up to the courts to determine the responsibility of the  Salazar Lopez brothers.    Gonzalez, the man who returned the country to a  constitutional regime following the unsuccessful coup attempt  perpetrated by ousted President Jorge Serrano on 25 May 1993,  was assassinated at his home located in Zone 2 of the Guatemalan  capital.    The vehicle used in the attack appeared two days later in  the  San Cristobal neighborhood in southern Guatemala City. On 15  April the authorities announced the arrest of Geovanni Reyes,  Abimael Samayoa, and Alfredo Santos Lopez, but Orellana said  they have been unable to determine if they have any connection  with the Salazar brothers.</p>

			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Slack still growing in companies THE number of companies operating at less than full capacity is increasing and export orders are shortening, according the latest quarterly survey of Bradford Chamber of Commerce, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The chamber says fortunes have been mixed and there is no firm evidence that the recession may be ending. The survey, of one in eight businesses, shows improving balance figures  - the difference between the proportion reporting improvements and declines - in home and export orders and in deliveries. There was a weakening in the proportion of businesses reporting growing export orders - from 32 per cent to 29 per cent - and the chamber says that is cause for concern. Only 23 per cent of the 217 respondents are at full capacity, a deterioration of 3 percentage points on the quarter. Interest rates remained the most important factor in need of improvement.</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Aids can sell papers, not clothes: All sides are 'united in revulsion' at the latest Benetton advertisements THE BACK page of yesterday's Guardian is dominated by a picture of a man dying of Aids. He is being comforted by his family. It is, if you go in for this sort of thing, a moving picture, the sort which I imagine has graced the pages of the Guardian many times before, and probably of a number of other newspapers who regard the Aids virus as being of pressing interest to a large number of their male readership. But the Guardian, on this occasion, was not in the business of soliciting sympathy for Aids victims. It was more in the business of soliciting lack of sympathy for a clothing company, Benetton. You see, Benetton, an Italian clothing retailer, planned to use the picture, without comment, as an advertisement for their latest clothes. And, boy, are people unsympathetic about it. One newspaper, which devoted most of its front page to the story yesterday claimed that 'A shocking advertising campaign by clothing giants Benetton united health officials, the fashion world and a leading charity in revulsion last night. It features a real-life Aids victim being comforted on his death-bed by his grieving family.' Presumably had the picture been of an actor pretending to be dying of Aids, health officials, the fashion world, and a leading charity would not be 'united in revulsion,' but perhaps united only in slight distaste. I think rather that Benetton should be praised for producing one of the few advertisements which are not make-believe, incorporating all the tricks of the acting profession and the imaginations of highly creative film producers. I am still reeling from being authoritatively told that all the products you see in food advertisements are painted. You would probably die of lead poisoning if you actually eat food prepared in such a way, but it looks yummy. The Health Education Authority would prefer that Aids was portrayed by advertisers as they treat food: very appetisingly. Its spokeswoman, Lynn Walsh, commented that 'To show such a bleak pessimistic picture doesn't help anybody. Although Aids is deadly many people enjoy years of life before falling ill.' How true. Perhaps if Benetton had superimposed a slogan on the dying man's shirt which read 'I'm dying of Aids but I've had a good time', the Health Education Authority would feel that decency had been satisfied. That admittedly would reduce the advertisement from being merely obscure to being dishonest - but nobody minds dishonesty when it reassures their own prejudices. At the heart of the outrage being expressed against Benetton is the charge that the Italian company is 'exploiting Aids for profit'. I have never understood this particular aspect of English puritanism, that regards the desire to shock and be paid for it, as inherently more sinful than the desire to shock and be subsidised for it, or, in other words, why, as Digby Anderson of the Social Affairs Unit once expressed it, 'Exotic, loss-making homosexual pornography is a cause to campaign for, but highly profitable mass market, heterosexual pornography is not.' American Vogue has robustly decided to run the Benetton advertising campaign. But English magazines have not. Margaret Alderson, The editor of Elle magazine is to leave blank the double page spread booked by Benetton for its next issue, and will instead carry a letter from Anderson, explaining why the ad had been dropped. She told the Guardian it was 'incredibly insulting'. What I suppose she means is that the ad would insult so many of her readers that the profit from selling the space would be outweighed by the losses caused by cancelled subscriptions. Like Benetton, exactly like Benetton, Alderson is in business to please her consumers. You might have noticed that although the press has managed to 'unite in revulsion' the fashion, health care and charity industries, it has failed in what must have been its first objective, to gain a 'revolted' on-the-record-quote from the mother of David Kirby, the Aids victim portrayed. That is because Mrs Kirby consented to the photograph being used, Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator</p>

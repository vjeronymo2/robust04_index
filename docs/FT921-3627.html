			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Grolsch to lift payout by 10% GROLSCH, the Dutch beer group which recently acquired Ruddles, the UK brewer, is to increase its 1991 dividend by slightly more than 10 per cent, after raising full-year profits by a similar rate. The company, which has more than doubled in size since 1990 with the takeovers of Ruddles and Wickuler of Germany, said it was 'well satisfied' with its performance in 1991, in light of challenges presented by economic recession and the Gulf war. Net profit for the full year rose 10.6 per cent to Fl 41.9m (Dollars 22.6m), on sales up 67.5 per cent at Fl 791.5m. The sharp rise in sales mainly reflected the first-time consolidation of Wickuler, a regional brewer in Germany's Ruhr area. Ruddles will be included in Grolsch's accounts from February 21, 1992. Grolsch's 1991 dividend will be raised to Fl 5.20 from Fl 4.70. The company is forecasting a further profit improvement in 1992. Unlike Ruddles, which needs no restructuring, Wickuler is being revamped to boost efficiency and focus on its three main brands. Grolsch expects the German unit, which posted an unspecified 'satisfactory' after-tax profit in 1991, to start making a substantial contribution to profit per share from 1994. Hunter Douglas, the Dutch-based manufacturer of window coverings and architectural products, posted a 41.7 per cent decline in net profit in 1991, extending the trend of the first half. Despite the downturn, it said it would hold its dividend at Fl 2, citing a sound balance sheet and confidence about the future. The company is forecasting an improvement in results for 1992.</p>

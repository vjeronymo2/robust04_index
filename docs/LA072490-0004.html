			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> "Who you gonna call? Ghostbusters!" goes the refrain in the movies of the same  name. Don't ask Jan Contreras of Arcadia to join in the singing, though.  </P> <P> After receiving countless phone calls at home from giggling kids -- especially  after the release of "Ghostbusters II" -- she realized that her telephone  number, 446-7828, spelled GHOSTBU.  </P> <P> What's worse, on two occasions she was investigated by Pacific Bell. Why? Angry  parents wanted to know why Contreras' phone number was showing up on their  bills.  </P> <P> Contreras has since had the number changed. It was that, she said, or take her  boyfriend's suggestion of "going into the business of getting rid of ghosts."  </P> <P> Speaking of who you gonna call, the dashboard sign on one parked car with a  two-toned paint job in Pacific Palisades (see photo) had a helpful suggestion.  </P> <P> Only in L.A. Home Furnishing of the Week: A house for sale for $975,000 in  Studio City features a master bath with, among other appointments, "a sub-zero  refrigerator." Probably a Whirlpool.  </P> <P> John Stein of Mar Vista wonders if there isn't something to the stereotype of  health-obsessed Southern Californians, judging from local merchants with such  names as "The Rug Doctor," "Floor Doctors," "Shower-Door Doctor," and "The  Drain Surgeon."  </P> <P> The latter, no doubt, has a great sink-side manner.  </P> <P> And now, an exciting scene from next week's episode of Chocolate CHiPs:  </P> <P> Signs on the city's Commuter Express buses warn that eating aboard isn't  allowed. And the rules are enforced.  </P> <P> Justin Fishbein was making a downtown-to-Chatsworth run the other day when the  driver stopped and declared:  </P> <P> "I smell a cookie."  </P> <P> He then confiscated a bag of freshly baked goods from a munching passenger. The  edibles were returned to her when she reached her destination.  </P> <P> Bill Wolf, a vice president for Air L.A., collects memorable letters received  by the local commuter airline. He shares some excerpts from his favorites.  </P> <P> "I am interested in a career in flight attendance," a Georgia woman wrote.  </P> <P> A Portland man seeking an "airline travel career" said his past employment "was  at a cafeteria in my high school as assistant cook, which takes a lot of  working with the chief and dealing with the customers."  </P> <P> A Finnish writer, perhaps thinking Air L.A. was the CIA, wrote: "I am writing  to you because you do not take bribes. . . . (Such-and-such) mining company  bribes people. . . . Would you be so kind and send (this) letter to the United  Nations?"  </P> <P> And then there was the mysterious postcard from Poland, which offered greetings  and added: "Send friend with Poland."  </P> <P> You may remember when locals joked that the freeway system had been named after  an Israeli prime minister. After all, the signs said: "Begin Freeway."  </P> <P> Joe Lyou of L.A. says that he always thinks of the French president when the  on-ramp signs say:  </P> <P> "Meter On."  </P> <P> </P> <P> miscelLAny:  </P> <P> Two of the most one-sided electorates in the county are Rolling Hills, where  only 15% of the registered voters are Democrats, and Compton, where just 4% are  Republicans.  </P></p>

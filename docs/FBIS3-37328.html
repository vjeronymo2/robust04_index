General Leonid Ivashov asked  nodding at the tape recorder on the table in front of him.    "Hm, hm," was the positive response.    General Ivashov reached out for his packet of Monte Carlo  filter cigarettes, lit one, and began to talk about his  skepticism toward NATO's plan for cooperation with Russia's  former allies in central and Eastern Europe.    "NATO's Partnership for Peace means firstly a creeping  expansion of the alliance. Second, it means that NATO's armed  forces will suddenly be standing at Russia's western border,"  the uniformed general said, exhaling smoke into the room. There  was a knock at the door.    "Come in," the general growled, interrupting himself.    A servant-like young man wearing a white shirt and a tie  entered. He was carrying a tray with five cups of freshly made  coffee and these were placed in front of those present in  General Ivashov's office: two Russian generals, two Russian  colonels, and one Danish journalist who would like to hear  something of what people here at the Staff for the Coordination  of Military Cooperation in the CIS think about security  developments in Europe and why Moscow has contacted Denmark with  a view to military and political cooperation.    The serving of the coffee was very discreet and stylish and  light years removed from what people are used to at the majority  of Russian restaurants in the city.    Each person present had been given a note pad; on the table  there was a crystal container filled with newly sharpened green  pencils, mineral water, Coca Cola, and a plate of cookies and  chocolate waffles.    They had really spared no effort.    General Ivashov is worried that the world will again be  split  into military blocs in competition with each other. According  to the general, NATO's military cooperation with the former  Eastern European countries and the Baltic republics is directed  against Russia. Joint exercises and maneuvers are not something  you hold for their own sake.    "I ask myself the whole time who these military efforts are  directed against. Is this really necessary? It seems extremely  doubtful."    My question about why Russia itself does not simply sign up  for NATO's Partnership for Peace gave rise first to a short  silence. General Ivashov glanced at his colleague, General  Viktor Koslov, and then answered hesitantly with an apologetic  smile.    "Russia could of course participate, but the question is  whether Russia wants to. NATO's cooperation model assumes that  there a first-class allies -- that is, the old members of the  alliance -- and second-class allies -- those countries which  must undergo a process of admission which I would not perhaps  call humiliating... but which would at least mean that Russia's  legal status in the alliance would for a while be lower than  that of Denmark and Luxembourg," said General Ivashov, whose  words were being recorded by a uniformed colonel.    Here in the beautiful turquoise-colored building at  Leningrad  Boulevard 41 in the northern part of Moscow which was built on  the initiative of Vasiliy Stalin, the dictator's son,  immediately after World War II, the Warsaw Pact had its  headquarters from 1955 up to its dissolution under Gorbachev.  The CIS countries' defense staff moved into the aristocratic  building in the spring of 1992.    The thermometer on the wall outside the main entrance  showed minus 17 degrees on this Tuesday morning. The armed guard  stood to attention and saluted as I drove into the staff's  courtyard as an official guest. The snow crunched dryly under  the tires.    The Russian generals think that NATO, instead of admitting  Moscow's former allies by the back door, should begin strategic  cooperation with the nine former Soviet republics which have  joined in a collective security agreement in the CIS. It is  Ivashov's view that the CIS and NATO should then jointly  guarantee the security of the countries which stretch between  the two blocs as a neutral belt.    "For example, I believe that the Baltic countries and Poland  would feel just as safe with such an arrangement," said Ivashov,  who fears that an expansion of NATO to the east will lead to the  formation of new military blocs.    The four officers' uniforms are in contrast with the  political aspect of the defense cooperation in the former Soviet  Union. General Ivashov and his colleagues pushed the military  aspects into the background the whole time and stressed the  political aspects of cooperation. All decisions are made in  line with the UN Charter and in consensus as in NATO.    It is partly in this context that the recent request from  Moscow to Denmark with a call for cooperation on conflict  prevention and peacekeeping operations must be seen. The CIS  countries are tired of being ignored by NATO and are hoping that  cooperation with Denmark within the framework of the North  Atlantic Cooperation council will provide a better opportunity  to make their voices heard in the international arena.    It is refreshing to see that there are no pictures of any  bigwigs -- either old or new -- on the walls of General  Ivashov's office.    The only decoration -- if you can call it decoration -- is  the flags of the 12 CIS countries which stand in a row on the  general's desk.    "The agreement on collective security in the former Soviet  Union gives greater priority to political and international  legal mechanisms than to the purely military aspect. Our  experience shows that military intervention does not give rapid  results, but rather leads a conflict into a blind alley,"  Ivashov said, taking a drink of coffee.    The general rejected the suggestion that Moscow is driven by  imperialist ambitions in the former Soviet Union. Ivashov  pointed out that in the past Moscow made all the decisions  alone, and that it was then up to the republics to follow orders.    "It is not like that any more. The Soviet Union was a  unified state. The CIS is a community of independent states.  The collective security system presupposes civilized rules for  interaction. Russia has no territorial claims on any country;  we are all living up to our international commitments in the  United Nations and the CSCE."    The Soviet Union fell apart at the end of 1991. To begin  with a majority of the former Soviet republics tried to retain  the Soviet army as a united army. However, these attempts  failed. For a while the dream of a joint supreme command under  the CIS lived on. People are now trying instead to cut their  coat according to their cloth and for this reason the CIS  command has had its name changed to the Staff for the  Coordination of Military Cooperation in the CIS.    "We have now postponed the efforts to build a joint army  because of economic difficulties and the political situation.  Instead we are concentrating on coordination, so that  individual national armies are built up according to the same  principles," the general continued.    A post of secretary general has been created after the NATO  model and for the first six months it is being filled by a  Russian diplomat, Gennadiy Shabannikov, and not by a general, as  would have been natural in the old days of the Soviet Union.    "We have thoroughly studied the lessons that NATO has  learned  and we are embracing the positive elements. However, unlike  NATO we have no combat-ready troops under our command. We only  have a coordinating role, we do not control armed forces, and  unlike NATO we are not talking about expanding our area of  responsibility," said General Ivashov, who did not shy away from  commenting on new Russian comet and extremist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy's geopolitical ambitions.    With a twinkle in their eyes Ivashov and his colleagues  said that at times you could be tempted to think that the West  itself has invented Zhirinovskiy to frighten its citizens with  the danger of fascism in Russia and to use Zhirinovskiy as a  legitimate argument for expanding the NATO's area of  responsibility for security policy eastward.    "Zhirinovskiy's success in the elections is not linked to  his  geopolitical plans. He simply promised every single social  group something concrete. And people believed this in the light  of the difficult economic situation. He will have problems at  the next elections when he will have to explain to the  population why their lives have not gotten better as he  promised," said General Ivashov, who asked his amanuensis to  accompany me as I left through the empty marble halls.    Out in the quiet park the February cold bites into your  face.  The fir trees are covered with snow. In the middle of the park  a bird sits on the 3-foot snow drifts -- motionless despite the  intense cold.    What sort of bird is it that has landed here in the CIS  staff's park?    It looks like a raven.    It is at least neither a hawk nor a dove. Those sorts of  birds are no longer suitable for describing what is happening in  the field of defense policy in the former Soviet Union.</p>

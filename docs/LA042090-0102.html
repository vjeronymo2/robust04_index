			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISSIDENT CHURCH LEADER PREACHES IN L.A.;  </P> <P> RELIGION: EX-PRIEST SEEKS TO EXPAND INDEPENDENT AFRICAN-AMERICAN CATHOLIC  CONGREGATION.  </P> <P> Former Roman Catholic priest George A. Stallings, who created a furor last  summer when he founded an independent African-American Catholic congregation in  Washington, brought his fiery revival-style preaching to Los Angeles this week  during well-received appearances in two black Protestant churches.  </P> <P> On Thursday night at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church on Harvard  Boulevard, Stallings repeatedly brought a crowd of 800 to its feet, cheering  and clapping, as he shouted out a challenge for them to develop faith "that can  move mountains."  </P> <P> As he danced about the stage behind the pulpit, a choir of 100 swayed to the  rhythm of drums and an electric organ, belting out gospel hymns.  </P> <P> Stallings, who is seeking to expand branches of his Imani Temple to other major  U.S. cities, announced that he will be consecrated a bishop next month by an  archbishop of an "Old Catholic" order that traces its lineage to Utrecht,  Holland, during the 1870s.  </P> <P> In February, a spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington said  Stallings had "excommunicated himself" by establishing the 1,400-member Imani  Temple in defiance of Washington Cardinal James Hickey and by publicly  disagreeing with a number of church teachings, including its ban on ordaining  women.  </P> <P> Old Catholic Archbishop Richard Bridges of Highland said in an interview at  Faith United Methodist Church -- where Stallings spoke to about 150 people  Wednesday night -- that he would consecrate Stallings during ceremonies in  Washington on May 12. The Old Catholic Church represents about 2,000 parishes  scattered throughout the United States, Bridges said.  </P> <P> The Old Catholic movement dates to a dispute among Dutch Catholics who reacted  against the declaration of papal infallibility made at the First Vatican  Council of 1869-70.  </P> <P> The Old Catholics have retained most Roman Catholic doctrines but rejected  ecclesiastical unity under the Pope, Bridges said.  </P> <P> Father Gregory Coiro, a spokesman for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los  Angeles, said that although the Roman Catholic Church recognizes Old Catholic  (Utrecht) ordinations as being in the historic line of succession originating  with the Apostle Peter, it considers the actions of Old Catholic clergy  illegal.  </P> <P> "They lack the apostolic mandate which can come only from the Pope," Coiro  explained.  </P> <P> Stallings' ecclesiastical status seemed unimportant to the congregants who  responded to the Bible-quoting preacher by clapping, raising their arms and  shouting encouragements.  </P> <P> Alternating between humor and good-natured scolding, Stallings told the United  Methodist gathering that "too many church folk are sitting on the premises  rather than standing on the promises" of God.  </P> <P> "We need to give our people a sense of ownership and empowerment," Stallings  said later, "so they can worship in their own way. Churches thriving in the  black community are those where they hear the Gospel in a tangible cultural and  ethnic context."  </P> <P> Methodist seminarian Jeff Sanders of the School of Theology at Claremont said  Stallings' preaching was "very similar to (that of) successful black preachers,  regardless of denomination. It's the identity question, the cultural black  tradition. . . . Successful black churches are reclaiming their roots."  </P> <P> Earlier during his current preaching circuit, Stallings spoke to a crowd of  1,100 packed into a rented hall in Philadelphia. He is scheduled to speak in  churches in Oakland and Tacoma, Wash., before returning home next week.  </P> <P> Eventually, he said, he hopes to establish a branch of his African-American  Catholic Church in Los Angeles. He has two congregations in the Washington area  and one in Norfolk, Va.  </P></p>

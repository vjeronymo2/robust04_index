			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Major's public-service brainchild fails test: A white paper on the progress of the Citizen's Charter is published this week. There may be little to report . . . The prime minister's Citizen's Charter, three years old next week, has failed to achieve central objectives in many of the public services it is intended to improve, scrutiny of the various charters show. On Wednesday the Cabinet Office will publish a white paper setting out the progress made in meeting the goals of the charter. When Mr John Major launched the charter he promised it would force public services to tell customers 'where they stand and what service they have the right to expect'. There would be 'financial sanctions' if the services failed to come up with the goods. But an audit by the FT of the 15 charters for public services in England shows that many specify no standards at all, or standards that are so vague they leave the customers in the dark. With most services there is no financial compensation when things go wrong. And few charters are independently audited, or overseen by an independent adjudicator who can deal with complaints. In addition to the 15 charters for England, government bodies such as British Rail, the Social Security Benefits Agency and the Inland Revenue have produced another 21 for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are also special charters for businesses, such as the Customs &amp; Excise Freight Charter for exporters in the road haulage industry. Mr William Waldegrave, minister in charge of the Citizen's Charter, said: 'Changes are happening where they matter most in services people use and rely on every day of their lives.' But five charters looked at by the FT promise better service without specific standards of performance. The Tenant's Charter says good councils will 'have answering machines to take messages when there is nobody in the office'. The Higher Education Charter promises that applications for student places will be 'handled efficiently and fairly'. Others limit themselves to promises about trying to see customers within a specified time of entering an office, replying to letters in 28 days and answering the telephone in less than 20 seconds. In some cases, the promise is in the form that 80 per cent of telephone calls will be answered within 20 seconds (Child Support Agency). Callers who take longer than this to get through can only assume that they are in the unlucky 20 per cent. Just six of the charters in the audit offer the financial compensation promised by Mr Major. In practice, the charter has reduced payments to customers from British Rail. Only four of the 15 charters have independent checks on whether they are meeting performance targets. For example, a National Consumer Council survey of 35 county courts in England and Wales found that in some cases almost 90 per cent of the courts were failing to reach even the simplest requirements of the courts charter. Only three of the organisations have independent bodies that will take up users' complaints. In most cases there are rights to appeal to the ombudsmen for central government, local authorities and the health service. But these have been in operation since long before the Citizen's Charter was launched and are not geared up to deal with large numbers of minor charter complaints. The original Citizen's Charter white paper published in 1991 said 'there should be a clear presumption that standards will be progressively improved as services become more efficient'. Fewer than half of the charters we looked at have been toughened up. Some have been revised more in style than in content. According to the NCC: 'Revision of the Patient's Charter gave no new rights to consumers.' The charter's promise to reduce maximum waiting times for certain operations from two years to 18 months has in some cases meant loner waiting times for other operations that used to have short waits. The NCC said: 'Now everybody seems to have a consistently longish wait.' When Mr Major launched the Citizen's Charter he said it was 'a testament to our belief in people's right to be informed'. The Department for Education plans to spend more than Pounds 2m on sending 20m copies of the Parent's Charter to every home. A summary of the Patient's Charter has also been delivered to all households in England. More than Pounds 14m has been spent on the publication and distribution of charters, according to the Office of Public Service and Science. In spite of this, many charters aren't getting the message across, according to a National Consumer Council survey. The council found that 35 per cent of those questioned did not remember hearing about the Patient's Charter. Only 24 per cent remembered ever having seen a copy. More than 90 per cent of respondents to a survey on the Courts Charter had not been given information about court facilities and 88 per cent had not been sent details of how to get to the court and 77 per cent had not been informed of a complaints procedure. Most charter agencies now have helplines. Some are genuinely helpful - the Patient's Charter has a comprehensive remit for answering questions. But even with helplines, there appears to be trouble getting the message across. When we telephoned the Customs &amp; Excise helpline for the Traveller's Charter, the staff said 'Quite honestly, you are one of the first people to call.'  --------------------------------------------------------------------       SELLING THE CITIZEN SHORT: AUDIT OF ENGLISH CHARTERS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- CHARTER                  BENEFITS      CHILD SUPPORT   CONTRIBUTOR'S  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Organisation          Social Security      CSA        Social Security covered               Benefits Agency                 Contributions  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Copies                    1/4m          All clients         1.3m distributed  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Is there cash             Yes               No               Yes redress?  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Amount                 Pounds 4m             -         Pounds 76,000 paid out  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Specific                  Yes              Yes               Yes performance targets?  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Have its standards        Yes               No                No been raised?  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Independently             Yes              Yes                No audited?  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Complaints                No                No                No independently adjudicated?  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Is there a             0800 666555      0345 133133        Regional helpline?

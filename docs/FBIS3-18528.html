			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini by </F> Federico Guiglia in Rome; date not given: "No Incongruous  Groups After the Elections" --first paragraph is IL GIORNALE  introduction]    [Text] Rome -- A "constituent government," certainly not.  The National Alliance leader Gianfranco Fini rejects the  proposition of an incongruous group to lead the country in  advance. In this interview with IL GIORNALE, Fini again  proposes presidentialism as the unifying theme of the  antiprogressive alignment and gives [Northern League leader]  Bossi a taste of his own medicine.    [Guiglia] The League leader continues to call you "a  Fascist." Were you not allies?    [Fini] If I were Bossi, I would have to reproach him for his  communist past which emerges each time he is in difficulty.  Unless this explains the favor done to [Democratic Party of the  Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto each time that Bossi attacks the  forces in the antiprogressive alignment. He can continue  shouting. He will not succeed in dragging me down to his level.  The National Alliance differs from the League in two concepts:  national identity and solidarity, things that Bossi does not  attribute any importance to. So much the worse for him.    [Guiglia] Do you also consider Forza Italia as being a party  of "recycled people?"    [Fini] I consider [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi as being  a  businessman that has demonstrated great courage. He has the  undeniable virtue of never having drawn from the coffers of  state to balance the accounts. This explains why the Left  prefers someone like [Fiat manager] Agnelli who resorts to  state-subsidized layoffs. Forza Italia may have given  hospitality to some survivors of the regime in its lists. But  denying that it represents a positive novelty, once again means  playing the game of the PDS-monopolized front.    [Guiglia] According to some people in the south, the  Center-Right could also get some votes from the Mafia. What  precautions have you taken to avoid such a risk?    [Fini] For the time being we should begin by remembering  that  this is the thesis of Pino Arlacchi, who was much better as a  sociologist. Now he is a progressive candidate and must create  some ridiculous propaganda about the adversaries. The professor  seems to have suddenly forgotten that a high-ranking boss, such  as Madonia, has spoken of dangerous links between the PCI  [former Italian Communist Party] and work contracts. However,  he must at least remember that in all the south the right is  advancing precisely by setting itself against the criminal Mafia  gangs. We have certainly not changed our minds about the Mafia  and the Camorra [Neapolitan Mafia] by asking for sentences that  not only set an example, but also without reductions or benefits.    [Guiglia] Do you see a "political solution" to the kickback  scandal after the 27 March elections?    [Fini] Those wanting to wipe the slate clean would do well  to  vote for the National Alliance. Two things are needed in order  to turn over a new leaf on thefts by the regime: trials and the  restitution of the stolen money by those who have subtracted  trillions [of lire] from the country.    [Guiglia] Do you still have faith in [Judge] Di Pietro or  has  the time come to change your mind after two years of "Clean  Hands?"    [Fini] I have not changed my opinion. I trusted Di Pietro  before and I trust him now. I am not surprised that Bossi has  changed his mind after the misadventures that forced him to  present himself in court.    [Guiglia] According to [Pact for Italy leader] Segni, the  Center-Right cannot govern because it does not have a common  program. What is your answer to the Pact for Italy leader?    [Fini] Segni is nothing but a character looking for an  author. His transformation will not give Italy a government. I  am convinced that the voters will give a strong and clear  indication as to the majority in parliament. If this is not the  case, it would be better to return to the polls after having  modified the confused electoral law. The direct election of the  head of government will also be the ground upon which a new  government alliance will be created. There are no prospects for  the anomalous coalitions proposed by [Italian Popular Party  Veneto regional secretary] Bindi in the first legislature of the  Second Republic. Goodbye to the old coalition projects which  will not be missed.    [Guiglia] Goodbye to [President] Scalfaro as well?    [Fini] New parliament, new government, new rules of the  game:  Can an "old" president of the republic remain at the Quirinale  [president palace]?    [Guiglia] What are the odds on the "return" of [former  President] Cossiga?    [Fini] The former head of the government lost an opportunity  and I am sorry. He gives the impression of living in a  fully-submerged submarine when he should be putting up his  periscope.    [Guiglia] The MSI [Italian Social Movement] has 34  representatives: What is the threshold of success for the  National Alliance?    [Fini] I am aiming at 100 representatives, but I will be  happy with 70. Two years ago the Right was at 5.4 percent and  it seemed a miracle.    [Guiglia] Speaking of miracles: In order to achieve the  "Italian" miracle should debts be cut first or should we invest  in employment first?    [Fini] The two priorities are not alternatives, they are  complementary.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to Bank Superintendent Tesalio Cadenas,  the opening of banks in which the government has intervened and  payments to depositors scheduled for next week is still  uncertain, despite assertions by the finance minister. While the  FOGADE [Deposit Guarantee and Banking Protection Law] president  announced that payments to depositors in these banks will  commence next week and that the timetable for payments will be  disclosed this week, Cadenas indicated that the payments can be  made only if Congress approves the use of 250 billion bolivars  based on the Law of Public Credit.    Once again official spokespersons are contradicting each  other by not providing the same information to depositors,  thereby increasing uneasiness. Cadenas said the goal is for all  accounts to be paid equally, that is, not only savings accounts,  but also checking, time deposits, cash, and others. With regard  to the banks that the government has intervened in, he said that  these could not sustain the large withdrawals of capital by the  public resulting from a lack of trust. The people, he noted,  should not listen to rumors.    [Begin Cadenas recording] I hope the public will react  positively to this situation. I am making a sincere appeal to  people to use good sense and not to be led astray by rumors. If  the public is led astray by rumors, anything can happen. There  is no valid reason for [word indistinct] bank can do that. There  is no reason for this, unless the public loses trust. If the  public starts to make massive withdrawals, it would be  impossible...that is, there is no institution that can support  this, as Paul Volcker, former chairman of the U.S. Federal  Reserve, said. [end recording]    With regard to the differences between the banks and the  associations to which they belong, such as the Banking  Association and the Banking Board, Cadenas emphasized that this  is not encouraging, given the nation's current situation.    Meanwhile, contrary to the decision by the Banking  Superintendency and FOGADE, the national government has decided  to guarantee that these banks will open their doors on Monday to  pay savings accounts up to 4 million bolivars. This was stated  by Guillermo Alvarez, Central Information Office [OCI] minister,  when reporting on issues discussed at the ministerial cabinet  meeting held this Thursday at the Miraflores Palace. Alvarez  explained that the depositors will be protected; however, he  said that the fact that an answer has been given to the  depositors does not mean that the Venezuelan justice system and  the government itself, through the corresponding mechanisms,  cannot act at a given time, in an attempt to guarantee the  assets that were wrongly managed. The OCI chief said that there  are legal mechanisms to take action in this regard, although he  did not specify whether the state is willing to sue the bankers  that illegally used the resources provided by FOGADE in order to  rescue the lost funds.    [Begin Alvarez recording ] FOGADE has guaranteed a large  proportion of bank assets. I cannot say right now what the  proportion is; I cannot give you the exact percentage.  Nevertheless, the proportion is large, because those banks have  [word indistinct] properties and they have securities,  negotiable documents that can guarantee a substantial part of  the monies fraudulently managed. This money has not been donated  by FOGADE; this money was granted as a loan for a specific  period, as a guarantee to the depositors, as we have mentioned.  [end recording]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Taba, 16 Feb (MENA)--Radwan Abu-'Ayyash, the  head of the Palestinian radio and television authority, has said  that Palestinian television faces three main obstacles while it  is being established.    He told MENA that the first problem concerns the scope,  power, and frequencies of transmission. A solution is left to  the current negotiations in Taba, he said, hoping that positive  results will be achieved in the talks.    The second problem, Abu-'Ayyash said, is securing the  finance  needed to put studies into practice.    He said the third problem is the financing of educational  and  other films and programs with which the television is scheduled  to begin its transmission. [passage omitted]    Abu-'Ayyash said that many studios are being set up in the  occupied territories. The Germans have begun building a radio  studio for training, France will provide a television studio  with a grant, and Britain will do the same, he said.    These donations, he explained, constitute what we call "the  basis of Palestinian radio and television."    The Palestinian official said that many issues relating to  radio and television transmission are being discussed in Taba  within the work of the Civilian Affairs Committee.    Abu-'Ayyash said Israel understands the pressing need for  Palestinian television. The translation of this understanding  into something tangible is being discussed, he said.    On the budget of the Palestinian radio and television  authority, Abu-'Ayyash said he conducted studies on establishing  a modern television. The proposed budget, he said, ranges from  $30-50 million.    He said donations from the European Union amounted to $6  million.    He said he will make a Gulf tour after Ramadan to continue  discussing donations with some Gulf states like Qatar and others.    Asked if radio and television transmission will be confined  to Gaza and Jericho or will extend to all occupied Palestinian  territories, Abu-'Ayyash said: When we discuss communications,  we speak about the Palestinian people and Palestinians  everywhere. Communications are not confined to Gaza and Jericho;  we want to spread out throughout Palestine first, the world  second. This is the aim of communications.</p>

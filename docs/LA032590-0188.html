			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT HOWLS FROM OTHER HOLLYWOOD, OURS DROPS ITS CLAIM ON THE NAME  </P> <P> The battle over the right to market the word Hollywood appears to have ended.  </P> <P> Facing opposition from Hollywood, Fla., the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has  agreed to drop its bid with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to get  exclusive use of the name on T-shirts, coffee mugs and other commercial items.  </P> <P> As part of a settlement, Hollywood, Fla., officials, who have long opposed the  California chamber's application, have agreed not to oppose any future  exclusivity the chamber may seek for the name, as long as it is specific to  Hollywood, Calif., or Hollywood, the movie capital.  </P> <P> The compromise was announced last week by chamber officials here and city  officials in Hollywood, Fla.  </P> <P> "We're pleased, and I believe they are pleased, so I think you have to say it  was a good negotiation," said Larry Kaplan, the chamber's executive director.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, the five-member City Commission in Hollywood, Fla.,  approved the settlement last Wednesday, said Irving Rosenbaum, the city manager  there.  </P> <P> The chamber began trying to get trademark status for the name in 1986.  Officials had hoped to use revenue from the sale of souvenirs to touch up some  fading stars among the more than 1,800 in the Walk of Fame and to help finance  other projects.  </P> <P> But the idea met with a storm of protest in Hollywood, Fla., a city of 125,000  halfway between Miami and Ft. Lauderdale. Hollywood bills itself as "Dream City  Come True."  </P> <P> City officials there filed notices of opposition with the trademark office, and  the Florida city's Chamber of Commerce launched a public relations campaign  ridiculing what it described as an "arrogant attempt" by Californians to claim  the Hollywood name.  </P> <P> A so-called "Hollywood Summit" organized by the Florida chamber attracted  national attention last year. Representatives of 10 smaller Hollywoods from  Maryland to New Mexico joined in, railing against "greedy Tinseltown" and the  notion of the Hollywood, Calif., chamber wanting the Hollywood name all to  itself.  </P> <P> Merchants in Hollywood, Fla., argued that if the application for exclusive use  of the name were approved, it could severely restrict their ability to market  anything with the Hollywood name on it.  </P> <P> Kaplan called the compromise fair, saying it offered something for both sides.  </P> <P> "It means that if we want to license a T-shirt with the word Hollywood over a  movie camera, they aren't going to interfere with us," he said. "And if  somebody there wants to sell a T-shirt with Hollywood over a coconut, we won't  complain."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The National Assembly today voted to reject the  proposed structural changes to the Council of Ministers. The  deputies debated the proposed personnel changes to the cabinet  but did not take a vote. Prime Minister Lyuben Berov asked for  a vote of confidence in his government. The National Assembly  deputies will take the vote next Wednesday [25 May].    Zhan Videnov, BSP [Bulgarian Socialist Party] leader, told a  BTA correspondent that the BSP rejected President Zhelyu  Zhelev's proposal to meet to discuss the government's problems  because the party considers that the country has a cabinet.  According to Videnov, the BSP would support the vote of  confidence in the cabinet if Professor Berov keeps to his  earlier proposals for changes in the executive.    Meanwhile, the parliamentary groups of the BSP and its  coalition and the DPS [Movement for Rights and Freedoms] are  holding meetings in parliament to discuss the situation that has  developed.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Fed criticism brushed aside by Bentsen Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, said yesterday he would press on with plans to bring all responsibility for bank regulation under a single body, despite criticism from Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, writes Richard Waters in New York. Mr Greenspan had claimed that the plan, which would strip the Fed of direct involvement in bank regulation, would make it harder for the central bank to carry out its other functions. Mr Bentsen said: 'Bank regulation is not essential to the conduct of monetary policy.' He said the proposed new Federal Banking Commission would make all information available to the Fed, allowing it to do its job unhindered. 'We have carefully considered the Fed's arguments, but we find them unpersuasive,' he said.</p>

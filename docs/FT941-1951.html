			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Secure pensions The debate over minimum solvency requirements for British pension schemes may appear arcane, but it goes to the heart of the issue addressed by the Goode Committee on pension law reform. How do you protect the promise contained in the typical pension scheme trust deed to pay a given level of pension benefit? Setting aside money in advance from which to meet pension liabilities - in a word, funding - provides security for present and future pensioners in the event of the employer running into financial difficulty. The problem is to define how much to set aside and, more specifically, to establish a minimum solvency standard to ensure adequate protection. It is now clear that the government is likely to reject the Goode Committee's approach to calculating minimum solvency in favour of a watered down version developed by the actuarial profession. The case for compromise rests on the difficulties that could be faced by companies and funds that are obliged to establish a new base level of funding under the legislation that will follow Goode's recommendations. In present UK law, there are no solvency requirements; the assets and liabilities of most earnings related pension schemes are valued on an ongoing basis. This requires assumptions to be made about future benefits and about the current value of future income streams. In effect the actuaries ignore stock market values and take a longer term view. This has permitted the average fund to invest up to 80 per cent in equities, despite a presumed higher risk relative to the government's gilt-edged stock. Higher returns have thus been earned than on portfolios more heavily biased towards gilts. If, on the other hand, a fund is valued on the assumption that it is to be wound up immediately - the so-called discontinuance basis - there is no escape from applying stock market values in working out whether the scheme can meet past service liabilities. These are valued on the basis of calculating what it would cost to buy a deferred annuity from an insurance company. Until recently a valuation on an ongoing basis would usually produce a bigger surplus than on a discontinuance basis. But benefit improvements have eroded the margin. Meantime the gap between the returns expected on an equity portfolio compared with the gilt returns which dictate insurers' annuity rates has widened. So many schemes that are well funded on an ongoing basis may be under-funded on the discontinuance basis. The actuaries' proposed compromise involves valuing liabilities on a mixture of the two bases. Equity-type returns will be assumed in valuing the rights of younger members of a pension fund, while a shift will be made to a gilts-based valuation for older members and current pensioners. But this could lead to members receiving less than the accrued benefits promised to them on winding up. This is better than no solvency standard. But it looks a less than satisfactory outcome. Yet, as in the discussion over the ownership of pension fund surpluses, the bargaining chips are all in the hands of the employers. If the minimum solvency standard looks onerous, they will abandon defined benefit schemes and opt for defined contributions. That implies greater uncertainty about the value of pension benefits. And since funds would be obliged to adopt lower risk investment strategies, investment returns would be less in the aggregate. But there would be no contribution holidays and far more transparency. As always in pensions, it boils down to a search for the least bad alternative.</p>

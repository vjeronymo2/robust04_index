			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / International Company News: Income increases 12.8% at AT&amp;T AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Telegraph, the US telecommunications and computer group, yesterday unveiled a 12.8 per cent increase in first-quarter income, excluding changes in accounting methods which led to a net loss of Dollars 5.6bn. Mr Robert Allen, chairman, said that, excluding the accounting changes, the results augured well for the rest of the year. Mr Alex Mandl, chief financial officer, said the group's target of at least 10 per cent annual growth in earnings was on a 'sound footing'. The company reported net income of Dollars 996m, or 74 cents a share, compared with Dollars 883m, or 67 cents, in the same period of last year. This became a net loss of Dollars 5.6bn, or Dollars 4.19, after a Dollars 7.02bn charge for changes in accounting for retiree health benefits and a Dollars 383m gain for changes in tax accounting methods. All US companies are implementing these changes and AT&amp;T's charge, which does not affect cash-flow, had already been announced. Revenues rose 2.2 per cent to Dollars 15.72bn, 'driven by growth in financial and long-distance services and sales of network communications products and micro-electronic components'. In the long-distance telecommunications market, AT&amp;T's first-quarter calling volume rose 5 per cent, year-on-year, while revenues rose Dollars 94m, or 1 per cent. Long-distance margins rose to 37 per cent, up 2 percentage points from a year ago. Equipment sales rose 2.9 per cent, helped by increased in network communications products and microelectronic components. Revenues from communications products and systems, which include business phone systems and consumer products, were roughly the same as a year ago. However, NCR, the computer company acquired by AT&amp;T nearly two years ago, saw revenues drop to Dollars 1.48bn from Dollars 1.53bn a year ago, which the company blamed on weak demand in Europe and Asia/Pacific and general industry softness. The subsidiary had an operating loss of Dollars 20m, after a Dollars 50m restructuring charge, against a Dollars 46m profit. Mr Mandl said the charge was designed to reduce NCR's cost structure in the US and Europe, and this action, with an improving order book, suggested the 1993 results would be better than last year. Group operating expenses in the quarter rose 3.3 per cent, or Dollars 146m, mainly because of higher spending on advertising and sales support in the long-distance market, where AT&amp;T faces a marketing war.</p>

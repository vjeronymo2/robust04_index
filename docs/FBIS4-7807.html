			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "The Hungarian Gallup Institute on </F> Party Preferences in the Middle of March -- The MSZP Is Leading,  the MDF's Support Has Decreased"]    [Text] Between 11 and 16 March 1994, the Hungarian Gallup  Institute carried out a public opinion survey on the adult  population's party sympathies using a sample of 2,500. The  margin of error linked to the size of the sample is plus or  minus 2 percent. The survey establishes that the proportion of  people voting for the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has  continued to increase among those who selected a party. The  Independent Smallholders Party [FKGP] and the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] are coming increasingly closer  to the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], which has lost further  "votes." The MDF leads the list of unpopular parties, with a  third of people who have an opinion saying that they would by no  means vote for this party. The MDF is followed by the FKGP and  the MSZP. Two-fifths of people who tried to predict the final  result of the elections think that the MSZP will receive the  most votes at the May parliamentary elections. Significantly  fewer people give a winning chance to the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] or the MDF, which follow the MSZP.    In the middle of March 1994, 24 percent of the population  did  not know which party they would vote for "if elections were held  next Sunday in Hungary"; a tenth said that they would not vote,  and 6 percent refused to answer this question. The uncertain  people who do not (yet) know whom they would vote for are more  common among women (28 percent) than among men (20 percent), and  more among the over-60's (31 percent) and people with the least  education (39 percent) than younger people (22 percent) and  people who have at least completed eight years at school.  Within this last group, the differences between the various  educational levels are negligible because 23 percent of people  with eight years of education and 20 percent of people with  higher education do not know who to vote for.    Some 61 percent of the population has party preferences.    Some 31 percent of people who chose a party would vote for  the MSZP, 4 percent more than in the previous month. The  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] and the SZDSZ are in  second and third places with near equal support (15 and 14  percent). Since the end of February, the MDF has lost 3  percent, and at the time of the survey, it has the confidence of  10 percent of potential voters. The biggest governing party is  closely followed by the FKGP (9 percent) and the KDNP (8  percent), and 12 percent would vote for other parties. Of these  last ones, none would reach the necessary minimum to get into  Parliament.    Gallup measures the certainty of participating in the voting  on a scale of seven. In the middle of March, 52 percent of  respondents said that "it is very certain that they would vote  next Sunday." However, within these "certain" voters, 18 percent  do not yet know which party to support. Out of those who do  know, 35 percent would choose the Socialists and 15 percent the  Free Democrats. The Fidesz and the MDF would be supported at  almost the same level (12 and 11 percent respectively). The  Smallholders would receive 8 percent, the Christian Democrats 7  percent, and other parties 12 percent. If we examine the  sympathizers of the various parties according to what proportion  of them are "very certain" in participating in the elections, we  have the following result: The MSZP's and the SZDSZ's potential  voters are most determined about their intention to participate.  Seventy-three percent of the former and 71 percent of the  latter are very certain that they would vote. The MDF follows  this line with 67 percent, then the FKGP (60 percent) and the  KDNP (60 percent) with almost the same percentage. Half (49  percent) of the Fidesz's voters are determined that they would  go to vote "next Sunday."    The potential voters of the various parties also differ in  how certain they are that they would vote for the currently  preferred party "in the first round of the May parliamentary  elections." Almost half (47 percent) of all people who selected  a party are "very certain" about this: They would vote for the  party they now sympathize with. A third (34 percent) of them  are slightly less certain, they are "only" certain about this,  and a fifth (18 percent) are "uncertain." Socialist  sympathizers are most determined; 60 percent of the party's  current supporters are "very certain" that their opinion will  not change before the elections. Half of the Smallholder (51  percent) and Hungarian Democratic (48 percent) voters are also  determined, and 42 percent of the KDNP's and SZDSZ's voters each  are very certain on this issue. Of the parliamentary parties,  the Fidesz again is the last: A third (32 percent) of their  current supporters are very certain that they would vote for  this party, but almost as many (27 percent) are rather uncertain.    The survey also included the examination of secondary party  preferences. People who chose a party were also asked "if,  apart from this, is there another party that you would be happy  to vote for?" and 29 percent of those questioned said that there  is no such part and 7 percent said that they did not know. Out  of those who named a party, the Fidesz was mentioned most  frequently (22 percent), followed by the SZDSZ (18 percent).  The rest were as follows: MSZP 13, KDNP 10, MDF 8, and FKGP 7  percent. A fifth (22 percent) of those who replied mentioned  other parties, most of them the Entrepreneurs' Party (5  percent), the Republic Party (3 percent), and the Workers' Party  (2 percent).    The individual candidates of the various parties cannot  expect the same level of support as their parties. Naturally,  in the case of all parties, the majority of people would  "certainly" vote for the individual candidate of the preferred  party, but the deviations are noteworthy. At least seven-tenths  of the Socialist, Free Democrat, and Smallholder voters are  certain (75, 72, and 70 percent) that they would vote for their  party's list as well as its individual candidates. In the case  of the MDF and the KDNP, 65 and 63 percent of people hold this  view. Again, the Fidesz is the last, 59 percent of its  potential voters would also vote for the party's individual  candidates.    Examining antagonistic feelings to parties, Gallup asked  people if "there is a party that they would definitely not vote  for." Two-thirds (65 percent) of those surveyed selected a  party from the list of 15 parties. The MDF was mentioned most  often (33 percent), followed by the FKGP (21 percent). For a  tenth (12 percent) of those who selected a party, the MSZP is  out of the question, and almost as many reject the Workers'  Party (9 percent) and the Hungarian Justice and Life Party  [MIEP] (9 percent). Five percent would definitely not vote for  the Fidesz, and 3 percent each for the SZDSZ and the KDNP. Half  (52 percent) of the people who do not have a party preference  also said "I do not know" to this question. Of the other half,  the order of parties disliked is the same as above: MDF 28,  FKGP 25, MSZP 14, MIEP 9, and Workers' Party 8 percent.    Some 41 percent of respondents did not venture to predict  the  final outcome -- which party will receive the most votes -- of  the elections. The vast majority of those who made a prediction  named the MSZP (40 percent). Twenty-two percent predicted  victory for the SZDSZ, and 17 percent for the MDF. The Fidesz  is expected by 9 percent as winner, the FKGP by 6 percent, and  the KDNP by 3 percent. This result is somewhat different when  the question applies to "your electoral district." In this  case, half (50 percent) the population would not make a  prediction. Out of those who did, 31 percent selected the MSZP  as winner, 20 percent the SZDSZ, 14 percent the FKGP, and 12  percent the MDF. Some 8 percent expect the Fidesz and 7 percent  the KDNP to be winners in their electoral district.</p>

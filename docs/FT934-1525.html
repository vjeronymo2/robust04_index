			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Lilley avoids banana skins: James Blitz on the political skills of the social security secretary For once Mr Peter Lilley can say that he has had a good week. In recent months the social security secretary, one of the most Thatcherite members of the cabinet, must have felt that he was the butt of more criticism than any other minister. His ambitions to target social security benefits on those who most need them have drawn intense fire from Labour's front benches. Even some cabinet ministers have hinted that his plans are far too draconian. Yet this week he introduced two bills central to his objective to contain the growth of the Pounds 80bn social security budget. The two measures - raising employees' National Insurance contributions by 1 per cent and cutting the statutory sick-pay subsidy to employers - were countered by the Labour whips, who ended their 'pairing' arrangements with Tory MPs in protest at the speed with which the measures were being pushed through. Nevertheless both went through without a hitch. Sitting in his Whitehall office this week Mr Lilley looked like a man preparing for another march forward in the new year. He said in his quiet, slightly intense voice: 'Any one of the measures that we have recently announced would have been a major item at any time. 'We seem to have done much better than we could have expected in getting support for them.' Tory backbenchers say the bills have had a smooth passage because Mr Lilley understood an important lesson of politics. He leaked his plans on withdrawing the statutory sick-pay subsidy before they were announced in the Budget. But the going will get tougher from now on. In the spring Mr Lilley will introduce a bill to tighten up the rules for applicants for invalidity benefit, introducing an objective test that would replace the informal examination now made by GPs. He says the measure will be controversial. Some Tory backbenchers go further, fearing the legislation will do the unthinkable by taking benefits away from people who already have them. He must also tackle problems with the Child Support Agency, which has been attacked for zealously forcing separated fathers to pay maintenance when they cannot afford to. Mr Lilley is under pressure to reduce the burden on the absent fathers. But that, in turn, could force his already hard-pressed department to pay out more in benefits to lone mothers. So what of longer-term, neo-Thatcherite ambitions to curtail the welfare state? He is clear enough on the broad principles, especially on pensions. 'I would expect to see welfare provision rising,' he said. 'But the share which comes from individual pensions will have to increase more rapidly than the share which comes from the state.' But he is vague on specifics. He says that the legislation which emerges from his social security review 'cannot be pre-ordained'. Mr Lilley's discretion may have been learnt by example. As every Tory MP knows, the shadow of Lord Moore hangs over Mr Lilley. The resignation of his predecessor in 1988 was triggered partly by the embarrassing zeal with which Mr Moore tried to reform the benefits system. Cabinet colleagues urging caution will press Mr Lilley to temper his enthusiasm. As one Tory MP said: 'Caution must be his watchword.' A neo-Thatcherite social security secretary moves step by step - or not at all.</p>

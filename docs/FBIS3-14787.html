In a statement published on Sunday Dzoblayev said that the  State Duma's resolution on granting amnesty to participants in  last October's riots poses "an act of absolute disrespect for  the law, unprecedented in political practice."    According to him, as a result of it "the confrontation  between the various political forces and branches of power will  inevitably grow, and the consolidation of power institutions  which began to take shape when the new Constitution was adopted  will collapse".    As Dzoblayev said, Sergey Shakhray must share the  responsibility for this with the "communist obscurantists". "His  further being in charge of the ethnic policy department is  absurd," the statement says.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Elf Aquitaine sale to raise FFr35bn The privatisation of Elf Aquitaine, the oil company which is France's largest industrial group, will be launched today with the start of the pre-marketing period. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said yesterday: 'I have just started the largest privatisation ever to take place in France.' The sale of the majority of the state's 51 per cent stake is expected to raise more than FFr35bn (Pounds 4bn). Mr Alphandery said the privatisation issue would take place over the coming weeks, depending on market conditions, and by April 20 at the latest. From today, individual investors will be able to apply for shares in Elf. Of the 60m shares to be offered for sale, 33m will be reserved for individual investors and 27m allocated to institutional investors. A further 6.5m shares will be offered on preferential terms to employees and former employees. In the case of excess demand, which occurred in last autumn's privatisations of Banque Nationale de Paris and Rhone-Poulenc, the chemicals group, there will be a clawback option for individual investors of up to 20 per cent of the institutional tranche. The number of shares available for institutional investors may also be increased by up to 10 per cent by acquiring shares from Erap, the state holding company. The French government intends to retain, through Erap, about 13 per cent of Elf's shares. In addition, there will be a placement of shares with a group of long-term stable investors. This group - known as a noyau dur - will hold about 10 per cent of the equity and will protect the privatised group from predators and ensure management stability. Applications to participate in the group of core investors will close on Monday. Members are expected to include leading French industrial and financial groups such as Renault, Union des Assurances de Paris and the Suez group. Core investors could also include Groupe Bruxelles Lambert of Belgium and Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>

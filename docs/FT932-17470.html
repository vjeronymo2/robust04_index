			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / W German industrial output may fall 7%: Construction is only growing sector, says Ifo WEST GERMANY'S industrial production could decline by as much as 7 per cent this year, Ifo, the Munich-based economics institute, reported in a monthly survey of manufacturers, distributors and building companies. The report says that plans to reduce investment sharply and cut production were the principal causes for the expected decline. Producers sampled by Ifo said they would continue to reduce output, leaving utilisation of industrial capacity at 80.4 per cent by the end of the year compared with 85 per cent in the middle of 1992. The most pronounced fall will be in the motor industry, with output dropping by 'nearly 20 per cent'. Exports will continue to be negatively affected by the strong D-Mark and high production costs, the report says. Production of lorries and delivery vans could also sink, by 14 per cent this year compared with 6.5 per cent in 1992. Engineering products are set to fall by 8 per cent in 1993. The chemical sector is also expected to reduce production by 4 to 5 per cent this year, the report notes. The textile industry plans to decrease output by 8 per cent while the clothing industry is expected to fair relatively better than last year, with production falling by 5 per cent against 12 per cent in 1992. Only the construction industry will continue to record growth, the report says. But output for 1993 will grow only 1 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent last year. The report blamed the general economic decline for such lower results. In east Germany, the construction industry will continue to grow strongly, with output expected to increase by 20 per cent this year. Meanwhile, Mr Ulrich Cartellieri, board director of Deutsche Bank responsible for macro-economics, said yesterday that the 'solidarity pact' recently concluded for the east German economy was only the first step towards big structural changes in the German economy. He said the government should tackle three issues as a matter of great urgency: It should make 'substantial, rather than marginal' cuts in budget spending to release funds for investment in eastern Germany; It should take steps to privatise industry as a way of reducing the DM400bn (Pounds 169.4bn) debts inherited from the former East Germany. 'Reduction of these debts. . . is inconceivable without the mobilisation of public sector assets,' he said. It should take steps to eliminate the causes of excessive borrowing.

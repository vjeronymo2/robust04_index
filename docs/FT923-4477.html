			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Travelling without let or hindrance: The new technological rigours behind relaxed passport controls NEW technology and initiatives to ease border controls could make Her Britannic Majesty's demand - inscribed in every British passport - for passage 'without let or hindrance' a thing of the past. From one end of the European Community to another, frontier formalities are being lifted. Brussels is encouraging member states to allow unhindered travel without officials giving even a cursory glance at passports. Britain will not be so accommodating. The government last week reserved the right to scrutinise documents at British ports of entry, although it has pledged to relax controls on EC nationals. Community officials are trying to solve the British dilemma: how EC citizens can be identified without queues and delays at passport desks. Travel industry analysts say the problem offers Britain the opportunity to use new technology to ease immigration procedures not only for Community nationals but also for frequent visitors from countries such as the US and Japan. Mr Dan White, an analyst for County NatWest, said the Home Office should pursue a scheme pioneered at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport, where passengers can avoid queues by using 'smart cards' which can be read by computers. Dutch travellers who use the airport at least five times a year can opt for a card containing passport and fingerprint details. The software could be installed at any EC airport. BAA, the UK airports operator, is discussing the introduction of such systems with the Home Office but says it could be some time before 'smart cards' are available to British travellers. Immigration officials are also looking at a US scheme which is due to undergo tests at New York's JFK and Newark airports next month. It relies on biometric technology, which stores the 'hand geography' of frequent travellers. At US immigration passports of computer-registered passengers will be scanned, while a second system will read their palms to verify that the passport is not being used by another person. The new European Community passports will be compatible with this system. The scheme could cut waiting times at airports, but British officials believe it would be costly and difficult to introduce at sea ports. The Home Office is co-operating with a separate US initiative to ease congestion for airline passengers crossing the Atlantic. From next year all passengers from London's Heathrow or Gatwick airports to the US will pass through US immigration before leaving Britain. US Immigration and Naturalisation Service officials will 'admit' passengers to the US before they depart. The move is based on a scheme launched at Shannon in the Irish Republic in 1988 and follows extensive tests in the UK last year. The scheme has prompted calls for reciprocal arrangements in the US for travellers flying to Heathrow airport, where the arrival of several transatlantic flights between 7am and 9am can lead to delays at passport control. 'We'd like to see the same pre-inspection immigration in the US,' said Mr Joe Brancatelli, executive editor of Frequent Flier, the New York magazine. 'There are a lot of complaints about Heathrow,' he added. 'The lines can be impossible and Paris can also be nasty. We haven't seen advances that should have been in place five or six years ago. Only Frankfurt seems to be efficient.' In London, minimum standards introduced by the Home Office for passport control show that US passengers will continue to face longer delays than their EC counterparts. The targets suggest that non-EC passengers should wait no longer than 10 minutes at immigration while EC citizens can expect a three-minute wait. The Home Office said it would consider proposals to pre-inspect passports of UK-bound passengers in the US. But an airline would have to apply for such a scheme before formal negotiations could begin.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Mexican Crisis: Murder raises spectre of political instability - Death of presidential front-runner comes on heels of Chiapas uprising The assassination of Mr Luis Donaldo Colosio, the presidential candidate of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary party, is certain to have a traumatic impact on the country's political system. Mr Colosio is the first major Mexican politician to be assassinated in more than 50 years. Coming after the New Year peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the killing is set to heighten national instability, jeopardising the already fragile economic recovery. The replacement of Mr Colosio by another candidate will not be easy. Mexico's constitution prevents any official who has held senior government office within six months of the election from running for office. Unless the opposition parties agree to change the constitution, the list of credible candidates is small. 'The situation is extremely worrying,' said Mr Sergio Aguayo, a political scientist at the Colegio de Mexico. 'The crisis has shown up the weakness of Mexican institutions.' The effect on this August's presidential election is hard to predict. A weak candidate or a financial crisis could enable the opposition to mount a serious electoral challenge, putting at risk the PRI's 65-year hold on power. But the party's domination is entrenched and its popularity is higher than in 1988, making a defeat unlikely. Mr Colosio, born in 1950 in the modest town of Magdalana de Kino, near the US border, was chosen by Mr Salinas as the ruling party's candidate last November. While not considered to be as articulate and forceful as other contenders, he had long been favourite for the nomination and he appeared to have the right mix of political and technocratic skills for the job. He had recently begun the difficult task of distancing himself from Mr Salinas, calling for a decentralisation of federal powers, reform of the legal system, and a more active industrial policy. He had also made public safety a central theme of his campaign. Two days ago his route to the presidency seemed secure after the charismatic Mr Manuel Camacho, the peace envoy to Chiapas, indicated he would not run for the presidency. Mr Camacho, a former foreign minister and mayor of Mexico City, had been passed over for the PRI's nomination in favour of Mr Colosio, but subsequently had hinted he might seek the presidential nomination of an opposition party. In the immediate aftermath of Mr Colosio's assassination, Mr Camacho appeared once again to be one of a handful of contenders in the ruling party for its presidential nomination. But last night he indicated he was sticking by his decision earlier this week to stay out of the presidential race. While Mr Camacho is by far the best known of the potential candidates, and the most experienced politically, he antagonised much of the party when he looked as if he was going to challenge Mr Colosio. Mr Salinas - who, it is assumed, will choose the new candidate as he chose Mr Colosio - may be happy to look for a less controversial candidate. Unless the law is changed to widen the field, possible candidates include Mr Ernesto Zedillo, former education minister and Mr Colosio's campaign manager, and Mr Fernando Ortiz Arana, president of the PRI. If the opposition agrees to change the law, Mr Pedro Aspe, finance minister, Mr Emilio Gamboa, transport minister, and Mr Emilio Lozoya, energy minister, might be considered. All have disadvantages. Mr Zedillo, a Yale University economist, is known for his political inexperience. Mr Aspe has been widely blamed for the economic recession and is not popular. Mr Gamboa and Mr Lozoya are junior ministers, with little experience in economic policy, and are politi cally unknown outside a small circle in Mexico City. Mr Zedillo is perhaps the narrow front-runner from this group. A former central bank official and budget minister, Mr Salinas could entrust him with economic policy. He is close to Mr Jose Cordoba, Mr Salinas's powerful chief of staff, and has learnt to work within the PRI. But Mr Zedillo has been widely criticised for his poor management of the Colosio campaign, and for political errors made when education minister. With the possibility of further political turmoil ahead, his nomination would involve risks. Mexico's accession to the North American Free Agreement and the creation of an independent central bank this year have reduced the president's room for manoeuvre in economic policy. But whoever is elected will still yield enormous power. The president dominates the executive branch, the judiciary, the Congress and has broad power to set government policy in almost all fields. The return of uncertainty over who will take office next year could not have come at a worse time for the governing party. Mexico's economy has been stagnant for the past year, posting negative growth for the last two quarters. The government has been trying to revive the economy before the August elections by increasing spending and lowering interest rates. Such a policy has already led to a substantial weakening of the peso against the dollar and recent outflows of foreign money. Mr Colosio's assassination and accompanying nervousness in financial markets may force the government to choose between further devaluation or higher interest rates that could choke economic recovery. The economic woes are accompanied by a highly volatile political mix. The uprising in Chiapas is proving harder to resolve than the government had hoped. It reached a provisional agreement with rebels last month, but landlords and rebel sympathisers have been caught in a bitter struggle over land and political power in the state. On Wednesday the Congress approved an historic political reform, which for the first time in 50 years would put the electoral institute, which judges the legitimacy of elections, in the hands of non-partisan citizens. However, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the presidential candidate of the leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary party, derided the reforms as insufficient. In theory the reforms will make it difficult for the PRI to revert to fraud to win the election. Apart from giving the non-partisan officials control over electoral tribunals, it makes the parties' access to the media more equal, puts tight limits on campaign spending, and establishes a prosecutor for electoral fraud. Mr Cardenas's dissent raises the prospect of post-election protests if he claims there has been fraud. 'Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is distancing himself from the reform because he does not trust the government,' said Mr Ricardo Pascoe, a close adviser. 'He will not give up his right to veto the elections if they are not fair.' The PRI's replacement for Mr Colosio will have to grapple with a potentially aggressive Mr Cardenas, the implementation of the political reforms, and at the same time reassure financial markets of his ability to run the economy for six years. It will not be an easy task.</p>

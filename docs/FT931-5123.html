			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Investors hope for move on PSBR EIGHTY per cent of fund managers expect the chancellor to announce in his March 16 Budget that purchases of gilts by banks and building societies will count towards financing of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, a survey for stockbrokers Smith New Court shows, Richard Gourlay writes. The survey suggests there could be short-term disappointment in the gilts market if there was no such move to underfunding, or relaxation of the so-called full funding rule. Sixteen per cent of the respondents did not expect a move to underfunding in the Gallup survey of 96 institutions which handle Pounds 618bn of funds. The investors are divided on what PSBR the chancellor is likely to forecast for the financial year beginning in April, with 17 per cent expecting a deficit of less than Pounds 40bn; 35 per cent Pounds 40bn to 45bn; 30 per cent Pounds 45bn to 50bn; and 10 per cent Pounds 50bn or more. On the equity side, the institutions demonstrated a growing preference for UK, and even more strongly, continental European equities. A small majority of investors turned sellers of the US market. The investors believed the retail prices index would be rising by 3.3 per cent by the end of this year and 4.1 per cent a year later. These figures are down from 3.5 per cent and 4.3 per cent in the February survey. Immediately after the UK left the exchange rate mechanism last September the survey showed investors expected end-1993 inflation of 4.0 per cent.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Personal View: How Workstart should work - Why the government's Workstart pilots do not capture his original vision Watch the government's employment policy over the coming weeks, for we are in danger of losing an opportunity to cut Britain's unemployment rate dramatically - perhaps by 50 per cent or more - without additional inflation or cost to the exchequer. The promise lies in the proposal to give the long-term unemployed the option of using their unemployment benefits to provide vouchers for employers who hire them. This is the gist of my benefit transfer programme, on which the government's Workstart initiative is based. We have much to gain from giving it a try. If employers were paid as much to provide work as people receive when they are out of work, a substantial number of jobs is bound to be created. If the amount spent on employment vouchers does not exceed what would have been spent on unemployment benefits, the programme will necessarily be costless to the government. And if the size of the voucher rises with the length of a person's unemployment spell, the long-term unemployed receive the greatest incentive to become productive. The Workstart pilot schemes, however, fall strangely short of this vision. They are available to just 1,000 people who have been unemployed for more than two to four years. To hire these people, employers are offered a subsidy amounting to Pounds 2,340 per year, which falls far short of the Pounds 8,000 that the average unemployed person costs the taxpayer. In comparison to what it saves in unemployment benefit, the government is not offering much. Beyond that, the pilots do not induce employers to retain employees once their subsidies have run out. The simplest way of doing this is to provide incentives for employers to spend the subsidies on training, so that recruited workers become sufficiently productive to remain employable after the subsidy period. The chance to promote training while reducing unemployment is a godsend. People who have completed the government's existing training programmes often fail to find jobs and, as a result, workers often have little incentive to participate in them. By contrast, employers which spend their job subsidies on training would invetiably have an incentive to provide jobs once the training is completed and to ensure that this training is appropriate to the jobs. And this training would cost the exchequer nothing. Why, then, are the Workstart pilots not designed to exploit these opportunities? The simple answer, it appears, is that policy makers are sceptical that this policy can really promote employment. Once the employment objective has been abandoned, all that remains is to spread the pain of unemployment more equally. In my judgment, this approach is misguided. It rests on two dangerous myths. The first is that Workstart could not create employment because, at the current level of demand, there is only a fixed number of jobs available, This overlooks the fact that, by reducing labour costs the subsidies lead employers to reduce prices, stimulating demand, and to use labour more intensively. The second is that Workstart's ability to create jobs would be destroyed by 'deadweight' (when the subsidies are spent on people who would have been employed anyway) and 'displacement' of existing employees by the unemployed. But deadweight can be minimised by concentrating the subsidies on the long-term unemployed, since these people have relatively little chance of finding jobs. Displacement need not be a big obstacle either. When it is discouraged - by giving employers bigger subsidies when they can demonstrate that the new recruits are additions to their workforce - the subsidies create new jobs directly. And when displacement is permitted, it can create jobs indirectly by reducing job security of existing employees. Once these myths are exposed, we can see the crucial issue that policymakers should be addressing: how to make the Workstart subsidies maximally effective in promoting employment and training. The more jobs are created, the less the government will have to spend on unemployment benefits; then it can afford to pay more generous employment subsidies, so that even more jobs will be created. But this is precisely where the Workstart pilots will leave us in the dark. The Workstart pilots need to regain the vision that inspired them. With more than 10 per cent of the population unemployed, we have little time to waste. A programme that gives us the opportunity of slashing unemployment in a voluntary, costless, non-inflationary way deserves to be adopted on a national scale without delay.

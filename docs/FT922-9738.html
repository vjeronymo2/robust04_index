			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Survey of Machine Tool Industry (8): The focus is on world markets - Cincinnati Milacron in the UK plans economies of scale THE OUTSIDE looks like an art deco palace. The inside is less decorative, more practical, subject to change as new production comes in and old production fades away. This is Cincinnati Milacron on the north-east side of Birmingham, the first overseas plant the US group set up in 1934. With a turnover of about Pounds 30m a year, it contributes some seven per cent of group turnover. Although the parent returned to profit in the 1991 final quarter, it recorded an annual net loss of Dollars 100.2m. The British part of the operation had its problems too. Its largest market is, in fact, the US and 80 per cent of its production is exported, so it cannot remain immune to international economic sluggishness. Mr John Bloxham, managing director in the UK, is encouraged by what he called 'decent signs' in the US market. 'We're expecting recovery later this year. We are on budget.' What is certain is that the Birmingham company cannot, and has not, relied on the UK market: the level of manufacturing investment is too low, especially compared with competitors like Germany and Japan. Since the recession started, Cincinnati Milacron has reduced its Birmingham workforce from 500 to 400. This is partly the result of lower orders, but it is also a result of the rationalisation of production. In this last respect, the UK plant is deeply involved in a re-alignment of how the group as a whole conducts its machine tool business - 'we are trying to design world products and maximise economies of scale,' says Mr Bloxham. This has taken Cincinnati Milacron into the marvellous world of 'focus factories' and 'wolfpacks' - the jargon for factories which are dedicated to a single product or series of products, designed, engineered, produced and financed by a multi-disciplinary team of executives. The background to this approach is the acceptance in the group of a number of fundamental factors: First, to obtain economies of scale, a product has to be developed with reference not to regional markets, as was the case until the late 1980s, but to the world market. Second, because the product cycle has changed from roughly 20 years to more like three or five, it is necessary to bring products to the market at greater speed. The traditional and leisurely sequential programme of market research-engineering prototype-production is not a recipe for profit. Third, the way machine tools are operated has changed. The tendency now is to run them for 24 hours a day, not just one shift. So, while this makes their life shorter, it also puts a premium on greater reliability, speedier installation, low service requirements and short warranties. The Cincinnati Milacron technique for dealing with these factors is team engineering - 'what we try to do is to define an opportunity in a given marketplace,' explains Mr Bloxham. The opportunity becomes a project and for every project there is a special team. Suppliers could be involved - the metal fabricators, for example, especially when they have facilities Cincinnati Milacron itself does not have. Across the group there are 20 projects under way. To avoid duplication of effort and resources, the individual factories are providing, to a co-ordinator in the US, quarterly reviews of progress, including data on costs and margins. For its part, Birmingham is concentrating on the Sabre line of products - by the middle of this year the effect of Cincinnati Milacron's strategy will be that, in Birmingham, all products being made in 1988 will have been phased out and replaced by a concentration on Sabre - the brand name for a series of vertical and horizontal machining centres.</p>

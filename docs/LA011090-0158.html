			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CRITICISMS OF MEXICO ON TV'S 'DRUG WARS' UNFAIR, EMBASSY SAYS  </P> <P> Some statements critical of Mexico voiced in NBC News interviews done for the  television miniseries "Drug Wars" were unfair and possibly made in bad faith,  the Mexican government contended today.  </P> <P> The program, a dramatization based on the 1985 killing of U.S. Drug Enforcement  Administration agent Enrique Camarena, was broadcast Sunday through Tuesday  nights.  </P> <P> Each episode in the miniseries, produced by the network's entertainment  division, was followed by a 15-minute interview segment produced by NBC News.  </P> <P> The Mexican government, in a statement distributed at a news conference at its  embassy here, said "some assertions made by the interviewer, reporter and  guests are the product of sheer ignorance, imprecise, unfair, lacking of any  evidence, and, maybe, in bad faith."  </P> <P> Lloyd Siegel, executive producer for special broadcasts at NBC News, said the  network took pains to see that Mexico's point of view was represented and "we  do not accept the charge that there were any inaccuracies or inconsistencies"  in its reporting.  </P> <P> Javier Treveino, a spokesman for the embassy, said Mexico was invited to have a  representative interviewed on the program but declined.  </P> <P> Gustavo Gonzalez, legal adviser to the embassy, said Mexican officials were  apprehensive that any statements they made could be used by attorneys  representing the men charged with Camarena's murder.  </P> <P> The statement distributed at the news conference said the killings were "an  aggressive act by organized crime, and by no means imputable to the Mexican  government."  </P> <P> The statement said an assertion was made on the program that "Mexico is just  like Panama, and that drug corruption is deep and pervasive, and that almost in  every part of the country there is a local Noriega, a comandante, a general, a  governor getting rich by dealing with Colombian cartel drug bosses."  </P> <P> The statement said this assertion "is not only irresponsible and malign, but it  also deeply hurts the Mexican people and institutions that are courageously  fighting drugs every day."  </P></p>

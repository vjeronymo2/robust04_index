			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian gold plan still in doubt THE CONTINUING and long-running controversy over whether a small Australian mining company should be allowed to develop Russia's largest hard rock gold deposit appears far from over despite Australian claims to have done a deal. Mr Boris Yatskevich, deputy chairman of the State Geology Committee, said that the local Siberian producer in which the Australian company, Star Technology, has undertaken to buy a 31 per cent stake, did not hold a valid licence to the Sukhoi Log deposit. He said this was because Lenzoloto, the Russian producer, had failed to confirm an earlier licence to the deposit with his committee within a month of the appearance in July of new Russian legislation on licensing this summer. He also suggested, however, that this permission would not have been granted anyway because the deal harmed Russian interests. 'If you've got a fine diamond why give it to a middleman. I've been looking for a legal way to stop this deal and I have found it.' A lawyer for Star, however, cited a resolution by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister, ordering the Committee to ensure the right of succession for Lenzoloto, as a newly-formed joint-stock company, to the resources for which it held licences when it was still an ordinary state-owned enterprise. Mr Yatskevich said, however, that the resolution, issued in April, had been superseded by the licensing legislation that appeared afterwards. He said he believed that Mr Gaidar, who also happens to be under severe political pressure to support Russian industry, would 'follow the letter of the law and the interests of Russia' by putting the prized deposit to a tender reserved for Russian companies. If that failed to attract adequate backing for the project, major foreign mining companies such as the UK's RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, which had all expressed a interest in the project, would be invited to second tender. He expected Mr Gaidar to take a decision on the issue very shortly. Star and Lenzoloto have been saying that all they are waiting for now to close the deal is the declassification of information about the undeveloped mine - which like anything to do with gold in the former Soviet Union been a state secret. But the information has so far not materialised, and, according to Mr Yatskevich not just because of resistance by the Interior Ministry and the Economics Ministry to declassification - but because Russia had no taken a final decision on whether Star should have access to the information.</p>

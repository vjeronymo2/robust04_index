			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Unemployment side-effects of inflation convergence NO government would have found it easy to put an optimistic gloss on last week's UK unemployment and inflation figures. Unemployment has now risen by over a million since the recession began, yet both wage and underlying price inflation rates remain unsustainably high. The Conservative party's labour market reforms were supposed to make the labour market more 'flexible'. At the microeconomic level they have succeeded. Reducing the power of national trade unions, removing restrictions on the ability of employers to hire and fire and encouraging decentralised pay bargaining have increased the variation in wages by age, skill and region. Yet these changes do not seem to have reduced the unemployment cost that the economy must pay to cut aggregate wage and price inflation. The chart shows the average annual unemployment cost that OECD countries paid in the 1980s to reduce inflation to their lowest point: the steeper the line, the greater the sacrifice in terms of lost jobs needed to reduce inflation by 1 percentage point. The UK 'sacrifice ratio' implies that in the 1980s a 2 percentage point drop in inflation required unemployment to rise by 1 percentage point a year. This ratio is above average for OECD countries and much higher than in the US and Sweden. The government reforms do not seem to have cut the UK sacrifice ratio in this recession. Retail price inflation has fallen by 6 1/2 percentage points since its November 1990 peak while unemployment has risen by 3.3 percentage points on the OECD definition, leaving the sacrifice ratio unchanged. The fall in underlying inflation has been more modest. Wage inflation has fallen at an even more sluggish pace. Membership of the European exchange rate mechanism means that average earnings cannot grow faster than in the UK's main European competitors - perhaps 5 per cent or less a year - without further eroding the competitiveness of UK exports, unless manufacturing productivity also grows faster. But after six quarters of recession, the underlying annual rate of UK wage inflation is 7 1/4   per cent, a fall of just half a percentage point in six months. Unemployment will have to rise above 3m before the adjustment to the ERM is complete. In the 1980s, OECD calculations show that the annual rate of UK wage inflation fell by 0.3 percentage points for every 100,000 jobs lost. With the sacrifice ratio unchanged, reducing wage inflation from 10 per cent to 5 per cent will require a rise in total unemployment of 1 2/3  m compared to a little over one million so far. The longer this wage adjustment takes within the ERM, the more export competitiveness will be eroded and the harder the adjustment becomes as the latest OECD report on the Spanish economy indicates.  Average earnings in Spain rose by 9 per cent in 1991, despite an unemployment rate of 16 per cent, raising Spanish export prices and increasing the trade deifict. Why is reducing the going rate of wage increases in Spain and the UK so costly? One reason is the unco-ordinated and partially decentralised system of wage bargaining in both countries. Sweden has a highly centralised wage bargaining with powerful unions and employers which together set the going rate of wage increases. Sweden's sacrifice ratio is very low. The US has weak unions and almost no collective bargaining; its sacrifice ratio is similarly low. The UK labour market reforms of the last 12 years ago have left the UK, like Spain, in the middle: little employer co-ordination, relatively powerful plant level unions and a desynchronised wage round all make it hard for employers to reduce their wage settlements below the going rate. The rational solution is either more co-ordination, as Labour appears to be offering, or more union-bashing from the Tories.  Here is one area where a middle of the road compromise would be inferior.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Bihac by Mirza Sadikovic] </F>   [Text] Multibarrel rocket launchers, howitzers, tanks, and  mortars have been incessantly delivering fire and death  throughout the day. The outlying districts of Bihac and Cazin  are being systematically destroyed -- Gornje Prekounje [words  indistinct]. The extent of the damage is enormous. There is  also a high number of casualties. Over 2,000 destructive shells  have landed on the defenders' lines on the Grmusa-Grabez-[name  indistinct] plain. There is hardly a square meter that has not  been hit by at least one shell.    In addition to this the chetniks are continuously launching  combined infantry-artillery attacks on an area on the  Grmusa-Crnanjski plain along the Grmusa-Prpici-[name indistinct]  line.    This hell has been raging on throughout this evening. The  fighters of the 5th Corps have been putting up heroic resistance  as fierce battles continue. Provocations are also continuing  unabated along the demarcation lines with the paramilitary  formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous province. This  has been compounded by mortar fire, especially this afternoon.</p>

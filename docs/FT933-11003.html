			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / International Company News: Former head challenges Canadian jeweller revamp MR MARVIN Gerstein, a former chairman of Peoples Jewellers, has blocked the group's financial restructuring and challenged the court-appointed senior management to find a better survival plan. Peoples, Canada's biggest jewellery chain with 220 stores and 1,800 employees, went into bankruptcy protection last December after writing off its 47 per cent interest in Zale, the troubled US jewellery retailer. Peoples, together with the Swarovski group of Switzerland, had bought Zale for USDollars 650m in a 1986 leveraged buy-out. Later, Zale and Peoples were severely hit by the North American recession. The restructuring of Peoples, under Ontario court supervision, would have shrunk Mr Marvin Gerstein's 33 per cent equity stake and the 53 per cent held by Mr Irving Gerstein, the former president and Mr Marvin Gerstein's nephew, to 1.5 per cent. Over CDollars 200m (USDollars 156.2m) of debt would have been converted to equity. Mr Marvin Gerstein voted against the plan at a shareholders' meeting in Toronto on Thursday, so that it failed to win a required two-thirds majority. A court-appointed receiver, Peat Marwick Thorne, will now decide Peoples' future unless a last-minute buyer appears.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] China will develop its relations with other  countries on the basis of principles of peaceful coexistence.  Rong Yiren, vice president of the People's Republic of China,  said this during his meeting with the Tajik Supreme Soviet  delegation headed by Abdulmajid Dostiyev, first vice chairman of  the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan, which is currently visiting  China.    Rong Yiren expressed satisfaction at the development of  relations between the two countries following the establishment  of diplomatic relations. He said Tajikistan and China, as  developing countries, (?ought) to develop their national  economies and enhance the standards of living of their peoples.  We should develop relations and expand cooperation with other  countries. He said the Chinese economy is developing fast and  the standard of living is improving. However, despite this,  there is still a large gap between Chinese economic growth and  the standard of living, and the standard of living in developed  countries. [passage indistinct]    Dostiyev said the main objective of the Tajik parliamentary  delegation's visit to the PRC is to familiarize themselves with  Chinese experiences on social and economic reforms.    Informed sources said that the head of Tajik delegation  explained the situation in Tajikistan and the position of the  Tajik Government vis-a-vis the inter-Tajik talks that are  continuing in Tehran during his meetings with Chinese officials.    According to Chinese experts, military actions that are  taking place between the Tajik Government and the Tajik Islamic  opposition are causing serious concern in Beijing. It is  believed that the continuation of armed clashes there could  destabilize the situation along the Tajik-Chinese border.  Therefore, it is not a coincidence that Qiao Shi, chairman of  China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, during  his meeting with the Tajik delegation, said that China has an  interest in seeing the border between the two countries be  transformed into a border of peace, stability, friendship, and  cooperation.</p>

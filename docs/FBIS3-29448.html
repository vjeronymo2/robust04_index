			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Look For Other Ways To Reduce the Surplus"] </F>   [Text] With the breakdown of economic framework talks at  the recent Japan-U.S. summit talks, there has obviously been a  number of negative effects, such as the rapid appreciation of  the yen, and moves by the U.S. Government to impose sanctions  against Japan in automobiles and mobile phones.    Japan is at a loss as to what is the effective way to deal  with this new development. It is now important to face the  situation calmly, and try to look for even one or two concrete,  viable ways to straighten out Japan-U.S. economic relations  before the meeting of leaders of the advanced nations (Naples  Summit) in July.    There are two aspects to U.S. President Bill Clinton's  evaluation of the recent summit talks. First, he is  disappointed that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa was not able  to override the bureaucrats. On the other hand, he also pins his  hopes on further serious efforts by both leaders to deal with  the problem.    However, such hopes are not necessarily shared by officials  who work closely with the President. People around him,  including Congress, still work at cross purposes.    Regarding the appreciation of the yen, while the President  did talk about the "foreign exchange rate factor" at a news  conference, there is no conclusive evidence that the Clinton  administration is manipulating the exchange rate.    It remains to be seen whether the U.S. Government will now  engage in vigorous Japan bashing.    We would like to make three suggestions to Prime Minister  Hosokawa. It was right to say "no" to the U.S. demand for  numerical targets. All U.S. scholars who have received the  Nobel Prize for economics oppose numerical targets. However, we  need alternative proposals on what to do with the huge trade  surplus against the United States.    In this regard, Japanese and U.S. negotiators were stuck on  the issue of numerical targets at the framework talks. We need  to come up with a comprehensive plan, and present this to the  United States.    Second, something should be done to normalize relations  between the automobile industries in both countries.  Fortunately, Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor  Corporation, has been designated the next chairman of Keidanren  [Federation of Economic Organizations]. The prime minister  should support a private sector-led solution to restore the  balance between the Japanese and U.S. automobile industries.    This will probably take the form of mutual market  participation through horizontal division of labor. There  should be an unbiased way for both parties to make use of each  other's marketing networks. Reaching a compromise on automobiles  will enhance the sense of equality between Japan and the United  States, and contribute to the solution of a considerable part of  the trade imbalance issue.    Third, in the multimedia sector, where the United States  enjoys a significant edge, Japan should accept U.S. leadership.  It will be much cheaper for Japan to just adopt U.S.  technology. Then, Japan can devote time to improve on such  technology to develop original technology for Asia.    The point is, to work on the key issues of Japan-U.S.  friction from a broad perspective. If we merely come up with  trivial piecemeal measures, it will only serve to aggravate the  distrust between Japan and the United States.    The prime minister seems unable to attract talented  advisers.  Therefore, even if he is successful at coordination, there can  be no new creative ideas. He should look for people who can  come up with real ideas, and listen to their suggestions. While  the Ministry of International Trade and Industry is good at  discussing specific issues, recently, its ideas lack coherence.    In the financial sector, Japan should also establish  principles as soon as possible that will guarantee no  discrimination in investments in Japan. In the insurance sector  negotiations, the United States was distrustful of the Japanese  negotiators. Japan is partly to blame for this.    It is easy to criticize the United States; some say it acts  like a spoiled brat. However, this will only put Japan in a  difficult position.    Even regarding the issue of the exchange rate, the dollar is  strong against the European currencies. Japanese companies  cannot afford to raise the price of their products even with the  appreciation of the yen. Therefore, for the time being, a  strong yen will not affect prices in the United States. The  United States is taking advantage of Japan's weak point.    However, there is no need to worry too much about the strong  yen. The fact that there has been a reversal in the balance of  power between Japan and the United States means the exchange  rate will recover to a realistic level in due course.</p>

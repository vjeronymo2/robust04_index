			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / RHM helps Tomkins double profits Tomkins, the industrial group, nearly doubled interim pre-tax profits, from Pounds 47.1m to Pounds 93.8m, with the help of Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food group acquired for Pounds 990.5m in December 1992. Mr Greg Hutchings, chief executive, said the rise in profits was achieved in spite of difficult trading conditions, with few signs of recovery in Europe. At the operating level, RHM contributed profits of Pounds 38.5m to a total of Pounds 85.9m, with milling and baking making Pounds 7.1m of that. Concern over intense competition in the baking industry has led Tomkins' shares to underperform since the acquisition. Mr Hutchings was upbeat yesterday about prospects, but the shares fell 3p to 259p. Since acquiring RHM, 22 facilities had been closed and 2,860 redundancies made, cutting the workforce by 11 per cent. Tomkins used Pounds 12.3m of the Pounds 90.4m provisions set up at the time of acquisition in the six months to October 30. About Pounds 69m was left, which would be needed over the next 12 to 18 months. Spending on advertising had been increased by Pounds 8m to support brands such as Mr Kipling's cakes, Hovis bread and Sharwoods ethnic foods, which had been neglected by the old management. New products had been launched, such as sun-dried tomato bread for Marks and Spencer. Mr Hutchings said the bread market was no more competitive than, for example, the lawnmower market in the US. Mr Ian Duncan, finance director, said Tomkins' operating profits, excluding RHM, rose from Pounds 39m to Pounds 47.4m, with about Pounds 4m due to the fall in sterling against the dollar. The group had hedged dollar profits for the current year at Dollars 1.59 which compared with a rate of Dollars 1.76 for 1992-93. Profits from North America rose 71 per cent to Pounds 50.1m. Mr Hutchings said this demonstrated the group's operational gearing, where a rise in volume led to a sharper rise in profits. However, in some divisions margins fell as competition was still fierce. Mr Duncan said that, for instance, at Murray Ohio, the US lawnmowers and bicycles business, higher volumes had been gained at the expense of lower margins. He said the group's net cash had risen to Pounds 169.8m at the end of the half-year, up from Pounds 120.6m on May 1. But with interest rates low, cash was 'our worst performing asset'. Interest receivable fell from Pounds 6.3m to Pounds 4.6m. After tax, earnings per share rose 23.2 per cent to 5.53p fully diluted. The interim dividend goes up from 1.805p to 2.08p. Mr Hutchings said the group had increased interim earnings per share by three times the market average over the last 10 years and the dividend at 2 1/2 times the average. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paraguayan Foreign Minister Luis Ramirez Boettner  and his Bolivian counterpart Antonio Aranibar Quiroga yesterday  ratified seven cooperation agreements, among which are one  creating mechanisms for the recovery of stolen vehicles, and one  for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to Paraguay. The  documents were signed by the two foreign ministers during a  ceremony attended by Paraguayan President Juan Carlos Wasmosy  and Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada at Government  Palace.    The other cooperation agreements refer to the economy,  natural resources, the environment, health, the duty free  warehouse in Villeta, and tourism issues.    All these agreements were signed during the last visit  President Wasmosy made to Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia, some  months ago.  <H5>  Stolen Vehicles </H5>   According to the agreement on the recovery of stolen  vehicles, the two countries promise a smooth exchange of  information between their respective police forces regarding the  owners of the vehicles, the reports of theft to the police, and  details of the stolen vehicles.    The accord also establishes the need for a document  certifying that the vehicle has not been reported as stolen and  listing the highways and checkpoints which the vehicle is  authorized to use.    Other preventive measures mentioned in the agreement refer  to  constant patrolling, checking of vehicles, and the establishment  of consultation offices in both countries in their respective  police stations.  <H3>  Establishment of Grounds for the Construction of a Gas  Pipeline </H3>   The agreement for the supply of Bolivian natural gas to  Paraguay is partial, although of an "indefinite duration" and  for a volume yet to be determined.    The two countries have agreed to authorize the construction  and operation of a gas pipeline between the two countries, as  well as for the transportation of gas within their own  territories.    The purchase of gas will be made through operators who will  be in charge of the negotiations and of establishing the price,  deadlines, volume, and other pertinent details. Payments will  be made in dollars.  <H5>  Economic Cooperation </H5>   The economic cooperation agreement is basically designed to  step up economic and commercial relations through the  elimination of non-tariff barriers on bilateral trade, and to  promote the expansion and diversification of trade between the  two countries.  <H5>  Natural Resources </H5>   As for the agreement referring to natural resources and  environment, it provides for the exchange of technicians,  professors, and experts for the drafting of joint programs as  well as the exchange of information regarding methods and  techniques.  <H5>  Tourism Cooperation </H5>   The tourism cooperation agreement, among other issues,  provides for regional and subregional integration, the  coordination of promotion events, the consolidation of  integrated tourism circuits, the identification and  consolidation of a land and river corridor between the two  countries, as well as the promotion of integrated tourist  circuits in the international markets.  <H5>  Villeta Duty Free Warehouse </H5>   The two ministers also signed an agreement for the exchange  of reversal notes authorizing the rendering of services for  cargo in transit, for Bolivian cargo in transit and to the  Paraguayan market, and for Paraguayan cargo bound for Bolivia.  The Bolivian Government has offered the Paraguayan Government a  duty free warehouse and storage area in a site yet to be chosen,  under the same terms granted by Paraguay to Bolivia.  <H5>  Health </H5>   The cooperation agreement in this field is designed to  establish an exchange of knowledge and experience, to step up  the training of human resources, establish an information  service on the activities held on the border areas, and adopt  regular notification mechanisms on illnesses that must be  reported.</p>

			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODMAN ON BARNEY FRANK  </P> <P> Ellen Goodman's "Oil Slick Is Starting to Cover Barney and It Doesn't Scrub  Off," (Op-Ed Page, Sept. 21) doesn't wash. Comparing Massachusetts Democratic  Rep. Barney Frank to an innocent coastline smeared by a mean oil slick is  nonsense.  </P> <P> Barney Frank, who made a career out of moralistic preaching against ethical  misbehavior among the Republicans, is not an innocent bystander. He solicited  the troubled brew in which he now flounders.  </P> <P> Frank has done a disservice to his constituents, to his party, to the House of  Representatives, and to the cause of responsible government to which he claimed  to be loyal for so many years.  </P> <P> Rep. Frank will be remembered, not for the causes he served, but for the  foolish mistakes in his private life.  </P> <P> One can only hope that other men and women in public life will learn from his  misfortune.  </P> <P> SIDNEY BALDWIN  </P> <P> Cypress  </P></p>

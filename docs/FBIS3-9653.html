			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Democratic Forum Deputy Gyorgy </F> Csoti by correspondent Miklos Keleti; place and date not given;  from the "Foreign Political Observer" program -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Keleti] The MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum]  has government experience; it has played a determining role in  the shaping and implementation of foreign policy in the past  four years. If it finds itself in the same situation in the next  four years, in what areas can we expect continuity, adjustments,  or perhaps changes?    [Csoti] The electors can expect continuity, primarily in  foreign policy. We plan to continue the foreign policy that  bears the stamp of Jozsef Antall, adapted naturally to the given  circumstance -- because the world is changing in the meantime --  and eliminating the minor mistakes that we made during the four  years of government, because we naturally were not perfect.    However, there will be no change in the main line: The  basic,  determining factors in Hungarian foreign policy are to join the  process of European integration and the handling -- and solution  where possible -- of the vital issues of Hungarians beyond the  borders, naturally in coordination with the good relations to be  shaped with neighboring countries.    [Keleti] Let us look more closely at the individual areas,  including integration with Western Europe. We will soon  officially submit our accession application to the European  Union [EU]. We know that this in effect could be on the agenda  in around 1996 or 1997. What aims does the MDF have in this  area until then?    [Csoti] Many things must be done concerning the further  development of relations with the EU countries. Many things  must be done here in Hungary so that we catch up economically,  so that we adapt our legal system to the European norms. So  there is plenty to do. [passage omitted]    There are members of the [European] family, primarily  Mediterranean countries, whose economy is not much stronger than  ours. For this reason, we expect -- and we have received  promises to this effect from our West European partners -- that  our accession will be a political decision, that having achieved  the necessary minimum, accession will enable us to be part of  the system of European integration, and that by this they should  ensure us the possibility of further economic progress.    [Keleti] The other sphere that is being mentioned a lot  recently is our relationship, our military-security relations,  with NATO. The situation has become somewhat clearer with the  announcement of Partnership for Peace and with the signing of  the framework agreements on this. Nonetheless, what does the  MDF expect from NATO specifically, within this cooperation, and  according to the MDF program, in what specific areas must  Hungary take steps so that there is closer cooperation?    [Csoti] What we expect from NATO is that within the  Partnership for Peace program we -- and other countries in the  region that are ripe for this and wish to gain this status --  should have the genuine possibility to gain full membership. It  is very important to emphasize that the European security system  must always cooperate with Russia and Ukraine -- because this is  inconceivable contrary to them or without them. However, they  do not even wish to be full members, and it is inconceivable  that a considerable proportion of the countries in the eastern  half of the region will become members in the near future.    For this reason, what we expect is that within Partnership  for Peace, everyone in the trans-European [as heard] region  should be a [NATO] partner, a cooperation partner, and the  central European countries who have completed the essential  phases of transformation and who want it should be full members.    [Keleti] The next big foreign policy issue is the place and  role -- in diplomacy -- of the Hungarians [magyarsag] beyond the  borders. Let us begin with Vojvodina, since the situation there  is special because of the southern Slav conflict. It has been  raised recently that a conflict, a conflict of interests could  develop between our rapprochement to NATO and the protection of  the interests of the Hungarians there. What do we expect in the  future, and what does the MDF wish to do in order to avoid such  situations?    [Csoti] I do not think that this would mean a conflict.  Indeed, I say the opposite. For example, the fact that Hungary  -- together with some other central European countries -- might  at a given moment be a member of NATO and a few neighbors of  ours might not, would not endanger the given country and would  not (?give rise) to tension between the given neighboring  country and us, since it is important for the neighboring  country, in the present case Serbia, that there should be  stability and security in the region. The wider the area  embraced by NATO -- thereby strengthening NATO and stability in  the region -- the more it should be in interest of Serbia, if it  wants a peaceful and stable Europe, trusting that the war there  will come to an end as soon as possible, that the situation  there will be normalized, and that the other countries of the  region could take a similar path.    Therefore, I do not believe there is such a problem there,  nor do I believe there is any vis-a-vis Romania or other  countries. The theory -- which the Socialists represent and, I  do not wish to speak on their behalf but they say this everyday  -- that Hungary should enter NATO together with all of its  neighbors is not realistic. If Hungary, and let us say,  Slovakia, Austria, and Slovenia, as four potential, aspiring  countries were to be excluded [from NATO membership], this would  have a detrimental impact on us, on the region, and it would not  help at all. Indeed, to the contrary, by perhaps increasing  instability it would impair Romanian and Serbian interests as  well.    [Keleti] Concerning the question of autonomy: One often  feels that when this question is raised in Hungary and in the  neighboring states, let us say Romania or Slovakia, it is  approached on the basis of entirely different viewpoints,  entirely different ways of thinking. There, it is regarded as  provocation against the nation-state; we regard it -- autonomy  for the minorities -- as a natural application of European  thinking, European legal-political norms. [passage omitted] Is  there any chance of hoping for psychological bridge-building,  rapprochement? This is one factor among many.    [Csoti] It is definitely possible and necessary. I believe  that it is an indispensable condition for finding a solution.  These two neighboring countries [Romania and Slovakia] must  come to terms with the fact that the peoples, ethnic groups....  [brief break in reception] Right cannot be applied selectively.  An over 2-million-strong ethnic group or a 700,000-strong  ethnic group, nation -- because the expression co-nation could  also be applied to them in the given country -- is entitled to  the same rights as those of the majority nation.    Regarding the psychological factor: A historical  reconciliation would be necessary, where there was a  precondition that we should fully grasp one another's problems  and ways of thinking, that we should have empathy with one  another.    If the Slovaks and the Romanians try to grasp fully the  Hungarian situation, what Trianon meant for us, what the  traumas, the historical blows to this country during various  dictatorships meant, and that it has not been possible to  recover from these to this very day, then obviously there will  be a rapprochement between us.    However, we must also imagine ourselves, for example, in the  situation of the Slovaks, who did not have an independent state  for centuries -- that this as well is a bad situation, it  influences the current political forces and public opinion.  This is what we must grasp. If we jointly comprehend fully one  another's traumas we will be able to understand one another and  it will become clearer to us that we in this region are  interdependent. We should not work against one another but hand  in hand when building the future, the Europe of regions where  the borders will not have any significance, and where we can  prosper to one another's benefit and to our benefit.</p>

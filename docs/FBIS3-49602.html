Dlouhy said he and Wieshau  were discussing what was already a second draft of an agreement,  and that from here on a group of Czech and Bavarian experts  would work on the problem.    Wieshau said Bavaria fully supported the pipeline project,  but that the Czechs were the party with the primary interest in  it. Those who own the land over which the pipeline will run want  to know who will insure them against terrorist attacks, natural  disasters, or other "acts of God," and it cannot be Bavaria, he  said. He said a law on pipeline-landowner land rights had been  worked out in the Bavarian Parliament, but that it needed to be  passed by the October elections or "we will have to start from  square one."    Construction of the pipeline from the Bavarian town of  Ingolstadt to Nelahozeves u Kralup in central Bohemia began in  the Czech Republic in September. Construction of the pipeline  in Germany is expected to begin this spring. The entire project  should be completed in 1995, but Wieshau said this depends on  what happens in the parliament.</p>

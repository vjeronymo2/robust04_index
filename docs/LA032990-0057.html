			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OCEANSIDE TEEN TO STAND TRIAL IN WOUNDING OF 4-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> An 18-year-old Oceanside resident was ordered Wednesday to stand trial in  Superior Court on charges related to a drive-by shooting that wounded a  4-year-old girl on Christmas Eve.  </P> <P> During two days of testimony at a preliminary hearing, a witness said Floyd  Avery was among a small group of San Juan Capistrano teen-agers who passed  around a sawed-off shotgun before embarking on a hunt for rival gang members in  San Clemente.  </P> <P> Avery allegedly drove the car at the time of the shooting.  </P> <P> Avery is charged with attempted murder and assault with a deadly weapon.  </P> <P> Three other people have already been convicted in the shooting, which sent  4-year-old Prisca Caudillo to the hospital for four days with shotgun wounds in  her face and upper chest.  </P> <P> Authorities say all three are members of a San Juan Capistrano gang known as  the SJC Boys.  </P> <P> Fifteen-year-old Rafael Gutierrez, an admitted San Juan Capistrano gang member,  testified that Avery was with members of the SJC Boys when the shotgun was  passed around after a party.  </P> <P> After the shotgun was shown off, Avery jumped into his blue 1973 Datsun with  two other teen-agers and drove to San Clemente, Gutierrez said.  </P> <P> Police say that a short time later, the teen-agers made three attempts to shoot  rival gang members, with the girl wounded in the second attempt.  </P> <P> Prisca and her father, Rodrigo Caudillo, 25, appeared during the first day of  the preliminary hearing. The child fell asleep in a chair at the district  attorney's table during her father's testimony. FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Link with private sector welcomed MR Jeremy Beecham, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities, yesterday told members of the Tyne and Wear Chamber of Commerce that local authorities had come to see over the past decade that partnership with the private sector was fundamental to the wellbeing of their areas. He said that to fulfil their responsibilities to their areas, councils could not be indifferent to the needs of business, and business could not thrive against a background of decline and decay.</p>

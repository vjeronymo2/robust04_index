			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Europe needs more small enterprises Sir, Martin Wolf's excellent commentary on your EU Business Survey of European Competitiveness ('A relapse into Eurosclerosis', February 24) came down firmly for three core recommendations. These were to increase competition and deregulation, and diminish the burden of the public sector. In other words continue and intensify the political and economic philosophies of the 1980s. May I add a fourth as a basis for a policy more suited to needs of the 1990s. In general, attention on the performance of manufacturing industry fails to differentiate strongly enough between different types of company. Evidence accumulates daily showing that while many large companies and sectors dominated by large companies are shrinking, employment and growth are coming from the dynamic entrepreneurial SME sector. My own company, privately owned, turns over Pounds 50m a year; 90 per cent of its British made high-technology coding systems are exported. The EU needs more examples of similar enterprises. To encourage that to happen, strong industrial structural adjustments are needed across the EU. These should favour innovation and enterprise in the dynamic entrepreneurial sector. The need includes encouragement of innovative approaches from key service suppliers such as banks; improved linkages with academic R &amp; D; changes in the laws relating to personal guarantees and bankruptcy; guidelines of acceptable practice by the venture capital industry; and measures to promote partnership-supplier relationships with larger companies. But the key must be greater understanding and support for the dynamic entrepreneurial sector from all levels of economic management, the European Commission to national governments and their industrial policy agencies.

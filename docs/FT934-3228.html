			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading The December futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index powered ahead yesterday to approach 3,300 and widen its lead over the underlying equity market, writes Peter John. Derivatives rose rapidly after a Pounds 3bn gilts auction exceeded all expectations and marketmakers fought to cover exposed dealing positions. Institutions were desperate to buy stocks with yield potential, such as bank, insurance and utility issues. The marketmakers who sold them were unable to cover themselves in the equity market and sought solace through the futures. That buying pushed the premium to a high of 20 points against an estimated fair value which, on some valuations, is at a discount to the cash market. December hit a peak of 3,297 before closing at 3,291, and then strengthened further in after-hours' trading. Closing volume was high at 16,253 lots. However, traders were beginning to get nervous, seeing the sharp rise as a squeeze which could easily turn round and catch the market out. 'There could be a hell of an opportunity to make profits on the downside - it is just a question of timing,' said one. With only seven trading days until the expiry of the December contract, there is also growing concern over the very high level of open interest, the number of existing long and short positions. Open interest has to reach zero by expiry next Friday, and at the close of dealing yesterday it stood around 49,000. Traded options volume recovered to a healthy 41,535 lots, against 29,697 on Tuesday. Hanson topped the list of stock options at 2,467.</p>

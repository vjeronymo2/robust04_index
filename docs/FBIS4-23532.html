			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Lusaka by correspondent Alves Antonio] </F>   [Text] Good evening. The question of the swearing in of  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]  members of Parliament is still on the negotiating table,  although it has been under discussing for five days now. The  UNITA representative is still evasive, thus hindering the  debate. Today's morning and afternoon sessions lasted eight  hours, but as a whole it was a totally unproductive day.  Tomorrow, government and UNITA negotiators will return to the  Mulungushi Conference Center to try to find a solution.</p>

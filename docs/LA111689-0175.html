			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHURCH NOT COWED BY INCIDENTS OF VANDALISM;  </P> <P> MINISTER VOWS TO CONTINUE TRADITION OF HAVING CHAPEL OPEN FOR PRAYER,  MEDITATION  </P> <P> At lunchtime Wednesday, the free weekly organ concert began on time at the  venerable Immanuel Presbyterian Church on Wilshire Boulevard. And Immanuel's  Chichester Chapel remained one of Los Angeles' few houses of worship open daily  for public prayer and meditation.  </P> <P> It was business as usual despite the fact that vandals had hammered holes in  two of the chapel's stained glass windows late Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> Seated at the church's 400-pipe organ before a crowd ranging from architects in  stylish business suits to a homeless man in a Hawaiian shirt, organist Joy  Schappell launched into five sonatas and hymns.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in the vestibule outside, the Rev. Gary A. Wilburn asserted that  nothing will prevent Immanuel from continuing its weekly Wednesday noon  community concerts, its multitude of prayer services or the continued daily  opening of its Chichester Chapel where the vandalism took place.  </P> <P> "While we are shocked and disappointed by this incident," Wilburn said. "We  shall continue to keep the chapel open and renew our commitment to the  community to have this center for prayer, meditation and relaxation available  for all of the people.  </P> <P> "There is too much loneliness and alienation in the city. I want the church to  remain a refuge."  </P> <P> The vandalism occurred shortly before the chapel was to be locked for the  evening at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. Vandals tore two brass-plated candlesticks from  an altar and used them to smash three holes in two stained-glass windows. The  vandals also punched holes in another window and stole a six-foot pew cushion.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police, estimating the damage at more than $5,000, had no immediate  suspects or witnesses. Church officials, who said they could not recall any  recent threats, predicted that repairs will cost more than twice what the  police estimated. They added that they will install security measures to  prevent further damage to the chapel.  </P> <P> One of the two colorful windows that was damaged depicts Jesus raising a girl  from the dead. The other shows Christ telling a rich young ruler to distribute  funds to the poor.  </P> <P> "It's ironic that (the latter) was one of the windows to be smashed," Wilburn  said, speculating the attacker was likely a person "pushed to the fringe  because of the inability of our culture to include them."  </P> <P> "I have empathy for the person who did this," he said. "He must be going  through his own hell."  </P> <P> The vandalism was the second such incident this month in the Chichester Chapel,  which attracts about 800 visitors a week, according to church business  administrator Anna May. In the other incident, excrement was smeared over an  American flag, she said.  </P> <P> The church, located on Wilshire Boulevard near Vermont Avenue since 1929,  serves a congregation ranging from Hancock Park to the homeless. More than 27  nationalities are represented among Immanuel's 500 member families, church  officials say.  </P> <P> Nowhere are the church's multicultural, multiracial aspects more in evidence  than at the free lunchtime organ concerts. About 60 people attended Wednesday.  </P> <P> John Sanchez, a health insurance administrator for Thrifty Corp., regularly  attends the weekly concerts during his lunch hour.  </P> <P> "It's just nice to see a church that is so old," he said. "I just wish other  churches along Wilshire would open too."  </P> <P> Aaron Thomas Cotton, a temporarily homeless musician, was attending his first  noontime concert.  </P> <P> "It's refreshing. It's a change from being in downtown Los Angeles' Skid Row,"  said Cotton, who occasionally participates in Immanuel's free lunch program.  "And I love organ music. It goes straight to the soul."  </P></p>

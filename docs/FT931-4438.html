			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC probes camera imports JAPANESE electronics manufacturers are undercutting prices of EC-made television camera systems by up to 65 per cent, according to European producers. The European Commission yesterday opened a formal anti-dumping inquiry into Japanese television camera imports after complaints from Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France that systems were being sold in the EC at well below the price in Japan. According to the Commission, Japanese exports of the studio cameras to the EC are worth Ecu30m (Pounds 24.78m) a year. The Commission has also begun investigating alleged dumping of electrical components by South Korean and Taiwanese producers, following a similar probe into Japanese manufacturers' exports last year. Philips, BH Components of the UK, and Roederstein of Germany complain that large aluminium electrolytic capacitors from Korea and Taiwan have been sold at prices between 9 and 17 per cent lower than competing EC-made components. The capacitors are used in a wide variety of consumer electronics products.</p>

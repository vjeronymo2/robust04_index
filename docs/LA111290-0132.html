			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL;  </P> <P> PRESEASON POLL RANKS UNLV NO. 1  </P> <P> as No. 1.  </P> <P> The Runnin' Rebels, who won the national championship after being the preseason  No. 1 last season, were banned from this year's NCAA Tournament and won't be  able to defend their title. But that didn't stop the voters from making them  No. 1 today.  </P> <P> All but 15 of the 65 voters on the national board of writers and broadcasters  listed UNLV first on their ballots. The Runnin' Rebels had 1,601 points, well  ahead of Arkansas, 1,506, and Arizona, 1,488, which each received five  first-place votes.  </P> <P> Michigan State was fourth with one first-place vote and 1,302 points and was  followed in the Top Ten by North Carolina, Duke, Alabama, Indiana, Georgetown  and Ohio State.  </P> <P> UCLA is ranked 11th.  </P> <P> UNLV has four starters back from the team that beat Duke, 103-73, in the most  lopsided championship game ever played. All-American Larry Johnson and  defensive star Stacey Augmon both opted to return to the Runnin' Rebels rather  than go to the NBA, only to find out in July they could not defend their title.  </P> <P> Coach Jerry Tarkanian, the center of the 14-year-old allegations, and the  school offered several alternative punishments to the NCAA's Infractions  Committee last month, and it is possible the postseason ban for 1991 may yet be  overturned.  </P> <P> North Carolina had 1,282 points, 120 more than Duke, which received two  first-place votes. Alabama had 1,110 points to edge Indiana by 21. Georgetown  had the final two first-place votes and 1,054 points, while Ohio State's 887  points made the Buckeyes the third Big Ten team in the Top Ten with Michigan  State and Indiana.  </P> <P> North Carolina and Indiana both have freshmen to thank for their lofty  rankings. The Tar Heels have the nation's top recruiting class with five  players led by 7-foot Eric Montross, while Indiana's young team will be  augmented by highly publicized guard Damon Bailey, who was scrutinized  nationally throughout his successful high school career in the Hoosier state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TOP 25  </P> <P>  The top 25 in the AP preseason college basketball poll, first-place votes in  parentheses, with 1989-90 record.  </P> <P> 1.

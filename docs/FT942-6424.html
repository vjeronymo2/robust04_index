			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Germany aims to privatise military support Germany has followed Britain in starting a drive to rationalise and where possible privatise support services for its armed forces. The German proposals on procurement and possible privatisation of logistics and maintenance operations, launched quietly this month by Mr Volker Ruhe, defence minister, could reduce the nominal price of Eurofighter 2000, the controversial military aircraft. While not as radical as Britain's Front Line First project, a cost saving drive whose details will be announced by July, the German exercise includes ideas familiar to defence planners in London. Both countries' armed forces are now expected to move to a new system of procuring spare parts that will operate more like the civilian motor industry, using a reduced number of large depots supplying components in response to computerised orders. Up to now, spare part depots serving allied forces in Germany have been small, numerous and scattered to avoid vulnerability to attack. This factor is now felt to be less important. The German plan, to be overseen by Mr Jorg Schonbohm, calls for the possible privatisation of weapons maintenance and some military training. It also envisages wider use of the British practice of market testing, in which private companies and internal divisions of the armed forces are invited to compete for engineering or maintenance contracts. But in some fields the plan could require increases in short-term expenditure as a prelude to longer term savings. It calls for upgrading of logistics and transport systems, seen as necessary when German defence policy is placing greater stress on creation of rapid reaction forces. Introduction of ISDN communications systems is also to be speeded up in the belief that the corresponding increase in efficiency will pay for the innovation in a few years. The initiative follows submission in March to the German defence ministry of a set of recommendations prepared by General Lorenz Huber with the help of a management consultancy firm. Although the plan makes no reference to Eurofighter, it appears to provide at least part of the explanation for reports suggesting the unit cost of the aircraft will be slashed as a result of privatisation of logistics and maintenance. Stern magazine has suggested that the aircraft's price tag of DM125m (Pounds 50m) per unit includes a DM68m logistics component which could be slashed by up to 30 per cent if the work were farmed out to the private sector as opposed to in-house engineers. A spokesman for Deutsch Aerospace, the German manufacturer of Eurofighter, confirmed that the company had put it to the government that privatising logistics and maintenance could lead to substantial savings. Germany has provisionally said it will buy 140 of the aircraft, starting in 2002, but no final decision will be taken till next year. The defence ministry is currently engaged in delicate negotiations with Deutsche Aerospace over funding of the development phase. Completion of the development phase by the four partner countries - others are Britain, Spain and Italy - will be seriously complicated unless the dispute is resolved in the next few weeks, before the German parliament goes into summer recess.</p>

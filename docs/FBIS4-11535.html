			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Note" from President Violeta Chamorro to National Assembly </F> President Luis Humberto Guzman in Managua on 18 April]    [Text] No. P-2731-79-4-94    Managua, 18 April 1994    Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman, president of the National Assembly    Honorable Mr. President:    This note is in reference to Draft Law No. 174 entitled  "Judicial Action and Sentence Execution Suspension Law for  Trials Stemming From Property Restitution, Possession,  Questionable Bail, and Annulment." The National Assembly  approved the draft on 28 March 1994 and forwarded it to me on  that date for sanctioning, promulgation, and publication.    Allow me to state that I have carefully studied the  aforementioned Draft Law No. 174 and cannot help but express my  concern over the consequences the bill could have if put into  effect, and the problems that enforcing its provisions may  entail. It is my opinion that in drafting this law, the National  Assembly is overstepping the bounds of the judicial branch's  jurisdiction.    I do not agree with any form of abuse. I do not agree with  those who seek to evict legitimate owners and occupants from  their homes and lands. I do not agree with those who have  illegally occupied the property of others.    I have respected and enforced Laws 85 and 86, because they  are laws that were already in effect when I assumed my place as  president of the Republic. The Office for Territorial  Organization was create specifically to detect abuses that could  have been committed under the aforementioned laws, while  respecting the rights of legitimate beneficiaries.    I cannot sanction or promulgate Law No. 174 at this time,  however. While seeking to correct such abuses, it is committing  other more serious abuses, such as denying the people the right  to appeal to the courts to demand justice whenever they feel  their rights have been violated.    In addition to these general considerations, I believe it is  important to underscore the following specific issues:    1. Draft Law No. 174, in interfering with the judicial  branch's sphere of jurisdiction, would violate the  constitutional principle stated in Article [numeral indistinct]  of the Constitution, which sets forth the independence and  concerted coordination among the branches of state.  2. The law creates a conflict with the Constitution when  it suspends the execution of court sentences. According to  Article 167 of the Constitution, execution of court rulings and  resolutions is mandatory for the nation's authorities.  3. Sentences that have been carried out, whether handed  down by the Supreme Court of Justice, appeals courts, or lower  courts, are binding for all parties. This draft law would  entail retroactive effects on individual or collective rights,  because the nation's courts had previously recognized such  rights in favor of a specific party or parties. In so doing,  the law would violate Article 98 of the Constitution, which  states that the law shall not have retroactive effects, except  in criminal cases when such effects would favor a convicted  individual.  4. According to Article 52 of the Constitution, citizens  have the right to petition the branches of state, which are  obliged to promptly resolve such petitions in accordance with  the timeframes established by law. This draft law would impede  the judicial branch from complying with its constitutional duty  of resolving the demands and petitions brought before it. It is  also an affront to the basic right to demand justice and to  appear before the nation's courts to demand recognition and  protection of the rights the Constitution itself provides.  5. By threatening the judges and courts (including the  Supreme Court of Justice) by saying they may be committing a  crime in handing down their decisions in this regard, the draft  law violates Article 165 of the Constitution, which guarantees  the independence of judges and magistrates in the administration  of justice.  6. The right to private property is established in the  Constitution. One of the forms of exercising this right is  turning to the courts for protection whenever this right is  threatened or violated. To deny a legitimate proprietor this  possibility violates his right to private property. In  addition, this action breaches the principle of equality under  the law, as stated in Article 27 of the Constitution.    7. The fact that some judges commit abuses in their  positions is no justification for the legislative branch to  attempt to paralyze an important part of judicial activity. The  judicial system itself has its own internal resources and  mechanisms to correct such abuses. For this reason, this bill  goes against Article 129 of the Constitution that establishes  the independence of government branches.  8. Furthermore, this bill has incongruities. It  establishes that the judges will not process suits or continue  trials when the person being sued shows the purchase of property  or the assignment of his right to possession. How can the  person being sued show his right if the suit is not processed?  9. It also presents technical problems by establishing  new specific criminal conduct and penalties without reforming  the Criminal Code.  You will understand, Mr. President, that the  specifications of this law would cause serious problems in the  administration of justice. As I have stated on previous  occasions, the issuance of laws, which must not only be just but  also feasible, and which must conform to the Constitution, is a  responsibility shared by the honorable assembly that discusses  and approves a bill and by the president of the Republic who  sanctions it.    For the reasons I have expounded, I feel it is my duty to  refrain from sanctioning Draft Law No. 174, and for the sake of  the understanding that must exist and that we are promoting  between the government branches, I have decided not to make use  of the power afforded to me in Article 142 of the Constitution  to veto the bill, which I am sending you together with this note.    I ask you, Mr. President of the National Assembly, to  communicate these reasons to the representatives and to take the  liberty of suggesting a reconsideration of this law, inviting  you to consult with the Supreme Court before deciding to send it  to be published.    With cordial regards to you and the honorable  representatives, I remain very truly yours,    [signed] Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, president of the  Republic of Nicaragua</p>

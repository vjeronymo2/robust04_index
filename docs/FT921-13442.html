			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Company News: CanPac unit to raise CDollars 225m CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products is raising CDollars 225m (USDollars 193.90m) with an equity issue sold partly to the public and partly to its parent, Canadian Pacific. CPFP, one of Canada's top three pulp and paper groups, is issuing a total 8.5m new shares at CDollars 26.50 each. About 6.8m will be sold to the public and 1.7m to CP Enterprises, a CP financing subsidiary. Analysts expected a receptive market. CPFP stock closed Friday at CDollars 27.50, against a 52-week low of CDollars 22.25 and a high of CDollars 35. Last week, the company said it was shutting down a loss-making paper mill near Montreal and also two older machines at its big New Brunswick newsprint mill. Although it will post a heavy loss for the final quarter of 1991, its fortunes should improve in 1992 and a return to profitability is expected in 1993. The CDollars 225m will make up an expected shortfall in 1992 cashflow. CPFP is spending CDollars 300m on completing modernisation at its other mills in north America and on two newsprint de-inking plants in Quebec and Ontario.</p>

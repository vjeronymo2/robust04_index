			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a report, in a 7 June interview with  NBC TV, U.S. Secretary of Sate Christopher openly stated that  the U.S. position toward North Korea's nuclear issue is to take  a tough action through sanctions.    This is a breach of faith against us who have made all  sincere efforts to consistently see the solution to the Korean  peninsula's nuclear issue by way of dialogue and negotiations.  These are intolerable, criminal words and actions which are  bringing the situation to the brink of war.</p>

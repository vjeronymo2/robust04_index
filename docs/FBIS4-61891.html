			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (May 9) TURAN--Yesterday following talks  between special representative of Russian President, Vladimir  Kazimirov, and Azeri representatives, the Chairman of Azeri  Supreme Soviet, Rasul Guliyev, signed the Bishkek protocol  concerning political settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani  conflict, reports a TURAN's correspondent.    Kazimirov said that "Rasul Guliyev signed the Bishkek  document with two reservations". Instead of "captured  territories", Guliyev wrote "occupied territories" and to the  word "monitors", he added the word "international".    "These reservations practically change nothing but the Azeri  party thinks that it is very important", mentioned Kazimirov.    In his answer to the whether these amendments to the Bishkek  document forwarded by the Azeri party will be adopted, Kazimirov  said that "this document was signed in Bishkek by the  representatives of Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, the Chairman of  the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS, secretary general of  the Interparliamentary Assembly of the CIS the chairman of the  Kyrgyzstan Parliament and myself as representative of the  Russian president. For all those who signed it in Bishkek, the  text will remain the same. Probably, the Azeri party expressed  it particular opinion of this text".    According to Kazimirov, "the document was signed by the  representatives of the legislative bodies which have created  important political ground for the beginning of the settlement  to the conflict".    "All concrete issues coming out of the protocol must be  settled by executive powers, or presidents, premiers and defense  ministers", said Kazimirov.    Kazimirov said that during his meeting with President Aliyev  on Sunday "they agreed to order a cease in hostilities". "On  the other hand, I know that Stepanakert has been already ordered  to cease hostilities since I spoke with Stepankert by phone just  now", said Kazimirov. But according to Kazimirov "there is no  official agreement on a cease-fire between the parties, each  party orders a cease in hostilities itself", mentioned special  envoy of the Russian president.    "The matter concerning concluding the agreement on a  cease-fire has yet to be discussed", said Kazimirov.    "The fact is that Baku and Stepanakert must conclude an  agreement over the cease-fire themselves", mentioned Kazimirov.  "Baku sees the conflict as one between Armenia and Azerbaijan  while Yerevan believes that this is a conflict between  Azerbaijan and Nagorno Karabakh and Armenia is not involved in  it. Such propagandistic sentiments by Yerevan do not allow the  parties to move towards political settlement of the conflict.    Kazimirov said that the Russian party believes that "one of  the obstacles in the way of settlement of the conflict is  Azerbaijan's non-recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh, the party to  the conflict". He added that "it is up to Azerbaijan to  recognize it or not". "But recognition of the party to the  conflict is necessary in order to know with whom to sign the  agreement for a cease-fire".    Prior to the Bishkek summit, the Azeri Parliament made the  decision to not sign the Bishkek Protocol because its provisions  contradict the interests of Azerbaijan.</p>

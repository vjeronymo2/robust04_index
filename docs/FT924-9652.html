			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Survey of Northern Greece (9): They can't afford to quarrel  -Businessmen are attracted by Bulgaria's new market economy IT TAKES five hours to drive from Thessaloniki to Athens, but only three to reach Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. That is one reason why northern Greek businessmen are enthusiastic about working in Bulgaria, despite their concerns about the lack of a clear legal framework for foreign investment and property ownership. To circumvent these problems, Greeks are going into partnership with Bulgarians. Over 200 Greek-Bulgarian joint ventures have been established since Bulgaria started its transition to a market economy. 'The joint ventures cover a very wide range of activities, from retail and marketing to consultancy and manufacturing, though this is developing rather slowly,' says Mr Emmanuel Vlahogiannis, treasurer of the Thessaloniki Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 'Bulgaria is an attractive market for Greece, being about the same size and in need of the kind of consumer goods that we can provide. Their development is going to be rather like ours in the 1950s and 60s.' Fast-moving consumer goods are the mainstay of the Greek retail trade in Bulgaria. Coffee, chocolate, ice-cream, jeans and training shoes are the most popular items, according to Greek exporters. A scramble is on to find business premises in Sofia, preferably in a building that has already been restored to its original owners - to avoid the possibility of being summarily evicted if the property changes hands. There appears to be little difficulty in converting payments in Bulgarian lev into US dollars, which are handed over in cash at Bulgarian banks, but there can be problems with arranging a transfer to a Greek bank in Thessaloniki. 'You can't just drive home with a briefcase of dollars in the boot. It took me months to organise payments through the banking system, because Bulgarian banks aren't geared up for sending money out of the country. But now I can get a transfer through in one week,' says Mr Apostolos Genitsaris, whose activities in Bulgaria extend from setting up an ice-cream distribution network to trading in oil and petroleum products. However, the free-wheeling climate of Greek-Bulgarian trade is starting to change, following a Bulgarian decision to impose a 30 per cent import tariff and set up a quota system for a wide range of goods. Business on the Greek side of the border consists mainly of Bulgarians arriving to shop at a large Greek supermarket just over the frontier. Some Bulgarians come as far as Kavalla or Thessaloniki in search of spare parts or a service for their car. It is hoped that dealings with Bulgaria will happen on a more organised footing once the new Greek-Bulgarian Chamber of Commerce starts operating, probably early next year. Meanwhile, seven medium-sized Greek towns close to the Bulgarian border are promoting commercial links with four others in southern Bulgaria under the European Community's Interreg programme for cross-border co-operation. Greek affiliates of international accounting and consultancy companies are participating in the EC's Phare programmes for assisting Bulgarian economic development. They also seem keen to get involved in Bulgaria's privatisation programme as financial advisers. 'There may soon be enough work available for us in Bulgaria to justify opening an office there,' says Mr Yiangos Charalambous, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick Kyriacou, which earlier this year carried out an audit for the new American-funded university at Blagoevgrad in southern Bulgaria. But several Thessaloniki-based manufacturing companies have postponed plans to set up plants in Bulgaria, because of the difficulties of acquiring a greenfield site. Under current Bulgarian law, foreigners are allowed to buy buildings but can only lease land. Meanwhile, four fast-growing Athens-based companies are already establishing themselves in Bulgaria. Hellenic Bottling, which holds the Coca-Cola franchise for Greece and Ireland, has launched a Dollars 18m joint venture to produce Coca-Cola and other soft drinks at five Bulgarian bottling plants. Delta Dairy, a food processor, is setting up an ice-cream plant at Varna, a Black Sea resort. Intracom, a telecommunications company, is negotiating the sale of a computerised lottery game to the Bulgarian state. The Vardinoyannis group, with oil and banking interests, has opened the first in what is planned as a network of petrol stations in Bulgaria, to be supplied from its refinery in Greece. However, the business environment for Greek companies in Bulgaria is to some extent clouded by a distinct coolness in the two countries' political relations. The Greek government was angered by Bulgaria's decision to recognise the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia earlier this year, though this was somewhat mitigated by a Bulgarian decision not to send an ambassador to Sofia until the EC approves recognition of the newly independent republic. Greek politicians are unhappy about the Bulgarian government's dependence on parliamentary support from the country's ethnic Turkish party. Before the collapse of communism, Greece and Bulgaria - though members of opposing alliances - found common cause in their mutual suspicion of Turkey. It does not help that talks have stalled in a long-running dispute over how much water the Bulgarians are entitled to pump out of the river Nestos before it reaches Greece. The Bulgarians, for their part, are upset that their requests for new border crossings into Greece to be opened up, and for access to the port of Alexandroupolis in Thrace, only 30 miles from the Bulgarian frontier, have not yet been granted. But given the threat of increased political instability in the southern Balkans, Greece and Bulgaria cannot afford to start quarrelling. 'If there is real trouble in ex-Yugoslav Macedonia, the road through Bulgaria will be Greece's only overland link to western Europe. Obviously, they need each other,' says a western diplomat.</p>

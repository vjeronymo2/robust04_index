			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, April 24 (XINHUA) -- China urged the  industrial countries here today to take concrete actions to help  the developing countries alleviate their poverty and improve  their economies.    "We urge the developed countries to take concrete actions to  meet the target of 0.7 percent of gross domestic product set by  the U.N." and use the fund to help the developing world, said  Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China.    In this aspect, Chen said at the 50th meeting of the Group  of  24 Ministers, the developed countries have "an unavoidable  responsibility".    "With the developed and developing countries' increasing  interdependence, it is clear that not until most of the  developing countries have achieved stable and sustainable growth  can sound and sustained global development be attained," Chen  said.    The deputy governor of China's central bank said that a  serious difficulty for developing countries' economic  development was the uncertainty for their external environment.    It included the persistent decline in commodity prices,  various forms of trade protectionism and the heavy debt burden  which he said imposed acute constraints on the economic  development of many low- income developing countries.    "We urge the developed countries to persevere in  substantially reducing the debt of the low-income developing  countries," he stressed.    He also urged the developed countries to take more  substantive action in the areas of finance and technical  assistance as well as in facilitating an improved economic  environment.    Speaking of the world economy, Chen said the global economic  activity is expected to improve in the next two years, although  continuing recession in most European countries and Japan  remains a cause for concern.    Many developing countries, he said, continue to face severe  difficulties in their economic development, while economies in  most East European countries and the countries of the former  Soviet Union are still enduring hardships.</p>

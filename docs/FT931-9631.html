			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Observer: Close to chest Things must be coming to a pretty pass when stockbrokers dismiss stockbrokers. That is nevertheless what BWD Rensburg, the ambitious and quoted northern broking and financial services group, did yesterday in giving Credit Lyonnais Laing the push in favour of James Capel. Laing said that on the whole BWD looked after itself and the relationship was 'never close'. But a better clue to the distantness thereof was given by BWD chief executive Christopher Broadbent when he let slip that the sacking was prompted by 'personnel changes' at Laing. Apparently he didn't hear of them until a year after they'd been made.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Bulletin" issued by the Secretariat of National Defense in </F> Mexico City on 2 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] Given the events in the Chiapas highlands at the  beginning of the year, the Secretariat of National Defense  intensified its investigation of the illegal shipment of weapons  to our country. Among the evidence gathered, in late January we  received indication of a possible shipment of 2,000 AK-47  rifles, which could be part of a larger shipment. In other  words, this case is over four-months old.    Upon receiving this information, the Secretariat of National  Defense established the hypothesis that these arms could be  smuggled to any state with high incidence of drug trafficking,  or other crime problems.    The Secretariat of National Defense alerted other Federal  agencies, so they could take appropriate action to confirm the  veracity of this report. The information was received at the  official level, and it was handled in a confidential manner.  Currently there is no evidence of an illegal shipment of weapons  from abroad.    The Secretariat of Government and the Attorney General's  Office also conducted an investigation into this case, with  negative results. All information on gun running is  investigated in great detail, and in several cases -- like in  this case -- investigations turn out negative.</p>

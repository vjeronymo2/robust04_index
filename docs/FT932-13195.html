			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / 'Greedy' house sellers prompt fears in north-east NORTH-east England's estate agents are strikingly cautious about the apparent recovery in the housing market even though they are delighted at the increased sales activity of recent months. Mr Stan Morville, managing director of Dollery Waller, which has eight branches in Teesside and south Durham, is refusing to accept instructions from would-be sellers who insist on an above-valuation asking price. Mr Sam Smith, a Newcastle-based associate at Keith Pattinson, which has 33 branches in the region, talks with dismay of clients who have wanted to increase the price of their unsold homes. There are fears that over-eager sellers could throttle house recovery at birth in a region with a big backlog of unsold properties. Mr Peter Miller of Black Horse in Newcastle, who is also the national housing spokesman for the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, warned: 'The worst thing which could happen is for people to become greedy and over-optimistic; the market is extremely price sensitive.' In parts of the region pleasant homes in good order can be found for less than Pounds 45,000; 60 per cent of Dollery Waller's sales in the first three months of this year were under this figure. But Mr Miller said because prices are now more realistic some first-time buyers are leapfrogging the lowest rung and looking at properties in the Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 60,000 band. He now detects virtually two markets; the unoccupied, possibly repossessed, property which may need some improvement, and the good quality, well-maintained home. It is the latter which are selling well. Many agents would like more semis; Miss Ashley Hollingworth, at Whitegates in Sunderland, said semis in coastal areas were in demand. 'People living there want to stay.' In Newcastle, Mr Smith would like more larger, older houses up to Pounds 150,000. Underlying these perceived shortages is concern about the level of new instructions. A few agents report a slight increase, under 5 per cent. Others say the number is static. Average selling times vary widely; Keith Pattinson has just sold a house for Pounds 155,000, asking price Pounds 158,000, which had been on the market two years. The sale of one semi in Redcar, Cleveland, was completed less than a fortnight after Dollery Waller listed it. Mr Smith suggests three months as an average selling time. With agents pushing for realistic asking prices, and the market looking more active, many discounts are now fairly modest; on average, agents suggest, no more than 5 per cent on properties under Pounds 45,000, rising possibly to 10 per cent higher up the scale.</p>

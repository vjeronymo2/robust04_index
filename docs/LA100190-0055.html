Affected agencies will be the city treasurer's  department, the economic development department, community services and  administrative services.  </P> <P> Richard Barnard, deputy city administrator, said the city has estimated the  cost of the work at $62,054. He said that plans for the remodeling currently  are being completed and that then a contractor will be selected.  </P> <P> "We hope to see all the building changes in place by the end of this year," he  said.BILL BILLITER  </P></p>

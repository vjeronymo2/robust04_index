			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. READY TO CALL UP RESERVES;  </P> <P> MOBILIZATION: ARMY, NAVY AND AIR FORCE WANT 150,000 FOR SUPPORT WORK. NOTICES  MAY GO OUT NEXT WEEK. CIVILIAN AIRLINES ORDERED TO PROVIDE UP TO 38 AIRCRAFT.  </P> <P> President Bush is preparing to act on a Pentagon request for permission to call  up as many as 150,000 members of the National Guard and other reserve units to  meet critical shortages of support troops that are developing as a result of  the massive U.S. military deployment in the Persian Gulf, sources said Friday.  </P> <P> White House officials said no final decision has been made on exact numbers,  but they left little doubt that a substantial mobilization of reserves is  imminent -- with the first wave of call-up notices expected to go out as soon  as early next week.  </P> <P> Indeed, Pentagon officials said, the armed forces cannot sustain the current  buildup in Saudi Arabia -- now approaching 50,000 troops and growing rapidly --  without a heavy infusion of reserves.  </P> <P> The Army has sought approval for mobilizing 80,000 reservists, while the Navy  and Air Force are seeking approximately 35,000 each, sources said. Secretary of  Defense Dick Cheney is supporting the services' requests and is understood to  have discussed the need for a major call-up with Bush when the President made a  speech at the Pentagon last Wednesday.  </P> <P> In a related move, the Pentagon ordered 16 civilian airlines to provide up to  38 aircraft for an indefinite period to help shuttle troops and equipment to  the Middle East in the first-ever deployment under the Civil Reserve Air Fleet  program.  </P> <P> The airlines have been asked to provide the planes and the crews needed to  operate them within 24 hours.  </P> <P> Any large-scale mobilization of reserves -- with its disruptive impact on lives  of individuals, families and communities -- is politically sensitive. As a  result, Bush may elect to start with a relatively modest call-up, sources  indicated, perhaps beginning with only a few thousand.  </P> <P> But Pentagon officials said that far larger numbers are needed and that they  expect to get a substantial proportion of what they are requesting.  </P> <P> "Anything less than tens of thousands of reservists would be meaningless," said  one Army official. Not all of those called up are expected to go to the Middle  East; some are likely to be used at bases in the United States and other  countries as replacements for troops used directly in the Persian Gulf buildup.  </P> <P> The Army official said the Defense Department is prepared to begin sending out  notices at the beginning of next week and is waiting only for a green light  from the White House.  </P> <P> A White House source said Friday night that final paperwork on a call-up had  not yet reached the President, but he indicated that Bush was "almost certain"  to take some action soon.  </P> <P> Present-day U.S. military units are structured in such a way that they are  almost totally dependent on reserves for such vital support services as  transporting supplies, providing medical treatment and maintaining  communications.  </P> <P> "Up to 80% of combat service support troops -- everything from water and oil  handlers and stevedores to engineers and signals corpsmen -- are in the  reserves, attached to combat divisions," one Pentagon official said.  </P> <P> As an example, he cited the Army's 24th Mechanized Division, which was sailing  Friday for the Middle East with two of its three brigades. "The third brigade  is in the Georgia National Guard. We plan on calling that brigade. It's organic  to the 24th Division," the official said.  </P> <P> A brigade consists of approximately 3,000 troops.  </P> <P> Especially in recent years, as the Pentagon has faced rising budget pressures,  more and more support functions have been moved out of regular units and  assigned to reserves. Now, the Pentagon may learn whether that strategy --  adopted primarily to save money -- can meet the test of a major crisis.  </P> <P> In ordering U.S. airlines to make the 38 planes available, the Pentagon said  the move is necessary "in order to meet mounting airlift requirements for  Operation Desert Shield" -- the official designation for the Middle East  military buildup.  </P> <P> The action marks the first time that the government has activated the Civil  Reserve Air Fleet, a program under which the Pentagon pays to equip privately  owned aircraft to handle military payloads in times of emergency.  </P> <P> The Defense Department said the additional aircraft would be used "for several  weeks" to supplement both military aircraft and existing support provided by  civilian airlines through charter arrangements.  </P> <P> A total of 29 commercial airlines participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet,  but only 16 are included in a "Stage 1" alert, the lowest of three possible  levels of deployment. The government did not identify the 16 carriers or  specify what kind of planes they would provide.  </P> <P> "These aircraft would be used to augment the Military Airlift Command's routine  overseas mission as well as operations in the Middle East," the Pentagon said  in a statement.  </P> <P> Under the program, which was developed in the 1950s, airlines equip specified  planes to transport military troops and equipment. The government reimburses  the carriers for the costs they incur, including additional fuel burned as a  result of the planes' increased weight.  </P> <P> Military officials said activation of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet is necessary  because the deployment of U.S. forces to the Middle East has been bottlenecked  to some extent by a shortage of cargo and troop transport planes.  </P> <P> The order to the airlines was issued by Gen. H. T. Johnson, commander in chief  of the U.S. Transportation Command.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yu. A. Yashin, by A. Vaganov, under the </F> rubric "VPK [Military-Industrial Complex]": "Yuriy Yashin: `The  State's Opportunities Are Limited': High Technologies in Russia:  Between Past and Future"]    [Text] So it worked out by force of objective  circumstances that the Soviet, now the Russian, VPK  [military-industrial complex] was virtually the sole creator  and, at the same time, producer of high technology in our  country. What this cost the other branches of the economy is a  separate discussion. Regardless, today we face the real prospect  of losing this "accumulator" of the most modern scientific and  technological experience. If things go any further, the symbol  of this process could become the spacecraft Burak, which has  been turned into an attraction at Moscow's Gorky Park. For the  state, in its present condition, the VPK may well be an  unbearable burden. Where does the solution to the current  situation lie?    Answering the questions of NG's [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA]  correspondent is Yuriy Alekseyevich Yashin, chairman of the  State Technical Commission under the RF [Russian Federation]  president, laureate of the State Prize, doctor of technical  sciences, professor, academician of the Russian and  international academies of engineering and of the Russian  Academy of Astronautics.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Yuriy Alekseyevich, aren't we having a  conversation merely for conversation's sake? Won't the problems  of our country's high technology be resolved automatically, as  the economy stabilizes?    [Yashin] First let's define what we mean by "high  technology."    Essentially, what this means is high priority directions for  applied research and research-intensive production, the mastery  of which at the present moment is what determines a country's  degree of development, its real scientific-technical, economic,  yes, and military weight in the world.    In order to have its own high technology, a country must  possess a minimum of three things: highly qualified staffs of  researchers and producers; the necessary material base for  science and industry; and significant funds, which are essential  at the stage of research and introduction.    Allow the temporary absence of just one of these  conditions--that is, fail to take measures against the "brain  drain," economize on research and modernization of production,  or on higher education--during a period of economic difficulties  and you are saying goodbye to any hope of staying on a world  level.    The whole process is automatic.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But maybe we really should restrict  our  ambitions and pretensions in high technology and attempt to  occupy an acceptable place in the world division of labor,  relying on less costly spheres of production.    [Yashin] That kind of thinking is fundamentally wrong, and  its implementation could cost our country very dearly in all  respects, including the purely economic one.    Only with the massive application of our country's  helicopter  technology (especially the Mi-6 and Mi-8 helicopters) were we  able to accelerate the opening up of Tyumen oil by 10 years.    Up to 30 percent of the information obtained by the Russian  Defense Ministry's satellites could be used in the interests of  our agriculture, whereas at present no more than 5 percent is  being used; 60 percent could be used in the interests of lumber,  but only 2 percent is.    Generally speaking, a lot of high technology is vital to  Russia. Our transport system would simply collapse without air  transportation. No other country needs satellite systems for  communication, ecological monitoring, and resource investiation  more than ours.    Here an extremely important dilemma arises: what do we need  to develop and support more, our own high technology or purchase  the appropriate output abroad, create jobs here at home or  support another country's prosperity, complain of the  ever-present "price scissors" of resources and manufactured  output or take our own "place in the sun" on the world market?    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Is the issue really that serious?    [Yashin] Unfortunately, yes. Let's look at the situation in  civil aviation. In the next 5-10 years we are going to have to  replace the overwhelming portion of our aviation fleet--about  1100 of our 1400 long-range airplanes. The creation of these  airplanes is provided for in the current "Program of Development  for Civil Aviation Technology." The Tu-204, Il-96-300, and other  airplanes that have already been developed fully meet world  standards.    At the same time, the current financing of the program comes  to 26-28 percent of what is required, the finishing of vehicles  and their release into serial production is being delayed, the  aviation industry, which as a result of the wholesale decline in  military orders has lost approximately 400,000 jobs, is not  fully utilized, and one of its leaders, the Aviastar  association, in order to stay afloat, is already entering into  an agreement to assemble English airplanes made from English  parts.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] We see that the problem is  inexhaustible. Still, precisely what paths for its solution do  you feel are most important today?    [Yashin] Keeping in mind the framework of our interview, I  will limit myself to what seem to me the three most important  points.    First: optimization of the process of converting defense  branches of industry. Due to objective reasons, Russia's leading  scientific-technological potential has turned out to be  concentrated in the branches of the defense complex. The current  way of implementing conversion threatens it with "erosion," if  not loss, and it is essential for us that this potential be  reoriented toward satisfying the demands of the economy's civil  sector. Especially since a rational reorientation involves  direct access to a virtually instantaneous and advantageous  "open yield" from the defense surplus. For example, right now a  cooperation of enterprises headed by the Moscow Institute of  Thermal Technology is building on experience gained in making  mobile military rocket complexes to design a family of  commercial, multipurpose, transportable complexes for putting  lightweight satellites into orbit. Flight tests of the Start-1  complex have been going on successfully since 25 March 1993. Now  several long-term programs for utilizing the Start complexes in  the interests of Russian and foreign organizations have been  agreed upon. There are other extremely interesting proposals as  well.    Second: a search for new ways to administer  scientific-technical progress. We must make substantial changes  in the mechanisms for administering design and research, which  in large part are inherited from the old economic model and are  not very effective, given current conditions.    Finally, third, and perhaps most important: a solution for  the problem of investments in our country's high technology. The  state's opportunities are limited. We must activate all possible  sources of financing, including commercial structures at home  and abroad and international consortia.    The state should do the minimum essential for this: ensure a  favorable investment climate; offer a developed legal base  guaranteeing investor interests; and create capable executive  organs. So far the operations of the executive and judicial  authorities in this respect have been poorly coordinated and  have borne a somewhat impulsive character. One can only express  one's regret, for instance, that the appearance of the RF  president's edict of 27 September 1993, No. 1466, "On Completion  of Work with Foreign Investments," did not stimulate any  noticeable progress in this sphere.    Apart from foreign investments in the country, however, we  also have our own potential sources of financing for high  technology and research-intensive branches. In order to get  things going well, we need to join forces and bring the  positions of all subjects in the investment process closer  together: banking structures, enterprises, the state apparatus,  and authoritative scholars and specialists.    I think that a definite positive role in this could be  played  by the international conference on "Integration of Banking  Industrial Capital," which is planned for November of this year  and the national organizing committee for which is headed up by  the deputy chairman of the RF government, Aleksandr Shokin. Also  encouraging is the role being played in conference preparation  by our own country's financial structures, especially the  Association of Russian Banks, the Moscow Banking Union,  Aviabank, and several others.</p>

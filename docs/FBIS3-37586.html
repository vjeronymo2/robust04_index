Announcing the above in a gathering of reporters in New York  yesterday, Nazarbayev said: The U.S. Government has a negative  understanding of the Iranian Government. He referred to the  special significance of the role played by Iran in the southern  and central Asian equations and emphasized that relations  between Almaty and Tehran are very good.    The Kazakh president, rejecting the existence of a threat of  Islamic fundamentalism in Central Asia, stressed: We are all  Muslims and respect Islamic beliefs. However, Nazarbayev said:  A line has been drawn separating religion and politics in  Kazakhstan. The Kazakh president said: Washington and Almaty  have reached agreements in political, economic, scientific,  technological, and defense fields as well as the U.S. use of  Kazakhstan's space center and America has promised to provide  $300 million of aid to Kazakhstan.</p>

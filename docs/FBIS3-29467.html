During their stay in Cambodia, H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam and his  colleagues were received by Samdech Chea Sim, acting head of  state and chairman of the Cambodian National Assembly, and held  talks with First Prime Minister Prince Krompreah Norodom  Ranariddh and Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen of the Royal  Government of Cambodia [RGC].    H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam also held talks with his Cambodian  counterpart, Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut. The focus was on  consolidating and expanding relations between the two countries  and peoples of Cambodia and Vietnam, which are based on  friendship and good-neighborly cooperation. They also discussed  the issue of the Vietnamese immigrants. Unanimous agreement was  reached on establishing two mechanisms. The first mechanism is  to determine the framework for discussions on the border issue,  to make the Cambodian-Vietnamese border a border of long-lasting  peace and friendship and to ensure security along the border.  The second mechanism is to determine the framework for  discussing the Vietnamese immigrants. The two sides also talked  about the Mekong committee. They agreed that the exploitation  of the Mekong River should be based on consensus and should  benefit all of the countries along the river. H.E. Nguyen Manh  Cam affirmed that the Vietnamese Government respects Cambodia's  independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity and wants  Southeast Asia to become a zone of peace, stability, and  cooperation. On the issues of the border and the Vietnamese  immigrants, the two sides agreed to solve these problems  peacefully and with mutual consideration, using legal principles  as the basis.    During his visit, H.E. Nguyen Manh Cam also signed a  memorandum of agreement on economic, science and technology, and  cultural cooperation between the RGC and the Vietnamese  Government.    Prince Kromkhun Norodom Sirivut, deputy prime minister and  minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation;  leading Foreign Ministry officials; and various diplomats  accredited to Cambodia were on hand at Pochentong Airport to see  off the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry delegation.</p>

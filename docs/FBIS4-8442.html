			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, April 13 (CTK) -- Czech Foreign Minister  Josef Zieleniec, during his forthcoming visit to Vietnam, the  main goal of which is to strengthen mutual economic relations  after a long period of stagnation, intends to raise the question  of human rights, diplomatic sources told CTK today.    They were reacting to an open letter received on Tuesday  [April 12] by Zieleniec from the Vietnamese Renewal Party whose  main goal is installing democracy in Vietnam.    The Czech section of the party added to the letter a list of  almost 150 people imprisoned in Vietnam for their religious  convictions or for expressing disagreement with the Vietnamese  government.    The section expressed its disappointment that articles in  the  Czech press about Czech leaders' recent visits to Vietnam did  not mention human rights breaches in that country.    Swedish Premier Carl Bildt and Australian Premier Paul  Keating, during their recent visits to Vietnam, pointed to the  violation of human rights and freedoms in Vietnam. Keating who  was a subject of pressure from the strong Vietnamese community  in his country, pointed to the Vietnamese leadership approach  towards religious and political dissidents. Nevertheless  Keating made it clear that human rights were only one topic for  discussion and that they should not influence relations between  Australia and Vietnam.    Hanoi is usually irritated when this side of the life of  Vietnamese society is pointed at and considers it interference  into its internal affairs.    Zieleniec will start his three-day official visit to Vietnam  on April 16. From Vietnam he travel to Malaysia and Australia.</p>

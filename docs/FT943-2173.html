			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Road-map sought for EU applicants France and Germany agreed yesterday to ask the European Commission to produce a white paper next spring setting out a road-map for enlarging the European Union to eastern Europe. The idea is to emulate Lord Cockfield's celebrated 1985 white paper which set out a list of measures for the European Union to adopt in order to complete the single market by 1992, a Brussels official said yesterday. EU officials hope the detailed pre-accession strategy will give the former communist countries of central and eastern Europe fresh incentives to consolidate economic reform, while persuading them that their aspirations for EU membership are taken seriously. The Franco-German initiative was unveiled yesterday at the end of a two-day meeting in Paris of both countries' foreign ministers and ambassadors to the six EU candidate countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania) as well as the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The aim of the conference was to pool information on eastern Europe, but also to ensure greater harmony between France and Germany on the EU's next enlargement to the east than was evident earlier this year on entry negotiations with Nordic countries and Austria. French complaints that Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, had put candidate countries' interests ahead of those of the EU had sparked a diplomatic row. Mr Kinkel, the current president of the EU's Council of Ministers, said the white paper 'should map out the road ahead' for East Europe's eventual integration. Among other elements, it should cover the difficulties of adapting its economic, banking, legal and transport systems to EU norms. One likely approach is for the Commission to draw up a list of between 100 and 150 measures for the East Europeans to adopt in order to make their legislation compatible with EU standards. In return, the EU would phase out progressively anti-dumping measures and thereby expand the single European market eastwards. Mr Alain Juppe, foreign minister of France which takes over the EU presidency from Germany in January, said the white paper idea would be broached with Mr Jacques Santer, the Commission president-elect. Both foreign ministers claimed that their governments were at one on enlargement the east, but differences of emphasis emerged over how far the EU should try to lift eastern Europe's standard of living to its own. Mr Kinkel suggested that it was important to treat eastern Europe as a whole, with reference to former East Germany, now incorporated in the European Union. 'We cannot have wages in Dresden that are twice as high as in Budapest, which are twice as high as in Bucharest.' However, the French side emphasised possible costs involved. Mr Alain Lamassoure, France's EU affairs minister, cited the alarming, though hypothetical, example that if all east European and Baltic countries were next year to enter the Union with unchanged farm and structural funds rules, the Union budget would have to double. Both ministers ritually disclaimed any ambitions for a Franco-German 'directorate' of the EU.</p>

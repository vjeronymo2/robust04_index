			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Management: Finding the right network 'UNTIL recently most managers believed that redundancy only happened to blue-collar workers in the north,' says Nicholas Walters, senior staff tutor at the Guildford Institute of the University of Surrey. 'Those who enjoyed the success and financial rewards of the enterprise culture are largely unprepared for the experience.' Unemployment in Walters' 'patch' - the traditionally prosperous region of south-west Surrey - has risen by more than 320 per cent since March 1990. Many of the victims are executives. Efforts to address their needs are being made through courses like the one at Guildford. Another source of support can be found in the informal networks of redundant executives springing up around the UK. Adult education centres, universities, citizens advice bureaux, churches and public libraries may also be able to provide the right introduction. Executive unemployment is often masked by substantial redundancy payments. But Walters believes that the refinement of job-finding skills is particularly important. Structural changes in industry mean there will be fewer jobs when the economy improves than there were at the top of the last cycle. Redundant executives are often well-qualified and have specialist skills, but Walters says it is important to look out for transferable expertise. Redundancy, he adds, can be an opportunity to overcome technophobia and to improve language and personal financial management skills. Philip Thomas, an out-of-work lawyer who recently completed a Guildford course, is a firm believer in unemployed executive networks and has just started one with fellow alumni. He thinks they can be a useful way of developing training techniques and, ultimately, of tracking down jobs.</p>

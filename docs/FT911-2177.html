			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK-based groups on US list alleging Libyan links TWO London-based companies were among 48 groups and banks named last night by the US Treasury as alleged agents of the Libyan government and therefore subject to the American economic embargo against that country. The action is part of a continuing Treasury investigation of Libyan efforts to engage in financial transactions and to buy goods in circumvention of the embargo. No US companies are on the list. The majority of the companies named are based in Arab and Mediterranean countries and many have specific links to Libya in their title. The 48 companies are now considered specially designated nationals or agents of the Libyan government, bringing them under the embargo and assets freeze put in place in January 1986. All assets of such entities within US jurisdiction, including overseas branches of US banks, are blocked and transactions by US persons with such entities are banned. There are criminal penalties of fines and prison terms for breaches. Mr Richard Newcomb, director of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, said last night: 'Libya's policies and actions, including its continued refusal to disavow terrorism as a tool of international policy, make such a listing particularly useful in redirecting public attention to the comprehensive sanctions programme in place against Libya.'</p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Fashion images YOU could invest in a little fashion world glamour this weekend at a sale and exhibition by almost 100 fashion and portrait photographers. Images include vintage shots from 1960s names such as Barry Lategan and Clive Arrowsmith, David Bailey's pictures of Jean Shrimpton, portraits by Linda McCartney and work by Sheila Rock and Eamonn McCabe. Proceeds will go to the Fashion Acts Aids charity, in memory of photographer Stevie Hughes, who, before he died from Aids last year, donated some of his work for the show. It is at The Worx, 350 King's Road, London SW3, from 10am to 6pm today and 11am to 5pm tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez from the </F> Spanish Socialist Workers Party headquarters in Madrid -- live]    [Text] I want to make a statement in the first place to say  that according to the results known so far in these elections,  which I think are now unchangeable, the People's Party [PP] has  won the elections. Therefore, elections to the European  Parliament belong to the People's Party. They are to be  congratulated and congratulated democratically. Therefore, this  is the first statement. I phoned PP leader Jose Maria Aznar as  soon as these first results were known to congratulate him.    Second, we are awaiting the results from the elections to  the  Andalusian Parliament. We will be the major party, although  with less seats. I have also congratulated Manuel Chaves [prime  minister of the Andalusian Autonomous Government]. Third, and  this is addressed to all of you, I want to say something.  Twelve years ago, a little more than 12 years ago, 12 years as  everyone knows...[pauses] we have been winning elections as the  Socialist party. We have an extraordinarily faithful  electorate, over 30 percent. We have to give our deepest thanks  for its loyalty and faithfulness at moments of difficulty. I  sincerely believe that this is a good base for recovery. We  have time ahead of us. We have to carry out government capable  of overcoming the two elements that I believe have had a  negative influence in what is probably the worst moment we are  experiencing. One of these elements, without a doubt, has been  corruption, and the other element has been the economic crisis.  Despite the fact that we are coming out of it, despite this, it  is still not being noticed among the people. Therefore, there  has been a part of the electorate that on this occasion I  believe has abstained. It has not given us its vote and this  has meant that we have gone down in the results. I want to give  you all the encouragement that I feel.    Even if the results were not what they were, and they are  respectable, being over 30 percent, even if they had not been  what they have been, I repeat, I would have the fighting spirit  to try to win the next elections as I think is right for a  political program such as the one we represent.    According to the figures I have, I think that at the level  of  the European Union [EU], which could also be a complementary  element, we will continue to be the largest group in the  European Parliament, but we still have to wait. The Socialist  and Social Democratic group will be the largest in the European  Parliament. We also have the satisfaction that Austria has won  its referendum by approximately two-thirds of the population,  therefore, there is a new EU member.    I do not want to go on much longer. But I want to remind you  that democratically and unreservedly I congratulate those who  have won. We know how to win and lose elections and we are  going to win the next elections. Therefore, take heart, you  have worked very hard. There is a very significant part of the  electorate that continues to give us its support at moments of  extreme difficulty. Therefore, as is already happening, when we  clearly begin to overcome the economic crisis the wind will blow  in our favor. When we try and succeed in eliminating from  public life those who take advantage of it, from wherever they  come from, we will also improve our electoral possibilities.    Finally, I just want to make a personal comment. When I win  elections, when we have won elections, and we have won many  times, you see me a bit serious. I feel overwhelmed by the  responsibility. Now we have lost I want to encourage you with a  smile to try to win the next elections. It is in our power and  we can do so. So, take heart. Do not let this work fail  because it is for a great political program that has  historically transformed our life and will continue to do so in  the future.    Finally, I want to say something else especially to the  press. Tomorrow morning government has to continue. I am  absolutely prepared to give stability to the country's  government, to try to improve the economic situation, and to  strengthen the fight against corruption. Therefore, as from  tomorrow, when I have to make an unavoidable trip to Colombia,  as from tomorrow, we will again begin our work as a government  and we will try to carry out a deeper analysis than I have just  done as to what have been the causes, the deep causes, of this  electoral situation, and we will try to overcome them. Have  confidence, trust in the future, the future belongs to  democratic socialism. Thank you.</p>

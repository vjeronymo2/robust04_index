			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Strong orders fail to alter Siemens outlook: Chairman warns against hasty conclusions as earnings expected to fall by as much as 15 per cent in current financial year Siemens, the electrical and electronics multinational, has said it expects earnings to fall by between 10 and 15 per cent in the current financial year, in spite of a strong flow of orders in the first quarter. Mr Heinrich von Pierer, chairman, yesterday warned against drawing hasty conclusions from the 15 per cent rise in demand recorded in the three months to the end of December. Mr von Pierer based his estimate of lower earnings on assumptions that financial income of DM2.1bn (Dollars 1.22bn) last year, compared with about DM1bn in 1991-92, would fall. 'As cautious business people, we cannot assume that capital market conditions will remain unfailingly favourable,' he said. Siemens-Nixdorf (SNI), the loss-making computer business would return a deficit of about DM300m, according to Mr Karl-Hermann Baumann, finance director. SNI last year reduced its deficit from more than DM500m to about DM400m. The company, which shed 5,000 workers last year, would again be particularly affected by plans for some 10,000 group-wide job cuts in the current year. According to Mr von Pierer, the computer business still hopes to break even in 1996. Officials expect semi-conductors, another persistent drain on profits, to return to the black in 1995. Mr von Pierer rejected speculation that the departure of Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, chairman of SNI, was premature because of his failure to turn the business round. Mr Wiedig, who is to hand over to Mr Gerhard Schulmeyer, head of ABB in the US, on October 1, had told him he felt that 10 years in data processing was enough and that he did not want to renew his contract when it expired this September. SNI was doing better than many others in the computer business, Mr von Pierer claimed. New mid-range products had been well received. Volume sales of personal computers had doubled, although the business was still suffering from falling prices. The company's problems stemmed from the culture clash when Siemens and Nixdorf were merged in 1990. Those problems had been compounded in the intervening period by a collapse in the industry worldwide and by the impact of recession, Mr von Pierer said. As reported last November, group pre-tax profit for the last financial year fell 9 per cent to DM2.9bn and net income increased marginally to DM1.98bn. According to Mr Baumann, earnings from operating businesses excluding investment income dropped 8 per cent. During the first quarter of the new year, foreign orders rose 33 per cent to DM13.2bn, but only 8 per cent when adjusted to allow for the distorting effects of booking large Asian contracts and the first-time inclusion of the Osram Sylvania lighting business in the US. The domestic order book, which is heavily dependent on public contracts, fell by 6 per cent to DM8.2bn. Details of new orders booked for the last financial year, which were released yesterday, showed clear signs of the recession and of reduced government spending, particularly in Germany. Demand for public communications, the group's biggest single business, fell 7 per cent to DM13.4bn after rising by 10 per cent the previous year. The KWU power generation division booked an increase of only 1 per cent, while automation equipment slipped  1/8 per cent, demonstrating the effects of reduced capital investment by industrial customers. Government figures published earlier this week showed that west German spending on new plant and equipment fell by almost 15 per cent last year. However, fast-growing businesses such as private communications and the group's railway operations, showed increased orders of 15 per cent and 25 per cent respectively. Mr von Pierer, who described last year's figures as respectable in the light of the business environment, claimed the group would emerge stronger from recession. Programmes for increased productivity and for shortened product cycles had been introduced. Siemens also planned to hire engineering graduates on a part-time basis. 'Employment restrictions must not be allowed to interrupt the ongoing process of recruiting highly qualified graduates,' Mr von Pierer said. Lex, Page 20 World stock markets, Back Page</p>

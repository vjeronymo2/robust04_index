			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Iraq/UN talks dominate oil market THE EYES of the world's oil traders remained fixed on New York this week as United Nations and Iraqi representatives continued negotiations there on the proposed Dollars 1.6bn one-off sale of oil to pay for humanitarian aid. As the threat of this untimely influx into an already oversupplied market was perceived first to wane and then to wax prices for the commodity responded accordingly. At London's International Petroleum Exchange this resulted in a welcome boost to business, with daily turnover on the crude oil market peaking on Wednesday at 61,738 lots, the highest level since the mid-January allied strikes against Iraqi missile sites. The market began the week in a cautiously bullish mood, encouraged by reports that the New York talks had become deadlocked over the weekend. The resulting upturn lasted for a few days, lifting the IPE's September contract from last Friday's Dollars 16.80 a barrel to Dollars 17.23, before the trend was abruptly reversed on Wednesday night by news that the negotiators were thrashing out a draft agreement for submission to Baghdad. The ensuing fall sent the price down to Dollars 16.35 a barrel at one stage, but it recovered to reach Dollars 16.84 in late trading yesterday, up four cents on the week. The UN/Iraq talks are to resume next week, though the precise date remains unspecified. While clearance for the proposed sale would clearly be bearish in itself it would at least end the present uncertainty, which some oil dealers believe is preventing the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries from addressing the more fundamental problem of above-quota production within its ranks. Excess supply is an equally familiar problem in the copper market and one that this week appeared to return to its rightful prominence following the recent technically-inspired rally. The downtrend that set in on Friday of last week continued unabated in the first half of this week, taking the three months delivery price at the London Metal Exchange down to Dollars 1,861 a tonne at one stage. Technical factors then reasserted themselves to some extent and the price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,914 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 60 down on the week and Dollars 106 below the three-month peak reached before last Friday's sell-off. The technical supply tightness that pushed prices to last week's highs and lifted them from this week's lows is reflected in a very narrow cash discount against three months metal - Dollars 2.50 at last night's close, compared with a more normal Dollars 30 two months ago - and that is worrying the exchange's management. Mr David King, the chief executive, told members this week that the LME board was concerned about the situation. That was taken as a clear early warning that a move into substantial 'backwardation'  -where nearby positions command a premium over forwards - could prompt some form of exchange intervention. Backwardation is usual in periods of severe supply shortage, but with the exchange's registered warehouse stocks now close to a 15-year high it would raise suspicions of market manipulation. Other LME contracts were undermined by copper's weakness, notably aluminium, which closed yesterday at Dollars 1,208.50 a tonne for three months delivery, down Dollars 36 on the week, and zinc, the three months price of which was Dollars 32 down at Dollars 940.50 a tonne. News yesterday of a serious explosion at Metaleurop's 250,000-tonnes-a-year lead/zinc complex at Noyelles-Godault, France, did little to boost prices of either metal. The three months LME lead price closed unchanged on the day at Dollars 404.75 a tonne, down Dollars 7.75 on the week. Meanwhile the three months nickel price was pushed to a fresh six-year low of Dollars 5,057.50 a tonne, down Dollars 210 on the week, after news of a further big rise in LME stocks. At the London bullion market the gold price, having last week demonstrated its inability to break decisively through the Dollars 400-a-troy-ounce barrier, this week reluctantly accepted Dollars 395 an ounce as the top of its present range. In the process it seemed to have lost the good opinion of the speculators who had driven it to a post-Gulf War peak and an increasing number of analysts were talking in terms of how low far the price could slip rather than how high it might rise. Silver continued to hold up well, however. A mid-week dip to Dollars 4.97 1/2 an ounce was shrugged off as New York buyers returned and the price ended the week three cents up at Dollars 5.06 1/2 an ounce. At the London Commodity Exchange robusta coffee futures built on the uptrend started two weeks ago by the agreement among Latin American producers to retain 20 per cent of their exports from the start of October as frost fears in Brazil encouraged the more bullish sentiment. But the frosts failed to materialise and prices backtracked towards the end of the week. At yesterday's close the September futures position, which had peaked on Tuesday at Dollars 1,016 a tonne, stood at Dollars 977 a tonne, down Dollars 4 on the week. Cocoa traders began to take a less sceptical view of constructive supply/demand factors this week and nearby futures climbed to 19-month highs at one point. The September position was trimmed back by Dollars 8 to Pounds 767 a tonne yesterday, following an overnight downturn in New York, but that was still Pounds 3 up on the week.  -------------------------------------- LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS (As at Thursday's close) tonnes  -------------------------------------- Aluminium     +2,250  to  1,920,600 Copper        -1,175  to  456,825 Lead          +1,675  to  263,925 Nickel        +2,382  to  95,772 Zinc          +3,350  to  706,100 Tin              -15  to  20,425  --------------------------------------</p>

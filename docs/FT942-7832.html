			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / Ashdown puts poll at heart of platform Mr Paddy Ashdown yesterday put the pledge of a referendum on further moves towards European integration at the centre of the Liberal Democrats' European election platform. Launching a manifesto designed to appeal to disaffected Tory voters, the Liberal Democrat leader underlined his party's support for the goal of a single European currency and increased integration on defence. But he said Britain should retain a veto over executive decisions on monetary and strategic defence policy by the Council of Ministers. This would be in the context of an extension of qualified majority voting to areas such as troop deployments and Common Agricultural Policy reform. At an upbeat press conference Mr Ashdown was at pains to adopt a balanced stance, saying a single currency would have disadvantages as well as advantages and insisting that Britain would retain its right not to have soldiers committed to specific conflicts. Commenting on the manifesto's pledge to seek 'popular assent' if the 1996 intergovernmental conference proposed 'fundamental changes', he said there were 'nine chances in 10' that a referendum would be the appropriate mechanism. Yesterday's 28-page document called for an independent central bank but mentions a single currency only once, saying the party would 'move in step with Britain's European partners' towards this goal. It takes a similarly measured tone on employee rights. It says: 'We want to see an effective framework of individual employment rights throughout Europe, while rejecting the centralised straitjacket of a European-wide minimum wage or maximum 35-hour week.' On the reform of EU institutions, it calls for cuts in the size of the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European parliament. But it says the parliament should be given equal legislative rights to the council. The manifesto insists that Britain's right not to have defence forces committed to combat must be maintained, but makes clear that, even if it exercised this right, Britain would have to help pay for its EU partners to deploy their troops. What the document has to say on defence will be scrutinised particularly carefully by the Tories in light of the strong Liberal Democrat challenge anticipated in south-west England, which is highly dependent on defence. On the environment, the party would seek to enforce the principle that polluters should pay for the damage they cause, as well as extending the powers of the European Environment Agency. It would phase out existing nuclear power stations by the year 2020 and 'rapidly develop' alternative power sources, such as wind, wave and tidal power.</p>

			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec ministers see no need to discuss output Oil ministers from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meet in Vienna today for talks that promise to be at least relaxed, if not amicable. Delegates, including Mr Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said last night that there was no need to discuss output quotas or prices. A sharp rise in oil prices over the past three months has taken much pressure off the ministers, who are not expected to tamper with last March's decision to set the Opec production ceiling at 24.52m barrels day for the remainder of the year. Iran has recently signalled its desire to see Opec add to the momentum of recent price increases, which have taken the Benchmark Brent Blend from a low of about Dollars 13 a barrel in February to its present level of Dollars 16.50. But analysts suggest that Opec could send a strong signal to the markets by simply cancelling its next informal meeting in September. Saudi Arabia, the cartel's biggest producer, says it sees no need for another meeting before November, when the organisation must hold a formal conference. Traders say a cancellation would be interpreted as confirmation that Opec was determined to stick to the present ceiling, even if international oil demand rose further as a result of more robust economic activity in the industrialised countries. Opec has recently revised upwards its estimate of 1994 demand for its oil, to an average of 24.8m barrels a day, up 40,000 b/d from last month's forecast. The committee that oversees Opec output yesterday expressed satisfaction that member states were generally adhering to their quotas. The report said estimates from selective secondary sources indicated production for May at 24.87m barrels a day. That is about 250,000 barrels higher than the revised April average of 24.65m. The main issue on Opec's agenda is the election of a new secretary general to replace the outgoing Dr Subroto of Indonesia. Dr Subroto yesterday said that he would be prepared to extend his term if, as seems likely, delegates failed to reach unanimous agreement on a replacement. But he said he would not be interested in serving for just a few more months, preferring instead to extend his term for at least a year.</p>

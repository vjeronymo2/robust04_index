			<p><P> August 7, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CHAMBER MUSIC FROM THE L.A. PHILHARMONIC INSTITUTE  </P> <P> Finely honed ensemble playing may be too much to expect from ad hoc collections  of young musicians. They can, however, revel earnestly in the sort of repertory  seldom heard outside such gatherings, as members of the Los Angeles  Philharmonic Institute did Friday evening at Schoenberg Hall.  </P> <P> A squad of eight cellists and soprano Elissa Johnston reminded us of  Villa-Lobos' wonderful scores for cellos with an energetically scrappy account  of the "Bachianas Brasileiras" No. 5. Johnston supplied both soaring purity and  insinuating zest, straitjacketed and overwhelmed at times by Lynn Harrell's  awkward conducting and his pressing little band.  </P> <P> Harrell, the institute's artistic director, also joined pianist Stephen Hough  in an unscheduled demonstration of eloquent personal artistry. The veteran  cellist brought the simple virtues of tone control and direct sentiment to bear  on transcriptions of two Schubert songs, "An die Musik" and "Nacht und Traum."  </P> <P> Hough, who had played the "Emperor" Concerto the night before at the Hollywood  Bowl, also collaborated with violinists Helen Nightengale and Amanda Yules,  violist Vincent Phelan and cellist Amanda Forsyth in Dvorak's familiar Quintet  in A. Theirs was a performance veering from startling technical crudity to  moments of real magic, all marked by a high seriousness and vigor.  </P> <P> Nine of the institute wind players provided the concert's best ensemble work in  Gounod's "Petite Symphonie," and unconducted at that. They dealt generously  with both the lyrical effusions and the circus music impulses, in a brisk,  balanced reading. JOHN HENKEN  </P></p>

			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Pre-Budget moves to b&amp;b - A practice which appears to have gained in popularity The London stock market may be wallowing like a rudderless ship, but down in the engine room investors are quietly shifting funds in case a well loved loophole is plugged in next week's budget. Dealers who closely follow the patterns of share trading have noted that the number of 'bed and breakfast' deals has risen dramatically over the past few weeks. These trades generally involve placing stock shortly before the close of the session and buying it back the next morning to establish a tax loss - hence its potential interest to the Chancellor. On one day last week, daily volume was boosted by 60m shares, about a tenth of the turnover, after large blocks of FT-SE 100 stocks appeared on the Seaq automated quotation system first thing in the morning. And on Tuesday some 13m shares in second line stocks went through the dealing screens. Both were believed to represent one half of this evocative but obscure practice. Opinion is divided, however, on the reasons for the increase. And establishing motivation is made more difficult by the shadowy legal nature of the practice. In the words of the Stock Exchange: 'The question is not so much whether it is illegal but whether it is allowable under tax regulations.' The pointer to a bed and breakfast deal is often a large block of shares recorded just before the close of dealing at below the market price and known in the trade as 'a 1629'. The following morning a similar block of shares with matching price and size will show up. These trades are made to mitigate the effects of capital gains tax. If there is no link between the sale and the repurchase they are perfectly legal. Mr Paul Franklin, of the Inland Revenue, said: 'We have no objection to a general disposal followed by an acquisition as long as they reflect the market value. If they don't, an inspector will look at them.' The Stock Exchange concurs. 'As far as we are concerned we don't know if the bargain is bought back the next day. The rules are that they have to be booked near the market price.' In other words, if the transaction constituted price manipulation it would be breaking the rules. Marketmakers say the fact that deals are often slightly below the market price can be explained by the size of the trade compared with the normal market size and the general liquidity of the stock. Because of the sensitive nature of bed and breakfasts, securities houses will not comment officially on their involvement. And none will admit to agreeing both sides of the deal, that would constitute a 'scheme'. One senior dealer said: 'Legally they don't exist but technically they do happen. The whole subject is such a hot potato we would rather remain in the background.' One insider at UBS, the Swiss-owned securities house, said business had grown because a number of institutional clients were concerned that the Chancellor would stop the practice. 'The rumour often rears its head around Budget time. It may not be founded on anything but there has been more worry around this year.' He added: 'I am not really sure how the Chancellor can stop people buying or selling shares and establishing a tax loss.' It is also possible that much of the business might merely reflect prudent cash management. The stock market has fallen by about 9 per cent since its highs at the start of the year. If Mr Clarke is going to bare his teeth, investors might feel that now is as good a time as any to make the best possible use of capital gains tax allowances.</p>

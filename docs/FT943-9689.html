			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Johannesburg SE curbs eased The Johannesburg Stock Exchange yesterday announced moves toward market deregulation, including a detailed timetable for removing barriers which have prevented banks and foreign companies owning local brokers. The JSE, the 11th largest in the world by market capitalisation, is to be restructured to 'meet the needs of the new South Africa,' its president, Mr Roy Anderson, said. Banks and foreign companies will be able to take a 30 per cent stake in local brokers as soon as required legislative amendments have been passed by parliament, with full ownership to be permitted 12 months later. 'The 12 months is designed to enable stockbrokers to prepare for the entry of new competitors to the market and for the JSE to amend its rules and systems to meet the needs of the new environment,' Mr Anderson added. Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive officer of South Africa's financial markets watchdog, the Financial Services Board, said yesterday draft legislation was 'ready to go' and could be ready for discussion in parliament in 'two to three months'. The JSE has been under heavy pressure to permit banks to own brokerages, with the Congress of South African Banks threatening recently to establish a second exchange if deregulation of the JSE is not implemented within 12 to 18 months. The JSE said yesterday it remained opposed to any move to switch from the current system of single trading capacity, where brokers act on behalf of buyers and sellers, to dual capacity where brokers act not only as agents but principals. It would 'reluctantly' adopt dual trading capacity only if a second, dual-capacity exchange were opened in competition, or if foreign exchange controls were lifted, a move which would improve liquidity in the market and reduce the risk of price manipulation.</p>

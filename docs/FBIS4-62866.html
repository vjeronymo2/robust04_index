			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [AZERTADZH report: "New Stage in Resolution of the Conflict: </F> Special CSCE Mission in Baku"]    [Text] Urgent matters connected with a resolution of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict and the elimination of its  consequences were discussed at a meeting between Geydar Aliyev,  president of Azerbaijan, and Jan Eliasson, chairman of the CSCE  Nagornyy Karabakh Minsk Group, his deputy Matias Mosberg, and  Vladimir Kazimirov, ambassador at large of the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation and plenipotentiary  representative of the president of Russia.    The present meeting in Baku essentially signifies, in the  opinion of the head of the Azerbaijani state, the start of a new  stage in a settlement of the conflict. He believes that the  Minsk Group of the CSCE has as of late enlarged the scope of its  activity and has been adopting a more realistic approach to the  possibilities of a resolution of the problem, relying on the  efforts of all its member countries. There was a positive  assessment here of the interaction of the CSCE Minsk Group and  Russia, specifically this country's Foreign Ministry, aimed at a  resolution of the conflict. According to the president of  Azerbaijan, "this may be considered a new qualitative level of  the peacemaking process."    As Geydar Aliyev emphasized, there is no more important aim  currently than a search for the most acceptable resolution of  this complex problem. He expressed confidence that all  interested parties would act in this direction. The president  shared the opinion of Jan Eliasson and Vladimir Kazimirov  concerning the importance of a cease-fire as an indispensable  condition of the settlement process. "I believe that a  cease-fire should be followed by specific practical actions  which culminate in the immediate withdrawal of the Armenian  armed formations from the occupied territories and the  implementation of the program specified in CSCE documents," the  head of the Azerbaijani state noted, in particular. He expressed  the conviction that these stages should be continuous. Only in  this case can, in his opinion, real results in a settlement of  the conflict be achieved.    Geydar Aliyev evaluated Azerbaijan's signing of the Bishkek  Protocol, which has been greeted ambivalently in the Republic,  as a "correct step" leading to a cease-fire and the creation of  the conditions for the realization of active practical measures  to achieve long-term and stable peace in the region. The basis  for this exists, he maintained, things are quiet currently in  the conflict zone. It is now a question, he emphasized, of  consolidating this achievement with the assistance of  international observers, who should put under supervision the  processes of demilitarization and the withdrawal of the forces  of occupation. This, the president of Azerbaijan observed, would  give everyone confidence in the irreversibility of the  peacemaking process.    Minsk Group Chairman Jan Eliasson, who spoke at the meeting,  declared that a settlement of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict  at its present, highly dramatic, stage would require the  exceptional and swift actions of all interested parties.  According to him, there is a great risk of the wrong path being  taken. At the same time the opportunities for the adoption of  serious and important decisions are just as significant, but  this, the diplomat believes, presupposes the unification of all  peacemaking efforts.    As Jan Eliasson emphasized, it is essential to do two things  -- achieve and consolidate a cease-fire and establish  international observers' supervision of observance of the  armistice process. The chairman of the Minsk Group announced  that last week he had had a "good meeting" with Andrey Kozyrev,  minister of foreign affairs of Russia, and Vladimir Kazimirov,  ambassador at large of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the  Russian Federation, on the creation of a "joint monitoring  structure."    We are even now, Jan Eliasson declared, practically prepared  to send to the conflict zone the first small group of  international observers. When, however, official opportunities  are afforded, we can then, he observed, track the sequence of  the peacemaking process.    At the same time the chairman of the Minsk Group emphasized  that he had to be sure that the process, once begun, would not  be frozen in the cease-fire phase. Having cited phased progress  as the main principle of the settlement process, the diplomat  emphasized the need for "strong connections" between each stage,  in the form, for example, of a timetable for the withdrawal of  the troops or the elaboration of confidence-building measures.  He had the day before, he said, obtained in Vienna the "full  blessing" of the CSCE for the continuation of actions to achieve  peace in the zone of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict. Jan  Eliasson also informed the president of Azerbaijan of his New  York meetings in the UN Security Council and with the secretary  general of the community of nations, at which ways of achieving  peace in the region were discussed.    Vladimir Kazimirov, plenipotentiary representative of the  president of Russia for a peace settlement in Nagornyy Karabakh,  evaluated today's meeting as a very important event. It is no  accident, therefore, he stressed, that the attention of the  world community and all people of good will interested in an end  to the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict is focused on it at this  time.    As the ambassador maintained, the "risks of peace" are being  weighed at this time. "And it is essential to reduce these risks  to a minimum, the prospect of a continuation of the bloodshed  should be  jettisoned, in any event," the diplomat emphasized.    Vladimir Kazimirov expressed satisfaction that preference  had  been given the concept whereby the peacemaking process begins  with a cease-fire. And this, he believes, is dictated not only  by humanitarian, but also practical considerations since it  would be difficult otherwise to resolve the problems that have  built up over six years of the conflict. The main thing now, he  observed, is to prevent the detachment of the cease-fire and the  cessation of hostilities from the next stage, that is, to  prevent a freezing of the situation. "We need to ensure the  integrity of the settlement process, and a precise sequence of  actions must be not a promise but the dependable undertaking of  all parties to the conflict," the ambassador at large  emphasized. In his view, this could be secured by a strong  political agreement, which would require the parties to observe  it and on which the world community could count with a certain  degree of confidence."    According to Vladimir Kazimirov, the main purpose of the  Russian side as a mediator is to contribute to not so much a  rapid as a dependable settlement of the conflict.    Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Council of  Azerbaijan,  State Councillor Vafa Gulizade, Minister of Foreign Affairs  Gasan Gasanov, Nizami Bakhmanov, leader of the Azerbaijani  community of Nagornyy Karabakh, and Azerbaijani and foreign  diplomats took part in the meeting.    Upon the conclusion of the negotiations the CSCE mediating  mission left for Yerevan.</p>

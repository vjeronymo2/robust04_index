			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 10 May (DPA) -- Shortages and material  limitations, which have gotten worse since the beginning of the  1990's, prompt Cuban citizens to escape the island, according to  a poll carried out by a Havana University branch. "This  situation increases the dissatisfaction of potential illegal  emigrants and magnifies their individual and professional  frustrations," the Political Alternatives Studies Center has  indicated.    The study is based on a poll carried out among people who  tried to escape the island. Sixty percent of the people polled  alleged that they had tried to escape because of economic  reasons associated to material needs in the housing and consumer  areas. The results of the study published today indicate that  54.7 percent of the people said they wanted to emigrate to the  United States due to personal aspirations; 28.4 percent  mentioned the search for personal freedom; and 16.3 percent  cited family reasons. One of the family-related reasons given  by the people polled was to alleviate their economic status in  the United States because they did not think Cuba had the proper  conditions for establishing a family. They also cited reasons  related to family reunification.    The poll revealed that 31 percent of the people interviewed  had expressed differences or dissatisfaction with the Cuban  political-social program. In this sense, "they judged the  economic policy to be inadequate and underscored problems other  than the ones brought about by the special period, such as the  depreciation of work, the handling of religious beliefs, and the  existence of marked social inequalities." The fact that the  people polled hoped to find a network of relatives and friends  who would welcome them abroad was another factor in their  decision to abandon the island, the Havana University branch  pointed out.    A recent U.S. Coast Guard Service report recently published  in Havana revealed that 2,173; 2,557; and 3,656 Cubans had  reached the coast of Florida in 1991, 1992, and 1993,  respectively. Meanwhile, the official BOHEMIA magazine revealed  that there had been 5,597, 7,053, and 10,579 foiled escape  attempts during that same period.</p>

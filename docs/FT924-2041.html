			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Tiphook lifts interim dividend in spite of pre-tax profits fall TIPHOOK, the freight container and trailer rental company, yesterday raised its interim dividend 11.4 per cent in spite of a fall in profits. Pre-tax profits fell 10 per cent from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 35.2m in the six months to October 31. The container division performed well but the trailer rental division was affected by UK recession and a weakening in Germany. Mr Robert Montague, chairman, said the second half of the year, which is the more important, had started well with signs of improvement in the UK. 'We're going to have the best Christmas for two years,' he said. The dividend increase, from 4.4p to 4.9p, was a continuation of Tiphook's policy of raising dividends now that a period of heavy capital expenditure has been largely completed. The increase, which followed a 25 per cent rise last year, lifted Tiphook's volatile shares 10p to 294p, compared with this year's high of 476p. Turnover increased 6 per cent to Pounds 170.7m while operating profits grew less than 1 per cent to Pounds 62m. The container division's sales increased 11 per cent to Pounds 94.6m, helped by strong growth in intra-Asian trade. But operating profits increased only 3 per cent to Pounds 45.6m. Rental rates were steady, but delays integrating new capacity led to a 3 per cent fall in utilisation rates to 85 per cent. The trailer rental division was hit by lower utilisation rates because of recession but rental rates improved 9 per cent. The division incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.8m compared with a profit of Pounds 300,000. Tiphook's rail freight division reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 400,000, which included a Pounds 600,000 provision against Charterail, the private freight operator which collapsed in August. Net borrowings increased more than Pounds 150m to Pounds 828.3m. More than Pounds 100m of the rise was because of higher US dollar conversion rates following sterling's fall. The gearing ratio increased from 2.8 times to 3 times shareholders funds but remained 'comfortably' within banking requirements, the company said. Interest charges increased 12 per cent to Pounds 26.9m, with interest cover falling from 2.6 times to 2.3 times. Earnings per share fell from 26.1p to 22.4p. Capital expenditure is expected to be Pounds 90m this year, compared with Pounds 228m last year. Lex, Page 16; London SE, Page 40</p>

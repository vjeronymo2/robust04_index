			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Atlantic Computers collapse probed An investigation is to be held into the conduct of certain accountants and companies connected with the collapse of Atlantic Computers in 1990. The probe follows the report into the collapse by the Department of Trade and Industry. In 1988 Atlantic was acquired by British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings. Both later collapsed, with Atlantic owing Pounds 279m. If counsel for the accountancy profession's Joint Disciplinary Scheme finds grounds for a complaint a tribunal will be set up to hear evidence and publish a report - only then would members or companies be named.</p>

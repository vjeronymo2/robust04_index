			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOREMAN VS. TYSON HAS DEADLY POTENTIAL  </P> <P> I'm still not impressed. George Foreman, boxing blob that he is, has yet to  fight anyone that wasn't over the hill, overweight, overrated or simply a  stiff.  </P> <P> Aside from his quick KO of an aging Ken Norton, and the best low blow of the  century (Hello, Larry!), Gerry Cooney's only claim to fame is that he is big  and white.  </P> <P> Before Foreman gets a shot at Mike Tyson, investigate. Then, if he's cleared,  make Foreman fight a real boxer. Somebody in the top 10, and I don't mean age  bracket.  </P> <P> Finally, let Foreman and Tyson go at it. And give the bloodthirsty public what  it really wants to see.  </P> <P> A death in the ring.  </P> <P> GARY MIEREANU, Northridge  </P></p>

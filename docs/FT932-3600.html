			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Cambodia losers go back on their word: The ruling communists have refused to accept election results IF the United Nations fails in its Dollars 2bn mission to bring peace and democracy to Cambodia, much of the blame will be laid at the door of the Cambodian politicians who did the opposite of what they said they were going to. The opening in Phnom Penh today of the Cambodian assembly, elected in UN-organised polls last month and charged with creating a new constitution and forming a government, is overshadowed by continuing violence and threats of secession from the existing communist administration. 'We consider ourselves sports,' Mr Hun Sen, the prime minister, had said before the election. 'We are prepared to transfer everything to the winner.' But when his Cambodian People's party (CPP) won only 51 seats in the 120-member assembly, against 58 for the royalist opposition party Funcinpec, he changed his tune, claiming 'massive irregularities' in the election and refusing to recognise the results or hand over power. Over the weekend the CPP has condoned the formation of an 'autonomous zone' of seven eastern provinces. CPP-organised demonstrators have threatened UN workers and Funcinpec officials and forced the UN and Funcinpec to evacuate their civilian staff from several provincial towns. The secessionist movement, designed to press the UN and Funcinpec into meeting CPP demands, is led by senior CPP officials and has been greeted with little enthusiasm by the public. Other factions have also performed political somersaults in response to Funcinpec's success. The extreme left-wing Khmer Rouge, which withdrew from the peace process and attacked the election as a 'cheating and dirty' means of legitimising the Vietnamese-installed CPP government, is now loftily demanding in the name of democracy that the CPP yield to Funcinpec - once a Khmer Rouge ally. Funcinpec itself, having promised to hand executive power to the erratic elder statesman Prince Norodom Sihanouk if he won the election, was appalled when he seized the initiative and attempted to form an interim government that gave the CPP equal weight with Funcinpec. Prince Ranariddh, Funcinpec leader and son of Prince Sihanouk, yesterday condemned the CPP secessionists as 'renegades', demanded that the CPP recognise the election results and raised the spectre of a renewed outbreak of civil war. 'We are ready to set up our own forces to fight and liberate that part of Cambodia, and I hope we will be supported by the world community,' he said. 'We do have arms, weapons caches in those provinces.' In fact Funcinpec is almost finished as a military force, and Prince Ranariddh's other threat is likely to carry more weight. 'I will travel around the world,' he said, 'to explain the real situation of Cambodia and ask them to clearly condemn the CPP and to freeze any aid and any support to those who are acting against the will of the Cambodian people.' Despite the animosity between the two largest parties in the assembly, the western and Asian backers of the 1991 Cambodian peace plan believe that stability will be best served by a Funcinpec-CPP coalition, if only because the CPP has the only credible Cambodian military force apart from the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. CPP support will also be needed for the passing of a new constitution in the assembly by a two thirds majority. UN officials and western diplomats are hoping that at least some CPP leaders, particularly in the armed forces, will refuse to risk further international isolation by defying the UN. Cambodia and its communist administration are broke, and soldiers are often paid months late. One of the few bargaining chips held by the UN Transitional Authority is its plan to pay soldiers and civil servants some Dollars 5m to Dollars 7m a month until a recognised government is formed.</p>

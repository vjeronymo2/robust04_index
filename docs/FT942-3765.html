			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Mediobanca rights set for approval  -Other companies Shareholders in Mediobanca, the powerful Milan merchant bank, should approve a L1,500bn (Dollars 939.8m) rights issue at their meeting in Milan today, although the exact price of the shares to be issued will not be set until next week. The shareholder assembly comes exactly two weeks after Ravenna magistrates warned top bank executives that they were under investigation for their role as advisers to the Ferruzzi-Montedison industrial group last year. Mediobanca has said it is 'bitter' about the allegations that directors conspired to issue false accounts. However, in line with its reputation for the utmost discretion, the bank is unlikely to comment further on the affair today.</p>

			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BUTCHER: HAVE A GENUINE OLD-FASHIONED BEEFSTEAK  </P> <P> "It's a great book, and knowing your affection for days gone by and sawdust on  the floor, I had to copy 'All You Can Hold . . . ' for you. Hope you enjoy this  feast as much as I did. Sincerely, Stan A."  </P> <P> It's a quote from a note from a friend; a man who knows my likes -- as far as  food is concerned -- better than any man. He also knows my shortcomings with  spelling and punctuation better than anyone: Stan has edited this column for  nearly 18 years.  </P> <P> "All You Can Hold For Five Bucks" is one chapter from a book by Joseph Mitchell  titled "McSorley's Wonderful Saloon." It describes a great gastronomic orgy  that my clan (butchers) used to indulge in on Saturday nights in New York back  around the turn of the century.  </P> <P> "The New York steak dinner, or 'beefsteak' is (was) a form of gluttony as  stylized and regional as the river-bank fish fry, the hot rock clambake, or the  Texas barbecue." It is believed to have started in the late 1800s, when  butchers from slaughterhouses on the East River would hustle choice cuts of  beef sirloin from the aging room at the plant into the kitchen of one of the  local saloons, grill the steaks over charcoal, and feast on them during their  Saturday night sprees -- washing down the beef with pints leading to quarts  that led to gallons of beer.  </P> <P> A beefsteak was a macho affair first put on by butchers, cooks and Teamsters  for butchers, cooks and Teamsters. But, by the turn of the century, beefsteaks  were being run by all manner of groups; religious, political and social.  Beefsteaks were never given or held, they were thrown or run.  </P> <P> "They were amazing functions," to quote Mitchell. "The men wore butcher aprons  and chef hats. They used the skirt of the apron to wipe grease off their faces.  Napkins were not allowed. The name of the organization that was running the  beefsteak would be printed across the bib, and the men took the aprons home for  souvenirs.  </P> <P> "In the old days they didn't even use tables and chairs. They sat on beer  crates and ate off the tops of beer barrels. You'd be surprised how much fun  that was. Somehow it made old men feel young again.  </P> <P> "There was always sawdust on the floor. The men ate with their fingers. They  never served potatoes in those days. Too filling. They take up room that  rightfully belongs to meat and beer."  </P> <P> The traditional menu at a beefsteak consisted of thin slices of ripened sirloin  served on day-old bread or toast, grilled lamb chops, sometimes grilled  kidneys, lamb or pork wrapped in bacon, and beer, lots of beer. Often the  trimmings from the beef were ground and small hamburgers were served as  appetizers.  </P> <P> There were two schools of beefsteak devotees in New York, and as is the case  with most things in "The Big Apple," they were divided geographically. You had  your East Side School and your West Side School. On the East Side, the steak  slices were served on day-old bread: "Day-old bread is essential. You can taste  the steak." The beefsteak chefs on the West Side preferred to serve the beef on  slices of toast. I think I subscribe to the West Side School.  </P> <P> The West Side School centered for years around the Old Hoboken Turtle Club,  founded in 1796 with Alexander Hamilton and Aaron Burr as charter members.  That's not why I subscribe, however -- I'm not much into politics. No, the  reason I subscribe to the West Side School is that, according to this book,  from 1879 until well into the mid 1900s, the official chef of West Side  beefsteaks was Bob Ellis. That man has got to know what he's talking about.  </P> <P> Of the East Side School, Ellis says, "What they call a beefsteak ain't no  beefsteak, it's just a mess."  </P> <P> "I'm not one of those hit-or-miss beefsteak chefs," he said. "I grill my steaks  on hickory embers. The efflorescence of seasoned hardwood is in the steak when  you eat it.  </P> <P> "Sure, I use toast. None of this day-old bread stuff for me. My beefsteaks are  genuine old-fashioned. I'm getting close to 90 years old, and I ought to know  what's old-fashioned."  </P> <P> I can't help but wonder how long that Ellis might have lived if he hadn't had  all that fun, drunk all that beer, and held -- no, I'm sorry -- thrown all  those beefsteaks.  </P> <P> Go ahead -- have a beefsteak -- a genuine old-fashioned beefsteak. You might  live to be 90, but there's no guarantee.  </P> <P> This is my version of Ellis'. If you like, serve fresh mixed green salad at a  beefsteak. Politicians used to do that on both sides of town back in the '20s  after the 19th Amendment was passed.  </P> <P> GENUINE OLD-FASHIONED BEEFSTEAK  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon black pepper  </P> <P> 1 top sirloin steak, about 2 1/2 to 3 inches thick  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> 12 to 16 slices French bread, toasted  </P> <P> Mix together salt and pepper and sprinkle liberally on both sides of steak.  (Salt creates crust that holds juices in.)  </P> <P> Grill over coals or broil to desired degree of doneness (130 degrees for medium  rare). Place on cutting board that has trencher to catch juices and let stand 5  minutes.  </P> <P> Melt butter in saucepan, then add Worcestershire. Slice steak into very thin  slices on diagonal.  </P> <P> Arrange toast slices on 1 or more large platters. Put 1 or 2 slices beef steak  on each slice of toast. Stir meat drippings from carving into pan with butter  and Worcestershire, then pour 1 to 2 tablespoons butter sauce over each toast  slice with meat. Serve with mugs of beer. Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev -- An agreement on the "development of military  cooperation between Ukraine and Austria" was signed on 16 May  during a visit to Ukraine by Austrian Defense Minister Werner  Fasslabend. It envisages an exchange of experience in the area  of military construction, cooperation in training special UN  troops, and setting up information links between the two  countries.    At a news conference on 16 May, Ukrainian Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy said that "being a non-nuclear and nonaligned  country, Austria is very close to Ukraine. But the concept of  "neutrality" today requires clarification. In conditions of  regional instability, noninterference in existing conflicts  would be incomprehensible."    Werner Fasslabend noted that "the aim of his visit was to  learn about Ukraine's experience in military building since the  stability of other countries created stability in Europe."</p>

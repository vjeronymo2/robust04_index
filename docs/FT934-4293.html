			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: A deep suspicion, not trust, of benchmarks Sir, What an interesting article by John Cuthbert ('Put your trust in benchmarks', November 27-28). It has become my experience over the years that the top unit trusts are out there waiting for me to invest. Receipt of my money is their signal to leap off the cliff into obscurity, cackling insanely. Their 'health warning' should surely read: 'The value of your investment may plummet. . .' But in the end the article disappointed. Unless you (or someone clever like you) were to publish and maintain a risk/benefit benchmark table along the lines of that suggested, the average decaying simpleton like me will be no better off. I hope you will decide to help. In these parts standard deviations are looked upon with deep suspicion. I don't allow them in the house, and if I find one in the garden I stamp on it smartly with my green wellies. W S Bainbridge, 48 School Lane, Ashurst Wood, East Grinstead, East Sussex RH19 3QP</p>

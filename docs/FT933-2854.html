			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / International Company News: Reebok fires two agencies REEBOK International, the US athletic shoe and apparel manufacturer, has fired its two main advertising agencies and consolidated its entire Dollars 140m advertising account with Leo Burnett Co of Chicago. The dismissal of the New York office of Chiat/Day and Euro RSCG of London follows a disappointing sales performance by Reebok in the second quarter. In the period, Reebok - whose current advertising features US basketball star Shaquille O'Neal - experienced a 3.5 per cent fall in worldwide footwear sales and a 9.5 per cent drop in the US. Net revenue fell to Dollars 657.6m, against Dollars 701.9m in the 1992 quarter. Meanwhile, sales by arch-rival Nike have climbed. The company said it had decided to consolidate the business at Burnett to take advantage of its worldwide network of 55 offices in 40 countries. 'We need the strength of a global agency,' the company explained. Burnett previously handled the Reebok brand in Latin America and Asia, with estimated advertising billings of Dollars 20m.</p>

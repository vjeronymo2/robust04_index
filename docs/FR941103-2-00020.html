			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Onsite personnel would not be exposed to unique hazards and would be adequately protected from potential exposure to radionuclides or other hazards by the existing health and safety programs. Existing facility design features would reduce direct worker contact with radioactive materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The formation of dioxins from Glass Melter operation would be virtually precluded due to specific technological design features of the equipment. For instance, the elevated operating temperatures of the Glass Melter would result in a high destruction and removal efficiency (99.9999% in test burns). In addition, the rapid cooling of the offgases below dioxin-forming temperatures, as recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency for municipal waste incinerators, would also be used to preclude dioxin formation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The worst reasonably foreseeable accident involving the Glass Melter would be a fire on the loading dock that would result in the complete vaporization of the contents of ten mixed waste storage drums. The estimated frequency of such an accident is once every 100,000 years. The effective dose equivalent to the maximally exposed individual [approximately 200 m (220 yd) downwind] would be 0.2 mrem, well below Environmental Protection Agency standards. The environmental assessment shows that the health risk from such exposures would be very small. Predicted concentrations of nonradiological pollutants would meet the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency's maximum acceptable ground-level concentrations. Taking account of the low probability of such an event and the small magnitude of the consequences, the health risk posed by the accident is insignificant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No endangered species, critical habitats, floodplains, wetlands, or historical or archaeological resources would be affected by the proposed action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternatives Considered: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the environmental assessment, DOE considered two onsite alternatives to the proposed action and seven offsite alternatives in the context of the original proposed action (i.e., assuming the continuing operation of the Mound Plant). The discussion below, however, while being based on the environmental assessment, reflects the current proposed use of the Glass Melter following DOE's decision to close the Plant, which is to treat only mixed waste backlog.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> No Action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The present practices of waste storage and disposal would continue and the Glass Melter would not be used. Most of the mixed waste backlog is liquid, and much of it is combustible. Storage of the untreated waste, therefore, could adversely impact human health and the environment, especially in the case of a fire in the storage facility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Administrative Action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Another alternative would be to rely upon the established Mound Waste Minimization and Pollution Prevention program to identify, screen, and analyze options to reduce the generation of waste. Waste that is in storage would not be affected by this program. The need for treatment options would persist.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Offsite Treatment and Disposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These alternatives would involve the transportation of mixed wastes to designated sites. DOE considered seven options for offsite treatment. All of the offsite treatment alternatives (i.e., all offsite alternatives except the Nevada Test Site) would involve thermal treatment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> Quadrex HPS, Inc. (Gainesville, FL) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> . This commercial facility cannot accept certain of the Mound mixed wastes, so this alternative would not, by itself, address the need to treat such wastes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

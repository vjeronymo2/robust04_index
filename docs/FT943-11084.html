			<p>940802 FT  02 AUG 94 / Market pioneers fear MMM fall-out: Securities firms warn of over-regulation in Russian market after pyramid hysteria Bankers and dealers nursing Russia's fledgling securities market fear the scandal engulfing the finance house MMM will persuade the government to overregulate the market. It was not lack of market regulation, they say, but the elementary nature of the regulation that was partly responsible for the threatened collapse of a company in which millions have invested their savings. Mr Maxim Boyko, chairman of Russia's privatisation agency, said yesterday the government had learnt its lesson. 'From now on, it'll intervene in similar schemes. People will be cautious and think twice before investing their money.' He called for a ban on dozens of similar shady schemes which have lured investors. Russian officials have asked the MMM chairman, Mr Sergei Mavrodi, to a meeting tomorrow to try to sort out legal tangles surrounding the firm's troubles. He is to face officials from the finance ministry and the state anti-monopoly committee, according to Itar-Tass news agency. Officials also want MMM to register its shareholders and audit its activities 'to give the public a better idea of what is going on with the company', Tass said. MMM, which still refuses to announce its own death, op-ened some of its Moscow kiosks yesterday - but was only selling, not buying, shares at Rbs1,125. The crowd around the headquarters in suburban Moscow thinned - possibly due to the organisation of a union of MMM shareholders whose chairman, Mr Vladimir Poluektov, said branches were being set up 'at lightning speed'. Negotiations began between the union and company for repayment of those in most need, such as invalids and pensioners: the company has promised to refund them at the shares' high of Rbs115,000. Of 11 such applications processed yesterday, one asked for assistance to bury a man whose relatives had invested all their savings in MMM. Though little else has been the subject of conversation for the past 10 days, and the cabinet devoted a full meeting last Thursday to discussing it, MMM and similar miracle share schemes continue to operate and advertise. MMM was not the first in the market: companies named Tibet and Chara were offering huge mark-ups on their shares before it appeared, and a company named TeleMarket has aggressively entered the market in recent months. All appear to operate in the same manner: with registered offices in a (usually deserted) private flat, they offer shares which are essentially coupons with a face value redeemable at any time at the value currently quoted by the company. MMM is thought to be a classic pyramid operation: where money deposited by the many buying into the company's success funds the higher prices paid to the fewer cashing in their shares - a process that can continue until the influx of investors dries up or, as in the case of MMM, investors' confidence is shaken and a run on the company begins. The longer term consequences of the crash in the value of the shares last week - from Rbs115,000 to Rbs1,000 - is not thought to have greatly affected the behaviour of the larger Russian or foreign investors playing the increasingly active Russian stock markets. 'People in the finance community have not really been talking about this as a worry, but as a source of amusement,' said Anatoly Danilitsky, a Moscow financial consultant yesterday. 'It's having very little effect on business'. 'No one I talk to would admit to buying MMM shares,' said another consultant. 'The kind of people who bought them are not those who are buying and selling through our company.' The concern, however, is elsewhere. It is fear of the reaction of a government acutely conscious some people blame it for the crash - indeed, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, has already admitted the government was at fault - and concerned to so tighten the rules in the securities market as to choke the life out of it before it can stand. 'There's good and bad in this,' said Mr Stephen Jennings of the CSFB group. 'You need regulation of the market but there's regulation which can encourage and that which can harm. You can get licensing requirements which keep out the fly-by-nights - but also it can be so framed as to keep out the new enterprises which are going to grow.' What larger Russian and foreign finance companies want to encourage is emergence of a so far elusive 'structural investor' - an individual or group that would take an engineering company making missiles or tanks and convert it to turning out cheap, state of the art consumer goods. 'I haven't seen these yet,' said the Russian consultant, 'though there is plenty of activity in the market.' Mr Andrew Balgarnie of Morgan Stanley said: 'If the banks will not act as they should by getting the funds to the businesses, then the only route is via share offerings. That's why this market is so important, and why it's so important to regulate it properly'. All companies now working in the securities markets, awash with shares because of the speed of privatisation, report growing activity by domestic and foreign investors in a steadily rising market. 'There's more money available from foreigners than there are profitable or adequate mechanisms to receive it,' said Mr Balgarnie. Financial experts see MMM as one of the rogue companies typical of the early stages of a money market - Russian commentators have likened it to the 18th century South Sea Bubble and the 19th century Panama Canal Scheme - and not as a bellwether for Russian capitalism as a whole.</p>

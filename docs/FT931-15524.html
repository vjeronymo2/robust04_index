			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Yeltsin puts allies in powerful positions MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has appointed a liberal to head the former Soviet television network and an official from the Gasprom gas monopoly as the government's chief of staff. The chief of staff is considered more powerful than any minister, including the numerous deputy prime ministers remaining in office from the previous government of Mr Yegor Gaidar. The former Gasprom official, Mr Vladimir Kvasov, replaces Mr Alexei Golovkov, a technocrat who took over the job a year ago. The appointment of Mr Vyacheslav Bragin, the head of the Russian parliament's media committee, to run the Ostankino television network, following Mr Yeltsin's summary sacking of its previous director, is intended to reassure liberal opinion in the country. The appointments are part of a reshuffle in which Mr Yeltsin is trying to balance forces favourable to himself following his confrontation with the conservative Russian parliament and his reluctant appointment of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime minister. But Mr Yeltsin's transfer of his allies in parliament to senior government posts means that he now has very few senior friends left in parliament itself, which is under the control of his most dangerous political rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Retail sales show third rise in row THE GROWING belief that economic recovery is under way in the UK was boosted yesterday by the news that retail sales rose strongly last month. At the end of a week of promising economic data, the Central Statistical Office reported that shop sales rose a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent in March compared with February, and were 4.1 per cent higher than in the same month a year ago. The year-on-year increase was the sharpest for four years. The rise in sales volumes followed a 0.1 per cent increase in February and was the third consecutive monthly rise. In the latest quarter retail sales rose by 1.6 per cent compared with the previous quarter and were 3.3 per cent higher than the same three months a year ago. The increase was more evenly distributed across the retail sectors than it was in previous months, with the non-food sector beginning to catch up. Non-food sales rose by 0.4 per cent month-on-month to stand 3.5 per cent higher than a year ago, while food sales edged higher by 0.1 per cent compared with February. The British Retail Consortium, a trade body representing more than 90 per cent of the retail industry, said it was particularly heartened by signs of increased activity in sales of goods related to the housing market, such as carpets and furniture. Sales of household goods rose by 2 per cent in the latest three months compared with the previous quarter, and were up 4.3 per cent on a year ago. Clothing and footwear sales were also higher. They increased by 1.2 per cent in the latest quarter compared with the previous one, and were 6.5 per cent higher than a year ago. The only sector to register a decline in the latest quarter was mixed retail businesses, which covers most types of department stores. Sales dropped by 0.3 per cent in the three months to March compared with the previous quarter, but were up 3.6 per cent on a year ago. The value of retail sales in March was a non-seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.65bn, 6 per cent higher than in March last year.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Company News: Gold Fields' profits drop 11% GOLD Fields of South Africa (GFSA) saw profits fall by 11 per cent in the six months to December. The results were in line with expectations and represented a creditable performance under very difficult circumstances, the company said. It expected earnings to remain under pressure, with little prospect of any short-term improvement in depressed commodity prices. Income from investments fell by 6.5 per cent to R115m (Dollars 37.4m) from R123m, while income from fees, interest and other sources dropped to R104m from R108m. Pre-tax profit was 12 per cent lower at R136m and attributable profit fell to R118m from R133m. The dividend was maintained at 70 cents per share on earnings which fell to 123 cents from 138 cents in 1991. The majority of GFSA's assets are in commodities - principally gold, lead, copper and zinc, as well as the developing platinum mine, Northam, which opens tomorrow.</p>

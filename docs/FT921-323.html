			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / International Company News: Pohjola deeper in red as foreign business suffers POHJOLA, the biggest Finnish insurance group, reported a dramatic surge in operating loss for 1991 due to heavy claims stemming from its foreign insurance business. Operating loss jumped to FM588m (Dollars 129.5m) from FM108m a year earlier, but the directors proposed paying a maintained dividend of FM1 per share. Profit from Pohjola's domestic direct insurance and reinsurance business was wiped out by underwriting losses of FM614m in its foreign insurance business  -compared with a loss of FM97m. Miss Pirkko Alitalo, director and chief financial officer, said the loss arose because foreign insurance claims were much larger than originally expected.</p>

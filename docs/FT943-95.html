			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / International Company News: US banks 'in lending frenzy' - FT Conferences A warning that US banks are in a 'feeding frenzy' to lend to large companies, and have started to sacrifice credit standards in exchange for short-term earnings, was given yesterday by Mr Richard Boyle, vice-chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. Mr Boyle told a Financial Times conference on international banking in Madrid that high levels of capital and liquidity had sharpened competition in syndicated lending. A 'lemming mentality' had returned and benchmarks of proper risk and reward 'have been replaced by the spectre of what the competition is doing', said Mr Boyle, who is in charge of credit policy at Chase. He said regulation was encouraging excess capacity. 'There has been far too little deregulation than is really needed to ensure the healthy banking environment that regulators should espouse.' Mr Michael Foley, a senior analyst at Moody's Investor Services, said that despite worries about syndicated loans, improvements in risk and portfolio management had lessened US banks' risks from credit defaults. Mr Foley said that although interest margins were likely to narrow in the long-term in the US, banks had maintained strong margins in the first half of the year despite the rise in US short-term interest rates. Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, said that banks in mature economies 'where there is high capacity in the market and a strong consumerist lobby' would have have to seek international growth. Lesser-developed countries, 'some of which are developing extremely speedily, may offer more dramatic prospects of new and profitable business but with great risk of high inflation and economic volatility'. Lord Alexander said banks were 'like chameleons: they are coloured by changing economic environments'. When the next downturn occurred, the successful banks would be those that anticipated it and adapted themselves. Derivatives losses such as those suffered by Metallgesellschaft suggested that 'a corporate treasury function would be well served by the advice of an expert banker when dealing in complex financial instruments'. Mr Emilio Botin, chairman of Banco Santander, suggested that banks could help banking regulators by jointly developing methods of measuring the impact of interest rate risks on the whole of balance sheets. Mr Botin said he could see 'no more than half a dozen' banks that could aspire to being truly global, but other banks could diversify their risks and find new businesses through internationalisation. He said that banks could develop links with telecommunications companies to create new banking products, as well as linking with insurance companies to provide 'bancassurance' products through branches. Mr Gerrit Tammes, a member of the executive board of Internationale Nederlanden Groep, said that in most European countries, banks were rapidly increasing their share of the life insurance market. There was a trend towards 'one-stop shopping' for financial services from a single provider, but many consumers had 'lost their way in the labyrinth of products, services, rules and regulations'. He said that banks' best chance of success in 'bancassurance' was in asset management. Members of ageing populations were seeking investments with higher long-term returns to substitute for state pensions. Mr Horst Kohler, president of the German Savings Banks Association, argued that the 1,500 savings banks, with 63,000 branches in Europe, were essential to maintain both competition and local distribution of capital. Many countries had discovered that large companies 'are not guarantors for either jobs or tax revenues in local regions' and savings banks provided local support to small and medium-sized enterprises. He said the local role of savings banks' made them less likely to 'seek opportunities solely in a highly detached financial sphere'. Commercial banks were at risk of 'over-concentration on pure financial business'.</p>

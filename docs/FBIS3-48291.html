			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Sumio Hirose: "City Banks: Commencing </F> Fundamental Job of Digging Up Demand for Funds"]    [Text] "Loans are really not increasing." "Results  were not greatly achieved in the first half." Howls about loans  not increasing are being raised in every city bank. Due to the  sluggish economy which has been more prolonged than expected,  all that meets their eyes is the need for non-expansionary  funds. It is a situation where the little demand for funds has  been absorbed by government affiliates. In Greek mythology, in  Hades after his death, Sisyphus, the king of Corinth, had to  roll up to the top of a mountain a rock that constantly rolled  down. The rock rolled down no matter how many times he rolled it  up. Loans today are truly the rock of Sisyphus.  <H5>  Plans Unfulfilled </H5>   The various city banks are not presenting absurd loan  increase goals such as half-year net increase of 1 trillion yen  as happened in the bubble era. At most, they say "about a 3  percent increase on a fiscal year basis." (person in charge of  domestic operations planning) It is about half the level  compared to the time of the peak of the bubble.    In performance, however, even viewing the loan trends  announced by the Bank of Japan, the figures continued to be  about 1 percent throughout the first half. Why have they been  unable to fulfill the plan? The head offices of all the banks  say in unison, "the greatest factor was that the economic  forecast scenario at the time of setting the plan was greatly  out of kilter."    In February to March this year, they had the view that "in  so  far as the summit in July and House of Councilors election are  close at hand, the government will embark on a full-scale  bolstering of the economy. Due to this, the tone of the economy  will turn to recovery in summer and thereafter, and we will  enter a complete recovery situation in the second half." (person  in charge of planning at high-ranking city bank). In reality,  however, they could not meet those expectations at all.  <H5>  Corresponding to the Loan Spread </H5>   Of course, those on the scene did not sit and wait because  the economy is bad. In the meantime, they offered loan terms  less than short-term prime if they were to make the most of  lending spread with market interest as the base. Moreover, if  they incorporated a yen-yen swap in this, low interest, medium-  to long-term loans on a 3 percent interest level would be  possible. With these attractive lending terms as a weapon, a  life or death sales effort centering on large corporations  developed.    However, large corporations have not changed their policy of  basically curbing borrowing. Yet it is a fact that "there were  quite a few successful cases of converting existing short-term  prime borrowing to long-term fixed borrowing or narrowing the  target to [acquire] redemption funds for such as warrant bonds  or convertible debentures." (person in charge of loan planning  at high-ranking city bank)    Loans below prime rate are taboo in so far as "once they are  executed, it takes several years to return to principal."  Consequently, banks must concentrate on spread lending other  than prime loans. In the operations office of one bank, it was  such that "in the first half, spread lending on a limited basis  accounted for 70 to 80 percent."    However, all the banks have a line up of the same kinds of  commodities. So, the next thing that happens is interest  competition by reducing the spread margin. It is said that at  one time, "excessive competition was seen such that it closely  resembled the bubble era." (city bank operations department)  However, a strong rival besides other banks exists in this  field. It is life insurers who have been troubled by fund  employment difficulties.    Voices of chagrin are heard everywhere that "regardless of  reduction in the spread margin, the level of a 0.5 percent  addition to the swap rate is our limit, no matter how much we  try. Life insurers, however, are offering an addition of 0.1 to  0.2 percent even with medium- to long-term ones with a 3 to 5  year period, and they are snatching away loan cases one by one."  (person in charge of loan planning) This life insurance  offensive, however, was conspicuous in early spring, but  recently seems to have disappeared.    Rather, those in charge at various banks vehemently say the  problem is "the government affiliates such as the Export-Import  Bank of Japan and the Japan Development Bank." It is the term  period rather than the interest level in which they are unable  to compete with government loans. That is because "with low  interest like today, an interest risk extending for a term  period of 10 years cannot be borne at all by private  institutions." (same)    Of course, that does not mean a situation is occurring where  government loans are "devouring" even existing loans by private  financial institutions. However, "the actual situation is that  while fund demand is very meager today, we are steadily pursuing  cases of 500 million yen and 1 billion yen and somehow linking  them to loans. If government affiliates continue to execute  loans of 1 billion yen or 2 billion yen on the strength of  advantageous lending terms, it inevitably will be a big threat  in a limited field." (person in charge of domestic operations  planning)  <H5>  Strengthening of Internal Bank Structure </H5>   On the other hand, what about the medium- to small-sized  business market? There is a strong feeling that they "would like  to increase loans aggressively in the medium to small market"  only to the class of customer that has a high degree of  dependency on bank borrowing. (person in charge of loan  planning) However, they "cannot steadily loan to firms with a  continued deficit." (same) If this economic situation continues,  naturally "clients to whom they can loan will be very few in  themselves."    On the other hand, it is a deadlock situation in which great  success cannot be expected in so far as other banks also are  stampeding to the few firms with favorable performance. Among  them, stories have been heard that up until last year when other  banks changed to a negative lending policy in order to reduce  assets as far as BIS measures were concerned, they contrived to  contact them and were able to skillfully take over the business,  but such examples were extremely few.    At this point, the demand for funds that is increasing is  "non-expansionary." (high-ranking bank). They are "funds for  lump sum retirement allowances due to plant closures or employee  reduction programs" or "clothing-related inventory has increased  because of the cold summer and it is borrowing to provide for  those funds." (person in charge of loan planning)    Looking back over this war situation in the first half,  there  is a move among the high ranking banks to attempt to correct  downward the plans for the second half. However, that does not  mean that they are greatly pessimistic. The move by firms to  reduce borrowing due to the collapse of liquidity in hand, which  had continued since last year, has calmed down at this point. In  so far as surplus funds have become meager on the corporate side  also, borrowing for the portion to pay off commitments should be  a necessity. The view is strong that "in the future, the loan  balance probably will not turn to a net decrease." (person in  charge of domestic operations planning)    However, it is viewed that "the results from economic  measures and the drop in the official rate will appear in the  spring of next year or thereafter at the earliest."  (high-ranking Kansai-related city bank) The fact has not changed  that demand for expansionary funds cannot be expected in the  second half.    Therefore, the various banks are prepared to deal with the  second half, strengthening loan business capability by applying  their hand to internal bank structure.    Specifically, it will be in the fashion of "raising the  weight of loans in the performance rating, or increasing public  relations personnel." (high-ranking bank) "While the economy is  sluggish, expansion of markets for sales growth, or needs for  various kinds of business information will rather increase.  Therefore, if we fully demonstrate the bank information function  and meet these customers' needs, we should be able to link it to  new acquisitions." (person in charge of loan plans)    The only way to do that is "return to the foundation of  lending operations, grasp the commodities which firms are  handling and their vendors, and steadily grasp demands for  funds." (same) Every bank firmly feels the need to look back  once more on the foundation of lending operations that was  forgotten in the bubble.</p>

			<p><P> October 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> 300 POLICE ON PARADE DUTY  </P> <P> In an effort to avoid a repetition of last year's riot, an estimated 300 police  officers have been assigned to cover the annual Halloween Parade on Hollywood  Boulevard.  </P> <P> City Councilman Michael Woo and Hollywood Division Police Capt. Rick Batson  said a command post will be set up on the boulevard from which the officers  will try to exercise greater control of the throngs of people who flock to  Hollywood for an evening of celebration.  </P> <P> "Last year, Captain Rick Batson and I stood in front of smashed windows at the  Brown Derby and vowed, 'Never Again,' " Woo said. "This year, we're putting our  police resources on the line to back up that vow."  </P> <P> An estimated 100,000 people took part in last year's celebration, which turned  ugly when a riot broke out. Nine people were injured, and 28 people were  arrested. Police said the disturbance caused about $50,000 in damages to a  dozen restaurants and stores.  </P> <P> "I expect this Halloween will be a return to normal on the boulevard, or as  close to normal as the boulevard gets," Woo said.  </P></p>

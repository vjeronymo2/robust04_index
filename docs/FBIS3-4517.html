A spokesman for the Romanian Foreign Ministry said that the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula should be a basic topic  for inter-Korean dialogue and that steps now should be taken to  ease tension in the region.    The spokesman said that any signatory to the nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty has responsibilities to comply with its  international commitment unconditionally.    Complying with the agreement between the International  Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and the DPRK, including the acceptance of  nuclear inspections, will help with the creation of peace and  security in the Korea peninsula, he said.    To this end, the talks between the DPRK, the U.S. and South  Korea must be resumed, the spokesman added.</p>

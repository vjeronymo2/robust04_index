			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Albanian Public Order Ministry in </F> Tirana on 30 April -- read by announcer]    [Text] The Public Order Ministry informs that all  religious ceremonies have been and are being held normally on  the territory of the Republic of Albania. No protest or written  or oral complaint regarding such ceremonies has been received by  this ministry.    Concerning the celebration of the Orthodox Easter in Tirana,  the ministry explains that at 1230 on 27 April 1994, Police  Commissariat No. 2 in Tirana District received a written request  from the Autocephalous Church of Albania which presented two  requests. One was for permission for a procession of clerics to  go from the church to Kavaje Street and back again. This  permission was requested for 29 April 1994 at 1900. The second  request had to do with the organization of a ceremony in the  form of a gathering, to celebrate the resurrection ritual. For  this ceremony, the construction of a tribune on the pavement in  front of Mihal Duri Factory was requested. They asked for  permission to hold this ceremony on 30 April 1994 from 2300  until 0015.    By means of an official document No. 1195/1 dated 27 April  1994, Police Commissariat No. 2 responded that the organization  of both ceremonies creates serious traffic problems on the  national road, something that can be of consequence for the  lives of the people. That is why it did not conduct security for  these two activities.    At the same time, the commissariat suggested that it was  ready to go anywhere but the national road and provide security  for the event.    Through a second document dated 28 April 1994, the  Autocephalous Orthodox Church authorities relinquished their  first demand and asked only for approval of the second request,  without presenting any protest or complaint against the police.    On 29 April 1994, the church authorities received a final  positive answer from Police Commissariat No. 2 to hold this  event. Besides this, regarding contacts between police  representatives and high church authorities, including the  archbishop, they have received only thanks from them and no  complaints.    The Public Order Ministry stresses that the religious masses  are free and no one hinders them in the Republic of Albania.  However, when a religious authority requests help from public  order authorities, they of course will give it according to  their ability to secure the event. We express our surprise and  deep indignation at the tendency of the Greek Government to  exploit even Easter Day for its political aims.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD FINANCIAL FORECAST: CLOUDY, CLEAR  </P> <P> It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Budget and trade deficits  soared -- but so did gross national product. Americans spent more than ever but  our industry became less competitive. Corporate America went on a debt-financed  merger spree -- and reported record earnings. The United States enjoyed record  economic expansion -- and became a debtor nation for the first time since World  War I. Incomes boomed, homeless filled the streets.  </P> <P> The '80s were a time of economic paradox, not just here, but worldwide.  Communism failed, capitalism triumphed -- but only if you didn't count the  Third World. The world economy grew more integrated than ever before but  protectionism also increased.  </P> <P> The outlook for the '90s? Unsettled and cloudy. The world economy contains the  seeds of a great boom and a great depression; the '90s could see either or  both. Technological progress, European integration and rising standards of  living around the Pacific Rim could bring back the good old 1960s. This was  when Americans thought average, single-income families could -- and should --  own their own homes while watching their standards of living rise every year.  </P> <P> That would be nice, but the world economy is as likely to belly-up as boom.  International cooperation can help deter trouble but the outlook is complicated  by current relationships. With U.S. prosperity still dependent on an inflow of  Japanese capital that many Americans resent, and tensions between the two  Pacific partners ratcheting up year by year, the United States and Japan could  waste the 1990s in futile but expensive trade wars.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Western Europe could be too busy picking up the pieces in the East  to care much about the rest of the world. An isolationist Europe might restrict  imports from both the United States and Asia. Instead of one dynamic world  economy, we could end up with three stagnant, quarreling blocs.  </P> <P> One other question mark hovers over the future. In most of the world, the '80s  were the decade of Thatcherism -- Reaganomics without the tax cuts. The basic  idea was to make life better for the rich in the belief that this prosperity  would "trickle down." Maybe. Historians generally (not universally; historians,  like economists, glory in contradiction) blame 1920s speculation for the Great  Depression of the '30s. The rich had plenty of money to invest, but the poor  and middle class had no money to buy.  </P> <P> There was more. International finance resembled a giant Ponzi scheme. Germany  borrowed from the United States to pay debts to Britain and France. Britain and  France used their German money to pay U.S. war debt. But when the crash came,  Americans had no more money for Germany. Without U.S. money, Germany collapsed.  Without German money, France and Britain could not pay debts.  </P> <P> Some financial historians warn that we are in danger of repeating this dismal  story, with Japan lending money to the United States so that we can service  foreign debt -- the largest, fastest-growing debt in the world. If Tokyo stock  and real-estate markets should falter -- and there are plenty of reasons why  they should -- Japanese money would dry up overnight. The shock could bring  down America's banking system, cause a new Great Depression and leave the  dollar trading one-for-one with the peso.  </P> <P> Oh well. History is not only bunk, the State Department tells us it's over.  Happy New Year.  </P></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / UK Company News: CentreGold at Pounds 4m and makes Pounds 5m acquisition CentreGold, the electronic games publisher and distributor, yesterday announced a 48 per cent increase in annual pre-tax profits and the acquisition of Core Design, an entertainment software publisher, for Pounds 5.34m. The company, which was floated in October 1993, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.03m (Pounds 2.72m) for the year to July 31. New product launch-es, higher US sales and the growing popularity of personal computer software in CD-Rom format helped the group to offset margin pressures. Turnover advanced by 34 per cent to Pounds 91.3m (Pounds 68m). On the publishing side, sales were up 62 per cent to Pounds 50.4m reflecting an increase in compact disc-based products and the launch of the group's first Nintendo video games. Publishing sales in the US more than doubled, from Pounds 7.6m to Pounds 18.8m. Overseas sales accounted for 41 per cent (24 per cent) of divisional turnover. Turnover in software distribution moved ahead by 11 per cent to Pounds 40.9m. Earnings per share increased to 7.3p (5.63p excluding new shares issued on flotation). A final dividend of 1.6p makes a total of 2.4p. Mr Geoff Brown, chief executive, said the acquisition of Core would help consolidate the group's position in software development. It reported sales of Pounds 4.74m last year. Some Pounds 2.94m of the purchase price will be paid in cash, with the balance in 2.74m shares issued to Mr Jeremy Smith, Core's managing director. CentreGold shares, which were floated at 125p, gained 16p yesterday to close at 105p. Mr Brown said that 'most investors still don't understand what we do'.</p>

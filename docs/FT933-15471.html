			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: Wang sees exit from Chapter 11 WANG Laboratories said it expected to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by the end of September. The US office computer company, which is refocusing its operations on software and services, said it planned to file an amended reorganisation scheme with the US bankruptcy court yesterday. 'Rarely, if ever, has a Chapter 11 case of this magnitude and complexity moved forward as smoothly and as rapidly,' said Mr C. Hall Swaim, counsel to the creditors' committee. Wang filed for bankruptcy protection in August 1992. The company also named a new nine-member board. Mr Michael Mee will resign as chairman when the board takes over but will remain chief financial officer. The new board will then elect another chairman. The company said the amended plan called for no additional staff reductions beyond the 3,300 job cuts announced in March. It currently employs about 6,000. Under the reorganisation, Wang's cost structure would be significantly reduced. It expects revenues of Dollars 1.24bn for fiscal 1993 and a net loss of around Dollars 199m, including restructuring charges of about Dollars 89m and reorganisation fees of about Dollars 29m. For fiscal 1992, Wang suffered a net loss from continuing operations of Dollars 358.2m , or Dollars 2.11 per share, including pre-tax restructuring and other charges of Dollars 277.3m, after a gain of Dollars 33m from the sale of real estate and pension changes. Anticipating that it would emerge from bankruptcy at the end of September, the company projected revenues of Dollars 955m for the year beginning October 1, with net profits of about Dollars 26m. Under the plan, ownership of the company would be transferred to creditors. Secured creditors would be paid in full the Dollars 50m they are owed, while unsecured creditors, owed about Dollars 1bn, would be issued 30m shares of common stock in the reorganised company. Holders of Wang class B and class C common stock would be issued seven-year warrants to purchase about 20 per cent of the new common stock. The amended plan calls for up to 12.5 per cent of the common stock in the reorganised company to be owned by Wang employees through a stock option scheme. Wang said it would continue to seek funds through a combination of internal financing, further sales of non-strategic assets and external financing. Last week it asked the court for authority to obtain a credit facility of up to Dollars 50m. The reorganisation plan must be approved by Wang's unsecured creditors and stockholders as well as the court.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Luxor, 6 Apr (MENA)--The hijacked Sudanese airliner  took off from Luxor Airport at 1600 today bound for Sudan.    The airliner was hijacked this morning on a domestic flight  from Khartoum to al-Danaqilah. The Egyptian authorities and  Armed Forces supplied the plane with fuel before it took off and  provided food and medical care to its passengers.    The passengers appreciated the good hospitality they  received  from the Armed Forces and Egyptian officials and said it was  nothing unusual from the fraternal and generous Egyptian people.    The captain of the Sudanese airliner said he would head  first  for al-Danaqilah and then proceed to Khartoum, adding that all  the passengers are well.    A Sudanese official earlier announced that the Sudanese  airliner left Luxor Airport two hours before it actually took  off.</p>

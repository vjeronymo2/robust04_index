			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Announcer] The second meeting this year between  13 journalists and politicians took place in Bratislava today.  These meetings are being organized for the third successive year  by the weekly SLOBODNY PIATOK [FREE FRIDAY]. In place of the  traditional one invited guest, today's meeting was attended by  five guests, who were representatives of nonparliamentary  political parties: the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia  [SSDS], the Christian Social Union [KSU], the Party of  Conservative Democrats [SKD], and the Party of the Green in  Slovakia [SZ]. They were represented by their leaders Jaroslav  Volf [SSDS], Jan Klepac [KSU], Pavol Hagyari [SKD] and Jozef  Pokorny [SZS]. The Hungarian Civic Party [MOS] sent its deputy  chairman Janos Toth. Our editor Ludmila Bulakova prepared for us  a digest of this debate, which lasted over an hour.    [Begin recording] [Bulakova] [passage omitted] Mr. Klepac  [KSU], what would your position be if you were in government?    [Klepac] I think it is necessary to gather enough courage  and  draw a line behind the past, but it should not be a line that  prevents us from talking about the past. [passage omitted] It is  necessary to say everything so that the citizens know why the  lustration law [passed by the former federal authorities as a  vetting system for the highest administrative, legislative, and  executive posts] is valid but not applied, why the assets of the  communist party have not been dealt with, why companies and  state organizations are still being chaired by former exponents  of the past regime, and other issues.    Mr. Meciar promised when he assumed power that he would  release a so-called white book on what happened in Slovakia. I  am surprised that this white book has not yet seen the light of  day. [passage omitted]    [Bulakova] What about you, Mr. Toth?    [Toth] I think that the minority issue is not isolated and  cannot be isolated from the social and economic dimension  wherein it exists. It is imperative to deal with the Slovak  social and economic problems; otherwise, there could be a total  collapse of the economy. Needless to say, the social  consequences of such a collapse would be incalculable. [passage  omitted] [end recording]</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / IRA again wrongfoots mainland security forces: How bombers slip through the net THE IRA bomb attacks in the heart of the City and on a stretch of road in north London have again demonstrated the capacity of one of the world's best disciplined and determined terrorist organisations to wrongfoot the security forces. Britain's anti-terrorist squad has been in a state of high alert ever since the IRA served notice five weeks ago that it would try to disrupt the general election. The squad believed there was at least one IRA cell on the mainland and that the most likely target would be a senior politician. Its efforts appeared to have been focused on maximising covert protection throughout the campaign. The fact that the IRA only struck only once during the campaign - ineffectually, with a small device in Soho - reflected not so much on the success of the police operation as on the IRA's decision to plan one step ahead. Security experts rule out suggestions that Friday's bomb was a kneejerk reaction to the electoral defeat in West Belfast of Mr Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA. The sheer size of the bombs detonated on Friday suggest the action was planned over weeks and would have involved at least one team of IRA volunteers on surveillance of the area as well as on the assembly and transport of the explosive devices. This team is likely to have been senior to and better organised than the cell responsible for placing less destructive devices such as the one on a railway line on Budget day. Friday's bombs are likely to have been kept in a 'safe house' in London for several days before being transported in vans to their final destinations. The timing of the City bomb in particular suggests that it was placed to coincide with a post-election security lull and to maximise the propaganda effect. During the campaign, City of London police concentrated on protecting buildings in their area and the local MP, Mr Peter Brooke, the outgoing Northern Ireland Secretary. But by Friday night security arrangements were being wound down and the London marathon rather than the IRA was drawing on the limited police resources available at the weekend. There continued to be speculation yesterday that the IRA had intended to bomb the Stock Exchange or Lloyd's - and thus halting business there - while minimising the loss of life. But even given such a miscalculation, hardliners within the IRA will have judged Friday's bomb a success. The response of the City was summed up by Sir Brian Jenkins, lord mayor of London. 'The City of London, confronted with this appalling act, has responded with the vigour you would expect from a major international business centre.' The bomb shook a City that was beginning to celebrate the Conservative victory as well as the prospects of political stability and economic recovery. The two blasts reminded Mr Major that, however much Northern Ireland was ignored as an issue during the election campaign, it will have to remain high on the security and political agenda as long as the IRA maintains its military capability. Some security experts believe the anti-terrorist squad's failure to arrest any of the significant figures in the current mainland campaign - or to avert incidents such as Friday's - point to organisational failings. But, as one senior Special Branch officer admitted during the weekend, there is a thin divide between stepping up security and undermining the democratic system which the police are entrusted to protect. It is such dilemmas which the IRA attempt to exploit.</p>

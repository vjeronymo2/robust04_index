			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, the U.S.  imperialists conducted a series of aerial mobile deployment  exercise on 22 and 23 May, lifting troops from U.S. bases in the  Pacific area to South Korea.    Pursuit-assault planes and VTOL [vertical takeoff and  landing] assault planes that took off from overseas bases flew  into the U.S. occupation Air Force bases in South Korea on 23  May. Prior to this, on 22 May, squadrons of assault planes and  pursuit-assault planes that left a base in Japan flew into the  U.S. bases in South Korea.    This war exercise was aimed at examining overseas-based  fighter planes' actual combat ability of rapid mobile deployment  to South Korea.    In the meantime, C-141 and C-130 transport planes carrying  many troops of the aggression army and war equipment took off  from U.S. Pacific bases and flew into the U.S. occupation Air  Force bases in South Korea on 22 May, and the troops and  murderous equipment carried by air were deployed in areas of  operations.    The U.S. imperialists' planned war exercise commotion is a  grave challenge to peace and detente of Korea.</p>

Police Gen. Miguel Maza  Marquez told reporters in Bogota, the capital, that judges handling sensitive  cases will be given offices inside bases of the national police and the elite  state security department. His pledge came after about 18,000 judges and  judicial officials went on strike to press for more protection after the recent  gangland-style slaying of a colleague.  </P></p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Blacklisting stuns UK group ONE OF two UK-based companies on a US Treasury blacklist expressed surprise last night at being named as one of the 'entities and agents of the government of Libya'. The company's comments follow publication on Tuesday of a list of 48 organisations, mostly based in Arab and Mediterranean countries, which the Treasury Office of Foreign Assets and Control named as circumventing the US embargo against Libya. 'We abide by British laws 100 per cent,' said Dr M Ageli, chief executive of the Libyan-owned Umm Al-Jawaby Oil Service Company, of Cavendish Square, London. He said the company cleared any trade with the Department of Trade and Industry and had never had trading links with US corporations. The second UK company named, Arabian Gulf Oil Company (Agoco) of Windsor House, Victoria Street, London, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of National Oil Corporation (Libya). It could not be contacted for comment. The DTI said there was no embargo on British companies trading with Libya, except under the provisions of the Export of Goods Control Order.</p>

			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / Observer: Long arm of the law There may well be more sense than Singapore's industry minister is aware of in his worry that his country is over-producing lawyers. Its present stock, which works out at one lawyer for every 1,266 people, is admittedly far short of the US's one for every 418. With 200 law students a year entering its national university, however, Singapore's count is rising. Minister Lee Hsien Loong hopes to absorb the mounting numbers by encouraging them to work in business companies. But he should beware of the link between lawyers and economic progress chanced upon by US industrialist Norman Augustine. He happened to notice that nations' rates of productivity increase reflected the density of lawyers in their populations. The trouble was that the correlation was negative - the greater their gain in productivity, the fewer lawyers they had on hand. The sole exception was the UK where, given its small legal profession, the productivity-gain should have been four times greater. The explanation probably lies in the UK's remarkable density of accountants. Taking all sorts together, it is not far behind the US lawyer count, at one for every 423 men, women and children in the land.</p>

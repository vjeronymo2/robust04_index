			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Pep charges cut MURRAY JOHNSTONE, the fund management group which led the recent round of charge cutting, has abolished all excess charges on its unit trust personal equity plans, writes Philip Coggan. The group's unit trusts currently have an initial charge of 1 per cent, compared with an industry average of 5 per cent. The total bid-offer spread varies between 2.2 per cent and 4.7 per cent. In other words, someone who invested in a Murray Johnstone unit trust Pep would face an instant loss of between 2.2 and 4.7 per cent on the value of the investment. The 'immediate realisable value', as Murray Johnstone describes it, of Pounds 100 invested would be between Pounds 97.80 and Pounds 95.30. That compares well with some unit trust Peps where, what with high bid-offer spreads and additional Pep charges, the investor might easily face a hit of 8 per cent. The immediate realisable value of Pounds 100 invested would be Pounds 92. Other unit trust managers would point out that Murray Johnstone's annual charge is 1.5 per cent, while many managers charge 1 per cent. This will hit performance over the long term, which could offset the lower initial charge. Many managers would argue that performance, not charges, is paramount. Here Murray's performance is variable. The UK growth, smaller company and European funds have below average performances over the three years to October 1; the Equity Income and Acumen funds have performed better than their sector averages over the period.</p>

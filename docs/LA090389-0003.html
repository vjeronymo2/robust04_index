			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: TRAVELING IN TIME;  </P> <P> AN 1892 SET OF ENCYCLOPEDIAS PORTRAYS A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE  </P> <P> IN CLEANING OUT our garage once more, I have finally decided to part with a  treasure -- the 1892 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.  </P> <P> It is not quite complete. Two or three volumes are missing. It was given to me  by my friend Will Fowler many years ago. I hope he will forgive me for parting  with it.  </P> <P> It is almost a shock to thumb through these volumes and see how much the world  has changed in almost a century. In 1892, the British Empire sat astride the  globe like a sergeant-major, exacting tribute, civilizing savages, keeping the  peace. It ruled a third of the earth and had no doubt that it would rule  forever.  </P> <P> The Royal Navy is called "the bulwark of the nation, and more important for the  defence of the kingdom than its land forces." With unseemly pride, the  encyclopedia lists the United Kingdom's ironclad ships of the line, including  those with such bellicose names as Devastation, Thunderer, Dreadnought and  Inflexible, which surpassed all other ships in armor, having 16 to 18 inches of  plate protecting its guns. Although the modern Royal Navy was undoubtedly a  factor in frustrating the German Sea Lion plan to invade the Sceptered Isle in  World War II, the 1892 edition hadn't a hint of the airplane to come. To its  authors, the Battle of Britain in the air was inconceivable.  </P> <P> Although the Wright Brothers' first heavier-than-air flight was only 11 years  away, the 23-page article on aerodynamics reviews the history of man's failed  attempts at flight, back to antiquity, but is devoted mostly to the past and  future of ballooning. As for heavier-than-air flying, it concludes  pessimistically: "In all ages . . . great ingenuity has been expended in  efforts at flying, all of which have as yet resulted in failure . . . and while  navigation is one of the most perfect of the arts, the power of directing a  body floating in the air still remains unattained."  </P> <P> Africa, though emerging, is still regarded as the Dark Continent: "This vast  continent, though associated from the dawn of civilization with traditions and  mysteries of the most stimulating kind, has remained until recently one of the  least known, and, both commercially and politically, one of the least important  of the great divisions of the globe."  </P> <P> At the end of the article on Africa is a footnote that places it for us in  time: "The above article was completed before it was known with certainty that  the saddest event in the history of African exploration had occurred. Dr.  Livingstone, to whom the article justly assigns 'the first place among African  discoverers,' died of dysentery near Lake Bangweolo on the 4th of May, 1873."  </P> <P> I am mystified by the lapse of time between the confirmation of Dr. David  Livingstone's death (1874) and the publication of that article (1892). Perhaps  it was written for an earlier edition and reprinted intact. So little did the  Dark Continent change.  </P> <P> Perhaps nothing in the whole set is more amusing to an Angeleno than the  article on Los Angeles. It reads, in part:  </P> <P> "LOS ANGELES, a city of the United States, the capital of Los Angeles County,  Calif., is situated in the lowland between the Sierre Madre and the Pacific,  about 17 miles from the coast, on the west bank of a stream of its own name. It  lies 483 miles by rail south-south-east of San Francisco on the Southern  Pacific Railroad, and is connected by branch lines with Wilmington, Santa  Monica (both on the coast) and Santa Ana. At the centre of a fine orange and  grape growing country, and a resort for invalids, Los Angeles is a place of  some importance; and since the opening of the railways it has been in full  prosperity. . . . "Founded in 1781 by the Spaniards, it received the name 'Town  of the Queen of the Angels' (Pueblo de la Reina de Los Angeles) as a tribute to  the beauty and pleasantness of the spot. It was the capital of the Mexican  state of California from 1836 to 1846, in which latter year it was captured by  United States forces." I wish I could trade this set in on the 2092 edition.  What unimagined wonders might it disclose?  </P></p>

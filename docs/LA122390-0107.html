			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPDATING THE LEGEND OF GUADALCANAL;  </P> <P> GUADALCANAL BY RICHARD B. FRANK (RANDOM HOUSE: $34.95; 828 PP.)  </P> <P> Guadalcanal is a word that stirs the American soul as few other battle sites  ever have done. It conjures up visions of supreme courage, bulldog tenacity and  impassioned patriotism. It is a symbol of all that is most admirable in the  American character. For in some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II, more  than 7,000 U.S. Marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen perished in the fetid  forests of this remote South Pacific island and in the turbulent waters and  transparent skies enclosing it, while killing two-thirds of a fanatical  20,000-man Japanese army.  </P> <P> Nor is the legend of Guadalcanal simply symbolic. The ferocious struggles there  thrust the United States onto the offensive at a time when the Japanese, even  though defeated at Midway, were seriously threatening the American campaign in  the Pacific and still dreaming of a negotiated peace that would let them keep  the spoils of conquest. Both sides knew that the decisive battle of the war in  the Pacific would be fought here. Indeed, victory at Guadalcanal opened the way  to America's ultimate victory in the Pacific.  </P> <P> The legend of Guadalcanal has been told many times by able historians and  journalists -- among them Samuel Elliot Morrison and Richard Tregaskis -- but  Richard B. Frank, a former captain in the 101st Airborne Division who served in  Vietnam, has written what must be the definitive book on the subject. His  "Guadalcanal" is an enormous work based on the most meticulous research.  Especially intriguing is the new material gleaned from official Japanese battle  reports that reveal the frustrations, fears and fantasies of an enemy portrayed  in most World War II books as soulless robots. One starving Japanese officer  poignantly scribbled in his diary: "Rice. I really want to give my men as much  rice as they want. That is the only wish I have."  </P> <P> In this brilliant academic history, almost every unit in every battle is  identified; almost every action by every platoon is described; almost every  weapon is taken apart, examined, appraised. Individual characters are  mentioned, but they play only cameo roles in Frank's epochal production. In one  shattering account, the author quotes a sailor who survived the sinking of the  destroyer Juneau and witnessed a shark gouging out a shipmate's shoulder:  </P> <P> "He looked at his shipmates there and realized that he was making them  nauseated, that he was driving them crazy by just being there . . . he pushed  himself off the life nets and swam out about five or six feet and let the  sharks have him rather than lay there and die like a coward and jeopardize the  live(s) of his shipmates."  </P> <P> Such drama often is obscured by the manual-like detailing of battle, but it is  this detail that makes the book unique. Here is everything you might want to  know -- or not want to know -- about Guadalcanal. And all the facts are  presented in an orderly manner and in studied perspective. Frank limberly jumps  from jungle conflict to naval encounter to aerial clash, dealing with each side  in turn, showing how each perceived the thinking of the other, weaving the  clutter of episodes into the whole.  </P> <P> Frank's objectivity is reflected in his comparative appraisal of the character  of the antagonists. While heroism abounds on the American side, the Japanese  emerge as opponents more than worthy of his admiration. He quotes one U.S.  officer as saying:  </P> <P> "Most of us who have fought in the Pacific are ready to admit here and now,  away from all the convincing firsthand evidence we have seen -- mass  starvation, untold suffering, shell shock, cannibalism, mass suicide -- that  for sheer, bloody, hardened steel guts, the stocky and hard-muscled little Jap  doughboy has it all over any of us."  </P> <P> As Frank points out, the brave fighters on both sides, ironically, often were  undercut by the misjudgments and faulty leadership of their commanders. Thus,  Japanese leaders were convinced that only 2,000 Marines had landed in  Guadalcanal and that their morale was low; in fact, more than 20,000 had waded  ashore and were ready for battle, even though, as the author states, they  "lacked the moral reserve that a long string of successes or a large  preponderance of power gives any unit."  </P> <P> And American leaders were just as convinced that when Japanese ships sought to  reach Guadalcanal, they were trying to land reinforcements, though their  mission was, on the contrary, to evacuate troops already on the island. At one  point, some U.S. officials, unaware that the Japanese were barely hanging on,  harbored doubts that the Americans could hang on, especially after they  suffered several naval defeats. When a reporter asked Secretary of the Navy  Frank Knox if they could, he dourly replied:  </P> <P> "I will not make any predictions. . . . What I am trying to say is that there  is a good stiff fight going on. Everybody hopes we can hold on."  </P> <P> Such doubts generated battle plans that resulted in the needless killing of  hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men.  </P> <P> If flawed intelligence and poor judgment were common to both sides, so was the  tendency to cover up bad news. The American brass, it seems, feared public  reaction back home almost as much as their Japanese counterparts did. After a  sea battle in which the U.S. Navy lost a number of ships, naval officials  confirmed the sinking of only one unidentified vessel and concealed the other  losses from the public for two months -- until they could be announced in  conjunction with a victory.  </P> <P> This was not a unique naval tactic in World War II. When the cruiser USS  Indianapolis, which had carried the major components of the Hiroshima atomic  bomb to the island of Tinian, was sunk shortly after delivering them -- losing  880 men, most while drifting in the shark-infested water for five days -- naval  officials revealed the disaster one hour after President Truman announced the  end of World War II. The story, as the Navy apparently calculated, was buried  in history.  </P> <P> In this book, Frank, without tarnishing the legend of Guadalcanal, bares many  aspects of the battle that, until now, have been buried in history.U.S. troops  on Guadalcanal, February, 1943.  </P> <P> </P></p>

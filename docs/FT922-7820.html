			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / 'Violent assault on carbon tax' angers di Meana The EC has faced a 'violent assault from industrial lobbies and the Gulf countries, which even threatened to break off diplomatic relations' following the announcement of its energy tax, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment commissioner, said yesterday, agencies report. Mr di Meana said the Commission would push ahead with a modified energy tax even if the US and Japan did not impose a similar levy to reduce global warming. He spoke a day after proposing a tax on non-renewable energy sources, such as coal and oil, of dollars 3 on the equivalent of a barrel of oil in 1993, rising to dollars 10 by 2000. This tax, he said on Wednesday, would be imposed only after the US and Japan agreed to introduce similar measures. However, a lower tax would be levied by the EC if other industrial countries failed to act. Mr di Meana attributed intense US lobbying against the tax to efforts to make next month's UN environment conference a meaningless event. 'It is vital that Rio is not simply a media event (but yields) concrete decisions with binding obligations to achieve precise targets.' Mr di Meana complained about US lobbying. 'Sometimes Big Brother's suggestions go too far,' he said, hinting that US diplomats had tried to put undue pressure on him to kill the energy tax. So far the only public reaction from oil-producing countries in the Middle East has come from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec). Mr Subroto, the organisation's secretary-general, said yesterday he believed the tax would not be implemented because of opposition from the US. On Wednesday, Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister criticised Mr Ripa di Meana for waiting for US and Japanese agreement before imposing the energy tax. He said he wanted Europe to 'go it alone in introducing EC-wide carbon dioxide taxes.'</p>

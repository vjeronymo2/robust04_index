			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Observer: Leaping sales Lions, not to mention unicorns, had better steer well clear of Britain if the pom population follows the lead of the Australians. They have taken to eating one of their national emblems, the kangaroo, with gusto since it went on sale in one of the country's supermarket chains. Previously sold for human consumption only in a few restaurants and delicatessens, the animal that supports one side of Australia's coat of arms has gone down far better than the chain expected. Indeed one of its stores, Big Fresh Franklins in Sydney, sold more in one day than had been budgeted for the whole week. The huge sales prompted Sydney nutritionist Catherine Saxelby to forecast that Australians would soon be getting their teeth into the creature on the other side of the coat of arms - which, unlike the unicorn, has the disadvantage of not being mythical. It's the emu.</p>

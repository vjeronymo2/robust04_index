			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Low pound may push up interest rates, Bank warns BRITAIN WOULD raise interest rates if it felt a falling pound imperilled its goal of low inflation, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, warned last night. Speaking in Bristol, Mr Leigh-Pemberton insisted that the Bank was 'in no way indifferent' to the behaviour of the exchange rate and stressed that the UK had 'most certainly not been seeking a competitive advantage' for its exports through sterling's depreciation. Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who is to retire at the end of June, said the 'substantial fall' in sterling's value since its departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 'was not a deliberate object of policy'. Although sterling gained 3 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London at DM2.37, its value measured on the Bank's trade-weighted exchange rate index was 15.2 per cent lower than before leaving the ERM. The governor warned that continued success in pursuit of the government's target of keeping underlying inflation within a 1-to-4 per cent band during the life of this parliament 'could be impaired if the exchange rate were to fall too far'. Giving his clearest warning yet of higher interest rates in the event of a further sterling slide, he said: 'We will need to monitor very carefully the impact of the exchange rate on inflation and to respond with tighter monetary policies if we believe the inflation target to be threatened.' As money markets throughout Europe yesterday looked forward to an easing of German monetary policy, Mr Leigh-Pemberton made clear that Britain would not follow any cut in interest rates. 'In such circumstances, there would be no question of the UK seeking to hold the exchange rate down to maintain competitive advantage,' he said. 'Indeed, the appreciation of the (sterling) exchange rate which would result from easier policies elsewhere would greatly assist the achievement of the government's target for reducing inflation.' The governor's remarks came only hours after provisional Bank figures for M0, the narrow measure of money supply, pointed to a continuing upturn of British retail sales last month. The sharp seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent year-on-year increase of M0 in February was well above the government's 0-to-4 per cent target.

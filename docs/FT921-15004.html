			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / International Company News: Investcorp profit declines by 21% to Dollars 52m INVESTCORP Bank, the Arab controlled investment bank, suffered a 21 per cent drop in net profits to Dollars 52.2m in 1991. However, Mr Michael Merritt, a member of Investcorp's management committee, said the bank was pleased with its performance in view of the economic and political upheavals of the past year, notably the Gulf war. Investcorp specialises in channelling funds held by wealthy Arab investors into well established businesses located in western economies. In a typical deal, it will arrange the buy-out of a company, such as that of Saks Fifth Avenue, the US stores group, which it organised two years ago. It distributes the equity and subordinated debt needed for the buy-out among its clients, keeping between 10 and 15 per cent. After the acquisition is completed, it takes a close interest in the management of the acquired company. Mr Merritt said that in 1991 Investcorp took a strategic decision not to make any acquisitions, because of the 'severe economic difficulties' faced by most economies. The bank concentrated on ensuring its existing investments would continue to increase in value. However, the absence of acquisitions - and thus the absence of fees for arranging deals - was a substantial contributor to the fall in profits. Speaking from the bank's head office in Bahrain, Mr Elias Hallack, Investcorp's chief financial officer, said he was particularly pleased that net interest income of Dollars 29.2m was only 13 per cent down on the previous year and exceeded operating expenses of Dollars 28.6m. He said this demonstrated that the bank could make a profit simply from the earnings it received from its portfolio of investments. Other income, including profits from the disposal of investments and from trading in securities and foreign exchange, was Dollars 51.6m, down from Dollars 65.9m. During the year, it sold its minority interests in Thecla Industries, a French aluminium components company, and in Fox Photo, the big US retail photoprocessing company. The group's net assets increased from Dollars 243m to Dollars 278m. It is paying a dividend of 3.75 cents a share, unchanged from a year earlier. Mr Merritt said he expected 1992 to be another difficult year. Investcorp has a complicated corporate structure. Part of the group has a listing on the Bahrain stock exchange and it has an estimated 10,000 shareholders. Just before the Gulf war, Investcorp reorganised its structure and transferred control of its assets out of the Gulf to a Luxembourg-based subsidiary. However, the group continues to be managed from Bahrain, though it also has offices in London and New York.</p>

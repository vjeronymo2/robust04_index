			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Copenhagen Summit: Community decides it is time to roll up its sleeves - Ian Davidson sees the acceptance by the Twelve that they must take responsibility in Bosnia as a foreign policy watershed for the EC AGAINST every expectation, the European Community this week passed a fundamental watershed in its history, with the decision to provide men and money to protect Moslem safe havens in Bosnia. We do not yet know in detail how the Copenhagen declaration will work out in practice: the real decision to send troops can only be taken individually by each member state. But the fundamental precedent is that the EC has for the first time moved beyond its traditional penchant for issuing wishy-washy expressions of opinion on difficult foreign policy issues, to a commitment to action. In effect, the Community appears to have accepted that Bosnia is a European responsibility. In Resolution 836, the United Nations Security Council voted for the establishment of safe havens in Bosnia; on Friday the council followed this up by authorising the deployment of troops by member states. Nato ministers have met and said the organisation would implement the policy; but they did not offer to provide the troops required to do so. The European Community has not formally decided on the sending of troops; that would be beyond its power. But it is now politically committed to the end result. This is a new situation. Sceptics will assume that this week's declaration will prove to go beyond what the Community can deliver. Britain already has a significant contingent in Bosnia, but yesterday the UK government declared it would send no more men. The Germans claim to be inhibited by their constitution from sending troops. The French already have the largest military force in ex-Yugoslavia, and will be reluctant to send more. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, said Madrid would not add to the 1,200 troops it has in Bosnia. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, has indicated that he would not welcome the deployment of troops from Italy. Greece has said that, as a neighbour of the former Yugoslavia, it is inhibited by UN rules from sending troops. So, if all these Community countries do not provide the forces, it is not obvious which of the other six will be ready to come up with the 7,500 men needed to protect the safe havens. And yet, in one way or another, the Bosnian tragedy and the European Community have both crossed some kind of Rubicon. The choice in Bosnia has become quite stark: either the Community will mobilise, by itself or with others, the troops necessary to protect the safe havens; or else it will be driven back on to the strategy preferred by President Bill Clinton, to lift the arms embargo and (probably) start bombing the Serbs. On Monday, indeed, under pressure from Mr Clinton, Chancellor Helmut Kohl actually started canvassing his Community colleagues with the case for the preferred US policy. In the event, his canvassing backfired, because President Francois Mitterrand succeeded in persuading his partners that the EC must not only stand by its agreed safe havens policy, but must take the practical steps to implement it. Those two alternative options remain; but in effect the Community has moved into point position for determining which of them is activated. If the Twelve succeed in mustering the minimum forces required, they will be responsible for the military enforcement of a ceasefire and a negotiation; and they may find themselves inextricably embroiled in a conflict which may yet demand further troop reinforcements for an indeterminate period. If they fail to muster the minimum force required, the Community's pretensions will be immediately exposed, and they will be forced to switch track. This choice will have to be faced very quickly, such is the precariousness of the situation in Bosnia. According to the Danish president of this week's summit, prime minister Poul Rasmussen, the decisions will have to be taken in days rather than weeks. It is quite difficult to understand how we got here. The Community is manifestly ill-equipped for handling any kind of operational foreign policy, let alone the military containment of a foreign war. The Maastricht treaty claims to aim at the eventual development of a common foreign and security policy; but most people rightly regard the treaty's formal provisions with amused derision. Large countries like France and Britain would prefer to cling nostalgically to essentially national foreign policies, as well as to their special privileges as nuclear powers, even if they admit the occasional case for 'co-operation'. Small countries like Denmark and Portugal would rather not have any foreign policy at all. It is difficult to imagine what possessed the Twelve collectively this week, to come out with a declaration which effectively commits them to common action of the most demanding kind. No doubt it is partly a response to the realisation that, on this occasion and for this problem, the Americans are simply not going to take the lead, let alone take charge. In other words, Bosnia is in practice Europe's problem; if the outside world is to exert any effective influence on it, Europe must take the lead. After so much savagery and so much suffering in Europe's back yard, this long-delayed reaction of shame does not come too soon.</p>

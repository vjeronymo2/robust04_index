[Correspondent] About 1,000 Liberal Democrats of the  north-west gathered in the St. Petersburg Hotel, opposite the  Aurora on its permanent mooring. Some rows were full of naval  officers. [passage omitted] Zhirinovskiy was very optimistic  about the prospects for his party in Petersburg. [video shows  correspondent interviewing Vladimir Zhirinovskiy]    [Begin recording] [Correspondent] How strong is support for  you here in St. Petersburg, and what sort of structure do you  intend to set up here?    [Zhirinovskiy] Well, the second thing... [pauses] this is  the  main assistance for our party in Russia. We have paid a lot of  attention to Petersburg and the oblast, and today we are holding  a conference of representatives of [word indistinct]  organizations, we are appointing a new leadership. [end  recording]    [Correspondent] The Liberal Democrats, it seems, are taking  the region seriously. Zhirinovskiy's people have met in St.  Petersburg at the most critical moment, when it is still unclear  whether the St. Petersburg city assembly elections will be  acknowledged as valid. If the elections were to be recognized as  valid, the Liberal Democrats would not get a single seat in the  city Duma, and over half the seats would go to  democratically-oriented blocs.</p>

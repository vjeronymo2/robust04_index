			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: REDUCING FAT INTAKE A CONFUSING ISSUE, BUT GUIDELINES  CAN HELP CUT USE  </P> <P> "Why is it," a health-conscious friend complained recently, "that you  nutritionists are always making it more complicated to choose a healthy diet?"  </P> <P> His lament referred to selecting fats for cooking and table spreads. For the  past several years, he had paid close attention to reports on TV and radio and  in newspapers chronicling research findings on how different types of fat  affect serum cholesterol. The payoff, he observed wistfully, is that he feels  confused about exactly what he should be doing.  </P> <P> He's not alone. Experts agree that reducing saturated fat is the most critical  step in modifying fat intake to lower serum cholesterol. Yet the role of  unsaturated fat, and the mix of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats we  should consume, is far less clear. For such a complex question, it will take  years of study, not the findings of any single project, to reach an answer.  </P> <P> The other confusing factor in fat selection is the proliferation of butter  alternatives and the advertising that accompanies them, tapping into some piece  of the message for a healthy heart.  </P> <P> Despite the confusion, we have to make decisions at the grocery store, in the  kitchen, and all other places where we buy, prepare and eat food throughout the  day. Luckily, there are some simple guidelines recommended to ease the process.  </P> <P> Start by assuming you could use less fat in your diet. Although consumption has  been dropping, the typical American gets considerably more fat than the current  recommendation of 30% of total calories. The best approach to trimming fat is  simply to eat lean: Choose low-fat or skim-milk dairy products, buy lean cuts  of meat and eat smaller servings, use more chicken and fish, cook with a  minimum of fat and use it sparingly at the table.  </P> <P> For many people, this strategy might be all that's needed to reach the target  of 30% of total calories, as well as to create a diet where no more than 10% of  the fat is saturated, with the rest evenly split between monounsaturates and  polyunsaturates. At nine calories per gram, fat is the most calorie-dense of  the energy nutrients, compared to four per gram for either carbohydrate or  protein. Thus, cutting back on fat might also mean you'll shed extra pounds.  </P> <P> If step one is to take a well-sharpened paring knife to the fat -- especially  saturated -- in your diet, step two is to make informed choices about those  fats you do buy for cooking and table spreads. Where oils are concerned, you  can choose according to usage.  </P> <P> For sauteing, take one of the many flavorless oils available. For salad  dressings or dishes with a Mediterranean flavor, olive oil makes the zestiest  choice. It should be used sparingly, so the fruitier the better. And in many  Oriental dishes, peanut oil -- like olive, rich in monounsaturates and also  carrying a distinctive flavor -- might be your pick. Again, a little goes a  long way.  </P> <P> So far, so good. When you hit the dairy case, however, you may feel lost in a  jungle of products. Bear in mind this generalization: A tablespoon of regular,  stick margarine, 80% fat and 20% water by weight, is calorically comparable to  butter, providing 100 calories per tablespoon.  </P> <P> Checking at the market, we found that all but three stick margarines provided  labeling information. All except one contained two grams of saturated fat per  tablespoon and one to three grams of polyunsaturated fat. Curiously, all but  one manufacturer used a tablespoon as the serving size. This one exception used  a teaspoon, which contained a gram of saturated fat. Multiply that by the three  teaspoons to a tablespoon and you'll find the product more highly saturated  than other brands.  </P> <P> Of the three unlabeled margarines, two were made from partially hydrogenated  vegetable oil, and it's unknown how saturated they are. The label on the third  states that it "contains liquid corn oil," but again, we don't know whether  it's hydrogenated and therefore more saturated. Among tub margarines, the one  containing the most saturated fat used a teaspoon rather than a tablespoon as  the portion of choice, thereby misleading the unwary consumer.  </P> <P> What happens when these margarines are modified by whipping in water? Calories  are reduced, but how much varies by brand. Consumers can make their selection  both on taste and on desire to cut calories. Clearly, there's no getting around  not reading the labels.  </P> <P> Finally, there is a line of products whose appeal is unabashedly based on being  a butter taste-alike. It may or may not achieve that objective. But, not  surprisingly, the addition of butter boosts its quota of saturated fat. In  making comparisons between this and other margarines, always remember to check  for portion size. Otherwise, you may be getting more saturated fat than you  bargained for.  </P> <P> Not All Shellfish Have Excessive Cholesterol  </P> <P> Question: I was sure I'd read in your column that most shellfish are no richer  in cholesterol than lean meat or chicken. The other night I dined with a friend  who says he knows all about the ins and outs of a cholesterol-lowering diet. He  passed up scallops because, he said, they are a potent source of cholesterol. I  thought he was wrong, but he was adamant. Who's right?  </P> <P> Answer: You are. Assuming that the scallops weren't prepared with a lot of oil  or margarine and weren't afloat in either melted butter or a rich cream sauce,  they are not only low in cholesterol but also low in both fat and saturated  fat. The scallops themselves, before any fat is added, contain less than a gram  of fat and just 95 calories.  </P> <P> To spare your friend's feelings, you can explain that his confusion is  understandable. The problem is that at the time a link between dietary factors  and serum cholesterol was first established, laboratory methods for analysis of  dietary cholesterol were relatively primitive compared to today's fine-tuning.  As a result, other compounds, which are chemically similar, were measured as  cholesterol.  </P> <P> This error inflated the early values for shellfish. Although the mistake was  later rectified, old learning has died a slow death. Many people, such as your  dining companion, cling like limpets to the belief that shellfish are all rich  in cholesterol.  </P> <P> In truth, many shellfish contain little. For example, three ounces of clams,  mussels, oysters or scallops provide between 30 and 50 milligrams. That amount  is considerably less than the 80 milligrams you would get from the same portion  of veal, beef or chicken.  </P> <P> The same amount of lobster contains somewhat more, about 90 milligrams. How  much there is in shrimp depends on species, anywhere from as little as 60  milligrams in Japanese prawns to three times that amount in the white Atlantic  varieties. Squid, a mollusk most people do not recognize as such, contains 180  milligrams of cholesterol.  </P> <P> Q: I know that ground beef does not keep as well as whole cuts, but I haven't  the foggiest notion why. Can you enlighten me?  </P> <P> A: There are two reasons why ground beef deteriorates more readily than a roast  or even chunks cut for stew. For one thing, ground beef is often made from  trimmings, so it has been handled more than larger pieces of meat. The handling  process increases exposure to bacteria. For another, grinding the meat greatly  multiplies the exposed surface area. That exposed area is an open playing field  for bacteria naturally present in the environment. While these organisms are  not harmful, they can cause a breakdown in quality, and even spoilage, if  handled improperly.  </P> <P> Because ground meat deteriorates so quickly, it should be held in the  refrigerator for no more than a couple of days. If you don't get a chance to  use it up within that time, you have several choices. One is to brown the meat  well and use it in a cooked dish such as spaghetti sauce or chili, which can be  eaten within a few days.  </P> <P> Alternatively, it should be frozen. If you do choose to freeze it, remember  that the best way to thaw it is in the refrigerator. Thawing meat on the  counter is not recommended. That method allows the outer layer to warm to a  temperature where bacteria thrive, while the inside remains solid.  </P> <P> Q: I was preparing a batch of corn muffins when my mother offered to "help."  She had never used corn meal before and when she opened a new box she wailed in  dismay at the black specks inside. I assured her that it was perfectly fine and  that those specks were always present in corn meal. She was dissatisfied with  my answer. Can you tell my mother that I know what I'm talking about?  </P> <P> A: Those black specks are indeed a natural part of the corn kernel. Corn  kernels, like other grains, have three basic parts: the bran (or outer husk),  the germ and the endosperm. These black specks, called the "hilar layer," are  found at the base of the germ and connect it to the rest of the kernel. During  milling, the hilar layer remains with the endosperm, and shows up as the dark  specks you describe.  </P></p>

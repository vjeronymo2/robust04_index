The restructuring of the defense industry is part of the  reform programme developed by the Government of Romania, and its  purpose is to adjust production capacities to the technical  endowment requirements of the forces forming the national  defense system, as well as to modernize and update certain  units, to keep under conservation strictly specialized  equipment, to convert, partly or entirely, some manufacturing  units, to offer the personnel to be laid-off professional  readjustment opportunities.    The main aim of the government board for the restructuring  of  the defense industry is to adapt the defense industry to the new  demands of the market economy without affecting Romania's  defense capabilities.</p>

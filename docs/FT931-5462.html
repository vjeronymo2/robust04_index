			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Belgian bank hit by bad loan provisions PROVISIONS to cover inter-national loans cut net consolidated profits at Banque Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's three largest banks, to BFr3.6bn (Dollars 1.2bn) in the 15 months to the end of 1992. In the year to the end of September 1991, BBL reported consolidated net profits of BFr4.5bn. The group had already warned it would turn in poor consolidated results for the 15-month period. The company pointed out that its operating profit had increased from BFr18.1bn in the year 1990-91 to BFr26.3bn in the following 15 months. It attributed the improvement to an 8.5 per cent increase in interest income and 'efficient control of general expenditure'. BBL proposed a net dividend of BFr100 per ordinary share. BBL identified last year's main problem as the increase in provisions - from BFr12.2bn in 1991-92 to BFr21.3bn - nearly three-quarters of which represented write-off of loans. The group said yesterday the loan provisions had peaked in 1992. It was positive about the prospects for its international branches. It said the international network 'may become profit-making again . . . unless the economic situation deteriorates dramatically'. A month ago, the group revealed that its French subsidiary alone lost FFr540m in 1992, mainly because it had to write off French property loans. BBL's balance sheet total rose by 7.7 per cent in the 15-month period, from BFr2,288bn to BFr2,464bn, and customer deposits increased by 6.6 per cent. Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, BBL's new chief executive, insists the group will not seek new alliances with third parties in the 1993-95 period, after last year's ill-fated attempt at an agreement with the Dutch financial services company Internationale Nederlanden Groep. Gevaert, the Belgian investment group, suffered a drop in consolidated profit in 1992, from BFr2.07bn to just under BFr2bn. It said the economic slowdown and depressed stock market meant there were 'no major capital gains' during the year.</p>

Before the opening  ceremony, Mayor Zhang Lichang met with Mr. Yi Chang-U, first  vice president of the Foreign Exchange Bank. He first extended  congratulations to the Foreign Exchange Bank of the ROK for  establishing a branch bank in Tianjin on behalf of the municipal  government. He said: Tianjin has speedily accelerated its pace  in opening to the outside world and foreign investments have  increased by 100 percent. We welcome banking organs from all  countries to establish organs in Tianjin and we are certain they  will thrive here.    The Tianjin branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank of the ROK  is  the first branch bank of the ROK in China. The Foreign Exchange  Bank is one of the major banks of the ROK with 238 branch banks  and subbranches. The opening of this branch bank will play an  active role in encouraging ROK business to expand investments in  Tianjin. Zhang Lichang said: I have just returned from a visit  to the ROK with the municipal government delegation. The warm  and friendly reception the ROK national assembly speaker and  some ministers of the government gave to the delegation left a  profound impression on me. We have established friendly city  relations with Inchon city. The ROK has speedily increased  investments in Tianjin and the inauguration of the Tianjin  branch of the Foreign Exchange Bank has shortened the distance  between us. I am full of confidence in the prospects of  cooperation. Mr. Yi Chang-U said: Through the municipal  government delegation's visit to the ROK led by Mayor Zhang  Lichang, the friendly contacts between the ROK and Tianjin will  be further strengthened. Our branch bank in Tianjin will  contribute to the two countries, and, in particular, to the  economic development of the ROK and Tianjin.    After the meeting, Mayor Zhang Lichang; Hwang Pyong-tae, ROK  ambassador to China; and Mr. Yi Chang-U, first vice president of  the Foreign Exchange Bank, cut the ribbon to mark the opening of  the Tianjin branch of the ROK Foreign Exchange Bank. Zhang  Lichang and ROK Ambassador Hwang Pyong-tae held talks on  strengthening cooperation. Vice Mayor Ye Disheng and responsible  persons of departments concerned also attended the meeting and  the opening ceremony.</p>

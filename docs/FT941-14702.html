			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Observer: Marvellous Ma What would Hong Kong be without ostentatious displays of wealth and connections? C K Ma, chairman of the Oriental Press Group, plumbed new depths last night in his launch party for the Eastern Express, an English language daily. Ma, 37, enticed a few hundred guests to come along and watch video messages from Ronald Reagan and George Bush. More predictably governor Chris Patten put in a personal appearance. Paul Keating, prime minister of Australia, Ma's adopted country, sent a note. Champagne, Iranian caviar, and lobster were topped off by guests receiving gift packs - including a copy of the new newspaper and a titanium and gold Tiffany's propelling ball-point pen - from an immaculately turned out army of young women. Like the heirs of Jardine and Matheson, Ma has gone far to live down his family's past association with drug trafficking. His uncle Sik-yu was known as 'White Powder Ma'; his father Ma Sik-chun dominated the heroin trade in the 1960s and beyond. Both fled to Taiwan in 1974, where White Powder Ma died in 1992.</p>

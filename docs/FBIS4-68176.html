			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Larisa Kislinskaya] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 17 TASS -- One of two blasts ripped the  air in downtown Moscow where a joint stock society of the closed  type was located.    ITAR-TASS learnt at the Moscow Chief Militia Department that  an explosive device without a shell went off due to careless  handling. The society's driver brought it to the office due to  some reasons.    He received several lacerated wounds, and both his hands  were  torn away. He soon died from the loss of blood. Militia found  two cartridges, two electric detonators and two radio  transmitters at the place of accident. The blast was so  powerful that the society's door was blown out, and all glass  was shattered at the house entrance foyer.    The second explosion sounded in Moscow's suburb  (2,Varshavskoye highway). An explosive device was planted into  a Lada car which belonged to the managing director of the  Grigori-91 firm. Luckily, there were no casualties. Only the  Lada car and nearby Zaporozhets car were damaged. Windows were  shattered at a house.    Investigation was started in both cases.</p>

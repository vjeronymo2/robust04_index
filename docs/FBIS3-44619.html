An official of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of  China (PBC), the country's central bank, said that Shanghai's  financial sector has been operating normally as a result of the  campaign to rectify the financial order nationwide.    Statistics released by the branch showed that the amount of  savings deposits in the city in the first 11 months of 1993 were  33.8 billion yuan (about 3.88 billion U.S. dollars) more than  that at the end of 1992.    During that period, the amount of loans extended by various  banks in Shanghai was 23.1 billion yuan more than in the whole  of 1992.    Various financial markets were bullish in 1993, the official  said. For example, trading in the Shanghai foreign exchange  swap center, the largest of its kind in the country, was heavy  last year, with nearly 500 billion yuan changing hands.    Mao Yingliang, director of the PBC Shanghai branch, said,  "the stability and prosperity of the financial sector has not  only helped Shanghai achieve a sustainable, fast and healthy  economic growth, but also has paved the way for its own further  restructuring in the new year."    He described 1993 as a "year of the reform" for the city's  financial sector.    In the new year various state-owned specialized banks will  become commercial banks by pursuing what Mao called  "risk-related management." Competition will be encouraged among  these banks, Mao said.    Moreover, credit co-ops in both urban and rural areas will  be  turned into co-operative banks this year so as to better help  spur the growth of the local economy, he said.    He said that the Shanghai municipal authorities have decided  to permit 26 foreign-funded financial institutions to handle  business in Chinese currency this year, but within a  government-prescribed range.    The governor said that Shanghai will try even harder this  year to turn itself into a national financial center.    The China Foreign Exchange Trading Center is expected to  open  in Shanghai in early 1994 to form unified quotations nationwide.    Furthermore, a gold exchange that will adapt to the global  market will open later this year, Mao said, adding that both  gold jewelry and gold bullion will be traded on the new exchange.    He said, "we are also going to expand and improve short-term  treasury bond market, inter-bank lending and borrowing market  and other monetary markets in the new year."</p>

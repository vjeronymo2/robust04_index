			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: Seven-Up files against Coca-Cola THE DALLAS-BASED Seven-Up Company, the soft drinks concentrates business, has filed a multi-million dollar lawsuit against the rival Coca-Cola Company, alleging that the latter has been attempting to disrupt Seven-Up's arrangements with bottlers. Formally, the suit alleges 'tortuous interference and other unlawful conduct including certain misrepresentations' by Coca-Cola of bottlers who handle both companies' products. The case was filed in the state district court in Dallas on Wednesday. It seeks unspecified compensatory damages, and punative damages of Dollars 500m. There was no immediate response from Coca-Cola, which ranks number one in the soft drinks market, to the suit. Seven-Up's chairman, Mr John Albers, said that the company would make no further statement regarding the litigation. However, people who had read the complaint said that it concerned the lemon-lime segment of the soft drinks market, which Coca-Cola entered in 1960 with its Sprite brand. In essence, the complaint alleges that Coca-Cola attempted to 'seduce' bottlers away from Seven-Up, by projecting various 'false and misleading impressions'. It cites one Texan bottler, for example, which it claims ceased bottling for Seven-Up in January as a result.</p>

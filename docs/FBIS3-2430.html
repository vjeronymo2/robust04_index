			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- China's veteran leader Deng  Xiaoping is healthy, but avoids making public appearances unless  he feels his presence is necessary to encourage reforms, his  youngest daughter Xiao Rong said in Tokyo on Tuesday [8 March].    "His only aim of appearing in public is to encourage better  (implementation of)... overall policies, to assist and help our  current leaders in even better implementing the route of  construction," Xiao said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE.    Xiao is in Tokyo to promote the Japanese edition of her book  My Father, Deng Xiaoping, the first part of a  biography of the 89-year old revolutionary covering the years up  to 1949.    In one of his rare public appearances the frail-looking Deng  was shown on television during the Chinese Lunar New Year  Festival last month.    On these occasions Xiao is always seen at her father's side  supporting him by the arm, whispering into his partially deaf  ears and translating his almost incomprehensible utterings.    She laughingly dismissed allegations that her  interpretations  of his utterings reflected more her own opinion than her  father's views, saying that was "incomprehension and ignorance."    "Wouldn't that be putting my father to a much too low  level?"  She said, adding that her father has no speech problems and  often talks for 30 minutes at a time.    At a press conference earlier in the day, Xiao said, "at the  moment (Deng) has no disease" and walks three-kilometers a day,  even during Beijing's cold winter weather.    Xiao said that although her father is frail, he is usually  amused by frequent foreign press reports that he is rumored to  have cancer or has already died.    The secret of her father's longevity is his regular routine,  she said. Deng wakes up at 7 A.M., reads the newspapers in the  morning, enjoys playing with his grandchildren in the afternoon  and plays bridge with old friends in the evening, she said.    Although he has given up all political posts, the mastermind  of China's market reforms is still believed to have his say in  major policy decisions.    Deng has complete confidence in the current leadership, said  Xiao, indicating that he has entrusted day-to-day politics  entirely to President Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Li Peng and  Vice Premier Zhu Rongji.    The three "actually come to see him very seldom," but still  consult with the senior leader on important matters, she said.  Yet Deng does not expect them to adopt his advice, which he  wants to be understood as "his personal opinion," she said.    Xiao adamantly dismissed efforts in China to create a new  personality cult around the father of China's socialist market  economy.    She said the Deng family would agree to setting up a  monument  after her father's death, but oppose the construction of a  pendant to Mao Zedong's mausoleum in Beijing.</p>

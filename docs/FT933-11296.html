			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / VSEL subsidised Navy ship bid VSEL Shipbuilding subsidised its winning bid for a Royal Navy ship in a competition against Swan Hunter, a government report said yesterday. But the Ministry of Defence was right to give the contract to VSEL because the price gap between the two bids was much bigger than the subsidy, says the National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog. Tyneside's Swan Hunter final bid of Pounds 210.6m to build the ship, a helicopter carrier, was Pounds 71m more than VSEL's final bid of Pounds 139.5m and Swans called in the receiver when it failed to win the contract. The NAO says the MoD estimated the level of VSEL's support at Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m on its final bid. But after the publication of the report sources close to the Barrow-in-Furness company said that the true figure was a little more than Pounds 10m. Mr Noel Davies, VSEL's chief executive, said: 'We have recovered all our variable overheads and have made a contribution to fixed overheads. It's a contract which is better to have than not to have.' The report also contradicts allegations by politicians that the MoD had unfairly favoured VSEL. It says the MoD 'treated both tenderers in a fair and even-handed manner'. Much of the Pounds 71m difference in the bids was the result of lower overheads at VSEL's civilian subcontractor, Kvaerner Govan on Scotland's River Clyde, it says. However, the NAO warns the MoD that if Swan Hunter closed, VSEL might have a monopoly over some types of shipbuilding. Mr Roger Vaughan, former joint chief executive of Swan Hunter, said: '(Creating a monopoly) is not an approach to the defence manufacturing industry which is likely to lead to the maintenance of a defence manufacturing base.' Mr Alex Marsh, also former joint chief executive, said Swan Hunter had understood that the MoD's budget was about Pounds 170m. He declined to comment on why, given this, the company thought a Pounds 210m bid might be acceptable. The report says the MoD was aware VSEL might become a monopoly supplier of large warships if Swans closed but it thought savings from competition in the bid more than outweighed the cost of keeping a high level of competition. 'Overall, the MoD concluded that these problems could only be addressed in the context of individual procurements and not as part of an abstract wider strategy,' the report says. The NAO identifies potential risks on the programme and lessons for the future: The MoD, aware that Swan Hunter faced receivership if the award of the contract were delayed, accelerated its timescale and changed its approach. This risked failing to identify the most cost-effective solution, although the department believed this risk was outweighed by the benefits of ensuring effective competition. Because of the short timescales for bids, the MoD was unable to carry out a full life-cycle cost assessment of the two bids. 'This has led to the department carrying the . . . financial risk that the vessel could be more expensive to operate than originally envisaged,' warns the report. The MoD's arrangements for merchant classification of the vessel, although refined during the course of competition, were not clearly spelt out in its initial contract documentation, leaving some risk. The NAO says: 'If the department are to continue procuring vessels which embody a mixture of commercial and military standards some consideration might be given to improving the expertise of the department's staff in connection with commercial standards.' The MoD's approach to availability, reliability and maintenance meant that it, rather than industry, bore the risk of achieving what it needed. While the department successfully transferred most of the financial risk to VSEL, through use of a fixed price, there remained a risk the total cost could rise if changes to specifications were not tightly controlled. The MoD also recognised, it adds, that it must monitor progress closely to obtain delivery of a vessel which met its specification on time and within the fixed price. The NAO says the bidding process was dealt with fairly but suggests informal meetings between the MoD and bidders should be avoided, and all meetings tape recorded. It also describes as 'disturbing' the fact that both tenderers obtained unofficial information on the budgetary provision; the decision not to provide this information was a key part of the MoD's procurement strategy.

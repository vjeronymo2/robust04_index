			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Amendment to Sections I-C-1-b-(2) and Deletion of Section III&hyph;A&hyph;2 of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Deliberate Release  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 6, 1990, the RAC Planning Subcommittee recommended that the requirement for RAC review of experiments involving deliberate environmental release of organisms containing recombinant DNA be eliminated from the NIH Guidelines. This recommendation reflects the fact that the Federal regulatory agencies, the USDA, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are responsible for the review and approval of environmental release experiments. The proposed amendment was published for public comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on April 29, 1991 (56 FR 19776). The RAC reviewed and recommended approval of the proposed amendment at its May 30&hyph;31, 1991, meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actions are detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions. I accept these recommendations, and the NIH Guidelines will be amended accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Amendments to Sections I, III, IV, and V, and Appendix M of the NIH Guidelines Regarding NIH/ORDA Review and Approval of Certain Categories of Human Gene Transfer Experiments That Qualify for the Accelerated Review Process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 3, 1993, and March 3&hyph;4, 1994, the Working Group on Accelerated Review Protocols presented an overview of the proposed amendments to the NIH Guidelines. The proposed amendments will: (1) Establish an accelerated review process for certain categories of human gene transfer experiments, (2) allow the NIH/Office of Recombinant DNA Activities to assign the appropriate review category to all human gene transfer proposals that are submitted in compliance with the NIH Guidelines, (3) allow the NIH/Office of Recombinant DNA Activities to approve those categories of human gene transfer experiments that qualify for the accelerated review process in consultation with the Chair and one or more RAC members, as necessary, and (4) exempt certain experiments involving the transfer of recombinant DNA or DNA or RNA derived from recombinant DNA into one or more human subjects which are not covered by Section V&hyph;U. All human gene transfer experiments approved by the NIH/Office of Recombinant DNA Activities through the accelerated review process will be provided in a report by the RAC Chair at the next regularly scheduled RAC meeting and will be included in the list of approved experiments which is available from the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendments were published for public comment in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59612) and February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6702). The RAC reviewed and unanimously recommended approval of the proposed amendments at its March 3&hyph;4, 1994, meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The actions are detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions.

Amendments to Section V&hyph;U of the NIH Guidelines Regarding Recombinant DNA Vaccines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 3, 1994, the Working Group on Vaccines presented an overview of the proposed amendment to the footnote in Section V&hyph;U. The proposed amendment will define those categories of experiments involving the administration of recombinant DNA vaccines that are exempt from RAC review and NIH and Institutional Biosafety Committee approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed amendment was published for public comments in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on February 11, 1994 (59 FR 6702). The proposed amendment was revised by the RAC at its March 3&hyph;4, 1994, meeting. The revised amendment was unanimously approved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The action is detailed in Section II_Summary of Actions.

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Bhutto's husband bailed MR Asif Ali Zardari, the husband of Pakistan's opposition leader Ms Benazir Bhutto, has been released on bail after spending over two years in prison for charges including aiding an attempted kidnap, writes Farhan Bokhari in Lahore. Mr Zardari's release is widely viewed as part of an opposition-government rapprochement in Pakistan, although both sides deny such moves. Other recent indications included a government-backed nomination for Ms Bhutto to chair the parliamentary committee on foreign relations. Less than three months ago, Ms Bhutto led a public campaign to remove prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif's government on allegations of corruption. Although she failed, many politicians conceded that Mr Sharif's effort to liberalise the economy and was suffering from an image of a politically unstable country.</p>

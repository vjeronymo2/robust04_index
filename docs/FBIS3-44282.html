			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 29 Dec (XINHUA) -- The Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS] sent a letter today  to Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], welcoming plans  by SEF Vice Chairman and Secretary General Jiao Renhe to visit  Beijing in mid January.    In reply to an SEF letter inviting a suitable ARATS official  to visit Taiwan for a "face-to-face consultation on SEF-ARATS  affairs," ARATS on 20 December sent a letter to the SEF,  expressing consent. However, in its second letter to ARATS dated  23 December, the SEF said it was unable to go proceed with the  invitation and expressed the hope that a responsible SEF  official might visit Beijing for consultations.    In today's reply letter to SEF, ARATS said: The talks on the  basis of the "ARATS-SEF Agreement on the System of Mutual  Contact and Talks" held between responsible ARATS and SEF  officials are conducive to further expanding ARATS-SEF  cooperation, to implementing the results of the Wang-Gu meeting,  and to promoting the development of cross-strait relations.  Therefore, it is appropriate to hold the talks in either Taibei  [Taipei] or Beijing. In view of the fact that it is  inconvenient for SEF to proceed with its invitation, ARATS is  willing to adhere to its original plan to welcome Mr. Jiao Renhe  to Beijing after 15 January at a time to be agreed by both  sides, to hold face-to-face consultations on a meeting between  Chairman Wang Daohan and Mr. Gu Zhenfu [Ku Chen-fu] and on  ARATS-SEF affairs, and to exchange views on matters of mutual  interest.</p>

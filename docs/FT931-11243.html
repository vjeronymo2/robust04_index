			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / International Company News: New Indian car targeted at Europe MARUTI Udyog, jointly owned by Suzuki Motor, the Japanese minicar producer, and the Indian government, is developing a small car for export to Europe, Reuter reports from New Dehli. Mr RC Bhargava, Maruti managing director, said the Maruti Y-2, a four-door hatchback with a one litre engine, would be be unveiled after trial production begins in April. Maruti plans to manufacture about 70,000 of the cars a year by the end of 1994 and about 50,000 will be for export, Mr Bhargava said. The rest will be sold locally. 'Europe will be the right market for this car,' Mr Bhargava said, adding it would be fuel-efficient and meet European emission standards. The Y-2 would replace Maruti's 800cc model currently sold in Hungary, Italy, Poland and Portugal. Mr Bhargava said he expected the Y-2 to compete against Fiat, Peugeot and Renault compacts. Maruti exported 23,000 of its 800cc model, the largest selling car in India, in the year to March 1992. Exports for 1992-93 are expected to be only about 16,000, because of the war in the former Yugoslavia, which used to be a large market.</p>

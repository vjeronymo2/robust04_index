			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, The Netherlands (4): A period of rapid change - Co-operatives VISITING the offices of Interpolis insurance in the bleak southern Dutch town of Tilburg, the mutual company still seems provincial and close to its roots as an insurer of Dutch farmers. Receptionists do not speak English. Staff are unfamiliar with the names of their counterparts at Rabobank, the giant Utrecht-based bank which took virtually complete control of Interpolis nearly two years ago. And senior executives still refer to their prospective merger partners, Avero Centraal Beheer, based in the small northern town of Appeldoorn, as coming from 'north of the rivers' - the largely urban area north of the Rhine and the Moose. But appearances prove to be deceiving. Like other Dutch mutual and co-operative banks and insurers, Interpolis is undergoing a period of rapid change. For one thing the mutuals are embracing the fashion for mergers which has take hold of the country's financial services sector since legal change in 1990. Rabobank, the Netherlands' second-biggest bank, has linked up with Interpolis, taking over control of the insurer two years ago. In a further step, Interpolis will merge with Avero Centraal Beheer, which is itself the product of a 1990 merger between Centraal Beheer and a group of smaller mutuals. Having agreed merger plans last November, in June Interpolis and AVCB agreed to a share exchange, swapping 15 per cent holdings. Interpolis and AVCB senior executives will exchange seats on each other's supervisory and management boards. Both Interpolis and Rabobank agreed to harmonise their information and distribution systems. Before the end of 1993 the two groups are planning a full merger, although negotiations about the final shape of the new holding company and Rabobank's share within it are still continuing. In any event, the new insurance conglomerate, will be the country's second-biggest, with annual premium income in the Netherlands of Fl 5.5bn, while the broader financial holding will provide Internationale Nederlanden Groepe, the country's biggest holding group, with its stiffest competition. The logic of the merger is to bring together Rabobank's strength as a distributor - its dense branch network and loyal customer base - with Interpolis' expertise in administration. The allocation of costs between the bank and insurer has evidently caused some teething problems, especially taking into account the fact that Rabobank's bank branches enjoy an unusual degree of autonomy. 'It will take some time before we can fully realise the synergies,' says Mr Antonius van Bijsterveldt, of Interpolis. But both parties appear convinced of the long-term strategic sense of the merger. Already the Interpolis link-up with Rabobank has yielded fruit. Since 1990, sales of single premium bonds in Rabobank's network of 2,500 branches have boomed. Interpolis doubled its income from sales of new life insurance premiums between 1990 and 1991, increasing its share of the market for new life business from 8 per cent to 14 per cent. In other respects too, the mutual insurers are at the forefront of the battle for distribution. Centraal Beheer pioneered direct sales of motor and health insurance in the Netherlands, selling direct to the public via a combination of media advertising, telephone sales and the use of state-of-the-art expert systems. In the mid-1980s, Centraal Beheer won 60 per cent of the private health market by direct sales, halving the Dutch brokers' share of the market. According to a recent study by Salomon Brothers, the share of the personal lines insurance market enjoyed by Dutch direct writers - of about 20 per cent - is higher than in any other European country. AVCB is now the third-largest Dutch insurer with 13 per cent of the car and group pensions market and 11 per cent of the annuity markets. Dutch mutuals, like their publicly-quoted counterparts, are increasingly turning their attention to the broader European market by linking up with mutuals in other European countries. Rabobank has links with France's Credit Agricole, Belgium's SERA and Spain's Banco Popular. Interpolis has lined up alongside Groupama of France, Assurantie Van Belgische Boerenbond of Belgium, the Farmers Union of the UK and R&amp;V Versicherungs of Germany. It is AVCB, however, which has taken co-operation to its furthest extent. Earlier this year, AVCB cemented a relationship with three northern European companies to form the Eureko partnership in a deal which contains two significant pointers for Dutch mutuals. Firstly, the four partners - AVCB, Friends Provident of the UK, Wasa of Sweden and Topdanmark of Denmark - have agreed to pool their interests outside their own domestic markets into a common holding company, called EUREKO. Secondly, the link-up has brought AVCB into direct contact with two companies that have chosen to change their de-mutualisation status. Both Wasa and Topdanmark de-mutualised in order to gain easier access to capital markets to finance future growth, following an example set by some of the world's biggest mutual companies such as Mapfre of Spain. Mr Van Bijsterveldt is cautious about the future course of the new merged group's international co-operation. For the moment, Rabobank's cheap retail deposit base provides a relatively cheap source of capital for the group as a whole. 'Capital is not a problem with the banks behind us,' he says. So, in the short term, Interpolis' more cautious approach seems likely to set the tone.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Surveys reflect different concerns Sir, There has been speculation over the perceived discrepancy between the recent British Chambers of Commerce and Confederation of British Industry surveys ('CBI survey affirms steady economic recovery', January 25). When comparing like with like there is little difference between the two. As the chancellor noted, the BCC survey shows the recovery remains on track, and that in manufacturing there has been an improved performance, particularly in terms of exports and confidence. Chambers' concerns lie with the slowdown in the rate of growth in the service sector, including small firms - the engine room of the economy - an area not as widely covered by the CBI. It is understandable that our different constituencies provide a different perspective on the state of the economy. Each has its value to business and policymakers. Richard Brown, deputy managing director, Association of British Chambers of Commerce, 9 Tufton Street, London SW1</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: These days, Israeli officials are  stepping up their statements on the peace process and are urging  Syria to speed up the peace talks before the U.S. administration  halts its efforts to push the talks forward due to its numerous  other international preoccupations. What is strange in these  statements is that Israel is speaking for the United States and  its officials in order to put pressure on Syria on behalf of the  United States. Has President Clinton's administration authorized  Israeli officials to speak for it about the peace process, or  are the Tel Aviv rulers trying to hint that time is moving  quickly and that Syria should catch the train of unilateral  deals to bring about peace before it misses both the train and  the fruits of these deals?    Speaking about Warren Christopher's time limits, Itamar  Rabinovich, Israeli ambassador in Washington and head of the  Israeli negotiating team with Syria, has warned that everyone  should know that the opportunity is limited. Ambassador  Rabinovich's statement is not the first nor the last of its  kind. Israeli officials make proposals every day that have  nothing to do with the bases of the peace process. Sometimes  they demand that the level of the talks be promoted and at other  times they declare that they want to know the nature of the  peace Syria will give to them or they allege Syria is not  serious in its talk about peace. In all cases, however, they  stress they will not withdraw from the Golan Heights, although  they have voiced their readiness to carry out some kind of  withdrawal from the Golan Heights--a withdrawal that will not  end the Israeli occupation or return the rights and the land to  their rightful owners.    Its threats that the opportunity is limited and that time is  short shows the true Israeli positions and the nature of  Israel's intentions. The Israeli officials, who have wasted a  great deal of time in futile talks over more than two and half  years, are trying to use the same weapon of time against Syria  to embarrass it in the international arena and portray it as the  side that is hampering the peace process. These officials are  mistaken if they believe that such attempts may succeed in  making Syria enter into the trap of unilateral deals, as they  succeeded with some sides, in order not to appear as an obstacle  on the way to peace.    These attempts will not affect Syria's known position and  cannot mislead the world public opinion, which knows the true  situation in the region, as well those who are placing obstacles  on the way to peace. Syria has always asserted that it is a  peace-loving state. The whole world, led by the U.S. and the  American sponsors of the peace process, also knows this fact.  Syria's desire to establish peace does not mean it will accept  unilateral deals or secret talks because of the time limit.  Such deals have weakened the momentum of the peace process and  lessened prospects of bringing about a just and comprehensive  peace that can stand fast in the face of changes and meet the  aspirations of the region's peoples and the world.    It is true that Syria wants peace, but it is also true that  it is not in a hurry. The peace that Syria seeks is based on  two principles: Justice and comprehensiveness in accordance  with relevant UN resolutions--a peace that can restore the land  and the rights regardless of time. What is important is the  achievement of that peace. Syria is not responsible for  hampering the peace march and wasting time. The whole world is  well aware of who is responsible for that. A desire for peace  can never mean embarking on the first train carrying that word.  First, we have to make sure that the train is on the right  railway. Otherwise, the peace train will not move, and even if  it moves, it will not reach its target.</p>

			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Credito Italiano Those expecting bargain-basement prices from Italy's privatisation programme are in for a disappointment. The 9.6 per cent discount at which shares in Credito Italiano have been priced is markedly less generous than offered by France for the sale of BNP. It can only be assumed the discount reflects confidence in the strength of international demand. Credito's shares have already fallen by 30 per cent from the peak reached in January. The recent fall of the Milan market and the fluid political situation are reminders of the risks. An orderly restructuring of Ferruzzi, which now looks likely, will help settle nerves. With around L1,000bn caught up in the restructuring net - and twice that amount lent to the sprawling empire as a whole - Credito is worryingly exposed. A hefty provision against this and other bad debts this year looks inevitable, but receivership for Ferruzzi would have been the worst of all possible worlds. Once this year's bad debt provision is quantified, investors will rest easier still. Besides, it is difficult to justify buying Credito for the earnings prospects this year or next. Provisioning aside, 1994 will be a difficult year, as trading income from the bond market declines and interest margins are squeezed. The strength of recovery thereafter turns on management's ability to develop fee income. Credito's life insurance marketing agreement with Commercial Union is an opportunity in this regard. Shepherding depositors in the direction of privatisation issues is another.</p>

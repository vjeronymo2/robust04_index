			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Hutchison Whampoa back in black with HKDollars 2.52bn HUTCHISON Whampoa, Hong Kong's largest conglomerate, yesterday announced a strong turnround in interim earnings, with net profit of HKDollars 2.52bn (USDollars 325.2m) for the six months to June, compared with a loss of HKDollars 76m in the same period in 1992. The greatest impetus for the increase was the performance of 49 per cent-owned Canadian oil and gas company Husky, which suffered substantial losses during 1992 and forced a provision of HKDollars 1.42bn at the interim stage. Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said Husky contributed a profit in the first half of 1991. The group's core businesses also performed strongly. Turnover rose to HKDollars 11.52bn and operating profit was up 22 per cent to HKDollars 2.47bn. Hong Kong International Terminals, the 61 per cent-owned port operator, saw a 22 per cent increase in container throughput during the period, and profits were boosted by lower interest and depreciation charges. Hutchison's port operations in Zhuhai, in China's Pearl River delta, and Felixstowe, in the UK, also reported profit increases. There were strong contributions from property sales, particularly from the group's 50 per cent-owned South Horizons development. The group's telecommunications ambitions continued to sap earnings. Mr Li said: 'Losses incurred by the group's overseas telecommunications interests have offset to a large extent the profits generated by the group's successful telecommunications businesses in Hong Kong.' The company is expected to make provisions of around HKDollars 600m against its lossmaking Rabbit CT2 telepoint business in the UK during the second half of the year. However, this will be offset by an extraordinary profit of HKDollars 1.5bn from Hutchison's recent sale of 32 per cent of its stake in Star Television. Mr Li said Hutchison would continue to expand into China, despite the current austerity programme. 'The group is well-positioned to participate in suitable property, power plant, container terminal and retail projects in China, which reflect the group's expertise in its existing core businesses,' he said. The directors declared an interim dividend of 19 cents a share, compared with 16 cents a share in 1992.</p>

On March 26, while making a round of frontline units of the  puppet Army, he incited war fever against the North, crying for  a flawless "posture for countermove".    It cannot go unnoticed that the South Korean puppets are  fanning confrontation with the North at a time when the  perfidious U.S. warlikers are aggravating the situation on the  Korean peninsula by threatening the resumption of the "Team  Spirit" joint military exercises this year and ordering the  deployment of "Patriot" missiles in South Korea after totally  reversing the agreed conclusions reached between the DPRK and  the United States in New York.    Facts show that the South Korean puppets are getting more  frenzied with the passage of time in driving inter-Korean  relations to the brink of war on the order of the U.S. masters.    The South Korean puppet clique are trying to ignite a war  against the DPRK, following the adventurous war moves of the  U.S. imperialists. But they would be well advised to mind that  they would eventfully die a miserable death in the flame they  kindled.</p>

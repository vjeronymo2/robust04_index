			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CASTLE PARK SPRINTER MOODY NARROWLY WINS FIRST BIG SHOWDOWN IN 100  </P> <P> After running a hand-timed 10.7 100 meters on a dirt track on Thursday at  Southwest High, Castle Park's Kiyoshi Moody was looking forward to his first  sprint on an all-weather surface.  </P> <P> He also was looking forward to running against two of the county's fastest  sprinters, Orange Glen's Glen Reyes, who ran a 10.7 last Thursday, and Mira  Mesa's Bobby Nelson, who has run 10.8.  </P> <P> Call it good timing, then, that the Titan Relays came along on Saturday and  promised Moody an all-weather track, Reyes and Nelson.  </P> <P> Finally, Moody thought, a chance to run a race in which he would actually be  challenged and perhaps could push his time lower. Moody said he was "pushed"  Thursday, but it was really more of a nudge from Southwest's Riley Washington,  who finished in the mid-11s.  </P> <P> So there Moody was Saturday afternoon, lining up for the invitational 100.  There already had been one disappointment. Reyes failed to show.  </P> <P> That set up a showdown between Moody and Nelson.  </P> <P> Nelson got the early jump as Moody slipped out of the blocks, but when the two  came within a stride of the tape, they were dead even.  </P> <P> It came down to the lean, and Moody was able to bow his shoulders slightly  farther than Nelson to eke out the victory a hand-timed 10.95 (the electronic  timing equipment wasn't working). Nelson finished at 10.99.  </P> <P> "The only thing I'm disappointed in was the start," Moody said. "The starter  didn't give me enough time to get set."  </P> <P> Despite being unable to match or beat 10.7, Moody nevertheless came out of the  race with a smile. He quickly put the 10.95 in perspective.  </P> <P> "My best time last year was 10.95," Moody said. "And that didn't come until  state.  </P> <P> "Last year at this time I was at 11.2 . . . When the Orange Glen Invitational  comes along (April 15), I hope to be down to 10.7, or 10.6."  </P> <P> Don't get the wrong idea. Moody is not forecasting himself as the section  champion. Not yet.  </P> <P> "All year long, it's going to be a battle between Nelson, Reyes and myself," he  said.  </P> <P> Moody just won the first battle.  </P> <P> While many of the day's times and distances were slow and short, three stood  out. New South Wales of Australia set a meet record in the girls' 3,200 meter  relay, running 9:39.4 to beat the 9:43.86 set by Anaheim Esperanza in 1985.  </P> <P> In the girls' triple jump, Henry's Rachelle Johnson soared 39-feet-3.  </P> <P> The Mira Mesa boys' 400-meter relay finished in 42.9, the only team under 43.  Don Elder, Nelson, Marshall Evans and Gene Metcalf ran together for only the  second time this year.  </P> <P> Elder, in fact, was running hard for the first time in three weeks, having just  recuperated from a left hamstring pull. He ran the opening leg, faltering at  the start as he slipped out of the blocks.  </P> <P> "I took off so hard that the blocks went flying back," Elder said. "And if I  hadn't slipped up, our time would have been a lot better."  </P> <P> It also would have been faster had the handoff from Evans to Metcalf gone  smoothly, but Metcalf inadvertently put back the wrong hand to accept the  baton.  </P> <P> Despite the goof, Metcalf maintained Mira Mesa's lead over second-place Poway  (43.14). JOHN GEIS Baseball Nonleague Escondido 5, Orange Glen 3 -- Gerald  Cabral was two for four with three RBIs, two in the second inning, for visiting  Escondido. Herman Moreno had a double and Shannon Bije two RBIs for Orange Glen  (7-7). Grossmont 4, Oceanside 1 -- The Pirates (8-5) failed to score in four  bases-loaded situations and left 15 men on base. John Eichhorst hit a double, a  single and had one RBI for visiting Grossmont (7-3-1).  </P></p>

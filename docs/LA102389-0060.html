			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> PHOTOGRAPHY LIES AND TRICKS ARE FOCUS OF 'INVESTIGATIONS'  </P> <P> Four Los Angeles artists in their 30s blithely spin a few fantasies to  demonstrate how photographs lie. Their targets are not just photographs, but  any type of information that reaches us at second hand.  </P> <P> Gathered under the title "Deliberate Investigations" at the Los Angeles County  Museum of Art (to Nov. 12), installations by David Bunn, Una Barth, Connie  Hatch and Dede Bazyk range from complex and clever to simple-minded. You have  to work pretty hard to get to the bottom of things, but the effort is nearly  always worthwhile.  </P> <P> Bunn's piece "Curvature (Some Projections)" sets up competing systems of  classification. Based on Frederick Kiesler's 1942 design for Peggy Guggenheim's  gallery, Art of This Century, the installation is as tricky and self-reflective  as a hall of mirrors.  </P> <P> The dislocating effect begins with the strange, convex shape of the  birch-paneled room. The walls are studded with wood brackets holding what  appear to be colorful tiles. Actually, they are Polaroids of out-of-focus  details from maps.  </P> <P> A series of 12 "guides" to the installation provide sources for fragments of  information painted on the wood brackets. But each guide offers a different  frame of reference, pertaining to Guggenheim, her gallery or even the  geographical regions in the photos.  </P> <P> As you immerse yourself in it, this witty, extraordinarily intelligent piece  begins to suggest an analog to the way the mind sifts through immense  quantities of information that may reaffirm, negate or enlarge on facts the  brain already has stored away.  </P> <P> Una Barth groups black-and-white photographs and abstract images taken from  various sources to create a heightened awareness of seeing as a visceral  activity. The work forces you to become aware of the visceral activity of  looking and the invasive bullying nature of shock effects. In "Untitled No. 6,  Configuration No. 2," Barth juxtaposes images of a helicopter's beam in the  night sky with a solar eclipse, a dizzying sunburst pattern and a woman picked  out of the darkness by a conical beam of light. The abrupt light and dark  contrasts, the optical strain induced by the graphic pattern and the emphasis  on both revelation and concealment create a cruelly intense effect.  </P> <P> Connie Hatch's photo-and-text installation, "Some Americans" from "A Display of  Visual Inequity: Forced to Disappear," makes for some fascinating reading. But  the visual and visceral impact of the piece doesn't have enough oomph.  </P> <P> Illuminated by lights on the floor, 24 black-and-white photo-transparencies of  faces cast elongated shadows of themselves on the wall. The faces belong to  people who have "disappeared" -- died before their time or simply vanished due  to causes beyond their control.  </P> <P> The images come from various sources: the face of a little girl who disappeared  from her home, from a carpet-cleaning ad; the image of the blues singer Bessie  Smith, who died after being denied admittance to a "whites only" hospital, from  an album cover. Texts explain the circumstances of each case.  </P> <P> But the lighting effects -- which also cause the viewer's shadow to fall across  the images -- aren't sufficiently dramatic to create a sense of the  "transitoriness of memory," as the catalogue suggests, or notion that the  viewer is momentarily blotting out history.  </P> <P> Culled from biology textbooks, Bazyk's brightly colored, hugely enlarged  free-standing and hanging models of blood cells, bones, pupae and other  biological imagery have the inviting, fun-zone look of a children's museum  display. But the premise behind this installation -- that science today offers  only cold, irrelevant theories rather than warm, friendly facts we can observe  for ourselves -- seems confused.  </P></p>

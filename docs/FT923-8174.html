			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Gulf war echoes reverberate through Yemen's economy: Aid and remittances from Arab neighbours have all but dried up, leaving only austerity YEMEN continues to pay a high price for its stance on the Gulf war more than a year after the end of hostilities. Before the war, as one local businessman puts it, the country's economy relied largely on 'aid, remittances, and some austerity'. But the reaction of Yemen's main pre-war benefactors to its Gulf war stand has deprived the country of much of the first two, leaving it with larger-than-ever doses of the third. Yemen remains isolated for failing to support the US-led coalition against Iraq and has since suffered economic hardship with few signs of this easing. Any improvement in Yemen's prospects depends on its developing better relations with Saudi Arabia and northern neighbours in the Gulf, a view made clear by Mr David Mack, the US assistant deputy secretary of state. 'US relations with all the Arab Gulf states are exceptionally strong and close. It is difficult to invigorate relations with Yemen unless it achieves a minimum of rapprochement with the Gulf countries,' Mr Mack said. But Saudi Arabia and Kuwait remain resentful over Yemen's stand during the war. Although the Yemenis condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, they failed to support restoration of the ruling Al-Sabah family and, worse in terms of their relations with Gulf neighbours, they criticised Saudi Arabia for allowing foreign troops into the region. Faced with hostility to their own position in the war from their southern neighbour, the Saudis responded in September 1990 by cutting aid to Yemen and by expelling around 1m Yemenis. The economic effects were immediate. The loss of remittances ended a main source of hard currency for Yemen, and the sudden 10 per cent increase in the country's population, added further burdens to the chronically unbalanced economy. Yemen is already the most populous, with 13m people, and least prosperous state in the Arabian peninsula, relying on foreign aid estimated at Dollars 500m (Pounds 261.7m) annually and on remittances of up to Dollars 1.5bn a year. Its oil income, from exports and sales of new concessions over the past year, amounted to Dollars 1.15bn. As a result Yemen was last year unable to meet some four-fifths of its foreign debt commitments. Outstanding foreign debt is now put at Dollars 7.8bn, two-thirds of which is owed to eastern European countries. Moreover, fast-rising inflation and unemployment have contributed to social tensions which last October erupted in a rash of anti-government riots. Though the government of General Ali Abdullah Saleh has been able to contain such problems, dissatisfaction with the economy remains high. To try and temper this discontent, the government has sought recourse largely to promises of future prosperity from the country's promising oil reserves. Officially referred to as 'transitional' the Saleh regime came to power with the unification of North and South Yemen in May 1990 and is charged with effecting democratic reform and multi-party elections by November this year. The process of democratisation has faced difficulties. There have been assassination attempts on members of the Yemen Socialist Party, including the prime minister, but so far no one has been brought to trial. The government has encountered opposition from fundamentalist groups, which although few in number, may be linked with international Islamic organisations bent on disrupting democratic movements throughout the Arab world. With such backing local groups have persistently opposed Yemen's democratic reforms and the worsening economy has played into their hands. The spectre of Algeria is on the minds of Yemen's rulers, who fear that fundamentalists may have fertile campaigning ground while the economy remains so beleaguered. There is therefore the sense of a urgency to exploit the country's newly found oil reserves. Few Yemenis doubt that Saudi Arabia is behind efforts to undermine their emerging democracy. 'The Saudis', said one businessman, 'are using our position on the Gulf war as a pretext. Their real aim is to weaken our economy in order to destroy our unity and democracy'. Armed with such suspicions, Yemen may indeed have difficulty in affecting any rapprochment with its Gulf neighbours or with the west. Faced with domestic recessions the US and UK are not likely to jeopardise their trade relations with the Gulf by assisting Yemen.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A TOUCHSTONE FOR HIS TIMES;  </P> <P> POEMS OLD AND NEW BY DONALD HALL (TICKNOR &amp; FIELDS: $24.95, CLOTH; $12.95,  PAPER; 244 PP.)  </P> <P> A reader looking for a reliable guide to the ebbs and flows of recent American  poetry, its quicksilver shiftings of shape and sensibility, might do far worse  than to consult Donald Hall's "Poems Old and New," a gathering of work spanning  the years from 1947 to 1990.  </P> <P> More clearly perhaps than an anthology, in which general developments are  refracted through the personal styles of many different poets, Hall's book  charts the major watersheds that our poetry has crossed in the last 40 years as  registered by a single artist. The fact that the most impressive poems come in  the last 60 pages of the book says more about Hall's own special talents than  about the progress of American poetry; the main styles of the last 15 years  evidently have proven more congenial to his imagination than those of the  previous 25.  </P> <P> It must be noted that one reason Hall's poetry provides such a useful index to  changes in period style is that Hall doesn't display a clearly recognizable  style of his own. A poet of skill and intelligence, possessed of a particularly  fine ear, Hall has been overshadowed by the more original poets of his  remarkably rich generation, many of whom he has promoted as a reviewer and  editor of anthologies. Poets such as Robert Bly, Louis Simpson, Galway Kinnell,  W. D. Snodgrass and James Wright have been both friends of Hall and  beneficiaries of his generous praise.  </P> <P> At times, Hall permits his admiration to shade into imitation; a number of the  poems in this book openly draw on the stylistic resources of Bly, Simpson,  Kinnell and others. Inevitably, these poems fall short of their models, since  style at second-hand tends to lose its original force, becoming mannered and  unconvincing.  </P> <P> Even when his poems can't be traced to the influence of a single figure, they  seem to follow more general shifts in poetic fashions. Thus Hall moves from the  hard, ironic, New Critical formalism of his early work to the open, "naked,"  quasi-surrealist mode that took hold in the '60s, from there pushing on to more  extended narrative and descriptive forms in the '70s and '80s.  </P> <P> The very look of the poems changes dramatically as one thumbs through the  volume, at first regimented into orderly stanzaic blocks in the '50s, suddenly  dwindling in the '60s to irregular wisps of language, slowly fattening out in  the '70s, finally returning in the '80s to what looks like the regular blocks  of verse with which the book opens. Needless to say, these changes go much  deeper as well, and the poems at the end of the book only superficially  resemble those of the beginning; for one thing, they're much better.  </P> <P> If Hall never entirely escapes the pressures of period style, such pressures  can have salutary effects when combined with a strong personal disposition. In  his more recent poetry, Hall has increasingly come into his own, finding forms  and methods that serve his gifts better than either the constrictive wit of  '50s formalism or the loose, associative Imagism of the '60s.  </P> <P> Starting in the mid-'70s, Hall's poems begin to expand, both in length and  width; his line grows more capacious, his poems divide themselves into uneven  sections, as if marking stages in a meditation; most important, they start to  show a new attention to subject matter.  </P> <P> Here, too, Hall may have been swimming with the current; many poets in the '70s  allowed themselves a new freedom to explore subjects, adopting some of the  flexibility of prose to the contemplative aims of poetry. Be that as it may,  Hall seems much more at ease in this style than he did with the short,  image-based lyric of the '60s and early '70s. Hall's imagination is not  metaphorical but meditative; he is better at connecting and weaving images and  thoughts than he is at producing individual metaphors that startle us with  their incongruity and rightness. His longer poems of the last 15 years are  moving, elegiac meditations on the rhythms of natural process and the  ubiquitous presence of death.  </P> <P> Many of these recent poems are set on or near the New Hampshire farm where Hall  has resided since leaving his academic post at the University of Michigan in  1975. A number of them are Lawrentian animal poems, in which pigs, sheep,  horses, cows and chickens take turns embodying the generational cycles of life  and death. Others trace the history of the farm as it came down to Hall from  his grandparents.  </P> <P> What ties these poems together is a common concern with mortality and  transience, the eternal counterpoint of what passes and what remains, or as  Hall titles one poem, "Granite and Grass." At times, this theme is too baldly  stated; death in the abstract may be too boring in its very terror to serve  poetry's demands for intricacy and surprise. The farm poems are most engaging  when they dwell on the sensuous reality of creature and landscape, without  allegorizing them out of existence.  </P> <P> To my mind, the best poems in the book come in its last two sections,  containing work from the '80s. Here Hall moves in still another direction,  pressing outward from the circle of his own history and geography to take in  the experience and especially the suffering of others. There are some fine  dramatic monologues that evoke the quiet dross of the quotidian as a backdrop  for tragedies of aging and suicide; these poems combine the linguistic pressure  of poetry with the circumstantial density of fiction.  </P> <P> But Hall's most exciting work to date goes beyond the frame of the individual  life altogether: In a number of recent poems here, and even more in his 1988  long poem "The One Day" (which unfortunately is not excerpted in "Poems Old and  New"), Hall experiments with a form that weaves together heterogenous strands  of history, narrative, prophecy and description, producing a thickly textured  tapestry with dissonant energies.  </P> <P> In their ongoing tangle of details, these poems resemble linguistic fugues;  motifs recur, are developed, fused with other motifs, and the effect is to  capture some of the profusion and variety of life, even when the ground tone is  death. Miniature versions of this form are "Six Naps in One Day" and "The  Coffee Cup"; the most extended example, and the last poem of the book, is  "Praise for Death." I can offer only a taste of this mode:  </P> <P> </P> <P> Everything  </P> <P>  is strange, nothing is strange:  </P> <P>  yarn, the moon, gray hair in a bun.  </P> <P> New Hampshire, putting on socks.  </P> <P> It does no disservice to Hall to say that none of the poems in this book are as  good as the book-length "The One Day," which won the National Book Critics  Circle Award. In its ambitious scope and dazzling complexity, that poem  succeeds in rising above the changing tides of period style, touching a height  at which decades become irrelevant.  </P> <P> If it does nothing else, "Poems Old and New" helps to make that achievement  seem all the more impressive, by showing how long it took Hall to find a style  that answered to his own imaginative needs and strengths.  </P></p>

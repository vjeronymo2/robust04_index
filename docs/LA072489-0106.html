			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KROC DONATES KENNEDY LETTER  </P> <P> San Diego Padres owner Joan Kroc donated to the Hall of Fame today a letter  written in 1959 by John F. Kennedy to Jackie Robinson pledging support in  fighting racial injustice.  </P> <P> Kroc, who purchased the letter in order to give it to the Hall of Fame, made  the presentation to Hall of Fame President Edward Stack.  </P> <P> "When I heard about the letter, I knew it was something the Hall of Fame should  have," Kroc said.  </P> <P> Robinson was the first player to break the racial barriers in major league  baseball and is a member of the Hall of Fame.  </P> <P> "This document deserves to be in the Hall of Fame," Stack said.  </P> <P> "There is still a lot of work to do, but we've come a long way," Kroc said of  baseball's progress in minority hiring.  </P> <P> Kennedy was a member of the U.S. Senate when he wrote the letter and was  elected President a year later.  </P></p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Del Monte seeks European partner Anglo-American Corporation, South Africa's largest group, hopes to double the turnover of its Del Monte Food International arm through a merger with a European foods company. Anglo, which is heavily dependent on minerals, moved into the global branded foods market when it paid Dollars 240m (Pounds 150m) for its share of Del Monte in 1992. Mr Graham Boustred, Anglo's deputy chairman, says that if the merger, due to be completed in three months, goes ahead it will double DMFI's annual turnover to Pounds 1bn. He hopes organic growth will add another Pounds 500m. Del Monte used to be owned by RJR Nabisco of the US, but was sold off piecemeal - the fresh fruit business going to Polly Peck, for example. Anglo and South Africa's Royal Foods acquired DMFI for Pounds 360m from a management buy-out. Anglo owns 28.5 per cent of Delhold, DMFI's South African parent. DMFI cans fruit and beverages in Kenya and the Philippines as well as South Africa and its strongest markets are Italy and the UK. Mr Boustred says the potential merger would add strength in Germany and the Benelux countries. The enlarged DMFI hopes to move into mainland China where Mr Boustred says there is a growing demand for fresh fruit drinks. It plans to build a beverage plant in Shanghai with a local partner. Mr Boustred describes DMFI as a good hedge against the performance of the financial rand because most of its sales are in Europe. He reckons that the business is now worth Pounds 100m more than was paid for it even though on the Johannesburg stock exchange the shares are below the price at which they were issued. South Africa's 15 years of political isolation left the Del Monte plant in the country lagging behind internationally. Mr Carlo Zingaro, an Italian who has worked for Del Monte since 1965, has been installed as managing director and brought with him a team of European experts. Last year R25m (Pounds 3.62m) was spent upgrading the plant at Tulbargh, which cans 70,000 tonnes of fruit a year. It is South Africa's biggest plant of its kind, responsible for 40 per cent of the country's canned fruit exports. Mr Zingaro says another R16m will be needed to continue the upgrading.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / People: Sinclair to co-ordinate Europe at Dell Dell, the world's fastest growing computer company, is reorganising its European business as it evolves from youthful entrepreneur to sophisticated multinational business. Bruce Sinclair, European vice president, has been given charge of all Dell's sales, marketing and service operations in Europe. A new team of seven country managers, including Michael Swalwell in the UK, will report to him. He says the move is designed to streamline and co-ordinate the company's European activities which had become fragmented and inefficient. While planning and treasury management were carried out at the company's headquarters in Austin, Texas, Europe had become a number of small, separate, businesses reporting to the US. Sinclair joined Dell in 1988 to launch Dell Canada, which had become that country's fastest growing company by 1991. He was appointed vice-president of Europe 18 months ago. Before Dell, he had been chief executive of Harris Systems, the electronics and semiconductor concern. Denis O'Kelley, formerly with Digital Equipment and Burroughs (now Unisys), has been appointed first vice-president of European customer service and Philippe D'Argent, formerly managing director of Dell France, has been appointed vice-president, European marketing. Dell was formed in 1984 by Michael Dell, then 19 years old, on the then revolutionary premise that personal computers could be sold by mail order backed by telephone service.</p>

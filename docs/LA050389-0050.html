			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: LEGAL FILE  </P> <P> A state appellate court in New Jersey, ruling in the divorce case of actor Joe  Piscopo, says that the price of fame can be calculated and its value split  between divorcing spouses. A three-judge panel of the Appellate Division of  Superior Court upheld a lower court's ruling that Piscopo's ex-wife is entitled  to 48% of the comedian's "celebrity good will." The total value of that good  will, determined by both sides in the case, who accepted the lower court  judge's calculation, is $98,708.60. Monday's appellate ruling means that the  former Nancy Piscopo stands to collect more than $47,000 for her part in  advancing her comedian husband's career while they were married. Lawyers in the  case said the ruling is the first appellate decision in the United States that  celebrity good will is an asset subject to equitable distribution in the  breakup of a marriage.

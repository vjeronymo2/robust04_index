			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / The recovery sends its apologies: America The reaction of financial markets to the US recession reminds me of the small boy who was given a pile of dung for Christmas. An incurable optimist, he dived into the smelly heap, shouting: 'There's gotta be a pony in here somewhere.' But it is not just Wall Street that ought to be reprogramming its errant computers. In the light of depressing recent figures, the White House forecast prepared by Dr Michael Pangloss (or is it Boskin?), also looks like an exercise in self-deception. In January, the Bush administration, confident perhaps that victory in the Gulf would revive the economy, said the worst of the recession was over. Gross National Product would fall at an annual rate of only 1.3 per cent in the first quarter and then start to recover. In the event, real output fell at an annual rate of 2.8 per cent, nearly twice as fast as at the end of last year. Rather than easing off, the recession appears to have gained momentum. The White House said the downturn would be one of the shortest in post-war history. Wheels turn slowly in academia, but the wise men entrusted to chart the contours of the business cycle finally delivered their verdict last week. The National Bureau of Economic Research's dating committee identified July as the month when the US downturn began. The recession has thus already been running for nine months: it is shaping up as an average rather than a particularly mild contraction. And contrary to the claims of many commentators, including Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, it was not caused by President Saddam Hussein. His disruption of world oil markets merely accelerated a decline whose ultimate roots lie in the excesses of the 1980s. With industrial production, employment, retail sales and order books still falling, optimists are pinning their hopes of imminent recovery on three main indicators: the stock market boom that took the Dow briefly past 3,000; signs of recovery in the housing market; and a fall in the number of people claiming unemployment insurance. The stock market has been right more often than wrong. Forecasters, therefore, should respect its collective wisdom. But it is a mirror of prevailing sentiment rather than an independent indicator: it is telling us that investors are more confident, not confirming their grounds for confidence. The tentative signs of recovery in housing also warrant attention. Construction and home sales, which respond quickly to falling interest rates, are usually one of the most reliable forward indicators. The trouble is that if you blink you might miss this upturn. Housing starts in March fell back after a sharp gain in February. They are 6 per cent above the January trough but still 31 per cent lower than a year ago - when the market was already weak. Building permits and sales of existing houses have edged forward in recent months. Estate agents in some areas talk excitedly of more custom. But the most the honest forecaster can claim is that the foundations for a housing recovery are being laid. Analysts scrutinise unemployment claims closely because they are one of the few indicators published weekly. In the last week of March and the first week of April, claims fell by 92,000 to 451,000, well below recent highs. This fuelled speculation that April's employment report (to be released this Friday) would be good. Alas, the most recent figures show claims rebounding to the 500,000 mark that historically has signalled sharp recession. It is thus too early to conclude that the labour market is poised for recovery. The first quarter GNP figures were encouraging in one respect: the rate of decline of consumption spending, two-thirds of economic activity, was slower than in the fourth quarter of last year. On the other hand, export growth, adjusted for inflation, has slowed to a standstill - a reflection of recessionary tendencies in the rest of the world. And US business investment, resilient last year, has begun to fall sharply. The recession is thus changing its character rather than melting away. Fed policy-makers, after much internal debate, nevertheless continue to resist calls for a looser monetary policy. Somewhat eccentrically, some regional presidents still harbour fears about a resurgence of inflation. They believe the interest rate cuts of the winter should be given more time to work their expansionary magic. A couple of sets of really bad employment figures, however, would probably be enough to shake their resolve. The July downturn ended an expansion phase lasting 92 months, the second longest since records began in 1854. The Reagan boom's longevity was exceeded only by the flower-power expansion of the 1960s. That, one hates to remember, was followed by a particularly difficult decade. The main problem then was to control inflation; the challenge today is to reduce borrowing and rebuild savings. Presidents John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson would have been appalled by the scale of the budget and trade deficits run up by Republican supply-siders of the 1980s. Don't worry, the business cycle is not dead. This recession will bottom out, probably by late summer. But it is difficult to see how the US economy can avoid a prolonged period of sluggish growth, as debt-sodden consumers and companies struggle to regain their fiscal balance. No wonder the US Treasury is pleading for interest rate cuts in more responsible parts of the globe.</p>

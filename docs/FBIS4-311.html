			<p>BFN     [Text] A total of 14 political parties, four of which are  represented in parliament, have formed a front against the  government. The parties met from 24 to 31 March 1994 to discuss  peace and national reconciliation. Today they issued the  following declaration:    [Begin Pinto Joao, leader of the Angolan National Democratic  Convention, CDNA, recording] The political parties have decided  to conduct joint action within the framework of a process aimed  at fulfilling the following goals:    A. Signing of a cease-fire accord between the government and  UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola], and  the immediate conclusion of the Angola peace talks.    B. A substantial number of UN blue helmets should be sent to  cover the country as a whole.    C. Complete disarming of the warring forces, including the  police, private militia, and civilians.    D. A stop to the supply of weapons to the warring factions.    E. Organization of an extended meeting attended by all of  Angola's active forces, including churches.    F. The establishment of a transitional government of  national unity.    G. Active participation by all political forces in the  transitional organs.    H. Formation of a new army and police that should be free  from partisan manipulation.    I. Establishment of a national military nonaggression and  mutual security pact, and the declaration of Angola as a  demilitarized territory.    Until those principles are complied with, the democratic  civilian opposition political parties represented at the meeting  have decided to hold meetings amongst themselves and with other  political forces likely to subscribe to the present declaration.  The democratic civilian opposition political parties have  adopted a basic agenda for peace and consolidation of democracy  in line with a planned broad movement for peace and national  reconciliation. [end recording]    The opposition says the present government is illegal, and  so  are the Angolan Armed Forces and the police. They have also  accused the government of monopolizing the news media. In view  of that, the opposition parties have called for the  reinstatement of a legal order, giving political parties the  right of access to the news media as of this month.    The new political grouping is known as the Democratic  Civilian Opposition Political Parties and its members include  the CNDA, the Angola National Liberation Front, the Front for  Democracy, the (Umbia-PCN) [expansion unknown], the National  Convention Party, the Angolan Liberal Party, Liberal Democratic  Party, the Democratic Party for the Progress-Angolan National  Alliance, the Social Renovated Party, the Angolan Solidarity and  Consciousness Party, the Angolan Social Democratic Party, the  National Union for Democracy, and the Angolan National  Ecological Party.</p>

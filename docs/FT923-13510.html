			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Old age threatens to clip Concorde's wings: The next generation of supersonic airliners will require an unprecedented level of international co-operation From the British Airways headquarters at London's Heathrow airport, mechanics could be seen examining the rudder of a Concorde sticking out of the big hangar known as Technical Block B. The rudders of each of BA's seven Concordes, the flagships of the airline's fleet, are normally inspected after every 50 to 100 flights. But BA is now subjecting this section of the aircraft to minute checks after every five flights. This follows a series of incidents in which parts of the rudder have fallen off in supersonic flight, although none represented a serious risk to the aircraft. For BA, the UK airworthiness and air accident authorities, and the manufacturers, Concorde's rudder problems have been an embarrassment. They have also raised questions on how much longer the world's only supersonic passenger jet, which entered regular service with BA and Air France more than 15 years ago, can continue flying and whether a new generation of supersonic aircraft will eventually be developed to replace it. Since 1989, three BA Concordes have lost large sections of their rudders in mid-flight, most recently on March 21, when a New York-bound Concorde lost most of the upper section of its two-piece rudder while flying at 56,000 ft at Mach 2, or roughly 1,300 mph. In all three cases, the aircraft, which yesterday completed 250,000 supersonic flying hours in commercial service with BA, flew safely to its destination. 'It's not critical, but the fact it happened more than once makes it serious,' says Mr Alistair Cumming, BA's director of engineering. To leave nothing to chance, BA has now asked British Aerospace, responsible for the original rudder design, to manufacture a new series of rudders for its Concordes for a total cost of about Pounds 5m. Although the new equipment is expected to resolve the fault, the rudder failures are signs that the aircraft is showing its age. BA said the supersonic hours flown by Concorde now totalled more than the supersonic flying hours completed by the combined air forces of the west since the introduction of supersonic combat aircraft. And unlike subsonic jets, Concorde has had to operate in more stressful conditions with the aircraft subjected to more intensive and frequent changes of temperature when flying at Mach 2. Each Concorde is at present cleared by the UK and French airworthiness authorities to fly a total of about 7,000 supersonic flights. BA's supersonic jets have already completed about 4,000 flights and are expected to reach their current operational limit by 1998-99. BA and Air France, together with the airframe manufacturers (BAe and Aerospatiale) and the engine suppliers (Rolls-Royce and Snecma), are working to try to extend Concorde's life into the next century. The airlines hope to stretch the life of Concorde until 2010. This will require design adjustments and improvements on which the airlines and the manufacturers are already working. Mr Cumming said BA would be fitting one of its operational aircraft with instruments to measure the stress on the airframe structures to provide the information to tackle any structural weaknesses and potential areas of distress. 'It could involve lots of small things like changing the radius of certain components facing high stress or polishing a surface,' he said. On older subsonic aircraft, airlines and manufacturers usually wait until a crack appears on the airframe before taking action. But Mr Cumming said it would clearly be unwise to adopt the same procedure for Concorde. The airlines expect the cost of improving the Concorde structure to be relatively small since adjustments would be phased in during the already exhaustive maintenance programme of each aircraft. Averaged out over a year, every Concorde undergoes 22 hours of maintenance for every one hour of flight compared with seven hours of maintenance for a Boeing 747 jumbo. Although it was hit last year by the slump in airline traffic and the general squeeze on first class travel, Concorde in recent years has operated profitably for BA and Air France. Apart from regular transatlantic services, the two airlines have also developed successful charter businesses for their supersonic jet. But for all its technical achievements, Concorde remains an economic failure. The profits BA and Air France make on their supersonic operations include no depreciation charge on the aircraft's Pounds 1.2bn development cost. And if the cost of keeping Concorde in service should suddenly jump and huge sums be necessary to refurbish and re-equip the aircraft, the airlines would have to re-examine the economics of their Concorde operations. Apart from modifications to stretch the aircraft's working life, spare parts are likely to pose another big problem. Scores of different small components from a myriad of suppliers will have to be manufactured, redesigned or replaced. Careful planning, according to Mr Cumming, will be critical to avoid the risk of spares running short and eventually grounding the aircraft. The challenge for the manufacturers and the airlines is to keep Concorde flying until a second-generation supersonic airliner is ready to replace it. The aerospace industry has already begun preliminary studies on developing a supersonic aircraft about three times the size of Concorde. It would carry up to 300 passengers, compared with the 100 carried by Concorde, at Mach 2 over longer ranges. But such an aircraft is unlikely to be developed before 2005-2010 at the earliest. It is expected to cost more than Dollars 10bn at 1992 prices and will need an unprecedented amount of international co-operation. All leading airframe and en-gine companies agree to co-operate. 'It would be very difficult for one company or one country to develop such an aircraft because of the big market and financial risks involved,' said Mr Mike Henderson, head of the supersonic research team at Boeing. The project faces a series of daunting questions: can international co-operation on such a scale work; will the manufacturers overcome hugely complex environmental issues to ensure no perceptible sonic boom over populated areas and no significant ozone depletion; can such an aircraft ultimately be economic? 'We are going to have to demonstrate that the aircraft is environmentally safe and show it is not just a toy for the rich,' Mr Henderson said. The industry is relatively confident it can overcome all the technical challenges of developing a new supersonic airliner. But Boeing research has shown that passengers appear willing to pay only relatively modest surcharges for supersonic flights of 10-20 per cent over subsonic fares. 'Concorde was a technological success but also a good example of something possible but not very useful for the market,' Mr Henderson said. The message is clear. The industry is unlikely to develop another technological showpiece that makes little commercial sense. Instead, the market will decide when and if a new supersonic airliner is built.</p>

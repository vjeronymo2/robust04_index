			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Greggs pays ABF Pounds 19m for bakery outlets Greggs, the Newcastle upon Tyne-based bakery chain, almost doubled in size yesterday with the Pounds 18.95m purchase of Associated British Foods' retail bakery outlets. The cash deal comprises 424 shops, mostly operating as Baker's Oven, and two manufacturing bakeries - one in Newcastle upon Tyne and another in Twickenham. Shares in Greggs rose 12p to close at 805p yesterday. ABF shares were down 12p at 543p. Greggs opened its 500th shop in January. Announcing 1993 profits of Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 110.4m in March, Mr Mike Darrington, managing director, was already claiming to run the biggest and most profitable retail bakery company in Britain. The group is not planning to close any branches. The deal takes the employee total from 6,000 to more than 11,000. Mr Darrington said the deal marked an important strategic move for the company, whose shops have been concentrated mainly in the north of England. The ABF shops are mainly in the south-east. He pointed out that 78 of the shops were freehold or long leasehold. In addition, there were 169 with in-store bakeries, providing good opportunities for expansion. The deal will be paid for with the group's own cash resources and borrowings. At the end of its financial year on January 1 Greggs had net cash of Pounds 12.1m. Allied Bakeries, ABF's bakery arm, said the deal would reduce its Pounds 100m turnover by about 20 per cent and the number of employees by 40 per cent. Allied Bakeries has about 35 per cent of the bakery market for supermarkets and grocery chains. Mr Garry Weston, ABF chairman, said the wide geographic spread of the retail operations had required an increasingly uneconomic daily delivery of fresh bakery products. Baker's Oven shops had achieved 'only modest levels of profit contribution' because of the competitive conditions.</p>

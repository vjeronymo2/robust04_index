			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Virginia Silveira from Sao Paulo] </F>   [Text] The Aeronautics Ministry has finalized a deal with  the Brazilian Aeronautics Company (Embraer) on the development  of a military trainer adapted for attack missions. Embraer's  commercial manager Paulo Cury said the prototype is based on the  standard Tucano EMB-312 plane. The current Super-Tucano  configuration [as published] was initially developed to meet the  specifications of the U.S. competitor JPATS (English acronym for  Primary Aircraft Training System).    Cury said Embraer has already completed the blueprint of the  plane, which was ordered by the Aeronautics Ministry, and is now  preparing the technical and commercial specification prior to  the construction of 50 to 70 planes. The program will last 5  years and the planes will be supplied to the Brazilian Air Force  (FAB). Cury said the new Super-Tucanos will replace the Xavante  plane.    The new configuration of the Super-Tucano, which is built  for  primary training purposes, will incorporate advanced training  features and a weapons system based on machine guns, an air to  ground system, and rockets. Cury stated that the Aeronautics  Ministry wants to use the new plane for border control and  interdiction within the Amazon Control System (Sivam). The  Super- Tucano is a stretch version of the basic Tucano and has a  more powerful engine -- 750 horsepower. The Aeronautics  Ministry has already created a work group to draft the technical  and commercial aspects of the new plane, which has been  designated the ALX. Cury added: "By the end of March we will  have the bid document ready." He could not give an estimate of  the investment required for the ALX program. He indicated that  an export version of the Super-Tucano will cost $3.8 million.    Negotiations with the Aeronautics Ministry for the  development of a plane with new specifications began in 1989  with the engineering aspect. The formulization of the agreement  with the ministry came during the second half of 1993. The  program is currently defining the basic operational demands,  work schedule, and the drafting of an estimate of the resources  to be disbursed.</p>

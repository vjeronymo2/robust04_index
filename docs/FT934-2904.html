			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / EU Summit: Summiteers strain to unite behind Gatt trade pact  -FT writers report on the first day of the European Union leaders' meeting in Brussels European Union leaders were straining last night to unite behind the Gatt world trade deal now likely next week, as Portugal and France hardened their conditions on textiles and agriculture. Portugal has twice in the past 10 days threatened to veto a Uruguay Round settlement unless its partners seek ways of offsetting what Lisbon regards as an insufficient market access offer by the US on textiles. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, referred yesterday to 'vital national interests' at stake - the politest Euro-code for threatening a veto - but devoted his efforts to winning over fellow heads of government in a series of bilateral talks. Portugal won wide sympathy, especially since Mr Cavaco Silva faces local elections tomorrow. But it was not clear how far its partners would or could go in offering funds from an already stretched EU budget to help restructure the Portuguese textile industry. A European Commission trade official said, however, that 'we think that when the details of the market access deal emerge, the Portuguese will find a lot to be satisfied with' on textiles. France refused to relent on its demand that the EU guarantee farmers would not have to set aside farm land, or take any more land out of production because of the Uruguay Round, if the output projections of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy exceed the limits on subsidised food exports set by Gatt. French officials insist that the government must have a plausible guarantee to offer when France's National Assembly meets to debate Gatt, probably on Monday. Such a guarantee could break the EU budget or it could cost nothing, if CAP projections for the next two years are as accurate as they have been in the first year of reform. 'Pick a figure,' said one European Commission official. He pointed out that if EU cereals prices do not come down to world market levels as a result of production restraints and price cuts which farmers get direct compensation for, then every Ecu10 overshoot would cost the Union Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.52bn) in extra compensation to avoid further set-aside. There were signs last night, however, of a compromise on French demands  - strongly backed by Spain and a thin majority of member states, but opposed by Germany - for strengthened EU trade weapons to put up against the US Section 301 trade arsenal. The current Belgian presidency is suggesting that a simple majority of the 12 should be sufficient for Brussels to take anti-dumping action against imports sold in Europe below production cost or home market price, but that the higher hurdle of weighted majority voting, normally requiring support from nine or 10 member states, should be retained for using safeguard clauses against import surges. Foreign ministers were due to discuss the wider Gatt deal over dinner last night. The 12 heads of government and Commission president Jacques Delors were expected to examine the farm and textiles issues at a separate, closed dinner. According to the Belgian presidency, foreign ministers were also expected to start a meeting on Gatt on Monday, possibly running through the week until after Wednesday night's deadline for concluding the Uruguay Round.</p>

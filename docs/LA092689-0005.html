			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WATER SNUBBED TODAY MAY LOOK GOOD TOMORROW  </P> <P> Earle Hartling made his way along catwalks above the sewage, bathed in  mid-morning sunshine. Underneath him, in concrete tanks, roiled the  tawny-colored waste water from the sinks and the toilets of the San Gabriel  Valley.  </P> <P> A musty odor here, a decided stench there. And the antiseptic smell of chlorine  wafted in the gentle breeze across the nine-acre expanse of one of the state's  largest sewage treatment plants, at San Jose Creek near the intersection of the  San Gabriel and the Pomona freeways.  </P> <P> Hartling, an engineer with the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, is  an expert on the matter of transforming sewage into usable water.  </P> <P> He peered down into a concrete opening where the finished product rushed away  like a waterfall: Clear, clean water, almost -- but not quite -- good enough to  drink, tumbled into a huge pipe.  </P> <P> "You'd have to drink a gallon a day for 875 years before you'd contract the  only virus we've ever found and it still wouldn't even make you sick," Hartling  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Swim, but Don't Drink  </P> <P> Millions of gallons of this water, considered by health officials to be clean  enough for swimming but not for drinking, rush through the pipe every day.  Eventually it flows into the concrete banks of the San Gabriel River, which  winds to the ocean at Long Beach. But millions more gallons are diverted into  the ground to indirectly replenish the water supply for portions of Los Angeles  County, a desert that water has made into a patchwork of manicured lawns, golf  courses, orchards and gardens.  </P> <P> To boost the water supply that serves 1 million people in the San Gabriel  Valley, from Monterey Park east to San Dimas, water officials had proposed  pumping water from the San Jose Creek plant upriver to Irwindale. There,  through a system of tanks and pipes, the water would have been fed into the  earth around Irwindale.  </P> <P> But a Los Angeles Superior Court judge last month said no to this idea.  </P> <P> Judge Florence Pickard reached this conclusion after she toured the catwalks at  San Jose Creek and then held a day-long hearing. She decided that, as long as  water suppliers in the San Gabriel Valley can afford to buy imported water of a  higher quality than that produced at San Jose, she would not be willing to give  her approval for reclaimed waste water to be pumped into the Irwindale water  table, 4 1/2 miles northeast of the San Jose plant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Understand Her Caution'  </P> <P> "We can't be particularly mad at her," said Ralph B. Helm, attorney for the  Upper San Gabriel Water District. "We understand her caution. But we did think  our plan was a good idea."  </P> <P> The judge's approval was necessary due to complicated legal agreements reached  in 1973 when rules were set forth saying court permission would be required to  use reclaimed water.  </P> <P> To pump the renovated water into San Gabriel Valley would not have been an  extraordinary event in the region. For decades, waste water reclaimed by a  sewage treatment plant in Pomona has irrigated fields, cemeteries, golf  courses, schoolyard ball fields and hospital grounds. It has supplied factories  with water they need to make their products, such as paper. In addition, Cal  Poly Pomona uses the water for irrigation.  </P> <P> Extensive use around Pomona, Hartling said, dates as far back as 1904, when  citrus growers processed sewage into water clean enough to use on crops. And  just as the citrus growers of long ago found the partial answer to their water  needs, Hartling and other water experts say, this recycled, reclaimed, repaired  water may provide partial answers for the future water problems of Southern  California.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plant Expansions  </P> <P> Already, the city of Los Angeles is expanding its water reclamation plants. The  Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County operate one of the state's largest  water reclamation projects, as a by-product of its sewage treatment operations  at 10 plants in the county. Two plants, including the largest at San Jose  Creek, are near Whittier Narrows and the third in the San Gabriel Valley is in  Pomona. Others are in Cerritos, Long Beach, Lancaster, Saugus, Palmdale,  Valencia and La Canada-Flintridge.  </P> <P> But half of the water produced at these plants eventually goes unused, much of  it flowing directly into the ocean. This water, Hartling said, could supply the  annual needs of hundreds of thousands of people.  </P> <P> "We all realize there is an upcoming water supply shortage in Southern  California. And water from the (San Jose) plant is being wasted to the ocean,"  Robert G. Berlien, general manager of the Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal  Water District.  </P> <P> Economics partly contributes to the fact that the treated water isn't being  used. But as the cost of imported water increases, economics may one day cause  water companies to seek ways to acquire the water.  </P> <P> In stating the case for reclaimed water, Hartling -- whose job is to sell  people on using the water -- makes several points. Due to legal actions, he  said, the amount of water coming from the Colorado River to Southern California  will be cut in half in the 1990s. And he said population growth, along with  water consumption, is occurring at a rapid rate.  </P> <P> Berlien said "there would be a net savings eventually to users," if the  reclaimed water was piped into the valley.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pipeline and Pump  </P> <P> Initially, however, there would be the expense of building a pumping station to  send the water from San Jose Creek to Irwindale via a pipeline, which also  would have to be built. But, Berlien said, reclaimed water is about a third  cheaper than water imported from Northern California and outside the state.  </P> <P> "Reclaimed water would benefit everybody in the San Gabriel Valley," Berlien  said. "It would be an additional source. There's a shortage of imported water.  It's a dependable supply that's being wasted."  </P> <P> But Helm said: "It's not that urgent to us. We've got this great big basin we  can mine."  </P> <P> Much of the water in the San Gabriel Valley is served by wells in a basin  suffering from what state officials consider to be a victim of the worst case  of ground-water pollution in California.  </P> <P> The reclaimed water would have supplemented the water table, which feeds those  wells. And through the process of percolating into the ground, the water  eventually would have become pure enough to drink.  </P> <P> Water officials in the San Gabriel Valley say they are debating whether to ask  the judge to reconsider her decision.  </P></p>

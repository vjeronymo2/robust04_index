			<p><P> May 10, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DAWN RAID ON AVALON BY INS SNARES 28 ILLEGAL ALIENS  </P> <P> Responding to complaints that unemployed Mexican nationals have harassed  residents and tourists in Avalon, immigration agents swept through the Santa  Catalina Island resort town at dawn Tuesday, arresting 28 illegal aliens,  authorities said.  </P> <P> The men agreed to deportation to Mexico, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization  Service officials said.  </P> <P> The raid by 37 INS agents was the first on Santa Catalina since 1986, when 36  illegal alien workers were removed from the island. Complaints from residents  and tourists prompted the raid, said John Brechtel, the INS' assistant district  director for investigations.  </P> <P> Brechtel said a second group of INS officials will return to the island soon to  inspect businesses accused of employing illegal alien workers. Island residents  said Mexican men have come to Catalina for years in search of work. Many find  jobs as dishwashers and busboys in the town's restaurants; others wait in the  town plaza and downtown on Front Street for day work as gardeners or laborers.  </P> <P> Avalon city officials said they requested the INS make the sweep before the  busy summer season begins later this month on Memorial Day weekend.  </P> <P> "Part of the draw of the island for residents and visitors is that you can come  here and feel safe," Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince said. "There has been an  increase in crime that seemed to be linked to the increase in the illegals."  </P> <P> Several men have been arrested for public drunkenness, while others have fought  in public, authorities said.  </P> <P> The most serious incident occurred Sunday when three men, believed to be from  Mexico, beat another Mexican national, said Lt. Dale Goss, commander of the  sheriff's station in Avalon. The suspects left the island, and the victim is  still recovering at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Goss said.  </P> <P> The city has also received complaints from women, who said they were subjected  to catcalls and obscenities, Prince said.  </P> <P> "That kind of thing really stands out on the island," Prince said. "It had a  real effect on the community."  </P> <P> The INS agents stopped 130 people on streets and inside rooming houses in  Avalon, requesting proof of citizenship or legal residency, INS officials said.  The 28 who could not produce proper identification were detained at the local  sheriff's station and later shipped to Terminal Island on the Coast Guard  cutter Venturous.  </P> <P> About 50 men escaped by running into the hills, said Thomas Loyd, a special  agent with the INS.  </P> <P> Agents also searched for, but failed to find, several small encampments in the  hills where some of the men were reported to have been living.  </P> <P> Most of those captured looked sullen as they walked down a gangplank Tuesday  afternoon, but a few smiled and waved farewell to the Coast Guard crew.  </P> <P> Several Avalon residents welcomed the INS raid, although they are not convinced  that it will keep the illegal alien workers away. Less than a week after the  1986 raid, most of those who were deported had returned to the island, they  said.  </P> <P> Brechtel said the INS will try to make sure that does not happen this time.  </P> <P> "I can assure you," he said. "We will return."  </P></p>

Some local  officials told reporters that the tightened control would result  in stopping some new investment projects in the northern  provinces. However, some officials in Guangdong said they were  not worried about this because they had certain countermeasures.  They also assured foreign investors that the newly signed  investment agreements would not be affected.    A senior official in a Guangdong city said: In the past more  than 10 years of reform and opening, Guangdong officials have  developed a good ability to cope with policy changes. "When  reading the documents, you do not need to worry too much, and  should continue to invite external investment and to carry  forward existing projects. Then things will not become too  complicated." He smiled: "A good cat is one able to catch mice,  and it does not matter whether it is a white cat or a black cat."    The official did not think that the recent "macro-control"  action taken by the central authorities would affect Guangdong's  high-speed growth and the large number of ongoing construction  projects.    He cited some examples, saying that Guangzhou's subway  project would require a total investment of some 5 billion yuan,  and the second phase of Guangzhou's Zhujiang power plant will  require an investment of more than 1 billion yuan. The funds  contributed by the Chinese partners in these projects will be  guaranteed, and the local authorities have their own methods of  raising the funds.    One of the methods is to tap the city's land resources to  raise funds for urban construction. For example, the Guangzhou  authorities will sell the right to develop the property above  more than 10 subway stations, which will raise over 1 billion  yuan in funds.    In contrast with the flexible reactions of the coastal  provinces, the situation in the interior provinces was totally  different. An official in Hunan Province said: In the second  half of last year, some cities and counties in Hunan set up  development zones on their own, and more than 100 such  development zones now have been closed. At present, there are  only three state-level development zones and more than 100  development zones approved by provincial or city authorities.  This time, after the central authorities again issued the  instruction on exercising "macro-control," the development zones  will be screened again, one by one. It is very likely that a  large part of the existing development zones will be closed, as  they cannot obtain any funds from the state and do not enjoy any  favorable policies.    An official in the Jiangsu city of Zhangjiagang said that in  the new round of retrenchment, some investment projects the city  recently had begun might be affected and have to be suspended  for a certain period.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Ambassador Renato Ruggiero, </F> candidate to head World Trade Organization, by Marco Cecchini;  place and date not given: "New Trading Rules"]    [Text] Milan -- Trade? "Today the problem is to manage the  new rules of international competition, to ensure that everyone  respects the trading rules set by the Uruguay Round (the round  of negotiations for liberalizing trade concluded last April in  Morocco -- CORRIERE DELLA SERA editor's note), while the  question of tariffs is in a certain sense behind us."    Ambassador Renato Ruggiero is one of the "strong" candidates  for heading the WTO [World Trade Organization], the body which  will replace GATT on 1 January and will work alongside the  Monetary Fund and the World Bank in managing the international  economy.    An important job, and not just a post from which to observe  worldwide economy, but a position from which "disputes" between  countries in the most disparate industrial sectors will be  settled.    A task for which Ruggiero has received the explicit support,  not only of Italy, but of European Commission President Jacques  Delors, and of other countries. The question of the WTO should  also be under discussion right now at the European summit which  is taking place on the island of Corfu.    [Cecchini] Ambassador, you are saying that the problem of  tariffs has in part been overcome. Can you explain your reasons  for this affirmation?    [Ruggiero] The Uruguay Round accord marked the end of a  cycle. The level of tariff protection in the industrial world  has fallen to 3.5 percent. If one considers among other things  that almost half the products entering developed countries do so  at a zero rate, one gains an idea of the globalization achieved  by the economy. New players are emerging in the market. The  Monetary Fund calculates that in the next millennium the economy  of the three Chinas will be three times the size of Germany's,  twice the size of Japan's, and slightly higher than that of  America. Even the European single market is small compared with  such an integrated world. The reduction of tariffs in order to  promote trade will continue, but today the real problem lies  elsewhere: It is a question of managing the rules of  international competition.    [Cecchini] Will this be the task of the WTO?    [Ruggiero] Exactly. The new rules of the game will serve  everyone's interests. Industrialized and nonindustrialized  countries alike.    [Cecchini] What will the WTO's particular role be?    [Ruggiero] It will have to put into practice the 18  agreements contained in the 26,000 pages which make up the  Uruguay Round. For the first time 123 countries have signed  these agreements, developing nations have been fully included in  the multilateral trade system and have taken part in the  discussions on tariffs; and trade in new sectors, such as  textiles and services, will be progressively liberalized. This  is a genuine and specific revolution which will inevitably call  for a regulatory center.    [Cecchini] And disputes?    [Ruggiero] These are one of the most important chapters. The  WTO will have to create a sort of international court for  settling disputes, stemming regionalism, and giving itself the  tools for punishing those who fail to abide by the rules of the  game. The lives of thousands of companies will be radically  influenced by all this.    [Cecchini] An opportunity to come out of recession?    [Ruggiero] In particular. It is enough to think that, with  East Europe, the Far East, and part of Africa, a market of  almost 3 billion consumers is developing. What does all this  mean? Simply that, with a disciplined trade system, the  opportunities for development are simply enormous.</p>

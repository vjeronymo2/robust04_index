			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Minimising tax liability  -Briefcase I will lose my job at the end of the year and do not expect to work again but my wife will continue to do so. Her salary is around Pounds 60,000 and we have Pounds 200,000 of investments held in joint names. Can we change these investments to my name only to minimise tax liability? And could we reverse the process in the future to maximise capital gains tax exemption? As a general principle, we do not recommend that married women hand all their investments over to their husbands absolutely. In any case, the fact that re-transfer is contemplated in the future would defeat your tax avoidance scheme because half the income would be deemed still to be your wife's (by virtue of section 674A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- Papers here today  dedicate editorials to May Day, the revolutionary holiday of the  world's working class.    The editorial of NODONG SINMUN headlined "The Revolutionary  Cause of Working Class of the World Will Certainly Emerge  Victorious" says the revolutionary cause of the working class  for building socialism and communism is an ever-victorious,  invincible cause forever for its just and noble idea.    We should wage a vigorous struggle to defend the socialist  cause of chuche, more deeply cherishing the faith in the  invincibility of the cause of socialism, the editorial notes,  and goes on:    We should thoroughly hold fast to the chuche-based  revolutionary lines and policies set forth by the party and the  leader with the unshakable conviction that our cause of  socialism will certainly win victory as we are guided by the  dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, a distinguished thinker and  theoretician, statesman and great military strategist.    In order to press ahead with socialist construction in our  country and defend the cause of socialism as a whole, it is  important to strengthen unity and solidarity with the working  class of the world, decisively smash the moves of the  anti-reunification forces and more vigorously struggle to bring  earlier the reunification of the country.    Today many revolutionary parties and people fighting in  defence of socialism are strengthening international solidarity,  taking the Pyongyang declaration as their common fighting  programme.    Our working class and people will make positive efforts to  unite with the people of socialist countries and non-aligned  countries on the principle of independence and constantly  develop good neighbourly, friendly relations with the peoples of  all countries who respect the sovereignty of our country.    Brighter prospects have opened up before the people who  aspire after independence and socialism.    The revolutionary cause of the world working class for  realizing the noble desire of progressive mankind will certainly  emerge victorious.    MINJU CHOSON carries an editorial headlined "Let the World  Working Class Firmly Unite and Accelerate the Cause of  Independence".</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 25 (YONHAP) -- The opposition  Democratic Party (DP) decided Monday to withdraw its demand for  the government to form a coalition cabinet.    Kim Won-ki, a member of the party's supreme committee, said  the panel had discussed the demand, which party chairman Yi  Ki-taek expressed to reporters on the plane carrying him back  from the United States, and agreed to cancel it.    "We talked about the coalition cabinet but reached the  conclusion that this is not the appropriate time to make such a  demand. Our party has no plans to mention the demand anymore,"  he said.    Chairman Yi had urged President Kim Yong-sam to disband his  cabinet, set up a pan-national crisis management organ and form  a coalition cabinet.</p>

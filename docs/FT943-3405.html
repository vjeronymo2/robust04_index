			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Boyd leaves Goal Petrol Goal Petroleum, the oil and gas explorer, is likely to look beyond the North Sea for growth now that Mr David Boyd is retiring after 20 years as managing director. Mr Boyd's retirement was announced yesterday, along with interim results showing a 36 per cent fall in net profits from Pounds 2.77m to Pounds 1.76m for the six months to June 30. The profits were hit by the sharp fall in oil prices over the last 12 months. Turnover was down from Pounds 20.9m to Pounds 20.1m although production rose by 23 per cent to 12,300 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Mr Boyd, 59, is closely identified with Goal, where he has worked since shortly after its flotation in 1973. He will be replaced by Mr Duncan Ritchie, the commercial director. Earnings per share fell by 37 per cent from 2.07p to 1.31p.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Southern discomfort: Albania and Macedonia's war of words could lead to another Balkan tragedy The war in Slovenia lasted a week. Eight Slovenes were killed. The war in Croatia lasted six months, and killed an estimated 20,000. The war in Bosnia-Hercegovina has lasted two years and killed 200,000. Each time, while governments focused on ending one war, they failed to take action which might have averted a worse one further south. Now, while the US has persuaded Bosnian Croats and Moslems to sign a federation agreement, and Russia is trying to coax the Bosnian Serbs into line, an even more dangerous conflict is brewing in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia. Macedonia, now recognised under the provisional name of 'Fyrom' in deference to Greek sensibilities, has been subjected in the past fortnight to a Greek blockade. On February 16 Greece closed the frontier to goods traffic, denying landlocked Macedonia the use of the Aegean port of Thessaloniki, which had become its lifeline. Two days later Albania offered Macedonia the use of the Adriatic port of Durres. Despite this gesture, Macedonia probably faces a greater danger of war with Albania than it does with Greece. Within Macedonia relations between the Slav majority and the ethnic Albanian minority have been deteriorating rapidly. Just how large a proportion of Macedonia's population the ethnic Albanians form is a sensitive question. Albanian estimates of 40 per cent are probably exaggerated if applied to the population as a whole, but may not be far out for the younger generation. The mainly Moslem Albanians have a higher birth rate than the Orthodox Slav Macedonian majority, who fear that they will soon be outnumbered. In the west of Macedonia, bordering on Albania, ethnic Albanians already form a 70 per cent majority. Two years ago they voted for political and territorial autonomy, but the government of Macedonia declared the referendum illegal. Until now Albanian political parties in Macedonia have not tried to insist on autonomy. They are represented in Macedonia's coalition government but, according to one of their leaders, Mahi Nesimi, 'Macedonian parliamentarians, whether or not they belong to the coalition parties, are uniformly tough in opposing Albanian demands'. Last month the leading Albanian party in Macedonia, the party of Democratic Prosperity, split. The moderate PDP leadership, including ministers and MPs, walked out. The majority then elected a new leadership dominated by Mendu Thaci, a 28-year-old radical who has warned that Albanians could secede from Macedonia if they are not recognised as a 'constituent nation'. This development was hailed with enthusiasm by the state-controlled television in Albania. The media there have also been heaping scorn on Ibrahim Rugova, leader of the Albanian majority in neighbouring Kosovo, the formerly autonomous province now under Serbian control. In an unofficial referendum in 1991, the Albanians of Kosovo (85 per cent of the population) voted overwhelmingly for independence, but Mr Rugova has restrained them from attempting violent resistance against the Serbian authorities. Once backed by Albania, he is now attacked by the press in Albania as an appeaser. Albanians, like Serbs, see themselves as a fragmented nation. The borders of the Albanian state fixed in 1913 left half of them outside it. Today there are about 3m in Albania; 2m in Kosovo; 400,000-800,000 in Macedonia; 100,000 in Montenegro and southern Serbia; and an unknown number in Greece. There is as yet little evidence that they are seeking to reunite in a 'greater Albania' but, according to an article by Mr Nesimi in the current issue of Balkan War Report, the Albanian state 'must aggressively support the interests of Albanians in Kosovo, Macedonia and elsewhere in the region'. President Salih Berisha of Albania, emboldened by a defence agreement with the US signed last October and by Nato's new-found willingness to use force against the Serbs in Bosnia, seems increasingly inclined to respond to such appeals. He is encouraging more radical leaders in Kosovo and Macedonia, and violence could break out in either place at any moment. If violence does break out, it is certain to escalate. In Kosovo, the Serbs would respond with 'ethnic cleansing'. In Macedonia, a leader of the main opposition party, the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation, has warned that 'if the Albanians tried to get anything by force, there would be a much more horrible war than any there has been yet in Yugoslavia'. Skopje, Macedonia's capital, is an ethnically divided city. It has a Serb minority whose grievances Belgrade has been fanning. Macedonia was once known as 'southern Serbia', and Serbs would probably seek to reannex it if it appeared to be collapsing in ethnic war. Unlike previous wars, this potential conflict could not be contained within the former Yugoslavia. Bulgaria recognises Macedonia as a state, but regards its Slav inhabitants as part of the Bulgarian nation and would be under great pressure to intervene on their side; Turkey would be equally tempted to come to the aid of the Albanians. This nightmare scenario is not yet inevitable. It may even seem far-fetched. But so did the horrors further north, until they happened.</p>

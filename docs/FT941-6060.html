			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Vickers claims it has 'turned the corner' Vickers, the UK engineering group which makes tanks and Rolls-Royce cars, claimed to have 'turned the corner' last year by making pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.3m, compared with losses of Pounds 36.6m. Sir Richard Lloyd, chairman, said: 'Having fought for and won our survival, the Vickers group is now in a position to pursue growth in 1994.' Group turnover fell 4 per cent to Pounds 690m in the year to December 31. Sir Colin Chandler, chief executive, said a squeeze on working capital contributed to a net cash inflow of Pounds 58m, compared with an outflow of Pounds 40m. The proceeds of last March's Pounds 60.3m rights issue helped the group to net cash of Pounds 18.6m at the year-end, compared with borrowings of Pounds 100m. Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury car subsidiary, managed to break even following two years of heavy losses. The operation has been drastically restructured to take account of a steep fall in sales. Worldwide retail sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars stabilised last year at 1,360 compared with 1,378 in 1992, and the business returned to profit in the final quarter. Overall Vickers' automotive operations, which include the Cosworth engines and castings businesses, made a trading profit of Pounds 10.5m compared with a Pounds 15.8m loss in 1992. Most of the profit was generated by Cosworth, which had a successful year in both Formula 1 and the IndyCar series in the US. Sir Colin said Rolls-Royce Motor Cars did not have the financial resources to develop a new model generation alone. It planned to evolve the present models, but would need some form of partnership during the second half of the 1990s. Operating profits from defence rose from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 10.3m, although sales were down from Pounds 179m to Pounds 145m. Sir Colin did not expect any firm orders from the UK for new Challenger 2 tanks before May, despite December's announcement that the Ministry of Defence intended to purchase up to 259. Sales in the new turbine technology and propulsion division, which combines the group's aerospace and principal marine engineering business, fell from Pounds 145m to Pounds 137m, and operating profits from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 9m. However, cost cuts and intensive marketing helped the medical division recover strongly, with operating profits up from Pounds 5.9m to Pounds 9.7m. Earnings per share of 8p compared with a loss of 12.1p last time. A final dividend of 1.75p gives a total of 3p (1.5p). Lex, Page 22</p>

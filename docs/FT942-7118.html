			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Survey of International Capital Markets (14): Dynamic Swiss approach - Lombard Odier Swiss private bankers are reputed to be low-risk, conservative investors. All the more remarkable then, that one of the country's oldest banks, Lombard Odier, should have a fixed-income investment arm that is consistently outperforming market indices with the help of innovative investment strategies and a dynamic trading approach. 'Markets are inefficient, and we are very active managers - our investment philosophy is to try to discover the inefficiencies and ensure the portfolio will benefit,' says Paul Abberley, director and head of fixed income at Lombard Odier in London. He adds that 'inefficiencies are dynamic, they constantly change. It's not realistic to build a model - you need human judgment to evaluate them.' Lombard Odier London was set up in 1978 to provide specialist fund management services to institutional investors in separate bond and equity funds. The total amount of funds under management has grown to Dollars 7.2bn (of which Dollars 4.5bn are invested in fixed income) from around Dollars 2.5bn in December 1990. The fund invests in about 20 OECD bond markets; including their currencies - which are managed as a separate asset class to enhance total return - that's 40 variables. To cover all this ground, Lombard Odier set up a team of 10 investment professionals specialising in three areas. Paul Abberley sets long-term strategy on a six- to nine-month fundamental view. A tactical group of four fine-tunes the long-term strategy and carries out microwork: picking sectors, carrying out yield-curve analyses, issue selection, and executing trades. The remaining five are members of the portfolio management group, who, taking into account long-term strategy, input from the tactical group and client parameters, build efficient portfolios to ensure investment performance. The bond team uses a multistrategy approach, consisting of 'top-down' analysis of macroeconomic and political trends, supplemented through 'bottom-up' sector- and security-selection. They place a heavy emphasis on fine-tuning which helps damp volatility and boost returns. Thus, while its overall long-term strategy remains constant, Lombard Odier's bond managers do a substantial amount of short-term trading within the overall long-term strategy, to optimise the portfolio's performance. In 1992, for example, their turnover for a UK pension fund was 325 per cent, including currency trading. 'This may appear high, but the level of turnover was not generated by inconsistent long-term strategy or by constant issue trading,' says Mr Abberley. 'Our commitment of resources in the tactical investment group simply allows portfolios to move quickly in times of short-term market instability.' Short-term trades might include a switch from gilts to eurosterling bonds of a similar maturity, or going short on one part of the yield curve and long on other sectors. This contrasts with more conventional bond fund managers, who might buy paper and sit on it for several months; while both houses might have the same long-term strategy, Lombard Odier may generate three times the turnover. 'The fine-tuning adds to the turnover, but it also adds value,' Mr Abberley says. Amid the recent turmoil in world bond markets, he admits that 'the first quarter of 1994 has been a very challenging period; we've had to deal with high volatility and a sharp correction in most markets - it's been a period where one is best off being defensive, rather than adding value.' To cope with these conditions, his team has moved away from directional bets, and has sought to shorten duration to reduce risk. But protecting one's downside does not promote index outperformance. That's why they are increasingly looking to exploit relative, not absolute, value. This might involve spread plays between different markets. 'It doesn't matter if yields are going up or down, as long as the spreads move your way,' says Mr Abberley. Derivatives form an intrinsic part of Lombard Odier's portfolio construction, where client guidelines permit. They can be used to replicate cash market strategies more cheaply than using conventional securities, and to hedge cash positions. Moreover, fund managers might use options to achieve risk-return configurations which are impossible to achieve in the cash market. Ultimately, 'fund managers are constantly driven by the twin forces of hope and fear: hope that their losses will abate, and fear that their gains will will be eroded,' says Mr Abberley. This too often leads them to take profits earlier than they should, or to hold on to loss-making positions longer than they should. Fund managers 'should train themselves to fear the losses and to run with the gains'. Lombard Odier's bond funds have consistently outperformed market indices recently. In 1993, its US dollar-based Global Fixed Income Fund posted a return of 22.08 per cent, compared with a 12.26 per cent rise in J P Morgan's global government bond index (traded). This compares with the industry average of 14.65 per cent, according to data from HSW, a fund performance measurement company. In the three years to December 1993, Lombard Odier's global bond fund posted a 49.40 per cent return versus 35.52 per cent on J P Morgan's index; over the past seven years it gained 147.58 per cent, against 93.25 per cent on the index.</p>

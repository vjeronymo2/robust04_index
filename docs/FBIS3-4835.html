Government forces have withdrawn to  positions about 10 kilometers (six miles) south and west of the  base at Anlung Veng -- the radical faction's headquarters for  all guerrilla operations in north and central Cambodia -- to  positions they held six months ago.    Toan Chhay, commander of the 4th Military Region and  governor  of Siem Reap province where the base is situated, told AFP by  telephone that his 1,200 government troops were re-grouping.  "Now we gather our forces to attack again and we will re-capture  Anlung Veng within 10 days at the most," he said. He said the  decision to withdraw came because "our soldiers lacked food and  supplies. The KR have captured the base itself but we are still  in the Anlung Veng area," he said. Cambodian armed forces  control most of the surrounding area, he said. [passage omitted]    Co-premier Hun Sen said the guerrilla shelling had forced  the  government to make a tactical retreat from the centre of Anlung  Veng. But he emphasised that Anlung Veng was more than just the  base and it covered a very big area. The government has  persistently described the loss of the base, which it captured  after a six-month struggle against the guerrillas, as a tactical  withdrawal and not a military defeat. [passage omitted]    Speaking at a press conference in the capital, Information  Ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse claimed government troops were  engaged in pitched battles with the guerrillas. "Sometimes they  (the KR) get in our frontline and three or fours hours later we  recapture it, so that's the battle," he said. When asked about  the military commander's admission that troops had withdrawn  from the centre of the base, the exasperated spokesman replied:  "Don't believe me because I know the situation changes fast.  If you pick up this story and write it, before the ink dries it  changes." Sieng Lapresse went on to say that commercial rather  then military reasons may have been the motivation for the rebel  counter- attack.    The KR finance their guerrilla operations by selling logging  and [words indistinct] to primarily Thai business interests,  many of which are controlled by the Thai military. Anlung Veng  was a major centre for logging activities. When the government  forces captured the base, "a great number of logs" were left  behind by the retreating guerrillas, he said. "One of the  primary goals of the KR was to try and get these logs out  through Thailand," the spokesman said.    Government officials said part of the estimated 600-strong  guerrilla force attacked from Thai territory, and that once the  guerrillas pushed the government troops back, trucks followed in  their tracks to pick up logs. "I don't know if they were Thai  trucks but trucks came and picked up logs and went back in that  direction which is north of Cambodia," the spokesman said  without referring to Thailand by name.    The guerrillas also had a lot of weapons caches in the area,  he said. "When we attacked they were unable to get them out on  time so they try to come and get their weapons and ammunition  back," he said.</p>

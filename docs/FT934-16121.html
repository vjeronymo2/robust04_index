			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Beijing hits at Patten over HK speech CHINA yesterday expressed its 'regret' over a speech on Wednesday by Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten in which he warned that decisions on arrangements for pending elections would have to be taken in weeks not months. Mr Wu Jianmin, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said there still remained a 'large gap' between China and Britain on the issue, but his remarks were low-key. 'We hope that the British side will take a truly constructive attitude towards the talks so as to narrow the gaps as early as possible, and make the talks a success.' Mr Patten, who wants to extend the franchise for local elections in 1994 and for elections to the Legislative Council (Legco) in 1995, told Legco on Wednesday that 'we now have only weeks rather than months' to conclude arrangements. China is bitterly opposed to Mr Patten's proposals, arguing that they contradict understandings reached in negotiations during the 1980s on the future of the colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. The 1994 and 1995 elections are the last that will be held before the handover. Beijing and London have conducted 12 rounds of talks on the future of Hong Kong in an effort to resolve differences over Mr Patten's proposals, but have made little progress. Talks are due to resume in the Chinese capital early next week. 'The Chinese side is of the view the current talks are aimed at a smooth transition in Hong Kong's political system,' Mr Wu said. 'A bilateral agreement on the 1994-95 election arrangements is the necessary condition for a 'through train'.' This latter reference is to arrangements that would help Hong Kong through the difficult transitional period when London yields control to Beijing. Legislators elected for four years in 1995 would continue to hold office after the Chinese takeover, hence Beijing's extreme sensitivity over the possibility that an extended franchise might yield more militant representatives. Referring to agreements between Beijing and the UK, including the Joint Declaration on the colony's future, initialled in 1984, and the Basic Law of 1990, Mr Wu said that the 'essence' of the current dispute was not over whether there should be democracy, but 'whether one should honour his word'.</p>

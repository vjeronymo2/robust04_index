			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Slowdown in managers' pay rises THE RATE of increase in the total pay of managers slowed slightly in the first quarter of 1991, leaving them on schedule for an increase of 13 per cent for the full year. That is the finding of the executive pay index produced by Noble Lowndes, management consultants and actuaries. The index, which includes the value of fringe benefits such as cars and pensions as well as salaries and bonuses, is calculated quarterly for the Financial Times. The latest figure is based on a survey of 5,085 managers in 396 companies throughout the UK. In the first quarter the average total pay for all ranks of executives rose by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 71,633. The rise compares with a 3.5 per cent increase for the first three months of 1990 and a rise for the whole of last year of 13.8 per cent. Although total pay increased, the recession was reflected by a decline in the element made up of incentive bonuses to an average of Pounds 4,242 at the start of this month, against Pounds 4,369 in early Jan-uary. The salary element increased by 3.3 per cent to Pounds 50,771, the average value of company cars by 4 per cent to Pounds 8,329, pension entitlements by 5.8 per cent to Pounds 7,014, and other benefits by 7.3 per cent to Pounds 1,277.

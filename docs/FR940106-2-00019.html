			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 6: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners claim that CBCC did not accurately report its charcoal replacement costs. They further argue that CBCC did not provide the Department with the additional documentation requested regarding the estimated harvest of wood and other assumptions used in the calculation of the amortization costs for charcoal production. Petitioners argue that by not providing this information, CBCC prevented the Department from verifying the accuracy of the cost data and CBCC did not comply with Department practice in reporting replacement costs for company-produced charcoal. Therefore, petitioners state that the Department should assign a noncooperative BIA rate to CBCC. Alternatively, petitioners suggest that the Department adjust CBCC's reported cost for company-produced charcoal upward to the level of CBCC's cost for purchasing charcoal from unrelated suppliers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CBCC argues that since charcoal accounts for less than three percent of the cost of production of FeSi, use of BIA because of the difficulty encountered with verifying the accuracy of this factor of production would be totally inappropriate. CBCC maintains that should the Department make any adjustments to the charcoal costs it should only adjust the figures with the information gathered at verification rather than disregard the entire response.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with petitioners that we should adjust CBCC's charcoal replacement costs; however, we disagree that CBCC was noncooperative and should receive a margin based solely upon BIA. We discovered errors made by CBCC in calculating its cost of producing charcoal, a primary raw material, used in the production of FeSi. CBCC substantially understated its cost of producing charcoal by inaccurately recording the costs associated with their wood forests which provide the raw material needed to produce charcoal. Therefore, we have recalculated the cost of CBCC's production of charcoal. As suggested by petitioners, we relied upon the actual weighted-average monthly cost CBCC was charged by unrelated vendors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 7: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners claim that CBCC incorrectly accelerated the depreciation on a particular furnace by five years. The result was a disproportionate allocation of costs to products manufactured during the first five years the furnace was put into service, as opposed to the second five years, when no depreciation was reported. Petitioners contend that the accelerated depreciation for this furnace was an abnormal event since CBCC returned to its normal ten-year useful life for furnace depreciation following the period of accelerated depreciation. Petitioners further argue that the Department has explicitly rejected the accelerated depreciation of assets where such accelerated depreciation was not based on the useful life of the assets. Accordingly, petitioners believe that the depreciation charges for this furnace should be recalculated to reflect the company's normal ten-year useful life for furnace depreciation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> DOC Position: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We agree with petitioners. We have recalculated depreciation expense for this furnace to reflect the amounts which would have been recorded based upon CBCC's normal ten year amortization period since it is CBCC's normal practice to employ a ten year useful life in calculating furnace depreciation charges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 8: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners state that CBCC failed to accurately allocate furnace depreciation to FeSi based on the percentage of total furnace capacity devoted to FeSi production. Accordingly, for purposes of the final determination, petitioners contend that the Department should increase depreciation allocated to FeSi production for each month of the POI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza -- Dr. Mahmud al-Zahhar, yesterday denied  having any knowledge of news agency reports that an agreement  had been signed between Fatah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. He  accused Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin of raising such allegations  in a bid to promote dubious aims.    Al-Zahhar said that relations between Fatah and Hamas were  normal and that the meetings between the two sides are merely  aimed at resolving some outstanding problems.    Regarding the arrival of the international observer forces  to  Hebron, al-Zahhar said: I still believe that this is an  international trick to draw the Palestinians to the negotiating  table. This will not change anything on the ground.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: USX halves dividend on energy side as net falls USX, the US steel and energy group, yesterday reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 10m, down from Dollars 28m a year ago, amid weak markets for steel and refined oil products, and announced it was halving the dividend due to holders of its energy stock. USX has divided the shares in the consolidated group into two separate issues which track the fortunes of its Marathon oil business and its US Steel subsidiary. Mr Charles Corry, the chairman, said the dividend on Marathon stock had been cut from 35 cents to 17 cents 'to maintain financial strength and flexibility' while continuing to invest heavily in projects which were expected to enhance its production profile from late-1993. 'Marathon group's profitability and cash-flow have been negatively affected by depressed refined product margins in 1992,' he added. These stemmed mainly from low petroleum product price levels relative to crude oil. The group also announced it would adopt two new accounting standards in the fourth quarter - FAS 106 and FAS 109 - and would restate its first-quarter figures to account for these non-cash items. US Steel's income would be reduced by around Dollars 1.2bn and Marathon's by some Dollars 275m to Dollars 375m. Marathon reported third-quarter net income of Dollars 17m, or 5 cents a share, compared to Dollars 23m, or 8 cents, in the third quarter of last year. Sales were Dollars 3.4bn, compared to Dollars 3.5bn before. US Steel reported a net loss of Dollars 7m, or 13 cents a share, compared to net income of Dollars 5m, or 9 cents a share, on sales unchanged at Dollars 1.3bn. The figures were dragged down by start-up costs for the new slab caster at the company's Mon Valley Works, near Pittsburgh, and weak markets for tubular products. Prices remained stable but at levels below the same period of 1991.</p>

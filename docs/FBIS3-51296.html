			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 16 Jan (EFE) -- The presidential  candidates of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI),  National Action Party (PAN), and the Party of the Democratic  Revolution (PRD) have stated their approval of the amnesty  decree announced today by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.    PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio termed as timely and  welcome the initiative, which will settle the situation in  southern Chiapas State, adding "everything done to attain peace  in the region is welcome."    PAN candidate Diego Fernandez de Cevallos said everything  that leads to the achievement of peace and justice must be  supported by all Mexicans, adding that if the amnesty is the  only option that guarantees peace, "I support the government's  decision."    Fernandez de Cevallos said events in Chiapas do not endanger  the conditions for holding elections this year; quite the  contrary--they prove the people's clamor for a fair and  democratic electoral process.    Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, PRD candidate, said the  proposed amnesty for the armed people in Chiapas represents a  step toward creating conditions that allow a settlement and  understanding on the conflict.    Cardenas--who termed as positive the fact that the  government  has decreed a ceasefire and is willing to decree an  amnesty--stated his confidence solutions will soon be found to  the state's problems.    The PRD candidate considered it urgently necessary to grant  Indian representatives access to positions in which decisions  are adopted to solve the conflict.    Cardenas demanded the replacement of acting Chiapas Governor  Elmar Setzer with another who has the Indian communities'  support and recognition.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Tbilisi, 2 Feb -- Pavel Grachev, the Russian defense  minister, arrived in Tbilisi today. His visit is taking place  within the framework of the visit by the president of the  Russian Federation, which starts tomorrow.    The key military question to be decided during the Russian  president's visit is the question of establishing Russian  military bases on Georgian territory, Pavel Grachev told  journalists on arrival.    The interim agreement on the status of Russian forces in  Georgia expires in 1995, he recalled. "We are willing to keep  our troops in Georgia provided military bases are established  for them. This fits in with the CIS's treaty on collective  security. If the two heads of state resolve the bases issue  satisfactorily tomorrow, the agreement will be worked out by  military experts," the minister said. There is a possibility  that a protocol of intent on the establishment of Russian  military bases in Georgia could be signed, he added.    If agreement is reached on the bases, the Russian side  expects to have three military bases on Georgian territory,  making a total of five in the Transcaucasus area, with a  combined strength of about 23,000 men. The main task of this  grouping, Pavel Grachev said, is to safeguard security in the  Transcaucasus and North Caucasus regions against outside  threats, within the framework of the CIS's collective treaty.    Pavel Grachev also noted that the question of assisting  Georgia with the formation of an army "would be resolved  provided political stability is established in the republic, and  the political status of Abkhazia and South Ossetia defined".  Pavel Grachev considers it possible that Russian peacekeeping  forces might be used to settle the situation in Abkhazia,  provided that both the Georgian and Abkhaz sides ask for this.</p>

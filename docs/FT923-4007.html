			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Bimec calls in company doctor BIMEC Industries, the acquisitive engineering and waste treatment company, has called in a company doctor to replace Mr Sam Smith as chairman and chief executive. The appointment of Mr Roy Barber, who has worked on the Thomas Robinson engineering group and Astra Holdings, the munitions concern, comes less than a month after Bimec cancelled its final dividend. Mr Smith arrived in 1989 and Bimec's subsequent expansion sent the share price up to a peak of 80p last October. The company said yesterday that the skills required to build a business in an expanding economy were different from those called for in a recession. The dividend cancellation, which was accompanied by the news that production had fallen by 20 per cent in the first few months of this year, surprised the market. The shares plunged from 19 1/2 p to 6 1/4 p. Bimec had raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 5.4m to Pounds 6m in the year to March 31 on turnover of Pounds 103m (Pounds 74.5m). Only four days before the bad news on the dividend, Bimec had announced the purchase of Pearl Contracts Holdings, a building and maintenance services concern, from Cannon Street Investments. The consideration comprised 3.25m shares, then valued at 19 1/2 p each. Mr Smith earned Pounds 120,000 last year and waived his right to Pounds 25,000 of his remuneration. A wire service report that his pay-off could be about Pounds 500,000 was last night described as 'absolute rubbish' by Mr Barber. Mr Smith's pay-off was 'reasonable and realistic', he said. In March net debt amounted to about Pounds 7.4m, including finance leases - about 60 per cent of shareholders' funds. However, gearing has risen since then and the proposed sale of the aero and industrial division had fallen through. After yesterday's announcement, the shares rose 1 1/2 p to 9p.</p>

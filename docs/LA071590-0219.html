			<p><P> July 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARY COLEMAN  </P> <P> As reported, we represent Gary Coleman in connection with his action against  his parents to recover certain funds received bythem while acting as Coleman's  personal managers, guardians and trustees.  </P> <P> Any assertion that an action was filed against Coleman's parents with "no  substantiating evidence" is absolutely false.  </P> <P> More than sufficient evidence existed to warrant the filing of an action  against Coleman's parents and his former business manager. Unfortunately,  Coleman's damages and the full extent of the defendants' wrongdoing could not  then be determined because Coleman's former business manager refused to turn  over Coleman's own books and records. Those books and records were finally  relinquished only after Coleman's action was filed, and only then could an  audit be conducted to determine the full extent of Coleman's injuries.  </P> <P> Your assertion that this firm persuaded Coleman to sue his parents against his  will is equally spurious. Neither Coleman nor the members of this firm chose to  believe that Coleman's parents would be so avaricious as to take advantage of  their son's success in such a way. For that reason, no punitive or examplary  damages were requested of Col;eman's parents in his complaint. Yet, the fact  remains that his parents have refused to repay a single penny of the monies  that they received in excess of that previously authorized.  </P> <P> CHARLES K.

			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENATE URGED TO REWRITE QUAYLE'S JOB TRAINING ACT  </P> <P> The Bush Administration today proposed rewriting the nation's major job  training program, which was co-authored by Vice President Dan Quayle, to direct  most spending to the poor and teen-agers.  </P> <P> It also warned states that their programs will have to be improved to receive  federal support.  </P> <P> "For years, the government has been distributing money to youth programs in a  fragmented and piecemeal fashion, and sometimes without clear expectations of  what these youths should achieve," Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole told  the Senate subcommittee on employment and productivity.  </P> <P> Dole and three Job Training Partnership Act participants who attended the  hearing were meeting with President Bush in the afternoon in a session designed  to demonstrate the President's support for the changes.  </P> <P> The amendments would significantly change the job act created by Quayle, then a  Republican senator from Indiana, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) that was  highly touted by Quayle during his campaign for vice president. Dole said the  revisions are necessary because of the changing American work force, not  because of any major flaws in the program.  </P> <P> "But JTPA can be made even better," she told the subcommittee, which has  jurisdiction over the act. "Funds do not always reach the individuals and areas  who need help the most. In some communities it is felt that the program does  not always result in good jobs and a higher standard of living."  </P></p>

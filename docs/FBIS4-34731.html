			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "special correspondent" Silvia Pisani] </F>   [Text] Ottawa -- The signing of a nuclear cooperation  agreement between Argentina and Canada has already got the first  joint project off the ground. The two countries will begin  studies for the construction of an energy-producing plant to  supply a city of 3 million residents.    The agreement is one of the key factors in President Carlos  Menem's trip, and it includes the possible construction of a  400-megawatt Candu-type unit, which is larger than that of  Atucha.    The studies could be concluded by year's end, and the unit  will be installed in the neighborhood of the Embalse Nuclear  Center, in Cordoba Province, if an agreement is reached. The  Canadians have guaranteed that they are in a position to build  it in 42 months. There also will be innovations such as the use  of partially enriched uranium to reduce contamination and  increase the fuel's yield.</p>

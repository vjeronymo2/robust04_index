			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Iberia's pilots reject pay cut Plans to salvage Iberia, Spain's loss-making national airline, were thrown into disarray yesterday when the company's pilots refused to accept pay cuts demanded by the management. Iberia's chairman Mr Javier Salas said the decision by Sepla - the union representing the carrier's 1,100 pilots - after all-night negotiations was 'profoundly depressing' and threatened the company's future. After a 24-hour wildcat strike on Monday that closed domestic airports, unions representing cabin crews and ground staff agreed to salary reductions averaging 8 per cent in place of the 15 per cent originally sought. The pilots, who held separate talks with the management, balked when they were asked to carry the main burden of the cost-cutting measures with salary reductions of up to 20 per cent. Mr Salas, who plans to meet ground staff unions again today, said the breakdown of negotiations with the pilots meant that the company could be forced to sell business units and subsidiaries in order to avert bankruptcy.</p>

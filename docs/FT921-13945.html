			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Late selling erodes dollar gains The dollar lost the best of recent gains in a bout of late selling on the foreign exchange markets yesterday, losing 3 pfennigs as dealers took profits before the weekend, writes Simon London. Overnight in Far East trading the dollar was stable, pushing higher against the D-Mark. From a close in New York at DM1.6172, the US currency rose to DM1.6265 by the close in Tokyo, just below a resistence level at DM1.6280 which marked the high point of the day. Against the yen the picture was reversed, with the dollar falling back slightly from Y128.28 in New York to Y127.95. The yen was supported by comments from Mr Yasushi Meino, Bank of Japan govenor, which were interpreted as meaning that the authorities were prepared to tolerate a stonger currency. But the D-Mark continues to be weak and this was reflected in its cross rate with the yen, which fell steadily through the session. From Y79.23 at the close in London, the German currency fell to Y78.67 by the Tokyo close, breaching the Y78.80 level at which it was expected to find support. Instead, stop-loss trading programmes kicked into action, accelerating the decline of the D-Mark. In early European trading the US currency finally breached DM1.6280 after two days of pressure, rising to a high of DM1.6350 during the morning session. Overnight losses against the yen were also recovered as the US unit rose to Y128.50. However, in late afternooon a wave of selling pushed the dollar back to a low of DM1.5930 and Y127.12. Some traders blamed the fall on US trade figures for November, which showed a sharp 5.5 per cent fall in the level of imports, underlining the weakness of consumer demand in the economy. Other analysts noted that the selling pressure had all the hallmarks of profit-taking before the weekend. The US unit closed at DM1.6070, from DM1.6185, and Y127.45 from Y128.30. Within the European exchange rate mechanism, sterling remained close to its floor against the Spanish peseta but gained ground against the D-Mark in line with other currencies. Having closed at DM2.85 in London yesterday, the UK currency rose to DM2.8520 during the morning session, a position maintained through the day. Sterling close in London at DM2.8550. UK inflation data for December showed a sharper than expected rise in the rate of retail price increases but this did not dent the stability of sterling. The retail price index rose during the month at a year-on-year rate of 4.5 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in November. Most analysts had expected a 4.4 per cent year on year rate. Excluding mortgage payments and poll tax, core inflation rose at a year-on-year rate of 7.8 per cent from 7.7 per cent.</p>

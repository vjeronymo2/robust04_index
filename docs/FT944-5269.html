			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Clinton backs Salinas as WTO chief With his battle over Congressional approval of the World Trade Organisation behind him, President Bill Clinton has issued his first public statement in support of former Mexican President Carlos Salinas as head of the new WTO. This signals that the US will press strongly Mr Salinas' candidacy despite the threat of a divisive fight over the WTO leadership. The president waited one day after the passage of Gatt in Congress before issuing a statement noting that 'President Salinas is the only candidate for director who has served as a head of state. He would bring. . . a wealth of experience and important insights from the perspective of a developing country.' Mr Renato Ruggiero, the former Italian trade minister, has been leading in the race while Mr Salinas was serving out his presidency - which ended last week - and Mr Clinton was focused on getting the world trade pact through Congress. The former Italian trade minister claims the support of African, Caribbean and Pacific groups, the North Africans and many Middle East countries. While there was little controversy about trade liberalisation in the US debate over the Uruguay Round, the creation of a WTO became the subject of fear and suspicion. The opposition portrayed it as a supranational body ready to eviscerate US environmental, health and food safety laws. It was not the time to press the candidacy of Mr Salinas, who US officials believe would bring stature to the new trade body. The next step by the pro-Salinas forces will be to seek an endorsement from the nations of the western hemisphere at this week's Miami Summit of the Americas. India will be sounded out for support, and the Asians, now supporting the third candidate - Mr Kim Chul Su, South Korean trade minister  -will be urged to back Mr Salinas as a second choice. There was hope in Geneva, where Mr Ruggiero is popular, that a new leader could be agreed at a meeting of trade diplomats on Thursday. But now the whole issue is likely to be remitted to another meeting just before Christmas. The EU contends that with Mr Ruggiero the clear favourite, Mr Salinas and Mr Kim should concede defeat and bow out. FT Guide, Page 9; Editorial Comment, Page 15</p>

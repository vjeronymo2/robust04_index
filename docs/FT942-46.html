			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Markets Report: Dollar dips to new low The dollar fell yesterday to a post-war low of Y98.55 against the yen amid uncertainties about the policy implications of a new Japanese prime minister, writes Philip Gawith. The US currency closed slightly above that level in London at Y98.675, from Y100.210 on Tuesday, and at DM1.5825 from DM1.5849. In New York it finished at Y98.75 and DM1.5870. Traders said sentiment towards the dollar remained bearish, but trade was patchy. 'Wimbledon is providing much more interest than the market,' commented one observer. European currencies again took a back seat to the dollar, with the features being a weaker lira and firmer peseta. The Belgian central bank cut its central rate to 4.95 per cent from 5 per cent, while the Bundesbank trimmed its repo rate to 4.96 per cent from 5 per cent. Sterling ended little changed against the dollar at Dollars 1.547 from Dollars 1.5466, and was slightly down against the D-Mark at DM2.4482 from DM2.4513. There was little news for dollar bulls to cheer about, save for the overnight comments from Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary. He told a New York audience: 'We believe a stronger dollar is better for our economy and better for the world economy.' He added: 'The dollar is not a tool of our trade policy.' This was the strongest position yet articulated by the US administration. In early May Mr Bentsen said that the US 'saw no advantage in an undervalued currency'. Mr David Cocker, economic analyst at Chemical Bank in London, said that 'verbal intervention needs to be at least one leg of any currency intervention that takes place'. He added that, to be credible, it needed to be repeated 'from a wide number of sources from within the administration'. Conflicting messages from other senior officials would undermine the good work. Confusing the picture was the political change in Japan which saw the election of a Socialist prime minister, Mr Tomiichi Murayama. Analysts said the market was very ambivalent about this move. One concern includes the greater sympathy of the Socialists for North Korea, while the market was also trying to sift through what the implications might be for progress in the trade talks. Some observers also believe that Mr Murayama's victory will complicate efforts to pass tax reform legislation. Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan in London, said the dollar would be in a lot of trouble if the Fed did not move to raise interest rates soon. The key, he added, was that it should not be seen to be panicking. 'As long as the Fed can place a monetary policy tightening in terms of what it has been doing already to fight inflation, I think it will be OK,' he said. Yesterday the September Eurodollar future was trading at 94.70, discounting three-month money at 5.30 per cent, compared to the current level of about 4.8 per cent. Mr Cocker said the dollar needed US short-term rates to move above those in Germany. The US federal funds rate is currently 4.25 per cent, against the German repo rate of 4.96 per cent. TIn Europe the lira weakened further, closing at L990.6 from L986.9 per D-Mark. Analysts were at odds about the explanation for why the Italian currency is approaching L1,000 for the third time since early 1993, but said it was more than a case simply of generalised D-Mark strength. Some said the market was unsure about whether the government had the ability to curb the budget deficit. But Mr Giorgio Radaelli, economist at Lehman Brothers in London, said this explanation was incompatible with the recent strength of the Italian bond market. He said the weakness of the lira was probably attributable to technical trading. 'I do not see any reason why the lira should move at odds with bond prices,' added Mr Radaelli. Elsewhere in Europe, the peseta continued its recovery, closing at Pta82.15 from Pta82.42 against the D-Mark. Mr Gunner of Chase said currency strength was based on a recovery in the bond market that had restored faith in Spanish assets in general. The Belgian franc ended unchanged at BFr20.60 against the D-Mark, although there was some concern about the implications of allowing interest rates to fall below those in Germany. Traders noted, however, that there was no fundamental reason for D-Mark strength, which is more a function of dollar weakness. The Bank of England provided Pounds 720m liquidity to the UK money markets after forecasting a shortage of Pounds 700m. Overnight money traded between 4 and 5 per cent. German call money traded at the 6 per cent Lombard rate after the Bundesbank unexpectedly drained DM2.8bn in the weekly repo. Sentiment in the interest rate futures markets was more positive, but trade was fairly light. The December Euromark contract saw nearly 27,000 lots dealt and finished six basis points firmer at 94.94. The December Eurosterling contract settled at 93.77 from 93.76.</p>

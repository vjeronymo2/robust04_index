			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Technology: Watching the shopper's every move Tempting shoppers into a store is one thing. Persuading them to buy is another, even in the busy winter shopping season. But working out the proportion of people who spend money, and in which parts of the premises at what times of the day, has been a task more subject to guesswork than analysis. Increasingly, however, big stores realise that monitoring in-store traffic and customer service can pay dividends. This is especially true in the US, where companies such as Burger King, Toys-R-Us and Walt Disney use a new system which does just that. Called ShopperTrak, its idea is to cut down long waits in check-out queues and weary searches by customers for staff. Frustrated branch managers often say they have little control over floor staffing, since weekly plans are generally decided by head office. The system was developed by Datatec Industries of the US, which also sells it in Europe. It tracks people entering and leaving stores, where they go when inside, and the average amount of time spent there. ShopperTrak even distinguishes adults from children. It uses infra-red sensors above entrance and exit doors, at the ends of aisles, and at other strategic points like stairways. The sensors are linked to the retailers' tills or electronic-point-of-sale systems. By comparing till receipts with the number of employees on the floor and the volume of shoppers at any time of the day, ShopperTrak enables managers to adjust staffing plans according to demand. The idea is to increase purchases per visit, encourage shoppers to return, and to lift 'conversion rates', says Chris Carey, Datatec's president. Conversion rates - the percentage of people entering stores who actually buy something - differ according to the type of retailer. In the US, specialist retailers such as fashion and sports outlets will typically have rates in the low teens, says Carey. In out-of-town centres the rates rise to about 25 per cent. But mass merchandisers such as Woolworths have rates of between 50 and 80 per cent. Carey observes that in the US, ShopperTrak data is used to improve customer service (including staff training and behaviour). In recession-hit UK, it is mainly a straightforward aid to sales, enabling stores to match staff numbers and open tills to customers. Since conversion rates are lower in the UK than in the US, retailers want to squeeze more sales from the large numbers of people entering shops. After five weeks with ShopperTrak, a US general retail outlet in a shopping centre can raise its conversion rate by three percentage points to nearly 25 per cent, says Datatec. 'We're looking also at France and Sweden,' says Carey, who sees a growing demand for such systems among retailers. Their prices range between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 10,000 - depending on the number and width of entrances and exits. Though some high-profile retailers in the UK use ShopperTrak, many are not aware of its strategic aspects. These include use of the information to improve the quality and style of service through better training, and the passing of more decision-making powers down to branch level. Stores can also be designed more effectively based on the results of in-store promotions.</p>

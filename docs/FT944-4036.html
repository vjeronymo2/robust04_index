			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): After the turmoil, it wasn't all bad - A week of political drama / London The most embarrassing parliamentary defeat for a British government in years; a half point rise in interest rates; and an emergency mini-Budget. In short, a state of political turmoil which might seem guaranteed to sow despondency in the stock market. Yet, London's initial response to the drama played out at Westminster this week was remarkably sanguine - certainly, far more so than the bout of bearishness which suddenly overtook the equity market yesterday. The measured reaction to prime minister John Major's problems is perhaps understandable: a substantial degree of political risk must have been factored into share prices long before this week's alarums, given Labour's enormous opinion poll lead. And while Major's humiliation by Conservative party rebels in Tuesday night's fuel VAT vote makes the government look extremely weak, Labour's opinion poll strength means Tory rebels will hardly be keen to force an early general election. At the same time, the market still generally likes the government's handling of the economy. This week's increase in base rates might have been prompted in part by a need to calm City nerves over politics, but many analysts also regarded it as justified purely on economic policy grounds. The economy is growing at more than 4 per cent a year, which is probably unsustainable over the long run. And while inflation is at its lowest point in 27 years - several companies reporting results this week welcomed a recent softening of commodity prices, which rose sharply earlier this year - the government, by raising rates now, could have nipped incipient inflationary pressures in the bud. A solid rally yesterday in gilts - the market which is probably most sensitive to political risk - suggests that the equity sector's end-of-week nervousness originated in large measure from the mood on Wall Street, which has tended to dominate sentiment on both sides of the Atlantic for most of this year. The US debt and equity markets were rattled this week by the bankruptcy of Orange County, California, the fifth largest county in the nation, after a change in the direction of interest rates exposed it to at least Dollars 1.5bn of losses from investments in complex securities. Nerves were also frayed by an announcement from Fidelity Investments' Magellan fund, America's biggest mutual fund, that it would not make a year-end distribution to investors, because of US tax-accounting rules. A sharp fall on Wall Street late on Thursday thus set a negative tone for London yesterday, and the FT-SE 100 index closed down 40 points on the week. Against these bearish forces, London gained some heart from an announcement on Thursday that SG Warburg, Britain's pre-eminent investment bank, was in merger discussions with Morgan Stanley, one of Wall Street's leading investment banks. Warburg's share price, which had been rising for some days on bid rumours, shot up on the news, which also sent other quoted UK investment banks and brokers - such as Schroders, Kleinwort Benson and Smith New Court - sharply higher. Analysts suggested that if Warburg - Britain's leading contender as a global investment bank and with a strong presence in the main markets around the world - felt it necessary to link with a large foreign ally, then the rest of the independent UK securities sector would also have to think along similar lines. It could, in other words, mark the second stage of London's Big Bang - the first being the round of mergers in the mid-1980s which accompanied the abolition of fixed commissions. The more immediate question is whether the Warburg-Morgan Stanley marriage plans will be consummated. The two companies look a good fit in terms of relative product and geographical strengths, but there is some overlap which is bound to lead to redundancies. And the melding of investment banking cultures is notoriously hard to pull off - as Big Bang I demonstrated. These cultural difficulties mean that it would be hard for a rival bidder to launch a hostile offer for Warburg, but other leading foreign houses may weigh an approach to the bank with a friendly offer above the price which emerges in any eventual agreement with Morgan Stanley. The present plan is to create a new holding company which would, presumably, offer shares in exchange for existing Warburg and Morgan Stanley equity. The week also marked the debut of British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television group, which floated this month through a successful offer for sale. Its shares opened for trading on Thursday at an 11p premium to the 256p price at which its offer was fixed. But shares in submarine manufacturer VSEL dived on Wednesday when Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission bids for the company from both British Aerospace and General Electric. The two offers now face three months of close scrutiny. The decision surprised the City, which had expected both bids to be cleared. But analysts' calculations were upset by the insistence of the Office of Fair Trading - which advises the government on competition policy - that GEC's bid should be referred since it already owns Britain's other large warship-maker, Yarrow, on the river Clyde. Heseltine referred the BAe bid on grounds of 'public interest involving national security,' a vague phrase which seemed designed to head off the storm which would accompany the referral of the GEC bid alone. A touch of expediency, in other words, in a week in which it was singularly lacking on the Tory benches.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The discipline inspection and supervisory organs  at all levels throughout the province have deeply investigated  and handled the cases of violations of the law and discipline as  well as have cleared up the way and removed the obstacle for  developing the market economy by earnestly implementing the  arrangements made the CPC Central Committee and the provincial  party committee; closely following the party's central work; and  abiding by the whole situation of serving the programs of  reform, development, and stability.    Since the second session of the Central Discipline  Inspection  Commission, the provincial discipline inspection commission and  the provincial supervisory department have earnestly  investigated and handled a large number of violation cases  committed by party members and cadres through the efforts to  enhance their leadership, to reinforce the dynamics in work, to  put the investigation and handling of violation cases on a  prominent position, to define the focal points of investigation,  and to stress the practical effect of handling the cases.  According to statistics, the discipline inspection and  supervisory organs at all levels throughout the province have  registered, investigated, and handled 3,554 violation cases  committed by party members and cadres, in which 2,616 party  members and cadres were punished. Of these party members and  cadres, 40 are of the units at the county-section level. Only  in the period from January to April this year, the discipline  inspection and supervisory organs at all levels across the  province investigated and handled 1,519 violation cases  committed by party members and cadres. Of these cases, 148 are  of serious and appalling crimes and account for 9.74 percent in  the total of registered cases, in which 667 party members and  cadres were punished and 14 are of the units at or above the  county-section level.    In deeply carrying out the struggle against corruption, the  provincial discipline inspection commission and the provincial  supervisory department have led the work teams on many occasions  to go deep into grass-roots levels to carry out investigation  and study and to conduct face-to-face guidance over the work of  handling cases. They have held meetings periodically to  allocate cases to relevant departments, to arrange the clues of  cases in order of investigations, and to conduct specific  discussion and arrangements for the investigation and handling  of key cases. Meanwhile, they have enhanced the coordination  with the departments in charge of enforcing the law and  discipline and made efforts to foster the joint force of  struggle against corruption, thus, bringing about a steady  increase in the number of serious and appalling cases that have  been well investigated and handled.

While deeply investigating and handling the cases of  violating the law and discipline, the discipline inspection and  supervisory organs at all levels across the province have also  paid attention to summarizing the experience gained in  investigating the cases, analyzing the typical cases, studying  the law and characteristics of violations committed by party  members and cadres, publicizing promptly the typical deeds of  administrative honesty and diligence, and conducting positive  and negative education among the broad masses of party members  and cadres.

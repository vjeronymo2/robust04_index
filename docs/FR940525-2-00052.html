			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The role of the Collaborator will be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Collaborator will provide technology for the identification of membrane fusion and cell adhesion molecules. In particular, the Collaborator should be able to provide technology for the implementation of photosensitized labeling approach for identification of membrane fusion and cell adhesion molecules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Collaborator will be responsible for the purification and micro-sequencing of selected peptides, enabling NCI to proceed with hybridization cloning of the accessary fusion molecules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The Collaborator will generate reagents (e.g. peptides and antibodies) using information derived from their cDNA sequences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Collaborator will provide technology which will allow the control and synchronization of migratory and invasive processes of metastatic cells. This technology will be used to model invasion of metastatic cells in vivo. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Collaborator will screen and test reagents (e.g. peptides and antibodies) for their ability to block HIV infection and/or metastatic cell invasion using in vitro assays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Potent inhibitors of HIV infection and/or metastatic cell invasion identified by screening will be further tested by the Collaborator on animal models and in eventual clinical trials for their efficacy as therapeutic agents. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The role of the Division of Cancer Biology Diagnosis and Centers, NCI, in this CRADA will be as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Provide the Collaborator with techniques, expertise and facilities to study virus-cell interactions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Provide computer and literature search support for the project. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Provide access to sophisticated instrumentation (e.g. fluorescence spectroscopy and video microscopy (imaging), protein separation). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Characterize physicochemical properties of the biomolecules involved in the fusion process as well as researching their mechanisms of biological action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Publish these results and provide the Collaborator all data as soon as they become available. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The selection criteria on which in Collaborator will be chosen are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The ability to collaborate with NCI on further research and development of this technology as demonstrated by experience and expertise in this or a related area of technology. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The demonstration of adequate resources to perform the research, development and commercialization of this technology (i.e. facilities, personnel) and accomplish the objectives in a timely manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The willingness to commit best effort to reach CRADA objectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The level of financial support the collaborator will provide for CRADA-related NCI activities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. A willingness to cooperate with the National Cancer Institute in the publication of research results. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. An agreement to be bound by the DHHS rules involving human subjects, patent rights and ethical treatment of animals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any invention. Generally, the rights of ownership are retained by the organization which is the employer of the inventor, with: (1) An irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to the Government (when a company employee is the sole inventor) or (2) an exclusive or non-exclusive license to the company on terms that are appropriate (when the Government employee is the sole inventor). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: May 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Barbara M.

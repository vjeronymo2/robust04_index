			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUN TO UNVEIL 4 WORKSTATIONS  </P> <P> Sun Microsystems Inc., the No. 1 maker of sophisticated computer workstations,  will launch four new models in April in an effort to counter increasingly stiff  competition from its rivals, industry analysts said.  </P> <P> The competition, from the likes of Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and  upstart Next, challenges Sun's position as the premier vendor of the powerful  desktop machines, they said.  </P> <P> The new workstations are expected to carry pricetags ranging from $7,000 to as  much as $50,000, depending on configuration.  </P> <P> Workstations crunch numbers faster and offer more complex graphics than  personal computers. Originally designed for use by engineers and scientists,  they are making their way into offices as their prices drop closer to those of  PCs.  </P></p>

			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Canada Liberals dismay markets: Turmoil laid at new government's door Canada's Liberal government has sought to soothe the financial markets with promises of economic rectitude since it came to office last November, but its response to their recent turbulence has raised doubts about its commitment. Market sentiment has taken a heavy toll in recent weeks. The Bank of Canada set its trend-setting Bank rate, or discount rate, at 6.21 per cent this week, sharply above the low of 3.87 per cent in early February. Commercial banks have raised their prime lending rates twice in the past three weeks to 6.75 per cent and another rise is expected soon. Yields on long-term government bonds reached 8.6 per cent this week, from 7.1 per cent in early February and mortgage rates have jumped. But the interest rate rises have been too little and too late to prevent a run on the Canadian dollar which has sunk to its lowest level in eight years. The currency has slid by almost four US cents in two months, touching a low of 71.62 on Tuesday. The slide began with the US Federal Reserve Board's landmark tightening of monetary policy in early February, which resulted in greater changes north of the border than in the US itself. The gap between US and Canadian 10-year bond yields has widened over the past two months from about 7/10s of a percentage point to 1.25 points. The spread on short-term securities has opened up even further. This divergence does not appear justified by the relative performance of the two economies. Canada's inflation rate, at a year-on-year rate of 1.3 per cent in February, is well below the US. The business recovery has also been far less robust in Canada, where unemployment remains over 11 per cent. Economists place much of the blame for the rattled markets on the Liberal finance minister, Mr Paul Martin, and on Mr Gordon Thiessen, whom the Liberals named as Bank of Canada governor last February to replace Mr John Crow. The stated aim of both men is to balance low inflation and fiscal restraint with steady growth and job creation. 'The balanced approach is a code word for getting nothing done,' says Mr George Vasic, chief economist at securities firm Bunting Warburg. Mr Thiessen has certainly displayed a less single-minded commitment than Mr Crow to attacking inflation. 'Crow would have left no room for doubt,' said one unhappy finance ministry official. Mr Thiessen on Tuesday did reaffirm an inflation target of between 1 and 3 per cent for the next three years - in his first keynote speech. And Mr Martin raised half a cheer in the markets with his first budget last February, in which he promised to bring down the federal deficit from CDollars 45.7bn in the year to March 31, 1994, to CDollars 39.7bn in fiscal 1995 and CDollars 32.7bn in 1996. Closer examination of the budget and subsequent statements by Mr Martin and Mr Jean Chretien, the prime minister, suggest the Liberals are reluctant to achieve targets through unpopular spending cuts. The previous government's budget projections were blown off course by stagnant tax revenues rather than unexpectedly high outlays. Mr Martin and his advisers are banking heavily on an accelerating recovery to push up revenues. 'We are going to hit our target,' Mr Martin said on Tuesday. 'There is sufficient room to manoeuvre in our budget in terms of the projections that we have made.' Some economists question this conclusion. The budget assumed an average long-term government bond yield of 6.4 per cent this year, which is far below yesterday's level of 8.3 per cent. With debt-service payments accounting for about a third of all government outlays, any jump in interest rates can quickly undermine budget projections. Mr Thiessen and Mr Martin do appear to have calmed the markets for the time being. In the past two days, bond prices and the Canadian dollar have recovered part of their losses. But the turbulence of the past few weeks has revealed the fragility of investor confidence in Canada and several more potentially unsettling events are on the horizon. Quebec separatists are confident of a strong showing in elections later this year. If they win, they have promised to hold a referendum on independence for the francophone province within 12 months. The ten provinces will present their 1994-1995 budgets over the next six weeks. Their combined borrowings now exceed those of the federal government. 'You've got to be betting on a weak currency,' Mr Michael Manford, chief economist at ScotiaMcLeod said yesterday. Scotia has lowered its 1994 forecast of the Canadian dollar to between 71.4 and 73.5 US cents.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 20 Jan (PL) -- Juan Contino, the first  secretary of the Union of Young Communists [UJC], said today  that the fact that 88,000 new members joined the UJC in 1993  disproves rumors that this sector is moving away from the  revolutionary process.    In an interview with PRENSA LATINA, Contino noted that the  UJC has 550,000 members in its rank and file from a population  of some 3.1 million youths, and this year it seeks to recruit  over 600,000 new members.    Contino said that even amid the difficult economic situation  the country is facing, there is an undeniable tendency for the  UJC membership to grow, which continues to be a selective and  leading organization and continues to strengthen its  mass-drawing power.    Contino explained that currently the UJC seeks to reach such  sectors as the farmers and services (particularly restaurants  and community) due to the significance of their labor in the  present situation.    Contino stated that people who say that "youths are no good"  undoubtedly have a very limited view while he recalled that  there are over 40,000 youths linked to sugar cane harvest  activities, even under inadequate conditions.    Contino added that over 167,000 high school and university  students volunteered to work the land for 15 days at the end of  the past academic year, and another 100,000 volunteered to do  the same throughout 1993.    It should also be taken into account that 60 percent of  Cuban  scientists are among the Cuban youth as well as 70 percent of  workers in the tourism sector, which is second in generating  convertible foreign exchange for the country.    Regarding workers in the tourism sector, Contino spoke  highly  of their initiative in the western Province of Matanzas, where  workers donated some of the tips received to buy provisions for  the young cane cutters who had volunteered for the sugar harvest.    He considered particularly impressive the response to the  victory caravan. The victory caravan was organized by the UJC  to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the Rebel Army's entry  into Havana, and as Contino stressed, it conveyed a massive,  spontaneous, and voluntary support for the revolution.    However, Contino, who is also a member of the Central  Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba [PCC], conceded that  there are places where little confidence is placed on youths  because of their alleged lack of experience.    Contino said that youths should be given room not because of  their age, but because of the capacity they show.    He pointed out that the UJC pays greater attention to two  age  groups: teenagers and young people between 25 and 30 years. He  indicated that in these two cases, the UJC tries to adapt work  methods to achieve a more effective approach.    The UJC was established on 4 April 1961 as a leading youth  organization, intended to train the future members of the ruling  PCC.</p>

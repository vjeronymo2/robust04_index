			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Optimistic Fed report falls on stony ground Wall Street US STOCK markets accelerated their decline yesterday after a Federal Reserve report that the economy continued to improve at a modest pace dampened hopes of a further cut in interest rates, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 41.73 lower at 3,287.76. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 fell 6.06 to 402.26, while the American SE composite lost 6.38 to 379.74 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 10.83 to 553.24. Turnover on the New York SE was heavy at 243m shares, while falls outscored rises by 1,422 to 381. Prices opened weaker in the wake of the steep fall in Tokyo to a 5 1/2 -year low and on concern about the fragility of the US markets. The selling, however, did not start in earnest until after midday, when the Fed's 'Beige Book' report on business conditions across the US was released. The book indicated that the economic recovery was continuing, and that inflationary pressures in the economy were light. Investors, however, chose to sell on the report, probably because they believed the news of improving economic conditions further reduced the chances of another interest rate cut. A late burst of program selling added to the downward pressure, sending the Dow tumbling past its support level of 3,300. The losses were spread throughout blue chip issues. General Motors fell Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 41 5/8 , General Electric Dollars 1 to Dollars 76 3/8 , Westinghouse Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 17 1/2 and Coca-Cola Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 39 3/8 . Coca-Cola was also affected by reports that the soft drinks group had told analysts that second-quarter estimates of 42 to 44 cents a share were appropriate. Telefonos de Mexico shares, heavily bought by US investors in the wake of the group's privatisation last year, continued to suffer, falling a further Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 45 3/8 . Upjohn declined Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 32 1/4 in heavy trading after the drugs group said it did not expect second-quarter net income to exceed the 70 cents a share earned a year ago. The news depressed some other drug stocks, with Pfizer dipping Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 5/8 , Merck Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/4 , Glaxo ADRs Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 25 3/4 and Schering-Plough Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 50 3/8 . AMR, parent of American Airlines, eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 62 5/8 on news that it will probably report a second-quarter loss because of higher fuel prices and the recent air fares war. Medical Care International dropped Dollars 6 1/2 to Dollars 48 1/2 after agreeing to merge with Critical Care America. Canada THE Toronto market mirrored the Wall Street weakness, the TSE 300 composite index finishing down 39.1 at 3,368.2 as declines outpaced advances by 347 to 221 after substantial volume of 30.2m shares valued at CDollars 361.7m. Traders noted that the selling was broad-based, touching every sector except the real estate and construction index. Bramalea was a bright exception, rising 15 cents to CDollars 1.20 in spite of reporting a first-half loss of 22 cents per share, compared with a profit of 2 cents for the same period last year. The diversified real estate company also halted payments on its common dividends.</p>

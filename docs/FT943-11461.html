			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Tribunal attacks big pay-outs for ex-servicewomen A number of large pay-outs to former servicewomen who were sacked after they became pregnant were 'manifestly excessive' the Employment Appeals Tribunal ruled yesterday. However, the appeals tribunal said most of the seven ex-servicewomen whose cases were taken to appeal by the Ministry of Defence could keep the bulk of their compensation because of the way the Ministry of Defence presented its case. Two women will have to return to industrial tribunals for reassessments. Mr Justice Morison, tribunal chairman, said: 'The large awards, running into many tens of thousands of pounds, seem quite out of proportion to the wrong done.' The MoD, which welcomed yesterday's decision, has already paid out Pounds 16m in settlements since 1990 when the European Court of Justice ruled that the armed forces were not exempt from EC legislation making it illegal to dismiss a woman because she was pregnant. The ministry said at the time that pregnant women dismissed since 1978, when the UK government was obliged to have implemented an EC equal treatment directive, were entitled to compensation. Until today's ruling it had claimed it faced bills of up to Pounds 100m if the principle of large awards had been upheld. The level of future awards to ex-servicewomen dismissed because of pregnancy is now likely to be much lower for the 1,700 outstanding claims. The seven test cases involved women who lost their jobs between 1978 and 1990 and who received awards of up to Pounds 173,000. The awards were made after the government's abolition last November of an Pounds 11,000 compensation limit in industrial tribunals for sex discrimination. About 70 cases involving pregnant women dismissed in past years from the armed forces have been heard at industrial tribunals, with a record Pounds 299,000 recently awarded. The appeals tribunal, which criticised the way the original industrial tribunals had calculated the awards, ruled that in future cases 'industrial tribunals need to keep a due sense of proportion when assessing compensation'. The tribunal also called for greater consistency in future in the awards granted to ex-servicewomen. The tribunal commented that the women had only been entitled to compensation because of judgments by the European courts after they had been dismissed from the services.</p>

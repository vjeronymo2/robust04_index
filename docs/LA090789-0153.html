			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEWS;  </P> <P> TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE;  </P> <P> RIVALS ENGAGE IN BATTLES OF ATTRITION  </P> <P> The Tri-Valley League is off to inauspicious start. More coaches are busy  counting the healthy than listing the talented. An all-star team can be formed  in the nurses' offices of these bedroom communities.  </P> <P> "What's happened to America's youth?," St. Bonaventure Coach Damian Wilkerson  asked. "If they're out there, there not playing football."  </P> <P> Carpinteria, a two-time Southern Section champion, has the largest roster with  41 players. Oak Park had the least on Tuesday when only eight healthy players  showed up for practice. Fillmore recently raised its total to join St.  Bonaventure with 30. Moorpark has 21 and Bishop Diego 17.  </P> <P> Needless to say, most players will see plenty of playing time and several will  rarely leave the field during the course of a game.  </P> <P> The following is a look at the projected order of finish:  </P> <P> Carpinteria -- It is hard to believe that Carpinteria would ever lose its  stranglehold of the Tri-Valley League.  </P> <P> Carpinteria has won or shared three Southern Section championships, two in the  last two years, and has been to the championship game five times under 13-year  Coach Lou Panizzon.  </P> <P> The Warriors have won Tri-Valley titles in 1981, '86, '87 and '88 and have won  15 consecutive league games over the past three seasons. Santa Ynez was the  last league team to defeat Carpinteria, posting a 17-16 victory in the 1985  season finale.  </P> <P> Even more telling of Carpinteria's dominance has been its margin of victories.  Last season, Carpinteria outscored its opponents 191-27. That was somewhat of a  disappointing season for the defense, considering it allowed only one touchdown  in 1987, when the Warriors scored 226 points and yielded 7.  </P> <P> On offense, Coley Candaele returns for his third season as the starting  quarterback. Candaele (5-foot-11, 165 pounds) passed for 1,630 yards and 24  touchdowns last season and made first-team All-Southern Section. Candaele, the  nephew of major league baseball player Casey Candaele, is also a standout  distance runner. He placed second in 1,600 meters and sixth in the 800 in the  state track championships last June.  </P> <P> The rest of the backfield also will be made up of returning starters. Senior  tailback Jose Hernandez (5-9, 175) rushed for more than 700 yards and 11  touchdowns and was an all-league selection. Senior Izak Ondre (5-8, 165)  started at fullback for much of last season.  </P> <P> Fillmore -- The Flashes have perhaps the best chance of unseating Carpinteria  and should improve on last season's record (6-4 overall, 3-2 in league play).  </P> <P> Quarterback Chad Van Winkle (5-8, 165) helped Fillmore make a smooth transition  to passing-oriented offense last season. Van Winkle set school records for  passing attempts (173) and yardage (1,023) as a junior.  </P> <P> The Flashes lost running back Anthony Chessani to knee surgery but have two  experienced replacements. Hugo Virto (5-7, 175) rushed 53 times for 286 yards  and Mike Kozar (5-11, 195) gained 158 yards in 26 carries.  </P> <P> Junior halfback Tory Cabral (6-0, 180) is a strong runner and will be the focus  of the ground game. Cabral helped Fillmore's junior varsity teams to undefeated  league records and an overall mark of 17-3 the past two seasons.  </P> <P> Tight end Steve Palmer (6-1, 205) and tackle Ralph Meza (6-2, 270) were both  all-league selections and will have to cover up for a relatively inexperienced  line.  </P> <P> Fillmore was shorthanded until the team's assistant coaches recruited 12  players in three days to raise the roster total to 30.  </P> <P> "It happened virtually overnight," Coach Curtis Garner said. "I feel a lot more  comfortable with my team knowing that I have some depth. I think we'll be ready  now to challenge for the league title."  </P> <P> Moorpark -- The Musketeers may have the second-best athlete in the league  behind Candaele in quarterback Robert Hernandez (6-2, 170). He already has  caught the attention of local college scouts. Now all he he needs is a receiver  to catch his passes. Last season, Hernandez passed for 615 yards and two  touchdowns but had a mediocre completion rate of 37% (56 of 151). Injuries  already have taken a toll and Musketeers' backfield has been affected the most.  Junior Tony Upshaw (5-10, 180) suffered a deep cut in his right foot and could  be out for two weeks. Senior Jeff Cox (6-0, 200), a two-year varsity letterman,  will move from fullback to tailback until Upshaw returns. He will be joined by  third-string fullback Doug Frasco. Backup fullback/linebacker Tom Uphoff (5-11,  190) suffered a torn quadriceps muscle in his right leg and also will be out at  least two weeks.  </P> <P> Senior tackle Pedro Lozano (5-11, 230) and senior guard Victor Magdaleno (6-1,  210) are Moorpark's strongest and best blockers and should provide better  protection for Hernandez.  </P> <P> Moorpark has not won a league championship since 1941. Last season, the  Musketeers finished 1-9 and 0-5. Second-year Coach Rob Dearborn hopes to finish  at least in the middle of the pack this season.  </P> <P> St. Bonaventure -- The Seraphs will go through a rebuilding season after losing  22 players from last year's team that finished 3-7, 2-3.  </P> <P> Senior quarterback Chris Conley (6-1, 185) was a part-time starter last season  and led the team in passing yardage with 607. He also rushed for 62 yards.  </P> <P> The other three returning starters are senior linemen -- tight end Chris  Borchard (5-10, 185), tackle John Kistler (6-4, 220) and center Ryan Garcia  (5-10, 230).  </P> <P> Fullback Sam Monroe (6-0, 225) and split end Tom Marostica (5-11, 145) saw  part-time duty last season. Marostica caught five passes for 85 yards.  </P> <P> "We're looking to utilize Chris Conley on the option as much as we can,"  second-year coach Damian Wilkerson said. "We'll sink or swim with him. He's all  we have.  </P> <P> "The rest of the players are big question marks."  </P> <P> Oak Park -- After going 10-2 overall and reaching the second round of the  playoffs, Oak Park expected to have a big turnout this season. Instead, the  Eagles will be lucky to make it through the season without forfeitting any  games. Coach Ron Veres said his team has lost eight players to injuries and may  struggle to field 11 for its first game against Boron.  </P> <P> Oak Park does have some talented athletes when they are healthy. Kent Richter  (5-9, 145), who sat out last season, will be the tailback. He was a member of  the school's 400-meter relay team that placed second in the Southern Section  1-A Division. Senior Carlos Pena (5-10, 185) earned all-league honors as a  two-way lineman and will start at fullback.  </P> <P> Junior Mike Stern (6-1, 185) will shift from receiver to quarterback. His main  targets will be senior Mike Devine (5-11, 165) and junior Chris Ruhle (5-11,  165). Senior Erikk Case (6-1, 175) and sophomore Jeff Gibbons (5-10, 165) are  also receivers, but suffered injuries in practice. None have caught passes at  the varsity level.  </P> <P> Bishop Diego -- Coach Norris Fletcher almost had to wait until next year before  officially beginning his first season at the helm for the Cardinals. Bishop  Diego, which has won one game in the last two years, also struggled to fill its  roster. The Cardinals ended up with 17 players, including two sophomores and  one 15-year-old freshman.  </P> <P> Despite the low turnout, the Cardinals have almost an all-senior starting  lineup.  </P> <P> The backfield consists of seniors Miguel Sanchez (5-9, 150) at quarterback,  Sean Faitel (5-11, 170) at fullback and Joel Chenoweth (5-11, 155) and Aaron  Baker (5-10, 160) alternating at running back.  </P> <P> Mike Hamilton (6-3, 160) and Keith Adett (5-9, 160) are the receivers.  </P></p>

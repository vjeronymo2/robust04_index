			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CLOTHING IMPORT BILL ADVANCES  </P> <P> The Senate Finance Committee today completed action on a bill limiting imports  of apparel and footwear but made no recommendation on whether it should be  passed.  </P> <P> The bill is supported by a majority of members of the House and Senate, but  there is some question whether the margins are large enough to override a  presidential veto.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration opposes the bill, and President Bush's advisers say  they will recommend a veto if it passes.  </P> <P> President Ronald Reagan vetoed similar legislation in 1985 and 1988, and both  vetoes were sustained by Congress.  </P> <P> Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chief sponsor of the bill, said it is  necessary "to prevent the outright extinction of the U.S. textile, apparel and  non-rubber footwear industry."  </P> <P> But Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) said, "I cannot think of a single justifiable  smidgen of comment to say about this bill." He said it would violate  international trade agreements and send the wrong signal at a time when the  United States is pleading for free trade.  </P></p>

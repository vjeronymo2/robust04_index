			<p>BFN     [Text] Certain media have recently been disseminating  reports that a significant increase in retail prices and tariffs  for consumer goods and services is planned for May and June of  this year. Additionally, it has been insinuated that the  Economy Ministry has already drafted a resolution, the adoption  of which will lead to a new wave of inflation and further  deterioration of the people's living standards. The press  service of the Economy Ministry states that the ministry is not  working on any plans to increase retail prices or tariffs.</p>

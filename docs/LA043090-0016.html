			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FALCON PROTECTOR  </P> <P> Milt Swimmer, partner with J.H. Snyder Co., is to be commended for his attitude  towards the pair of peregrine falcons mating on his building ("Love on a  Ledge," Metro, April 26). By treating the birds as his "first tenants," Swimmer  breaks important ground in the battle of developers vs. nature. I hope his  placing the needs of two raptors before those of efficient construction sends a  signal to other developers to examine their own priorities.  </P> <P> DOUGLAS C.

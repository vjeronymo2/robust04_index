			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem yesterday [1  January] denied the possibility that a coalition government  could be formed in 1995 by factions of the ruling Justicialist  Party and the opposition Radicals, despite the fact that they  have reached a deal on constitutional reform because the  differences between the two remained too great.    "We can agree on political issues but the lack of  similarities in the economic field will make that kind of  government impossible," Menem said in his native La Rioja.    The president's comments were prompted by an interview with  Radical Party (UCR) Chairman Raul Alfonsin published by the  Buenos Aires newspaper LA NACION on Friday [31 December].    In the article, Alfonsin suggested that "all those who want  to defend the overall plan that will be an alternative to the  neoconservative model" followed by the Menem administration join  together to form a coalition government when the next  presidential and congressional elections are held.    Among potential members of his group, Alfonsin said, was  "the  large portion of the Justicialist Party that is opposed to the  policies that (the government) is carrying out."    Alfonsin also spoke out in favour of the idea of continuing  in favour of the idea of continuing the dialogue begun between  the UCR and the government on constitutional reform to address  issues such as education and foreign policy, "where we will  also debate quite a bit."    "This moment in Argentina should by symbolized by the word  dialogue," said Alfonsin.    However, Menem appeared unwavering in his attempt to stress  the differences between his party and the UCR.    Agreement on economic matters, said the head of state was  impossible because "the Radicals continue to support an economic  system like that which led to the situation we experienced in  July 1989, which was uncontrollable."    Menem stressed that his administration would not stray from  the economic course it had charted. "While my government lasts a  devaluation of the peso is impossible; thus the exchange parity  (between the peso and the United States dollar) will remain  unchanged."    The President also lauded the successes his government had  logged last year.    "Nineteen ninety-three has been one of the most brilliant  years for the Argentine Republic with the consolidation of the  democratic process beginning with the accord" on constitutional  reform signed last month by Menem and former president Alfonsin.    In addition Menem noted, "The country grew at a rate of  nearly seven percent at the same time as the poverty indicators  decreased and unemployment showed a tendency to decline."    Menem noted that between May and October 1993 unemployment  dropped 0.6 percent from a record-high 9.9 percent. "It's a  small decrease," said the President, "but it marks a tendency  for this year."    Labour Ministry figures released on Friday that show an  increase in unemployment between October 1992 and last October  to 9.3 percent from seven percent.    While still in La Rioja Menem also asserted that last  month's  riot in Santiago del Estero was fomented by "agitators who have  infiltrated the province" and may also be doing so in other  provinces.</p>

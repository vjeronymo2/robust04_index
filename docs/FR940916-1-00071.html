Current FRA personnel have, during prior years, served in a variety of capacities on every major railroad. Each of them has been exposed_in their combined Federal and private sector careers_to a vastly richer panorama of American railroading than most railroad employees will enjoy in a lifetime. These railroad safety inspectors, supervisors, and managers contribute daily to the rulemaking judgments ultimately expressed by the Federal Railroad Administrator, and the agency has made a special effort in this proceeding to tap the knowledge that these individuals possess to ascertain the means by which public and employee safety may be secured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The experience of the agency yields the following broad findings. These finding are based upon hundreds of accident investigations, tens of thousands of days of inspection activity, and hundreds of thousands of contacts with railroad employees, supervisors, and managers, as well as the comments to this docket:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;In general, locomotive and train brake safety is good. Investments in improved technology offer the possibility of further progress in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;However, exceptions to this rule are numerous and persistent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Exceptions often derive from railroads' attempts to speed the provision of efficient transportation services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The current structure of the regulations tends to impede efficient provision of transportation services, while creating incentives to evade the regulations and imposing certain requirements that are not effective in practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Accordingly, continuation of the current regulatory structure_which with every passing year becomes less well adapted to the current realities of the industry_is likely to erode safety over time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Train Brake Inspections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal problems addressed in this notice concern the safety of conventional freight trains. In particular, the current regulations focus great attention on intensive and often repetitive train brake inspections conducted at departure from major terminals and at fixed intervals en route. Under these circumstances, tremendous incentives exist to ``overlook'' or fail to inspect rigorously for what may be viewed as minor defects on individual cars. In some cases, personnel have been instructed to disregard defective conditions in order to move trains, after which FRA has often been required to resolve (or attempt to resolve) disputed claims of responsibility in the context of enforcement actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This system encourages railroads to assign inspection duties to train crews who_while notably competent and alert in their normal duties_have often received little training in inspection of increasingly diverse power brake arrangements and other safety-critical components of freight equipment. As a result of this and other factors, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the number of qualified mechanical personnel employed by the railroads and the number of locations at which such personnel are deployed have declined rapidly. In a system that ensures minimum economies of scale, repair trucks equipped with an increasing array of equipment are then used to provide spot-repair capability at outlying points in cases where cars cannot be moved safely prior to repair (or where, as in the case of the statutory power brake requirements, movement is prohibited by law). Although this process of consolidation and adaptation may have been both necessary and healthy in its earlier stages, it now threatens to leave the railroads short of qualified mechanical forces and excessively dependent on contract repair facilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> FRA is intimately familiar with other factors that complicate this analysis. In particular, the competitive environment fostered by deregulation of the motor carrier and railroad industries has led to intensive cost cutting through rationalization of plant, more effective utilization of equipment, substitution of automated information systems for manual systems, and reduction of payrolls through reductions in force and contracting out of work previously performed by railroad employees. For the railroads, reducing employment has become an imperative that threatens to drive itself out of control. For instance, the Railroad Retirement System depends upon employer contributions on behalf of less than 275,000 employees to support over 372,000 retirees. With every employee removed from the rolls, the likelihood increases that further increases in Railroad Retirement Taxes will be required_creating further perceived incentives to reduce employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A long-term shift in car ownership has also affected railroad employment decisions. Approximately 40 percent of the freight car fleet is now privately owned, including virtually all tank cars used in revenue service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

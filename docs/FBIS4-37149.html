			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 17 Jun (MENA)--The Egyptian Central Bank's  latest report emphasizes that the annual service of Egypt's  foreign debts totalled 2.5 billion dollars at the end of March  1993. This sum amounts to 12 percent of the revenue of foreign  currencies, part of which is used to service foreign debts. In  a statement to AL-'ALAM AL-YAWM newspaper, Dr. Yusuf Butrus  Ghali, minister of state for international cooperation, pointed  out that the safe limit regarding the service of foreign debt  must not exceed 24 percent, noting that there is a surplus of  approximately 9 percent as an additional margin to the safe  limit.    Dr. Ghali pointed out that the volume of serving Egypt's  foreign debts in 1987 reached 52 percent of the revenue of  foreign currency. He expected that the service of Egypt's  foreign debts in the next five years will drop to 6 percent of  the revenue of foreign currency if the size of foreign debts  maintains its ratio and if the current rate of borrowing remains  unchanged.</p>

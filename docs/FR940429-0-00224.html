			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four commenters opposed the provision in this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that required an institution to be responsible for payment of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability owed by the institution's third-party servicer for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation of the institution's participation until the amount is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paid in full. One of these commenters argued that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer should be held entirely accountable for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment of any liabilities incurred for the servicer's violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Title IV, HEA program requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In the NPRM published on February 17, 1994, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary repeatedly stated that an institution is always  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for the actions of any of its third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This responsibility includes assuming payment of any liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred by the servicer as a result of a violation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program requirement by the servicer while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administering aspects of the institution's participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. See &sect;668.25(c)(3). No institution will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to answer for servicer violations without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to have such determinations reviewed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures established in these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters were concerned with the provision in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section governing the ability of the Secretary to perform an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative offset to collect funds owed under the procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section. One of these commenters suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary only use administrative offset to collect funds if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer has not entered into an agreement with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary to repay those funds. The other commenter thought that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this provision amounted to the equivalent of an emergency action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without having to afford an institution or third-party servicer a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> show-cause hearing. Several commenters were opposed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision in this section governing the ability of the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to collect on a surety or third-party guarantee before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion of appeal proceedings. These commenters contended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this provision assumes that the party is guilty before it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven. Two of the commenters were also opposed to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision on the grounds that audit findings of the Department of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Education are sometimes insupportable or in error and that to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect on a surety or guarantee before those findings can be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proven wrong is simply improper.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The provisions in this section governing additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steps that the Secretary may take to collect funds owed under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures of this section are necessary to allow the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to act quickly to protect Federal funds and insure that funds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available for collection. Institutions have a distinct financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive to cause delay and prolong any appeal of audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations. Some institutions use delays to either hide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assets or drain assets so that none remain for collection; others  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may attempt to draw increased amounts of Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds prior to any final determination. The commenters are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incorrect in stating that administrative offset denies procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection. Under the Department's offset regulations in 34 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part 30, the Department provides written notice and an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to inspect records and receive an oral hearing. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department may offset prior to completing the procedural  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements where failure to offset may substantially prejudice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its ability to collect. In such cases, the Secretary completes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the procedural requirements promptly thereafter and returns any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds later found not to be owing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to comments about the Secretary's ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collect a surety or guarantee before final determinations are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded or all appeal procedures are exhausted, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not agree with the commenters. Financial surety is provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Department as a condition of participation to insure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds are available to satisfy liabilities. The Secretary would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only attempt recourse in cases where there is a need to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relief to students or borrowers affected by the actions of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or third-party servicer, or where the terms of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surety do not guarantee that funds will be available after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeals are completed. For example, in the case of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution that has failed to pay refunds owed to students that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attended that institution, the Secretary believes that the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to collect in advance to pay those refunds outweighs deferring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection to final determinations or until the exhaustion of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal procedures are completed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The reference to 34 CFR 30.28 is revised to refer to 34  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CFR part 30 to clarify that the procedural protections in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part related to administrative offset apply.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 668.25&blank;Contracts Between an Institution and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Third-Party Servicer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters supported fully the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal in this section that requires a third-party servicer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assume joint and several liability with an institution for any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violation by the servicer of any statutory or regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provision relating to Title IV of the HEA. One of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters noted that only the assumption of full liability by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer could ensure the protection of public funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, many commenters supported the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some type of liability on a third-party servicer for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer's violation of a Title IV, HEA program requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although most of these commenters recommended that the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cap liability at the fees and compensation received by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer from the institution. A few commenters supported the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's compromise to limit the liability of a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer to the fees and compensation received from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution if the servicer was not an affiliate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution and to assess full joint and several liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the servicer if the servicer was an affiliate of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution. Other commenters believed in the concept of joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and several liability for third-party servicers only to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extent that it could be unequivocally proven that the servicer is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the one at fault, or that the violation of a Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program requirement was more serious than simple human error. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

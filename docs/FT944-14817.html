			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Government Ethics Row: Defiant rightwinger vows fight to the end Mr Neil Hamilton is not a man to duck a fight. Refusing to resign yesterday, he told the government's business managers that he would fight to the finish to prove he had done nothing wrong. Mr Hamilton opened his campaign by issuing a writ for libel against The Guardian, which printed disclosures about his alleged relationship with Mr Mohamed Fayed before they were raised in the Commons. 'He says it is all lies and he will take The Guardian for millions,' a friend said. This is not the first time that Mr Hamilton has had recourse to the libel courts. He issued a writ against the BBC in 1984 after a Panorama report linked him to rightwing extremists in a programme called Maggie's Militant Tendency. Three years later the BBC admitted that the allegations were false, and paid Pounds 20,000 damages plus costs. Mr Hamilton celebrated by launching a ferocious attack on another BBC programme about the government's defence policies. A man of strong views, Mr Hamilton has been a supporter of the Conservative right since 1970, when he sympathised with Mr Enoch Powell during a clash over immigration that led to Mr Powell's dismissal from the shadow cabinet. He is a believer in the deterrent value of the death penalty, and has called for the reintroduction of corporal punishment for violent offenders. Mr Hamilton took a strong stance on South Africa, defending Baroness Thatcher as prime minister when she refused to toughen sanctions. He once claimed that National Health Service operations were being cancelled, not because of a staff shortage but because public-sector unions had their 'snouts' in the public money trough. But Mr Hamilton is more than an identikit rightwinger. An amusing speaker, he was named parliamentary wit of the year in 1989 by the Spectator news magazine. The grandson of Welsh miners, Mr Hamilton was sufficiently Euro-sceptic to defy Baroness Thatcher in 1986 by rebelling against legislation implementing the Single European Act. By the time of last year's debates on the Maastricht treaty he was in the government and had to help Mr John Major force the bill through the Commons. Mr Hamilton, 45, was born and educated in Wales, but has been MP for Tatton, Cheshire, since June 1983. He made his mark by barracking Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, from the government back benches. Spotted by Lady Thatcher, he was made a parliamentary private secretary in 1986 and a junior whip in 1990. Mr Major made him corporate affairs minister at the trade and industry department in 1992.</p>

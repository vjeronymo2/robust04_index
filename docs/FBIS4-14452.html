			<p>BFN     [Text] Former Russian Finance Minister Boris Fedorov is now  in charge of the State Duma's sub-committee for monetary and  credit policy. At his news conference today, Fedorov made his  views known concerning the current government's economic  policies:    [Begin Fedorov recording] I think that not a single economic  action was carried out over the past three months that could be  called reformist, even in the conventional sense of the word.    At the same time, nothing bad was done either, or almost  nothing, save for the abrogation of the decision on excise  duties on alcohol, and for the adoption of strange import  tariffs, under which the budget revenue from import tariffs is  declining while prices are rising.    The government is, in essence, on course and, as for me, I  will support the budget, because given the quality of the  current political situation I think that this budget can be the  best possible one, at any rate where expenditure is concerned.    It is clear that the government and the Finance Ministry  endeavored to keep in check the swelling expenditure we have  experienced. However, attempts to keep the situation under  control are not tantamount to any real forward movement and that  is why my views are as follows: In the first place, the  government must be given a further two or three months and we  must take a look at how the situation develops in reality, how  inflation shapes up in May and June.    I think that in principle, things have so far been going  much  better than could have been expected and in this context, again,  I will broadly speak in support of the government and will not  enter any opposition.

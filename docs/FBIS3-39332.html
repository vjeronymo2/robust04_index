			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Feb 16 (AFP) -- Private European  Community steelmakers still need to find capacity cuts of two to  four million tonnes of hot-rolled steel if a rescue plan for the  industry is to succeed, an EC official said Wednesday [16  February].    EC Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann told journalists  here that the private steel sector had been given until April to  share out amongst themselves the required capacity cuts.    He said the two to four million capacity reduction target  was  the bare minimum to destroy over-production of between 19 and 25  million tonnes of hot-rolled steel a year.    Bangemann was speaking after a meeting with steel executives  here on Tuesday to discuss the over-production crisis.    "I think they got the message," he said, adding that he  planned another meeting with the steelmen shortly before a  gathering of EC industry ministers on April 22 to review the  rescue plan.    He repeated that the European Commission would abandon a  plan  to lend financial support for a slimming down of the steel  industry unless the private sector accepted the Commission's  capacity-cut targets.    But Bangemann said the threat had nothing to do with the  Commission's decision Wednesday to levy fines totalling ECU104  million (115 million dollars) on 16 European steel firms for  running a cartel in steel beams.    About one third of the total fine was levied on British  Steel, and the fines provoked outrage in Britain.    Reflecting British sentiment, Keith Brookman, general  secretary of Britain's Iron and Steel Trades Confederation,  suggested earlier that the fines might be a "blackmail tactic"  to enforce the production cuts.    The Commission's capacity reduction targets would mean  scrapping at least 60,000 jobs -- a sacrifice deemed essential  medicine for an industry buffetted by a steel glut, falling  demand, plummetting prices and economic recession.    Last December, EC governments agreed that the public sector  steelworks would cut production by 5.5 million tonnes of  hot-rolled steel a year, as a condition for allowing them  last-time subsidies totalling about 7.5 billion dollars.    Bangemann said there were indications that the private  sector  might be ready to slice capacity by about 11 million tonnes,  leaving two to four million tonnes still to be found.    But the private steelmakers are upset about continuing  subsidies paid to their public sector competition in Spain,  Germany, Italy and Portugal.    They say they are being asked to shoulder an unfairly large  share of the production sacrifice in the face of  state-subsidised competition.</p>

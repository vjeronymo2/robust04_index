			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / Private View: In search of future enemies Because the west can no longer see the enemy, Nato is struggling to find a role. Around the world the guns keep firing. But without an enemy who can feel secure? So, while leaders of the western military alliance were jetting to Brussels to talk this week about 'partnerships for peace' I took a suburban train through the snow to Camberley in Surrey to talk about prospects for war. My target was David Chandler, latest victim of the peace dividend. Last night, the eve of his 60th birthday, he was pensioned off from his job as head of war studies at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst. A Pickwickian figure in waistcoat and watch chain, Chandler is one of Britain's leading military historians, a globetrotting Napoleon specialist, prolific writer and lecturer, adviser to television (latterly, The Great Commanders), stalwart of the Sealed Knot society for re-enactment of famous battles. Dr Chandler is not shy. The letters after his name run right across the office door and the frontispiece of his latest book is a photograph of the D. Litt awarded to him by Oxford University. Instead of visiting cards he hands out witty colour caricatures of himself. Nor is he short of words: they pour from him like a fusillade from a pom-pom gun. But behind the rapid fire is a grim realist with a speculative mind: could the next great war, asks Chandler, be triggered by rival international business cartels? He does not see Britain going to war again except as part of an alliance, unless for some small-scale operation like the Falklands. Neither could he imagine another struggle between former European adversaries; that is, unless a 'totally wrong regime' were to gain power via the ultra-right-wing nationalists now reappearing in Germany, France and, of course, Russia. So where is the threat coming from? 'I go back to Napoleon's statement. 'Let China sleep. When she wakes the world will rue it.' China is the unknown card in the pack in a very big way.' Chandler was not referring to Britain's dispute over Hong Kong. 'That will be just a sad last whimper of the British Empire. The Chinese are humiliating the UK in revenge for the way we treated them in the 19th century. 'No, the Chinese have got these tremendous resources they haven't even started to tap, a huge population, this terrific intelligence. And it's a very heady (he pronounced it 'heedy') combination.' Would the issue be lebensraum? 'If they haven't got their resources fully mobile they'll have to move to get other people's resources to maintain their standard of living, development, industry. That's always been the major thing. Like the Rape of the Sabine Women. Rome was short of breeding stock. So it went to grab 'em. Nowadays it's oil.' What about the Japanese? Aren't they in that position too? 'Ahhh . . . Right. We used to call them the British of Asia in 1905, 'the gallant little Jap'. They could. You see, they've had a very humiliating defeat and of course it's difficult for a westerner to fully understand. They are humiliated and lost face. That is going to be a problem in the longer term. China will see threats which we would not regard as threats and feel they must take determinate action, or the Japanese could do it, partly for revanchism, though they don't want to admit that . . .' Chandler regards economic competition as a possible cause of war, not a substitute for it. It was obvious, he said, that the Gulf war was fought because of Kuwaiti and Saudi oil. Less obviously, Atlantic oil was a prime reason for the Falklands War. 'When the chips are down you go to war for key resources. If you are going to suffer a lot, become a slave economy or whatever, that could cause struggles of this nature.' Does that mean war is not eradicable? 'In a perfect world it would be. But it's not a perfect world.' If war was eradicable, I said, it would be a perfect world. He chuckled. 'Exactly right. Touche.' There could be conflicts to prevent nuclear proliferation. But there was still another danger that strategists were now beginning to study: 'It is these huge international cartels, great groupings of multi-mega-millions of dollars in the hands of relatively small groups of top industrialists. There is a danger, in my opinion - no more than that - that they could become the equivalent of the medieval big bad barons, terrorising people all round them, in a sense. They have so much influence on standards of living and so forth that in a way they can dictate to governments.' They can tell governments to go to war? 'Well, at a pinch, as a last extremity, yes. They might. Shaw in The Apple Cart foresaw a bit of this . . . 'You see, the multinationals are not moral or immoral, they are amoral. They are huge, they have terrific influence, great potential for good, or evil if they do the wrong things. If they get desperate about resources they need to keep their status they will be looking for countries which they can induce to do the dirty work, like grabbing, say, a third of China's oil.' Even the European Union, with its powerful but barely-accountable officials, could be seen as constituting a cartel. Chandler is the son of an East Yorkshire vicar and considered entering the church himself. Like many small boys he was captivated by warlike images: a picture of a medieval fortress, a tank that spat sparks when you pushed it. I suggested he had chosen a contrary vocation. He protested: 'Not for one moment would I claim to be a militarist. I would hate to be called that. The study of war itself is no more militarism than the study of medicine means trying to propagate illness. In a way you are looking for answers: I wouldn't say quite solutions, human nature being what it is. What's the difference between 'war studies' and 'peace studies'? 'Ah] Black and white wizards - that's what the peace studies people will say. They believe they are motivated by avoidance of war at all costs, while the war student, if that is the right word, is looking for the means of prosecuting his profession if he needs to. 'Really, there is a lot of common ground. Everyone knows war is wicked. Trouble is, some of us know there are worse things than war under certain circumstances - like genocide or the enslavement of people.' Bosnia had shown again how thin was the veneer of civilisation. At the base of all humanity there was a streak of violence. It could be constructive, the drive behind a great book, symphony or building. Or it could be destructively employed to protect an interest. Chandler admires Clausewitz's perception that a military commander's greatest test is 'friction' in war, the idea that if anything can go wrong, it will. Nor does he share Clausewitz's enthusiasm for war as a necessary, even noble instrument of state policy. He prefers the Swiss strategist Henri Jomini, Marshal Ney's chief of staff, first analyst of Napoleon's military method. All wars are hell, said Chandler, with a few positive products such as medical innovation and human courage and comradeship. Wars were inevitable, too, so long as the United Nations (like the League of Nations or the Congress of Europe before that) remained a forum for propaganda battles and adversarial alliance-building rather than an institution of supranational moral purpose with its own military capability. 'I would call myself a realist more than anything else,' Chandler said. 'I don't believe necessarily in the perfectibility of human nature. It's not very different now, I imagine, than 500,000 years ago. Life, and the struggle for life, does involve violence, even if it's putting out a fire. There's always danger and risk, surviving a challenge. 'That is my basic interest, the way man reacts and has reacted to the challenges, the perils and the opportunities of war, which is probably the most challenging aspect of human existence, the greatest challenge for an individual and for a society.' But if we can't sustain the moral imperative for peacekeeping, I said, does that mean we shall revert to a pre-Cold War age where war was legitimate as well as inevitable? 'There is a danger of that, I would agree with you, if everything is breaking up and America hasn't the energy or the incentive to do the whole thing.' So we're going to say about former Yugoslavia 'Let the buggers fight it out'? 'That's the realpolitik. I wouldn't use the word cynical, but I think a very practical view. Except, we will fight when our own interests are definitely threatened. Then we will intervene.' The lessons of history have not made us any more altruistic? 'I'm afraid when the chips are down that is the bottom line.' So we'll accommodate by saying these kinds of war are an inevitable, evolutionary development? 'That's a highly realistic-pessimistic view, of course. Being realistic, I fear that is the way it's going to go.'</p>

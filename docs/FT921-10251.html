			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / Back into the public arena: A potential new role for Paul Volcker The surest signs that Mr Paul Volcker wants to accept an advisory job with President Boris Yeltsin as soon as his role can be defined are both positive and negative. The positive sign is simply that he is who he is. He has spent most of his life in public service - US Treasury, New York Fed and finally Federal Reserve chairman - always a workaholic, always miserably paid compared with those with whom he did business. In a word, committed. The first thing he did after accepting his investment banking chairmanship, at enough pay to make up for many of the lost years, was to take on an unpaid job heading a commission arguing for better terms for US public servants. The report was hardly a best-seller, though, and after five years of high pay but low profile, the offer of a post of real international importance must be irresistible. The negative sign: he did not mention the invitation to his New York partner, Mr James Wolfensohn, when he landed in New York from his flying visit to Moscow. The two spent the evening discussing Russian problems - 'You name it, and they've got it,' as Mr Volcker summarises the mess - but still no mention of any personal involvement. The discretion learned as a public servant is still an almost Pavlovian response to anything important. If Mr Volcker did not take the offer seriously, he would have talked about it, at least to his partner. However, Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a leading Yeltsin adviser, has the more gossipy habits common on university campuses. So yesterday Mr Volcker was prepared to admit that he had been approached, to be warmly non-committal about it - and somewhat amused. 'You know I was only there as an extension to a European trip - just 36 hours to see for myself, and look up some old friends. And now this. The first thing I mean to do is to go back there - and for at least two days.' These could be quite a difficult two days. It is clear that Moscow badly wants Mr Volcker's name on the masthead - he is the nearest human symbol, thanks to his financial austerity, to an actual IMF endorsement - as soon as possible; but Mr Volcker himself is not interested in being a symbol. He is determined to get a job description where he can be sure to be useful (which is a case of embarras de richesse), and which he can manage in the time left between Wall Street and Princeton university (where he is a professor for half his time), which is harder. He will certainly have to find time for some residence in Moscow, though the Russians might be almost as happy if he spent most of his time on the telephone in New York to his contacts in government. The useful paradox is that his five years in the private sector have made Mr Volcker much more clubbable, without in any way smudging his Caesar's-wife intellectual reputation - quite a feat in the Wall Street of recent years. He has lost the habit of talking in Sphinx-like riddles, which he thought appropriate as Fed chairman, and is a frequent and surprisingly witty conference performer. In one respect his reputation is as forbidding as ever - he likes his own way, and is not an easy man to work with, unlike his very collegiate successor at the Fed, Mr Alan Greenspan. He left some bruised egos in the C street block where the Fed's policymakers also hope to make some sort of a public splash. In Moscow, where most of those he is likely to work with have everything to learn about the outside world and its markets, this is not likely to matter in the least. Mohammed will not only come to the mountain, but happily camp out on its lower slopes. Mr Volcker may even get something of a feeling of deja vu as he considers the problems of a government with a seemingly bottomless deficit, only partly restrained by a much more businesslike and independent minded central bank, and those of negotiating debt rescheduling. He did all this as Fed chairman. But his experience in the US Treasury (which manages US government funding and foreign exchange) and in the New York Fed (which monitors the markets and imposes prudential rules) is likely to be at least as relevant to a Russia striving to invent, as it were, a capitalist past. Mr Volcker has become such a lofty figure of monetary rectitude that it is easy to forget that like everyone who has ever done the New York job effectively, he is an operator and a negotiator. He may yet be able in the right circumstances to do for Russia what his New York predecessor Mr Charlie Coombs once did for Britain - buy vital time at wholesale prices. Time, among other things, to try to implement any advice he offers.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONCE IGNITED, HARD TO STOP;  </P> <P> * COMBATING SHAKE ROOFS AND ARSONISTS  </P> <P> Too much of Southern California has been burning. Hundreds of houses, primarily  those with shake roofs, have been incinerated in communities from Santa Barbara  south to San Diego. There are many culprits, including the drought, but two of  them are criminal.  </P> <P> The state must ban wood shake roofs. The flames leapfrogged from shake roof to  shake roof in Santa Barbara, where as many as 350 homes have been destroyed or  damaged and over 3,500 acres charred by a blaze apparently started by an  arsonist. Preliminary damage estimates have been set at $200 million, which  would make that inferno the most expensive fire in the state's history.  </P> <P> Arsonists started several other fires, including a major blaze in Glendale,  where as many as 66 houses have been damaged or destroyed; 90% of those homes  had wood shake shingle roofs. Gov. Deukmejian has offered a $50,000 reward for  information leading to those responsible for the fires.  </P> <P> The fires are a huge economic tragedy for the five-county region. The human  toll is unmeasurable. Hundreds of families are now homeless; many have lost  everything. Fortunately, there have been no deaths. Heroic firefighters have  suffered burns, smoke inhalation and heat exhaustion while battling the flames  in temperatures topping 105 degrees and in the face of strong winds that have  swept the flames across streets and even freeways.  </P> <P> For as long as Californians have built homes on dry hillsides, shake roofs have  fueled too many fires. But local officials are powerless to impose stronger  codes. Mayor Bradley and the Los Angeles City Council approved a local ban last  year, for example, but the state attorney general's office ruled that local  communities lack the authority to approve local codes that are stricter than  state codes. That decision puts the matter in the hands of the Legislature.  </P> <P> Proposed legislation would restore the authority of local jurisdictions to  impose stricter fire codes. That measure merits approval in spite of opposition  by the $150-million cedar-shake industry.  </P> <P> Shake roofs are rustic and charming but fire safety is not a matter of  aesthetics. As the ashes cool, the state must proceed with a total ban on all  wood shake roofs.  </P></p>

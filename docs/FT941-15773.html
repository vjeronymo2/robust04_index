			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Tory-run council faces damning auditor's report: Major braced for fresh 'back to basics' attack Mr John Major's government was last night bracing itself for fresh attacks on its 'back to basics' initiative with the release today of a damaging report on the running of Conservative-controlled Westminster City council. The district auditor's report into allegations of misconduct by the flagship Tory council during the 1980s over the sale of council houses will be published only in summary form for legal reasons. One minister with links to the council said he expected the auditor's assessment - which has taken four years and cost about Pounds 1m - to be 'damning'. Other Conservative MPs suggested that that might be an understatement. As the cabinet prepared for its first meeting since the recent spate of revelations and resignations, ministers began to clear some of the confusion surrounding its call for a return to traditional values. After a period of contradictory statements, ministers are finally speaking from agreed briefing notes. Yesterday they sought to reinforce Mr Major's insistence that the 'back to basics' strategy applied across the range of the government's economic and social policies rather than to narrow questions of personal morality. But the prime minister will be told today by senior officials of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee that they expect him to take a much tougher line with members of the government whose personal behaviour could tarnish its image. Senior Labour spokesmen indicated their determination to use the Westminster report to contrast the government's commitment to traditional values with the behaviour of some Conservative politicians. The decision not to publish the report in full brought a charge from Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, that the auditor had been the subject of 'bullying' by a former council leader. Speaking with the protection of parliamentary privilege, Mr Straw said he understood the auditor had taken the decision 'as a consequence of constant bullying by lawyers acting for one of the respondents, Dame Shirley Porter'. Despite the secrecy surrounding the conclusions of the investigation, ministers said they would inevitably involve embarrassment for the government. Among other former officials who have been a focus of the inquiry is Mr Barry Legg, the Conservative group's former chief whip. Mr Legg is now MP for Milton Keynes South West. The auditor has the power to recommend that the councillors involved should be surcharged if he decides that the council's actions were unlawful. Three quarters of people questioned in a poll for ITN's News At Ten poll believed ministers who supported the 'back to basics' initiative should resign if they commit adultery.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Vitaliy Churkin, Russian special </F> representative in former Yugoslavia, by RIA NOVOSTI  correspondent Sergey Gryzunov "especially for ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA;" date and place not given: "Serbs and Croats  Reconciled"]    [Text] The joint efforts of Russian and U.S. diplomacy  produced the desired result 30 March. The Croats and the Serbs  who are densely concentrated in the Krajina enclave on the  territory of the Republic of Croatia, concluded a cease-fire  agreement. Russia played a crucial role in achieving this  agreement. Vitaliy Churkin, its special representative in the  talks on the former Yugoslavia, gave an exclusive interview for  ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA.    [Gryzunov] What further action will you take to resolve the  Yugoslav crisis?    [Churkin] First, our joint actions with the Americans are a  precedent which will have far-reaching importance. It is  experience which we can use to resolve other conflicts.    As regards the former Yugoslavia, two main areas of work  have  now been mapped out for us. They are further steps to normalize  Serb-Croat relations, specifically in areas protected by UN  units. Possibly in two weeks' time we will be able to organize a  new round of talks at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb between the  Croats and the Serbs from Krajina on economic questions, and  then we will move on to the most difficult part of the talks --  Krajina's political status.    We intend to take advantage of the accelerating pace of  peacemaking efforts in order to complete the settlement of the  Bosnian conflict. We and our U.S. partners have a clear idea of  what to do next.    [Gryzunov] It is known that some Duma deputies are prepared  to obstruct the Foreign Ministry in connection with your  approach to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. How will  you react?    [Churkin] From my viewpoint our participation in the program  is something that speaks for itself. The reaction of a section  of the Duma did, however, come as quite a surprise to me. In  this context we have already started to explain our positions  and approaches.    Our reaction is that we will defend our viewpoint. We have  to dot all the i's and cross all the t's.    Therefore, as for myself, when I get back to Moscow I intend  to participate most vigorously in the upcoming debate on this  question prior to 21 April, when it is planned that Russia  should officially join the "Partnership for Peace" program.</p>

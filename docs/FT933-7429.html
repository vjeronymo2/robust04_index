			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Exceptionals leave Raglan Pounds 2.4m in red AFTER allowing Pounds 1.49m for additional write-offs and a reduction in property values, Raglan Property Trust, the property developer and investor, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 2.44m for the year ended March 31 1993. That compared with Pounds 1.58m last time when there were exceptional charges amounting to Pounds 960,000. Turnover came to Pounds 354,000 (Pounds 9.49m), generating a gross profit of Pounds 268,000 against Pounds 80,000. Losses per share worked through at 1.4p compared with 0.9p. In April a capital reconstruction took effect, which included raising Pounds 7m of new equity, converting Pounds 3m of principal creditors' debt into equity and repaying the balance of their debt. As a result the company's finances were now on a more secure basis. Since the year-end progress had been made with the development proposals for the shopping centre in Banbury. Also, 18 freehold shops were acquired from Dunn &amp; Co and Philips Pension Fund for Pounds 7.5m at an average yield of 9.3 per cent. Finance came from a Pounds 6.3m loan from NM Rothschild with the balance from Raglan's own resources.</p>

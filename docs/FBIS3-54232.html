Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss has  decided to refer the matter to the Knesset's legal adviser.    The Likud statement, calling for a continued Israeli  presence  on the Golan, was defeated by one vote, but four opposition MK's  [Knesset Members] said their votes were not registered even  though they pressed the correct button in the electronic vote.  Now Knesset Speaker Shevah Weiss says he is willing to hold the  vote again next week, if both sides agree, but as David Ze'ev  reports, the Likud wants him to change the result without a  revote.    [Begin Ze'ev recording] Likud caucus chairman Moshe Qatzav  says he is considering going to the High Court if House Speaker  Shevah Weiss does not reverse the outcome of the plenum vote on  the statement over the future of the Golan Heights. The  coalition declaration of the Labor party and the Meretz bloc at  the end of the Golan debate was endorsed without controversy.  It said simply that the Knesset registers before it the  government's position on the Golan Heights as stated by Deputy  Defense Minister Mordekhay Gur earlier in the debate. But the  statement by the opposition -- Likud, Tzomet, and the National  Religious Party -- borrows terminology from the Labor platform,  a move to embarrass the government. It calls for maintaining an  Israeli military and settlement presence on the Golan. It  failed by one vote, but four opposition MK's say their votes  were not registered, and, in fact, on the Knesset computer sheet  their names do not appear. [passage omitted]    There are two issues at stake. One is a Knesset rule which  says that the House speaker must change the result of a vote  accordingly if Knesset members inform him of a problem after the  voting procedure has been completed. That is the point  emphasized by the Likud's Moshe Qatzav, who says the House  speaker is distorting the will of the Knesset. But the speaker  counters with what he says is the dangerous precedent that would  be established if MK's start complaining that the computerized  voting system sometimes gives the wrong result.

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Dollars 5bn award against serial killer In spite of increasing disquiet in the US about the rise in the scale of punitive awards in recent years, the general level of damages rose significantly last year compared with 1991, according to the US National Law Journal, writes Robert Rice. There were eight awards of more than Dollars 100m. One was for Dollars 5bn against serial killer Robert Berdella, part of which the insurers of his home may have to pick up; another was for Dollars 3.5bn, later reduced to Dollars 1.75bn, against Charles Keating in the litigation arising out of the collapse of the Lincoln Savings and Loan. In 1991 there were two verdicts of more than Dollars 100m. One was later set aside, the other reduced on appeal. The NLJ notes, however, that there were also far more settlements in 1992, both before and after trial. Many of the largest verdicts were settled within weeks of being handed down by juries. But awards in business disputes rose significantly and jury decisions continued to batter insurance companies. Accountancy firms were hit by two big verdicts: one for Dollars 338m against Price Waterhouse which was later set aside, and one of Dollars 558m involving Coopers &amp; Lybrand in the litigation arising out of the collapse of the computer disk-drive manufacturer Miniscribe. This was subsequently settled for an undisclosed sum. Some of the largest awards from previous years were also overturned or reduced in 1992. The largest verdict of 1990, Dollars 185m against Dresser Industries and Baker Hughes over the production of faulty oil-well fracturing materials, was overturned, while the biggest award of 1991, Dollars 127.7m against pharmaceutical giant Upjohn in a product liability case, was reduced to Dollars 38m. Overall, 17 large awards were settled after the verdict; 11 large verdicts were overturned or substantially reduced; and 11 prominent case were settled before trial for amounts of between Dollars 25m and Dollars 500m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Shi Tao (4258 3447)] </F>   [Text] Changsha, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- Speaking in Hunan where  he was directing the work of combating flood and doing disaster  relief, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat,  pointed out: To successfully carry out the work of combating  flood and disaster relief, we must rely on the masses, rely on  ourselves, work hard, rely on unity between the military and  civilians, and rely on strong leadership of the party and  government. Party committees and governments at all levels in  the disaster area should regard the work of fighting disaster  and carrying out disaster relief their central task of paramount  importance at the present stage and should meticulously organize  the efforts, make overall consideration and all-round  arrangement, and make an all-out effort to carry out flood  prevention and disaster relief and to engage in production to  provide for and help ourselves.    From 21 to 23 June, Wen Jiabao led a work group of  responsible comrades of central party, Army, and government  departments concerned to the great dike along the Xiangshui and  to several major disaster areas in Hunan's Changsha, Zhuzhou,  Xiangtan, and Hengyang, where they inspected the disaster  situation. On behalf of the party Central Committee, the State  Council, and the Central Military Commission, they extended  cordial regards to flood victims as well as to cadres, the  masses, People's Liberation Army [PLA] commanders and fighters,  armed police, and public security cadres and officers. Together  with the local party and government leaders, they studied and  arranged for flood prevention and disaster relief work.    Heavy rainstorm hit areas along the Xiangshui from 12 to 18  June, creating great flood unseen in 100 years and causing heavy  losses to industrial and agricultural production and to people's  lives and property in urban and rural areas along the river.  After the outbreak of the disaster, under the leadership of the  Hunan provincial party committee and government and with the  support of the PLA and armed police units in Hunan, the military  and civilians in the province spared no efforts in fighting the  disaster. Their efforts have ensured the safety of Changsha,  Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Hengyang Cities, as well as the  Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, State Highway 107, and other major  transportation facilities; reduced losses caused by the  disaster; and scored initial success in combating flood and  carrying out disaster relief. At present, the masses in the  disaster area are calm in their sentiments, society is stable,  and life is normal.    Wen Jiabao fully affirmed Hunan's fight against flood and  its  disaster relief work. He urged the military and civilians  throughout the province to display the dauntless spirit of  fighting successive battles to win all-around victories in  fighting the disaster and carrying out relief.    After hearing a report on the disaster and observing the  disaster situation, Wen Jiabao also expressed his views on the  work of fighting the disaster and carrying out relief. He said:  The Xiangshui's water level is subsiding. However, its flood  season has not arrived yet. We must not lower our guard and  become careless; we must continue to do a good job of preparing  against big flood and disaster. First, we must step up  repairing various works damaged by water and reinforcing the  dike. This is the key to preventing flood. Second, we must  make adequate arrangement for the victims' daily life, properly  resolve their food and clothing problems, and carry out public  health and epidemic prevention work. Third, we must organize  efforts to provide for and help ourselves and to rebuild our  homes by engaging in production, and we must restore industrial  and agricultural production. Fourth, we must strengthen  ideological-political work to further mobilize the initiatives  of the vast number of cadres and masses in fighting the disaster  and carrying out disaster relief. Fifth, we must strengthen  leadership. Party committees and governments in disaster areas  must lead the broad masses to rely on themselves and rebuild  their homeland through thrift and diligence. All departments  should work closely and provide big support to overcome various  difficulties. We must unite as one to fight the disaster and  carry out disaster relief.</p>

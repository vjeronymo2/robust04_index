			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Outdoors: After the massacre, the narcissi - Gardening / Some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely and see tangible evidence of success Robin Lane Fox has some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely and see tangible evidence of success THIS weekend, it is time to plan the annual bulb massacre. During the past 30 years, I have sent hundreds of them to their death: tulips, anemones, iris, muscari - and my latest victims, 200 ipheions, which were planted lovingly on a warm October day last year and responded by sending up two green shoots between the lot of them in March. Gardeners like to forget the mass murders buried in their gardens because hope springs eternal; if only the Triumph tulips would do the same. But I want to share 35 years' experience of such things with those of you who cannot confess to it or are starting out with high hopes, coloured photographs and bulb catalogues which talk of naturalising. This year is the tulips' 400th anniversary. I send my happy returns to the family although, as individuals, I have seldom had one which has reached its fifth birthday. But since tulips should not be planted until late October, I will reserve a separate week for their birthday obituary. How, though, do wise gardeners spend their money with better prospects of success? My successes have always been narcissi. This year, the trade has not found narcissi easy because many of the bulbs did not grow on well in a year of peculiar weather. I follow firm narcissus rules. I put the tall, hybrid varieties in grass, chosing them to cover their widely differing seasons. I swear by the early Icy Follies, followed by Barrett Browning and the late Pheasant's Eye. These narcissi, with a white base to the flowers, persist better in grass than the tempting all-white daffodils. Order them in 25 kg bulk for country planting and do not economise by starting with a few and seeing what happens. They grow almost everywhere, but you should segregate the varieties in separate clumps because they flower at different seasons. They look miserable if they open when their neighbours have gone brown. Small narcissi also are excellent and persist well, but the catalogues mislead you by recommending them for naturalising. Why not? you might think; after all, some of them grow wild on the Welsh borders or in the Yorkshire dales? The best method is to plant a few, see if they like you and allow them to colonise. Vigour varies widely but you should start with some small, experimental clumps of February Gold, Tete a Tete and the native Lent Lily. They all flower early, allowing you to mow the grass much sooner in the year. I have known gardeners whose grass has been colonised by these strong varieties after three years. If they start to spread, the best method is to lift and divide them after flowering when they are still in leaf: they move much better late in April, the season when no supplier can send them out. We all buy dry bulbs which need to be planted quickly. Next year, there is no particular merit in dead-heading them, but it really does help, after flowering, to spray the leaves with liquid fertiliser once a fortnight. Most of the small narcissi which I have not murdered are used in small groups, in flower beds. They bloom early and the small leaves are unobtrusive when they die. The prettiest, but not the cheapest, is Dove Wings, although groups of a dozen bulbs go a long way. Generally, you can make as much of an impact with small clumps, spaced well down the length of the bed, rather than with an expensive total coverage. February Gold is the strongest form of all (although it is not gold and does not flower in February). Jack Snipe is almost as good and Peeping Tom also has stamina. Never try to naturalise jonquils in grass: they are better in dry ground below a wall. The pure white forms are extremely pretty and we have had sensational success with the pure white Thalia, planted to face due north at the foot of Oxford's ancient city wall. It is supposed to prefer a warm, sheltered place but it has spread by the hundred in this unlikely site. Narcissi grow well on heavy soil but, in light gardens, I would choose anemone Blanda as a carpet instead; its starry flowers open at ground level in pink, white and blue (or simply blue, if you prefer). They arrive like dry, black nuts from the suppliers and I have learned the trick to them. Soak them for 24 hours in a bowl of cold water before planting, and do not worry if you are not entirely sure which side of the corm should be uppermost. Somehow, they right themselves. They are excellent for the front of beds which will be semi-shaded when leaves return to the trees but where they can open in the spring sunshine meanwhile. They will often spread quite happily and the leaves are not a bother. Crocuses are harder to kill if you are not too experimental. Despite a few triumphs, I have vowed to follow narcissus rules with this family, too. Almost the only ones to go into grass will be the strong Dutch hybrids, which persist if you do not mow them before the leaves have died away. The whites and yellows are chosen easily, but the blues are more tricky because the best-known are purple or striped annoyingly. My favourite is Sky Blue - but squirrels and mice like all these crocuses, too, and I know of no protection except the shotgun. Small-flower crocuses usually dwindle in grass, except for the vigorous Tommasinianus; this variety is the other great bet for a future carpet in the lawn. Other small varieties include flowers which I might well choose to take to my desert island: Blue Pearl and Cream Beauty are of unsurpassed beauty and show great stamina along the front of flower beds out of season or at the foot of hedges of roses. On open ground, they persist and multiply, but grass is too much for them. The best multiplier of all in a flower bed is the pale blue vernus Vanguard - not the cheapest, but much your best hope of total cover. Leave aconites alone in quantity. They are better bought in green leaf in the spring and planted in small samples to see if they are happy. The same is true of snowdrops, which few people establish from dry bulbs planted now. Better bets for the bigger cheque-book are the milk-blue and white chionodoxa Luciliae, which spreads rapidly, and the wonderfully early scilla Spring Beauty, which makes clumps but is essential because it flowers so early. Bluebells are a romantic menace and you probably want no more in your life. I would like to have ended on a positive note. For 20 years, my best early spring bulb was the wonderful iris Histrioides Major, which flowers in a brilliant blue at a height of 6in and resists any weather. I have never been able to kill it, whereas its other small relations split into small bulbs and dwindle after two years. Now, the nurserymen have killed it instead. Its two main suppliers in Holland allowed a virus simultaneously into their stock, and this admirable bulb is now off the market.</p>

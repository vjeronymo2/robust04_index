			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa has not discounted the  possibility of placing controls on foreign exchange. Sosa said  he does not favor controls, but the government is prepared to  adopt any necessary measures. The minister made these statements  during a news conference he held after being questioned by the  Chamber of Deputies.    [Begin Sosa recording] Such matters are being reviewed by  the  president at cabinet meetings. What I said was that when this  kind of measure becomes necessary, it must be considered. What  is happening, however, is that we are hoping that this will not  become necessary. [end recording]    The questioning took place as planned; that is, there were  four rounds of questions. A total of 24 congressmen took the  floor. At the session, Minister Sosa reviewed important aspects  of the current economic and financial situation in the country.  He said the government does not favor nationalizing the banks,  but it has not ruled out the possibility. Referring to the eight  financial institutions in which the government has intervened,  the minister said that intervention boards have 30 days to  decide whether these banks should be liquidated or restructured.  He also spoke about privatization processes, noting that they  are necessary to keep the state from suffering huge losses.    He said he does not favor the privatizing of Venezuelan  Petroleum or the Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana.    He also discussed the disparity between assets and  liabilities. He noted that the Central Bank of Venezuela must  find a way to trim the shortfalls. The minister said  nonrestructured foreign debt has risen to 250 billion bolivares,  adding that this has produced domestic outlays of approximately  150 billion bolivares.    After the session, "Union Radio News" consulted the various  parliamentary factions to learn what their position would be on  a censure vote. The social Christian Party and Democratic Action  were cautious in their responses. They said they will wait until  President Rafael Caldera speaks about this vote. Radical Cause,  however, is maintaining its position in favor of a censure vote.</p>

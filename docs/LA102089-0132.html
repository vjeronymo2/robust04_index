			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NORTH;  </P> <P> YORBA LINDA;  </P> <P> CITY TO SEEK MORE FAMILY RESTAURANTS  </P> <P> Fed up with fast food, the City Council has voted to adopt "an aggressive  marketing approach" to attract more family restaurants to the city.  </P> <P> A report by Community Development Director Phillip S. Paxton this week said  that while the city is saturated with fast-food and takeout establishments, it  can accommodate more sit-down restaurants.  </P> <P> "From an economic and demographic point of view, Yorba Linda can support 38%  more restaurants than the average (city) in the United States," Paxton said.  </P> <P> Although the motion was passed unanimously, the council did not reach agreement  on how it will attract new restaurants to the city.

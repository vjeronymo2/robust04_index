			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Visits (&sect;409.48)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested clarification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare coverage when a nurse provides a skilled nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service and a home health aide service in the course of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single visit. The commenter suggested that the HHA should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive two payments for this visit: one payment for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing visit and one for a home health aide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If a nurse furnishes several  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services that fall within the normal scope of a nurse's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practice in the course of a single visit, that constitutes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only one visit. Because the visit involved only a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurse providing home health services during the course of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single visit, the fact that the nurse also provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incidental unskilled services (which can be safely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively provided by a licensed nurse) in addition to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing care does not mean that the service could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered as two visits. We consider this situation to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve only a single episode of personal contact between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HHA staff and the beneficiary and, therefore, covered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only as a single visit under the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;409.48(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter requested clarification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare coverage when two individuals are needed to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a service. The commenter specifically cited a situation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which a nurse and a home health aide are required to furnish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated in &sect;409.48(c)(3) of this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare will pay for two visits when two individuals are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to furnish a service (e.g., a bath, wound care, or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain exercise). Because each patient's situation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unique, we have not established a specific guideline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which combinations of HHA personnel can furnish services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are covered as two visits. The personnel, however,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be appropriate for the service to be performed (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, it would not require the services of two licensed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nurses to give a routine bath to a heavy beneficiary).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although coverage of these services does not require the HHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to submit any additional documentation, the clinical notes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should describe why it is necessary for two individuals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnish the service (patient's weight, nature of required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter opposed the coverage of two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visits when the HHA staff cannot provide the reasonable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary care in the course of a single visit but remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the beneficiary's home between the provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. The commenter stated that claims for coverage in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this situation would be too difficult for the intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to review. Another commenter requested that we rescind this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage until its impact can be studied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We have not accepted either of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments. We believe that, in those situations in which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HHA cannot provide the necessary services in the course of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> single visit (e.g., wound dressing changes), it is fair and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasonable to cover two separate visits even though the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual furnishing the care has remained in the home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between visits (e.g., to provide companionship or other non- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered care). Abandonment of this policy would simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in HHA staff leaving the home for a token period of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time or having a different HHA staff member provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second service to create an artificial ``second visit.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although coverage of these visits may be more demanding for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intermediary to review, the removal of this coverage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would inevitably result in HHAs allocating staff less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiently to secure coverage of two visits. In summary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the two services cannot feasibly be provided in a single  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> visit, we do not believe what the provider does between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those services is relevant to the coverage decision. With  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regard to delaying implementation of this coverage, Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has covered two visits in this situation for some time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without discernible effect. This rule codifies current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> coverage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

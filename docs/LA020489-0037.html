			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANDINISTA PROPOSAL FOR REBELS WINS HONDURAS SUPPORT  </P> <P> In what could be a breakthrough in Central America's stalled peace efforts,  Honduras gave qualified support Friday to a Nicaraguan government proposal for  disarming and resettling idled Nicaraguan rebels who want to leave their  military camps in Honduras.  </P> <P> Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo gave his response after hearing the  proposal from Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and discussing it with Vice  President Dan Quayle. Honduran and U.S. officials said the Nicaraguan plan will  receive serious attention.  </P> <P> This apparent step toward talks on disbanding the U.S.-backed Contra army was  taken as Latin American leaders meeting here pressed Ortega to relax his  Sandinista party's strong grip on a postwar Nicaragua. A final armistice in the  Contra war is expected to be the goal of a five-nation Central American summit  meeting now set for Feb. 13-14 in San Salvador.  </P> <P> Honduras, a long-compliant U.S. ally and Nicaragua's northern neighbor, has  played host to the Contra army since the CIA assembled it in 1981. After the  U.S. Congress cut off their military aid a year ago, about 10,000 rebels have  retreated to the Honduran border camps, leaving only a token force to skirmish  in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> As one of the Latin American leaders who gathered here Wednesday for  Venezuela's presidential inauguration, Ortega handed Azcona a proposal offering  land, jobs and amnesty to Contras who want to lay down their weapons.  Nicaragua's Sandinista government would also release most of its 3,000 or so  remaining political prisoners, take other steps toward a freer society and set  up a team of Hondurans and Nicaraguans to monitor the homecoming.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Extraordinary Problem'  </P> <P> Azcona said he felt obliged to study the proposal because the presence of so  many armed Contras in his country is "an extraordinary problem" that could  become a "security threat" if, lacking renewed American military aid, they  abandon the camps and scatter about the country.  </P> <P> "We can help solve this problem by easing the departure of the Contras from  Honduras to third counties that want to receive them. We can collect these  Contras' arms, if that is the decision, and we can ease the departure to  Nicaragua of those Contras who accept amnesty in Nicaragua," Azcona told  reporters.  </P> <P> Azcona said he insisted in their meeting that Ortega cannot wait until the  rebel army is dissolved before keeping promises about democratic reforms that  the Nicaraguan leader made as one of the five signers of a Central American  peace accord 18 months ago.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Azcona said, he will support continued non-lethal U.S. aid to  the Contras to keep them together.  </P> <P> But twice during his press conference, Azcona said he was "pleased" and "fully  satisfied" with Ortega's promises to reduce the size of the Sandinista army,  hold fair elections next year and give freer rein to private enterprise in  Nicaragua.  </P> <P> Quayle discussed the plan with Azcona here but declined to comment on it  publicly. But he said the Bush Administration is making "no move right now" to  rearm the Contras, with the hope that "diplomatic initiatives" can force  changes in Nicaragua.  </P> <P> A U.S. official said the Administration "will take a good hard look" at the  Ortega plan but may need months to devise a strategy for Central America. "The  whole region is more out on its own than ever," he said.  </P> <P> Ortega beamed as he watched a telecast of Azcona's remarks from his hotel  suite. "I think we have achieved a rapprochement," he said. "The summit can be  fruitful."  </P> <P> Other Latin American leaders here for the swearing-in of President Carlos  Andres Perez told Ortega that he must concede more than amnesty for the summit  to succeed. However, none insisted that he resume the direct talks with Contra  leaders that were broken off last June.  </P> <P> President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica, author of the 1987 peace accord,  challenged Ortega to advance municipal elections now set for November, 1990,  into this year and to abolish a censorship law.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three-Hour Meeting  </P> <P> In an unusual three-hour meeting that ended early Friday, Ortega and Arias  debated the Nicaraguan conflict with the Sandinistas' closest Latin American  allies -- Cuban President Fidel Castro, Peruvian President Alan Garcia and the  new Venezuelan president.  </P> <P> An official who was present said that Castro did little talking, leaving Ortega  to defend himself.  </P> <P> For Ortega, said the source, "it was like having your best friends tell you,  'We respect you, but we think you have to do more.' They're telling him this  could be his best and last opportunity for peace."  </P></p>

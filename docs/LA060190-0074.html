			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DOWN AND OUT IN THE SOVIET UNION;  </P> <P> WHY PROBLEMS BACK HOME THREATEN U.S. SECURITY, NOT ENHANCE IT  </P> <P> The outcome of the current Bush-Gorbachev summit will be determined by the  willingness of the two superpowers to deal in a constructive fashion with three  considerations glimpsed only dimly when they last met in Malta. Now all three  are clear: One is a fact; one is an aspiration, and the other is a realization.  </P> <P> The fact is Soviet weakness. Today, Moscow's network of military alliances has  collapsed; its only firm claim to superpower status is its nuclear arsenal. Its  system of economic planning has failed utterly. Central authority itself is in  jeopardy, as nationalism surges not only around the periphery but also through  the Russian heartland. Political fragmentation is so intense that the two  largest vote-getters in the Russian Republic's presidential election this week  were a Gorbachev critic from the left -- the winner, populist Boris N. Yeltsin  -- and an opponent from the right -- hard-liner Ivan K. Polozkov. Yet  Gorbachev, as Thursday's Times Poll reported, remains popular.  </P> <P> The aspiration is European stability. Here the United States must take Soviet  weakness into account without exploiting it, particularly on the German  question. Washington -- and the Germans -- want to see the new Germany part of  NATO. Soviet public opinion, as The Times Poll found, overwhelmingly desires a  neutral Germany.  </P> <P> Yet such a solution virtually assures the European instability everyone fears.  What must be found -- and this may take some doing -- is a structure that keeps  Germany firmly in the stabile community of Western nations without frightening  the Soviet people and humiliating and further weakening their leaders. It is  not surprising that some are touting a sort of desperation candidate known as  the 35-nation Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe as a possible  successor umbrella for Europe. The 15-year-old organization already includes  the Soviet Union and the United States as members and so carries no  debilitating Cold War baggage. Something, though not just anything, is needed.  </P> <P> Finally, point three: The realization is that neither superpower can dictate  solutions. The Soviets can influence, but not exercise, a veto over the shape  of the new Europe. The United States can isolate itself or put aside domestic  politics to join the stabilizing process of economic interchange with the  Soviets wisely begun by the Europeans. A destitute, desperate Soviet Union is  in no one's interest. Washington ought to sign the trade agreements it has  concluded with Moscow as soon as possible.  </P></p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Shortfall in US pension funds shows big increase The shortfall in the 50 US corporate pension funds with the biggest deficits had climbed from Dollars 29bn to Dollars 38bn by the end of last year, and is projected to have grown to as much as Dollars 50bn now. The figures will add to support for proposed legislation which would force companies to cut the scale of their pension fund deficits, in turn eating into their reported profits and cashflow. The latest figures on the scale of the underfunding were disclosed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, which guarantees benefits in private sector funds. Falling US bond rates largely account for the worsening position of US pension funds. Long-term interest rates are used to discount future pension liabilities to calculate their current values. As this discount rate falls, the present value of the liabilities rises. 'With interest rates declining, companies should have been contributing larger amounts to their pension plans to keep their liabilities manageable. Our reforms will require it,' said Mr Martin Slate, executive director. Given the one percentage point fall in the 30-year US bond yield since the start of this year, the combined deficit is likely to have grown considerably larger. General Motors, for instance, calculates that a one percentage point fall adds Dollars 5bn - 6bn to its liabilities. GM once again topped the PBGC's listings. As others, such as Chrysler, have moved to cut the underfunding of their plans, the scale of GM's pension fund deficit now dwarfs those of other companies. Last week GM announced its intention to transfer Dollars 5.7bn worth of shares into its pension fund. The PBGC figures differ from those published by companies because they are calculated on a termination basis, and assume the funds are forced to buy annuities at current market rates to cover all their future liabilities. Based on its own calculations, GM's deficit was Dollars 14bn at end-1992 and will be Dollars 24bn by the end of this year as a result of lower bond yields.  -------------------------------------------------         LARGEST UNFUNDED PENSION PLANS  -------------------------------------------------                                    Unfunded                              benefits Dollars m                                   Dec      Dec                                  1992     1991  ------------------------------------------------- General Motors                 20,182   11,827 Bethlehem Steel                 2,431    1,854 LTV                             2,102    2,990 Chrysler                        1,360    4,019 Westinghouse Electric           1,271      724 American Nat Can                  546      413 Navistar International            544      709 Uniroyal Goodrich Tire            501      554 Trans World Airlines              479      394 New Valley                        429      381  ------------------------------------------------- Source: Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp  -------------------------------------------------</p>

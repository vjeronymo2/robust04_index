			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Yevgeniy Podkolzin, </F> commander of Russia's Airborne troops, by Vladimir Solovyev, in  Eastern Slavonia on 23 February -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Solovyev] Today on the Day of Defenders of the  Fatherland at the main base of the Russian battalion in the  former Yugoslavia in Eastern Slavonia, the traditional parade  with presentation of medals was not held. Parades have been  postponed until better times. Out of 1,200 soldiers and  officers, 400 have been dispatched to Sarajevo from here.    [Podkolzin] Today they have already been fully deployed  there, they have been deployed normally. There is electricity.  So far there is no heating, but it was promised that in the  course of the next two days they would be supplied with heating.    The battalion has already received a combat task. Today the  battalion is serving in the main areas: it is guarding one area  for the collection of the Serb weapons under an accord which was  reached between the Muslims and the Serbs -- and one group is  today serving at Sarajevo airport. Well, and the others have  received the task of patrolling the separation line between the  Serbs and the Muslims. I got in touch with General Rose, and he  said that on the whole they would be serving in very difficult  sectors, difficult areas. We were on the brink of this disaster  but both the Serbs and Muslims have carried out their  obligations as a result of which the strike was called off, and  let's pray that there won't be another one.    [Solovyev] Do you think that your battalion will be there  for  a long time?    [Podkolzin] Until they set about the next stage of the  cease-  fire -- this is the opening of the roads for the delivery of  humanitarian aid and other issues -- no less than two months  will elapse -- but as a whole, it would appear that the  contingent will have to be kept there probably no less than two  years; this is my personal opinion.</p>

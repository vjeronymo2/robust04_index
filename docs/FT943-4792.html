			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Mr Berlusconi's looming deficit When Silvio Berlusconi promised voters an 'Italian miracle' back in March, resolving a fiscal crisis was probably not what he had in mind. But a pain-free solution to Italy's structural debt problem would be just that. The world's financial markets are not looking for a miracle, but their lack of confidence will inflict its own pain if the government does not start being similarly realistic. The Italian cabinet yesterday began the process of agreeing the details of the budget package it should present to parliament by the end of the month. Judging by some of the recent public squabbles between ministers, the negotiations over how to finalise the budget plan announced in July will not be peaceful. But the mood outside, among financial investors, is not tranquil either. Investors' lack of faith in the Berlusconi government's fiscal resolve has led to a steady rise in the gap between Italian and German long-term government bond yields. Italian long rates, now around 12 per cent, are some 470 basis points higher than German ones, compared to a gap of just over 300 at the beginning of the year. Stock prices have caught the same malaise: the Milan stock price index has fallen more than 8 per cent over the past three months. Italy, of course, is not the only country to have sparked financial market jitters in recent months. Indeed, at first glance the distrust of the markets seems overdone. The measures of fiscal retrenchment achieved by Mr Berlusconi's predecessors helped make Italy the only country in the Group of Seven, apart from Japan, to run a primary budget surplus in 1993. This meant that revenue exceeded expenditure by some 2 per cent of GDP, before deducting interest. Yet Italy's more profligate past, coupled with recession, mean that over a fifth of total spending is taken up with such payments, while the level of public debt, now the equivalent of more than 125 per cent of GDP, continues to rise. Fiscal woes It is not merely the size of Italy's debt problem that is concerning observers. Nor is it the usual fear, that the government will look to inflate away the debt. Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and there is little to indicate that it will pick up in the near future. The Bank of Italy sent its own signal that it would not allow monetisation of the country's fiscal woes with its 'pre-emptive' interest rate increase on August 11. The action had a dual target, Mr Berlusconi and the markets. It certainly failed to reassure the latter: the lira promptly fell to further record lows against the D-Mark. But this was largely because it is not clear that the message to Mr Berlusconi has hit its mark. Economic recovery Though economic recovery is now well under way, its delay in arriving helped to send the 1994 budget deficit above its target level of L145,000bn. This means that the primary budget surplus for 1994 is likely to be well under 1 per cent of GDP, and the debt, once projected to stabilise in 1995, probably will not reach its peak until the following year at the earliest, at 130 per cent or more. The government's long-awaited response to this, the deficit reduction plan aimed at saving L45,000bn over 4 years, is of the right order to keep the debt on its previously intended path. As yet, however, the plan has been uncomfortably short on detail, and what detail there is hints at one-off reactive measures, not the kind of systemic reform, above all of the bloated state pension system, which long-run fiscal health will require. It would take some selling by the prime minister to convince a majority of the cabinet, and the public at large, of the need to return to these questions so soon after the pain of the past two years. The recovery is fragile, and Mr Berlusconi has made little effort to ready them for further sacrifice. Indeed, on economic matters, he maintains much the same determined stance against higher taxes that he used to win over voters on the campaign trail. The contradiction between what he must do and what he seems willing to do is not lost on the financial markets. But falling investor confidence, by pushing up interest rates, can only make the gap wider, and the need to bridge it even more urgent.</p>

			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IT'S A DOG'S DAY WHEN THE MASTER'S AWAY  </P> <P> When my wife and I first started traveling, we still had offspring at home who  took care of our pets. So, at first, our problem had an easy solution.  </P> <P> That didn't last. It wasn't long before our children were out on their own and  we had to find another answer.  </P> <P> "It can't be that hard," Joyce said. "What do other people do when they go away  for a few days?"  </P> <P> I checked with a friend who travels a lot.  </P> <P> "It's no big deal," said Burt, stroking the big gray cat nestled in his lap. "I  just run old Tom over to this hotel for cats. He loves it. Don't you, big  fella?"  </P> <P> But when Burt brought out his "kitty carrier" to show me how he transports the  big fella to the "hotel," Old Tom, who had been relaxed and purring, suddenly  went as rigid as if somebody had stuck his tail in a wall socket. The big gray  went straight up in the air and then almost instantly disappeared under the  sofa.  </P> <P> "Loves it, huh?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Wonder what spooked him," Burt said. "Would you hand me that broom out of the  closet? Here, kitty, kitty."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Three-Legged Dog  </P> <P> When I left, Burt was still trying to fish the big fella out of the couch  springs.  </P> <P> Joyce was disturbed by my report.  </P> <P> "Maybe it's different for dogs," I said. Since I'm allergic to cats, we didn't  have any, but we were sure long on dogs. We had three.  </P> <P> Actually, that's a slight exaggeration. We really had 2 3/4, one of our  daughters having brought home Kubro, a mixed shepherd who had only one hind  leg. It was this particular animal that posed our major problem.  </P> <P> As the lowest common denominator in our herd, or pack, we figured that if we  found a kennel that could cope with Kubro, our other two dogs -- Snickers and  Josie -- wouldn't present any problems.  </P> <P> Kubro had lost one back leg and had a few stabilizing steel pins inserted in  the other as the result of a driveway accident he suffered as a puppy.  </P> <P> Catherine, one of our daughters, said he followed her home. When nobody seemed  to be buying that, she admitted that she got him from a musician friend who was  just no longer able to cope.  </P> <P> She also announced, chin quivering, that "we just have to take him because he  hasn't got anywhere else to go and somebody's just got to turn this dog's luck  around."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bark Worse Than Bite  </P> <P> "Well," Joyce said, "is what we see all that's wrong with him?"  </P> <P> Catherine looked up at the ceiling. "There is just the slightest touch of  arthritis when his bullets bother him?"  </P> <P> "His bullets?" I asked.  </P> <P> "Yes," she explained. She scratched the dog behind the ears. "And he has an  unusual bark, but he's sweet. Aren't you?"  </P> <P> As if in answer, Kubro barked. It was so loud and sharp, the dog himself shook  his head as if trying to clear the ringing. Then, to prove it was no accident,  he did it again and pawed his ears. I also pawed mine; it didn't help.  </P> <P> "I think his mouth is too close to his ears or something," Catherine said.  </P> <P> Joyce is a "mark," a sucker for anything small and furry. And a double mark for  anything small, furry and hurt, but she put on a show of firmness. "You'll take  care of him? Feed him, bathe him and take total control?"  </P> <P> "Of course," Catherine said. "Naturally. I promise."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Amorous Nature  </P> <P> Two years later, she got an apartment closer to her work . . . and Joyce and I  got Kubro.  </P> <P> Besides having a short count in the leg department, Kubro also had one lop-ear,  indeterminate coloration and a shaggy coat that came out in clumps in the  presence of dark clothing or carpeting. If you combed that dog once a week,  you'd get enough fur to make another dog.  </P> <P> Kubro acquired his bullets when he was shot by someone for raiding garbage cans  in the alley in the middle of the night, also in his puppyhood.  </P> <P> There were, however, two other problems. First, he was possessed of an amorous  nature.  </P> <P> But we figured that a dog with only one back leg would be playing the game of  romance with enough of a handicap, so we kept putting off having him fixed.  </P> <P> Then there was the lightning.  </P> <P> But I didn't even consider telling anyone about Kubro's problems with lightning  when I started checking around for a kennel.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seller's Market  </P> <P> In the Yellow Pages there were listings such as The Pet Hotel, Waggin Tails Pet  Resort (I figured that had to have a dude-ranch motif) and The Barking Lot.  </P> <P> The kennel search was surprising. First, I found that most of the operators  considered it a seller's market. They had lists of requirements regarding  would-be clients.  </P> <P> Potential "guests" had to have shot records indicating they'd been inoculated  against rabies, distemper, parvo (which I had always thought had something to  do with kosher foods), kennel cough and another affliction that sounded like  the name of a Mafia family.  </P> <P> Most of the kennel operators cared not a fig if Fido was a barkaholic or stone  crazy, as long as he was in perfect health and could come up with $10 a night  (which would be 70 in doggie dollars).  </P> <P> I only visited the places that advertised having "dog runs," not just cages.  Though I imagined a dog run would be a place where the dog could run, in most  instances it amounted to a few extra square feet of space in addition to a  protected sleeping area.  </P> <P> I was a little disappointed until the last place.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Good Omen  </P> <P> The office was closed because it was a Sunday, but since it advertised "outside  runs," I climbed up on a ledge and looked over the fence. There were dozens of  small 5-by-10 chain-link fence enclosures with dog houses at the end of each  and a tent over the whole compound.  </P> <P> A caretaker was talking to the dogs as he cleaned up, and they were listening.  That seemed like a pretty good omen, so the following day I visited the place.  </P> <P> A pair of Chihuahuas in the same run were barking at nothing, while a couple of  Dobermans, also together, were pacing. So what else is new?  </P> <P> The proprietor introduced the Chihuahuas as Cheech and Chong, and the Dobermans  as Hannibal and Hamilcar. Since the historical Hamilcar's family name was Barca  and Hannibal was his son, they sounded like pretty good names for dogs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Comforts of Home  </P> <P> "Yeah," said the proprietor, "makes you wonder, though, what the dogs call  themselves." A cocker spaniel was sitting in the next cage, staring through the  fence, looking worried.  </P> <P> "That's Florence. She's not really upset, she's just a cocker. They're only  happy when they worry." We moved on past the runs.  </P> <P> "The trouble with most people," the proprietor went on, "is that they look at  kennels from the human standpoint. Your average dog owner wants the place to  have all the comforts of home. Like there should be a sofa in each run and  someone to come along and yell at each dog to get the hell off the sofa a dozen  times a day. Don't laugh, it's almost come to that.  </P> <P> "You've got to look at a kennel through your dog's eyes. Dogs run in packs.  They like to be around other dogs. It's their nature. I think a lot of these  dogs are happier here than they are at home.  </P> <P> "Dogs love to smell things. Can you imagine the smells these animals are  enjoying now? Most of them don't know they're in a kennel. They think they're  in Disneyland or they've been sent to camp for the summer."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Members of the Family'  </P> <P> A little exaggeration maybe, but three months later when a trip came up, Joyce  and I booked space for our dogs at the kennel.  </P> <P> When Catherine heard about it, she had an attack of conscience and took Kubro  to live with her while we were away.  </P> <P> Two weeks later we picked up Snickers and Josie. Both were healthy, happy and  freshly bathed "to remove that kennel odor." Sure enough, the kennel odor was  gone, replaced by a fragrance a neighbor said made both dogs smell like they'd  spent the two weeks in a Bessarabian brothel.  </P> <P> Later in the day, Catherine brought Kubro home to us. Being confined to her  apartment while she was at work had not suited him too well.  </P> <P> Once, when he had "fallen in love," he had eaten a part of her front door to  get out. She assumed he had gotten lucky because when she bailed him out of  jail (or the pound) three days later, he was filthy, relaxed and wagging his  tail a lot.  </P> <P> Another time, while reacting to a minor electrical storm, he had gone through  the window. Unfortunately, the window was closed at the time.  </P> <P> "He cost me a fortune," she said. "You know, keeping animals can be expensive?"  </P> <P> "Zat so?" I said.  </P> <P> Joyce's response was better. "When you take them in, you're making them members  of the family. You don't think of them as an expense. Think of them as an  investment."  </P></p>

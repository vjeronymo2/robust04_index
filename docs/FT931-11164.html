			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Japanese key interest rate cut to 2.5% THE Bank of Japan early today cut its official discount rate from 3.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent in response to intense political and business pressure for a stimulus to the economy. The central bank's decision was immediately welcomed by Mr Hajime Funada, the economic planning minister, as a timely and appropriate step which would promote further declines in market interest rates and bank lending rates. The Ministry of Finance said it had no plans for additional steps to stimulate the economy. The Japanese government had also come under strong international pressure to boost domestic demand and raise imports, and Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, said the move would help spur world economic growth. Following the announcement, made at an emergency meeting of the central bank's board, the Bank of Japan said the cut 'should provide a sufficient basis for achieving stable growth'. Its governor, Mr Yasushi Mieno, said that the expected recovery in Japan's economy and corporate profits would have a positive impact on Tokyo stock prices in the long run. At mid-morning in Tokyo today the Nikkei market average was up slightly after early sharp gains. Expectations of a rate cut rose yesterday when Mr Mieno, who has become known as a tough financial disciplinarian, said there was a need to support an economy which had fallen into a worse-than-expected condition. The new rate is the same level as the low reached during the peak of the bubble economy between 1987 and 1989. Today's cut marks the bank's acceptance that the downturn in the economy has spread well beyond the real estate and financial services sectors badly hit by the bubble's collapse. There were growing signs that small businesses in regions not affected by the bubble were also being hit. This is the sixth cut since September 1991, when the official discount rate stood at 6 per cent. The last reduction, of 0.5 percentage point, was six months ago. Since then the economy has fallen close to outright recession. Employers' leaders have signalled that they do not believe the historic low of 2.5 per cent is sacrosanct.</p>

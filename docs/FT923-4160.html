			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The TUC At Blackpool: Tougher pensions law urged UNIONS are to call for a majority of occupational fund trustees to be democratically elected or appointed by scheme members. A 'charter for pension fund democracy' is to be launched tomorrow. The charter will call on the government to put forward new legislation in the wake of the Maxwell scandal. Unions argue that pensions form an important part of the pay package so that neither contribution rates nor benefits should be altered unilaterally by employers. The idea of majority control by scheme members is more radical than previous TUC proposals that half of a scheme's trustees should be made up of employees and pensioners. Although the charter is to be launched at a fringe meeting, and is not part of an official TUC campaign, it is being backed by several of the largest unions. The charter will call for a number of changes, including the separation of pension-fund assets from the assets of employers; the right for pensioners to be represented on trustee boards; and the right for trustees to be able to appoint advisers to obtain independent advice. The launch of the charter will coincide with two debates on pensions tomorrow - one on the control of occupational schemes, and the other on the equalisation of the state pension age for men and women. The TUC is certain to renew its call for a common retirement age of 60.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Stena Line chief to resign MR Lars Erik Ottosson, chief executive and president for the past 10 years of Stena Line, the Swedish shipping group, is to resign, it was announced unexpectedly yesterday. Mr Ottosson, aged 45, was the driving force behind Stena's rapid expansion during the late 1980s. The group acquired Sealink, the UK ferry business, in 1990. 'It is time to do something new,' he said yesterday. 'The company is going into a period of consolidation and I am more interested in expansive and strategic managerial duties.' The company said that operations in Scandinavia were 'going better than ever' and its savings programme at Sealink had been implemented. Stena made a pre-tax loss of SKr300m (Dollars 51.5m) last year. A spokesman said the company would make a profit this year 'on all its operations'. There were strong denials that Mr Ottosson's departure was due to any difference of opinion inside the group over its future strategy. He will leave the company in May. A successor has yet to be appointed.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Intervention rate cut leaves Paris cold A further fall in the dollar, and a negative reaction in global bond markets, brought bourses back out of the clouds yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS retreated sharply late in the session as the performance in the equity market was undermined by the expiry of futures and options. The CAC-40 index dropped 44.33, or 2.3 per cent, to 1,892.00, bringing its loss over the first six months to 17 per cent, in turnover swelled to some FFr4bn by technical trading. A cut of 10 basis points in the Bank of France's intervention rate, while taking some analysts by surprise, did little to motivate investors. Bouygues, off FFr26 at FFr580, was given a long term buy rating by Smith New Court, which forecast a price of FFr750 per share over an 18 months' timespan. On the way up, Sanofi was FFr6 firmer at FFr861 following news earlier in the week that, as expected, it was to sell its diagnostic imaging business to Hafslund, of Norway. Eurotunnel slipped a further 60 centimes to FFr22.25 - off 52 per cent over the first half - on news that the passenger service between London and Paris was to be postponed yet again due to technical difficulties. FRANKFURT decided that talk was cheap, and shares expensive. After much discussion of 'window dressing' on Wednesday, and talk of a 2,100 level for the end of the quarter, the Dax index closed 20.96 lower at 2,025.34 after an intraday high of 2,051.32. Turnover eased from DM7.25bn to DM7bn and, after hours, the Ibis-indicated Dax eased further to 2,020.85. Mr Eckhard Frahm at Merck Finck in Dusseldorf calculated that yesterday's trading left the key index down 4.8 per cent on the month of June, 5.1 per cent lower for the second quarter and 10.6 per cent off for the first six months of 1994. Banks and insurers were savaged in the first half of the year, the sector indices falling by 21 per cent and 19.3 per cent respectively; among cyclicals, iron and steel rose 6.2 per cent and major chemicals by 1.3 per cent, engineering and automotive stocks tailing off with 2.2 per cent and 4.5 per cent declines after leading the 1993 charge with gains of 60.8 and 58.7 per cent respectively. However, said Mr Frahm, defensive stocks - in Allianz, Viag, Dresdner Bank and Veba - took four of the top six Dax performance slots in the month of June alone. If long bonds were to recover in the third quarter of this year, he said, it would be interest rate-sensitive stocks, typically banks, insurance companies and utilites, which would be expected to respond in the equity market. AMSTERDAM featured strength in KLM after a positive performance all week, the shares improving a further Fl 1.30 to Fl 49.70 as the AEX index added 1.24 at 383.54. KLM advanced 23 per cent over the first half, lifted by the more positive outlook for airlines which emerged over the last few months. Analysts have turned positive on the industry in general and, on a worldwide basis, Merrill Lynch said in a recent comment on the sector that it expected a return to profitability in 1994, assisted by an increase in traffic of about 7 per cent this year and next. With regard to KLM, Merrill noted that the carrier had demonstrated to its competitors that costs could be brought down and assets used more intensively. MILAN remained indecisive and the Comit index gave up 8.44 to 689.59 during another day of thin turnover. Fiat began firmly, spurting to a day's high of L6,525 before turning back to finish a net L76 lower at L6,376 in spite of an upbeat statement on the outlook from Mr Giovanni Agnelli, the chairman. Mr Nicholas Potter at Credito Italiano International, who has been positive on the motor group's turnround potential since last November, admitted that he was taken by surprise by the forecast of a return to profits this year after last year's L1,700bn loss. Benetton fell L950, or 4 per cent, to L23,100 amid worries that the volatile dollar could hit the clothing group's export earnings. The shares have fallen by 8.9 per cent this week. ZURICH was subdued as late selling overcame a positive early performance, and the SMI index gave up 22.4 to 2,608.8, under pressure from a weak futures market. Banks remained at the centre of attention as CS Investment Research recommended the sector following the recent steep share price falls, but Salomon Brothers revised down its profits forecasts. UBS bearers fell SFr17 to SFr1,162, against a February high of SFr1,499, and CS Holding slipped SFr1 to SFr558, compared with the year's peak of SFr765. TEL AVIV accelerated its rate of decline, the Mishtanim blue chip index falling a further 4.95 to 159.40 to end the week with a drop of 8.2 per cent, after a decline of 3.1 per cent in the week before.

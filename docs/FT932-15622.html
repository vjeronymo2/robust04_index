			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Property: When religion gives way to conversions - A look at the market for redundant churches CLOSING a church or chapel is painful. In many cases, it has stood for decades - sometimes, centuries - as a centre of community life and a place of reflection and beauty. What a delight to walk into a well-tended church with brass gleaming and the smell of furniture wax, incense or candles hanging in the air. 'Hatless, I take off my cycle-clips in awkward reverence,' wrote Philip Larkin in his poem Church Going. Larkin wondered why the place ('This special shell') mattered to him when he did not believe in God. How right he was. Many people do not go to church regularly - if at all - but still see themselves in some loose way as Christians. And, in a sentimental British fashion, they feel the local church ought to be there in case they need it. But congregations drop - some country churches see fewer than 10 on Sunday mornings - and people move. New suburbs need new churches. Others, built in Victorian times to take the gospel to the Industrial Revolution, are left stranded in the middle of slum clearance or traffic schemes. What can be done? The Church of England looks for alternative uses as restaurants, art galleries, museums, concert halls, offices, workshops or even flats. Such schemes fit best into medieval and Georgian churches where the architecture derives from the style of the long hall and the drawing room. But Victorian churches, with their lack of windows, are far harder to adapt. They were built as statements of belief when doubt was already on the increase - intellectually with Darwin and Huxley, and socially among the toiling urban masses to whom religion was irrelevant. Every detail in them, especially the sight lines, was planned to make the point and they resist conversion to other uses. Matthew Saunders, of the Ancient Monuments Society (AMS), says two good Georgian conversions are St George's in Bolton, Lancashire, and St Julian's, Shrewsbury, both now craft centres. The Grade I-listed St Mary's, Gateshead, has become an auction house and arts centre while St Mary's, Bedford, is an archaeologists' workroom and St James the Great at Bethnal Green, London, provides 24 affordable flats for first-time buyers. The Redundant Churches Fund (RCF) has money - 70 per cent government, 30 per cent Church Commissioners - to preserve exceptional buildings without having to find alternative uses. The RCF has 271 such C. of E. churches in its care while the dioceses look after a few more. So do the Friends of Friendless Churches, whose aims are obvious. They share offices with the AMS in, of course, a church: Wren's St Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe in the City of London. Soon, with the inauguration of the Historic Chapels Trust (HCT), non-conformists will have a scheme like the RCF. Chapels, often in a sub-Georgian style, have the space and windows to convert well and have become museums (as have synagogues in Cheetham, Manchester and Spitalfields, London), offices, galleries, houses and flats. If they are Methodist, they will have restrictive covenants forbidding their use to sell alcohol, or for gambling, public dancing or Sunday trading. The handsomest chapel now on sale is the 1835 Old Chapel in Blockley, Gloucestershire. This Cotswolds building has a Palladian facade and has been converted sympathetically to make an attractive, contemporary two-bedroom house. Jackson-Stops offers it at around Pounds 285,000. Far simpler, but carrying the gambling/sale-of-drink restrictions, is the Old Chapel on the edge of the village of Chillaton, near Tavistock in Devon. Better inside than out, it has a lean-to that held the Sunday school. Millerson offers it at around Pounds 125,000. Cheaper still is the former Mission Chapel of the Good Shepherd in Great Langton, near Northallerton in North Yorkshire. It is 115 years old, was used religiously until 12 years ago and has planning permission for conversion to a two-bedroom house. The River Swale is close by for fishing. (The neighbouring School House and Old School are sold already). The chapel is on offer at over Pounds 30,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker. In Warwickshire, the Methodist Chapel at Long Compton might go for less than the guide price of Pounds 25,000 upwards when Tayler &amp; Fletcher auctions it on April 28 at The Bull in Burford. If you like chapels but do not want to live in one, Toat House near Pulborough, West Sussex, is a farm with 166 acres and a chapel to St Wilfred in the grounds. Toat is on offer from GA Town &amp; Country and Humberts at over Pounds 650,000. Over in East Sussex, Heathfield Park, a grand late-17th century Georgian house (from Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, around Pounds 850,000) has a barrel-vaulted chapel in the cellar. The same firm offers a large Edwardian house at Wadhurst, used recently by an order of nuns as St Benedict's Priory, for around Pounds 400,000; it has 24 bedrooms and a 1960s' chapel. For the chance to live in a converted Victorian city church, Winkworth offers a flat in Steeple Court, Bethnal Green, London E1 (convenient for the City). The guide price for the leasehold is Pounds 99,000, with 94 years to go. A Pounds 100 annual ground rent and 12 flats in the building raise the intriguing thought that this could be the first ex-church to win collective enfranchisement (acquire the freehold) when the Housing and Urban Development Bill becomes law.

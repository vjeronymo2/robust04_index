			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] The United States, Japan, and the ROK will start a  trilateral meeting in Washington tonight, Japan time, to  exchange views on the issue of the UN Security Council's  economic sanctions against North Korea. In this regard, Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata, at a news conference held today at Aizu  Wakamatsu City in Fukushima Prefecture where he is making a  stump tour, touched on North Korea's suspected nuclear arms  development and explained, without making a concrete reference  to such measures as economic sanctions, the need to continue to  carefully deal with the issue.    [Begin Hata recording] I hope from the bottom of my heart  that North Korea will talk without reserve by candidly accepting  the opinion of international society. Also, we need to do our  best to seek understanding of North Korea. [end recording]    At the same time, Prime Minister Hata said that generally  speaking, it is a matter of course for a nation to be able to  deal with emergency situations. In this way, he generally  admitted that the government is studying various possible  measures Japan can take to deal with the situation.    On the other hand, Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the  Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], held a news conference  today in Hachinohe City in Aomori Prefecture. On how Japan  should deal with the issue of North Korea's suspected nuclear  arms development, he explained a negative view toward the idea  of imposing sanctions against the DPRK by Japan, the United  States, and the ROK.    [Begin Kubo recording] I think Japan, the United States, and  South Korea must be cautious about the idea of imposing  sanctions without any decisions by the United Nations. I think  the SDPJ, for its part, will take a negative position on the  idea. [end recording]    In making the remark, Secretary General Kubo indicated a  negative view on the Japan-U.S.-ROK sanctions against North  Korea. Moreover, he stated that the Japanese Government should  do its utmost to solve the issue in an amicable way through  dialogue.    With regard to the future domestic political situation,  Secretary General Kubo stated that if a no-confidence motion in  the Hata cabinet is approved, there will be no other option but  for the cabinet to resign en masse. He thus reiterated the view  that the Hata cabinet should voluntarily resign en masse after  the fiscal 1994 national budget passes the Diet.</p>

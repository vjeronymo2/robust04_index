			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Compaq product range expected to broaden COMPAQ COMPUTER, struggling in a personal computer price war, is believed to be planning to diversify its product line to include a broader range of computers and printers. Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive who is visiting Europe this week, said that the US company was formulating its strategy for the 1990s. 'I don't consider a PC-only strategy as . . . the most promising long-term corporate business strategy,' he said. Compaq is developing a new line of computer products based upon the reduced instruction set computing (Risc) technology used primarily in computer workstations from companies such as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard. Compaq said it would bring out a new range of low cost personal computers this year to compete with lower priced clones. Industry executives in the US say Compaq is hiring engineers to form a laser printer division and that the personal computer company aims to launch new printer products later this year. That would place Compaq in direct competition with Hewlett-Packard, the laser printer market leader. Compaq declined to comment. After nine years of rapid growth, Compaq recently reported its first decline in year end sales and earnings. Revenues for 1991 fell 9 per cent to Dollars 3.3bn and profits dropped 71 per cent to Dollars 131m. Compaq cut its prices aggressively last year, but competitors have recently made even deeper price cuts.</p>

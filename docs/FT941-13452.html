			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Fisons to cut 1,000 jobs in shake-up: Partial closure of main plant - Some production will transfer to France Fisons, the UK pharmaceuticals company, is to cut 1,000 jobs from a total of 6,400 as part of a restructuring programme to restore its reputation and fortunes after last month's dismissal of Mr Cedric Scroggs, its chief executive, and a collapse in profits. The two-year programme will cost Pounds 15m. It will include the partial closure of the company's main production site at Holmes Chapel, Cheshire, with the immediate loss of 250 jobs. Eventually, up to 700 UK jobs will go from every part of the company, said Mr Patrick Egan, chairman and acting chief executive. Some production will be transferred to France and there will be 'senior management changes to create a flatter structure'. Fisons' other main division, scientific equipment, is unaffected. The restructuring is the first big decision from the company since it issued a profit warning on December 13 - the third in two years - which said that Fisons would only break even in 1993. Analysts had been expecting a pre-tax profit of about Pounds 100m. Mr Scroggs, with Mr Roy Thomas, finance director, went on the same day. The restructuring will save Fisons Pounds 35m a year in costs. 'There will be some contribution to the bottom line this year, but the full effect will not be seen until 1996,' said Mr Egan. He said there was 'plenty of fat' to be cut in the company. 'Along with other (pharmaceuticals) companies, Fisons has not been concerned very much with costs,' Mr Egan said. The job cuts come in all parts of the company's pharmaceuticals business and some compulsory redundancies are likely. The partial closure of the Holmes Chapel site comes more than three years after the US Food and Drug Administration banned the sale of two products made at the plant, citing low standards. 'Some of the money already invested to improve the plant will (now) be wasted,' Mr Egan said. A new plant will be built at the site as part of a Pounds 100m investment over four years. That will not prevent the transfer of the manufacture of a range of products to a Fisons plant at Le Trait, near Rouen, France. The French plant will make a range of liquid products such as anti-allergy nasal sprays. BAe cuts 400 arms jobs, Page 10 Lex, Page 22 London stocks, Page 44</p>

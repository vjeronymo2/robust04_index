			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / A pit waits for release from months of misery THE FATE of Westoe Colliery at South Shields, Tyne and Wear, and its 1,120 miners hung in suspense yesterday. Powerloader Mr Jimmy Gallagher and his workmates wanted, above all, to know whether their colliery has a future. They have endured three months of uncertainty and oscillating morale since their pit appeared on the October closure list. As they drank mugs of tea in the canteen, waiting for the 2.30pm cage to take them underground for their hour-long journey to the coal face - six kilometres out under the North Sea - their prospects were as unclear as before the release of the eagerly awaited select committee report. Mr Gallagher, 35, who has worked at Westoe for 20 years, said: 'Men don't know if they're coming or going.' Mr Davy Graham, a 49-year-old powerloader with 33 years service at Westoe, said: 'What we want to know is, when are they going to put us out of our misery?' Westoe's coal goes to Yorkshire region power stations, so transport costs put it at a disadvantage against pits in that region. It was ranked 20th economically out of the 21 threatened pits in last week's John T. Boyd report. Westoe miners dispute the report's calculations, arguing their pit has produced an operating surplus each year, except one, since the mid-1980s and has 60m tonnes of known reserves. The men were gloomy yesterday about Westoe's survival chances and about their prospects of working again. South Tyneside is already joint first, at 19.7 per cent, in mainland Britain's unemployment league. Its male jobless rate is 28.2 per cent and 40 per cent of its unemployed have been out of work for more than a year. In this context Westoe's miners are an elite - well-paid men, most of whom have never been on the dole. Most laughed when asked about their chances of finding another job. There was confusion among them over whether the Commons trade and industry committee's recommended subsidy was for 16m or 19m tonnes. The former figure would probably damn Westoe. The latter figure offers a meagre shred of hope. Political lobbying will be crucial.</p>

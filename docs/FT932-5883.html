			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Spain's Socialists lag in polls: Gonzalez more popular than conservative leader Aznar SPAIN'S ruling Socialist Workers' party (PSOE) may suffer a devastating defeat in next Sunday's general election. Even the most favourable of opinion polls, published on Sunday and yesterday by the daily newspaper El Pas, shows the conservative Partido Popular (PP) leading the Socialists by 34.8 per cent of the vote to 34.5 per cent, or a maximum of 155 and 151 seats respectively in the Cortes (parliament). Behind that apparently close race lurks a Socialist nightmare. El Pas found that the Socialists, in power in Spain since 1982, had lost support in all Spain's 52 voting districts, or provinces. The poll suggested that the PP would reverse Socialist victories in 1989 in the autonomous regions (which each include one or more province) of Valencia, Aragon, Madrid, Castilla la Mancha, the Canaries, the Balearics and Murcia. The Socialists would hold majorities only in Andalucia and Extremadura in the poor south, where the government nurtures its support through a subsidy paid to farmworkers between harvests. The threat to Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister, is that within each province very small shifts can produce dramatic results in the number of seats each party wins. Spain's system of proportional representation does not allow voters to choose names from all of the lists of candidates presented by parties. Only one party can be voted for. That is important because while the PP is clearly taking a lead over the Socialists as the most popular party, voters still prefer many Socialist leaders over the untried faces in the PP. Mr Gonzalez holds a big lead over the PP leader, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, in personal polls. Recognising that, Mr Gonzalez did not campaign on Sunday, instead preparing for a second and final television debate with Mr Aznar last night. The conservative leader easily, and surprisingly, beat Mr Gonzalez in the first debate last Monday. In the last few days of the campaign, the two men are fighting for the support of between 3m and 6m of the country's 30m voters who, according to weekend polls, remain undecided. The undecided vote has never been so high this close to a Spanish election and is a measure of how difficult ex-Socialist supporters are finding it to move to the PP. Last night was Mr Gonzalez's last chance to appeal to them to stay with him. To an extent, however, the undecided vote is being skewed in this election by the advent of TV debating between prime ministerial candidates. Only Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar have been invited to appear. Mr Javier Arzallus, leader of the Basque nationalist PNV, said this weekend it might be a good idea for all other parties to drop out of the election. He was only half serious, but two of Spain's new commercial channels, Antena 3 and Tele 5, have scrambled to secure the debates. Little wonder: more than 10m people watched the first debate on Antena 3. Tele 5 was last night expecting up to 15m viewers. Politicians from other parties fear that by concentrating attention on the two lead candidates and by becoming the key flashpoints of the campaign, the TV debates oversimplify Spanish politics. The smaller Basque and Catalan regional parties are critical to Spain's youngish democracy. They stand a good chance of being invited to help form a government after June 6 because no large party will have an overall majority. Without their presence in the debates, along with the third-largest party, the communist-led United Left, the undecided vote risks being left without a home to go to.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 8 (AFP) -- Giant flames licked a  munitions dump in the Zagreb suburbs Friday [8 April] a day  after massive explosions injured 17 people, and five others were  still missing, authorities announced. The explosions stopped at  1:00 a.m. (2300 GMT Thursday), 11 hours after the dump was  rocked by a first blast.    Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic, who Thursday  announced an evacuation order for all residents within a  2.5-kilometre (1.5-mile) radius, said the blasts in the depot in  Sesvete, about 12 kilometres (seven miles) outside Zagreb, were  a "disaster."    Deputy Defense Minister Josip Juras said he did not rule out  sabotage.    Damage was huge but could not be immediately assessed.  Firemen were still unable to get near the flames Friday at  noon. Ten buildings near the military facility were destroyed  by exploding ammunition and 100 others were damaged.    Fragments of exploding mortars and, according to western  experts, probably of ground-to-ground and anti-tank missiles,  flew around and even seriously injured a man in a central Zagreb  street Thursday. Authorities maintained a general alert but  traffic near the dump was reopened.    The numerous blasts opened up a huge crater at the dump  which  is one of Croatia's biggest.</p>

Trukhin, V.I. Filippovich, K.V. </F> Filippovich, Eurasia Limited Partnership]    [Abstract] The limitations on using available foreign  CAD/CAM systems, e.g., DUCT-5, UNIGRAPHIX, etc., at most CIS  enterprises with numerical control (ChPU) equipment and the  difficulty of designing an individual postprocessor for each  specific ``machine tool-numerical control system'' complex  prompted the development of an off-line invariant postprocessor  (AIP) designed for CAD/CAM programs for numerical control  equipment. The AIP invariant postprocessor contains a library of  280 ready-to-use descriptors which encompass virtually the  entire pool of machine tools at 350 CIS enterprises equipped of  numerical control equipment. The use of the invariant  postprocessor for the CAD/CAM system adaptation to numerical  control equipment is cheaper than developing an individual  postprocessor by fifty-to-hundredfold while the labor outlays  for developing an individual descriptor vs. an individual  postprocessor are lower by 100-200 times. The service personnel  skill requirements can also be relaxed. The AIP has been adapted  to the ANVIL-5000, DUCT-5.2, EUKLID, APT, MODAPT, and other  systems whose processors have a CLDATA-file output. The  invariant postprocessor has been implemented at a number of  mechanical engineering enterprises in Russia.</p>

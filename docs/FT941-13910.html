			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / FT/Transmedia Restaurant Promotion: How does the card work? You can pay for any meal with this card, at any of the restaurants taking part. Simply sign the Transmedia credit card slip for the full amount of the bill. This amount will then appear on your next Visa, MasterCard or Delta card statement together with a credit for 25 per cent of the amount you have spent on food and beverages. Discounts are not given on the service charge or VAT. The FT/Transmedia restaurant card is free for six months. Thereafter, the annual membership fee is Pounds 35 to entitle you to continue to receive the 25 per cent discount. The fee will be billed to your credit card account unless you cancel your membership. (Cardholders may return the card and claim a full refund at any time.) To join the scheme, complete and return the application form on this page. You will then receive your FT/Transmedia restaurant card together with a list of all participating UK restaurants and a directory of restaurants in the US which accept the card. All those who use the card between January 24 and February 11 will be entered automatically in a draw for 1,000 free meals for two, which are being offered as a bonus scheme during the start-up period. Every credit card slip signed during the period will be entered in the draw, so the more times you use your card the better your chance of winning. Each winner will receive a Pounds 50 credit towards a meal or meals in any restaurant in the scheme (in addition to the normal 25 per cent saving with their card). Please note: there is no alternative to the prizes offered. Winners will be notified by post by Monday, March 7,1994.

			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Arts: English Heritage reveals the need to shore up rotten wood Jocelyn Stevens has already warned that he regards the staff of English Heritage as so much dead wood that he will axe vigorously when he takes over as chairman in April. But a report produced by EH suggests that much of his formidable energy will be best spent shoring up the rotten wood in many of England's 500,000 listed buildings. A comprehensive report from English Heritage reveals that over seven per cent of the listed buildings in the country are at risk, while another 14.6 per cent are in a vulnerable condition, making over 100,000 structures giving cause for concern. Listed buildings are given protection from demolition, but not from neglect, and the state of many, especially those in remote areas, left vacant and of no practical use, such as windmills, chapels, follies, barns, warehouses, etc. is causing concern. Around two per cent of the building stock of England is listed, but this only protects it from demolition or drastic alteration: not from being left to decay. That is perhaps the main significance of the Buildings at Risk survey: it highlights a problem, and, ideally, prods local authorities into taking action. What makes matters worse is that, in actual numbers, most of the buildings causing concern are 'domestic', which, if lived in, could be brought up to scratch. Once they are left to deteriorate repair becomes costly. The fact that two thirds of the buildings at risk are not in conservation areas (a half of all listed buildings nestle in such protective covering) probably accounts for the lack of concern for them. The report is good at highlighting the problem but poor at coming up with solutions. It points out that at greatest risk are Grade II buildings. Legislation is needed to extend financial aid to these, especially those not in conservation areas. The cheap solution would be to require owners of listed buildings to accept responsibility for them, with local authorities not offering money for repairs but threatening to wield the legislative stick of enforced renovation. The survey produces few surprises and few solutions. Perhaps Jocelyn Stevens will provide the drive to put pressure on the Government to take the slow deterioration of the nation's building heritage more seriously. One hopes he will spend less time in alienating personnel and concentrate his energies on unlocking the legislation, and the money, needed to preserve the commonplace physical legacies of our history.</p>

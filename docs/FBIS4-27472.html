			<p>BFN     [Text] The Supreme Court yesterday acquitted the man  charged with killing a Saudi envoy in 1989, saying that eye  witnesses could not remember sufficient detail of the gunman's  face to justify a conviction.    A third secretary of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Saleh  Abdullah Al-Maliki, 35, was shot dead on 4 January 1989, in Soi  Phipat 2, between Bangkok's North Sathon and Silom roads. Three  bullets from a 6.35 mm pistol struck Al-Maliki in the head,  right temple, and left ear, killing him instantly.    Police believed the motive for the murder was the  dissatisfaction of employment agencies, which were losing  commission because of Al-Maliki's method of issuing visas direct  to Thais wanting to work in Saudi Arabia.    At yesterday's hearing, Judge Charan Hatthakam ruled that  acquittal was the correct verdict because the testimony of the  prosecutor's eye-witnesses was not deemed reliable.    The accused, Adinan Songkoewala, 26, was arrested on 23 June  1989. The prosecution witnesses -- Thongkham Lengkham, Somwang  Kritchukiat, and Lun Posayanon -- identified the accused as the  man who shot Al-Maliki dead. They told the court that Al-Maliki  was shot while he was walking to his residence at the PMP  Mansion. The gunman shot Al-Maliki at close range and ran away.  But in passing his verdict, the judge reminded the court that  the eyewitnesses had also said they could not remember much  detail about the gunman because they were in shock.    The accused had pleaded innocence, and said he had been at  work in his garment business up-country at the time of the  murder.</p>

			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Parking under the sun Spain, Switzerland and Greece are experimenting with solar-powered parking meters in areas that lack a direct supply of electricity. Metric Parking, a UK ticket machine company, has designed a ticket machine with a 305mm by 610mm south-facing solar panel, which is placed on a 1.5m pole to keep it out of the reach of vandals. This provides enough power to issue up to 250 tickets if it receives eight hours of sunlight filtering through clouds on a grey day. Heavily-used machines would require auxiliary solar-powered batteries in poor climates. Metric Parking: UK, tel 0285 651441; fax 0285 655216.</p>

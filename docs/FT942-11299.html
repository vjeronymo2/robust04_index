			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Revenue is told of threat to venture capital trusts Venture capital trusts, proposed by the government in last November's Budget as a way of boosting investment in unquoted companies, will flounder unless current Inland Revenue proposals are substantially changed, the Association of Investment Trust Companies said yesterday. Association members include venture and development capital specialists already managing investment trusts with assets worth Pounds 1bn. Mr Ernest Fenton, association director-general, says investors would be unlikely to take the additional risk of investing in unquoted companies unless the tax incentives were significantly increased. The association says few sponsors would be willing to promote the venture capital trusts because the Revenue was proposing to restrict too severely the maximum investment in any company and the size of qualifying businesses. Nevertheless, Mr Fenton said: 'The AITC warmly welcomes the government's initiative. We would like to see venture capital trusts work.' The association's criticism comes in a detailed reply to the Revenue's consultative document on the new trusts. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, said in his Budget address that the new trusts would stimulate substantial investment in unlisted companies, many of which suffer from a shortage of equity and long-term finance. The government plans to include final proposals in the 1995 finance bill. The association suggests a number of changes that would make the venture capital trusts more likely to succeed. These include: The maximum size of an investee company should be raised from the Revenue's suggested limit of Pounds 10m of assets to a maximum of Pounds 30m, broadly the size of company that can realistically expect to provide an exit for investors via a stockmarket flotation. The maximum investment in any company should be raised from Pounds 1m to about Pounds 3m. Mr Fenton argued that for a venture capital trust to be floated it would need to raise about Pounds 25 to Pounds 30m. Finding and investing that amount in Pounds 1m parcels would be time-consuming and commercially unattractive. Investors should be given tax relief on their initial investment at their top marginal rate. This would then be similar to the relief given investors in the Business Expansion Scheme, which ended in December.</p>

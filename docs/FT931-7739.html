			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Business and the Law: Competition law does not apply - European Law Regional social security offices dealing with sickness maternity and old-age benefits are not 'undertakings' covered by the Rome Treaty competition rules, the European Court of Justice ruled last week. In a reference from a French court, in a case brought by two people who felt they had the right under EC law to go to any private insurance company in the EC in order to pay their social security contributions, the Court ruled that Community law did not impinge on the authority of member states to administer their own social security systems. The Court also said that the relevant social security schemes had an exclusively social rather than economic aim. Given that EC competition rules only apply to undertakings which are engaged in an economic activity, the Court said the social security offices in question were not covered by the rules.

The Belgian rules applied to people made redundant when aged 60 or above, entitling them to supplementary payments in addition to unemployment benefit. Under Belgian law, unemployment benefit is payable to men until 65 but to women only until 60. The effect of the redundancy rules was therefore of clear benefit to men. The Court had to decide whether the redundancy payments came within the scope of Rome Treaty equal-pay rules. Relying on its decision in the Barber pensions case, it said that, simply because certain benefits were made after employment had been terminated, this did not necessarily mean that they could not be deemed to come within the scope of EC equal pay rules. The Court did point out, however, that benefits such as state pensions, applicable to general categories of workers, which had no connection with an individual's place of work, would not come within the scope of the equal pay rules. C-173/91: Commission v Belgium, ECJ FC, February 17 1993 Migrant workers' benefits On a preliminary reference from a Belgian court, the ECJ held that EC rules regulating the granting of social security benefits to migrant workers took precedence over relevant national rules, even where the amount of the particular benefit in question was the same under both sets of rules. The case concerned a migrant Italian worker who had worked both in Italy and Belgium before becoming ill. Both countries recognised his right to claim sickness benefit. The Italian benefit was calculated on the basis of the relevant EC rules. The Belgian benefit was calculated on national rules. The benefit was the same, whichever basis of calculation was used. However, under the EC rules the benefit could only be re-evaluated if there had been a change relating either to the establishment of the person concerned or to the rules used to calculate the benefit. Under the Belgian rules the benefit could be re-evaluated to take into account changes in the benefit granted by another member state, particularly in relation to the fluctuations in the exchange rates. In this case the applicant's benefit was re-evaluated to his detriment by the Belgian authorities on the basis of exchange-rate fluctuations. The Court held first that, where a worker was subject to the legislation of two or more EC countries, that worker was entitled to the most favourable benefits available - either under the national rules or the EC rules. However, the Community rules had to apply when the national rules were less favourable. The Court said this meant that, even where the national rules were chosen, the amount of benefit conformed with the EC rules. Given this, any re-evaluation should be determined on the basis of Community, rather than national, rules.

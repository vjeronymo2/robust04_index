			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Stupide Albion Mr John Major's government is lurching towards another pothole. The foreign secretary, long regarded as the cabinet's 'safe pair of hands', has landed Mr Major with a new political drama which again threatens to divide his party. The enlargement of the European Union to admit Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden was not a purely British idea. But Mr Major had pushed it, especially during the UK presidency in 1992, against the reticence if not outright opposition of several other member states, and had insisted on giving it priority over various other tasks, including notably the reform of the EU's decision-making process. Two weeks ago this policy appeared close to a deserved success. After hard negotiations, agreements with three of the applicants were concluded, and that with Norway appeared very close. Yet now the whole enterprise is in jeopardy because the UK, of all countries, is pressing for a change in the qualified majority voting system - reducing the 'blocking minority' in the EU council from 30 to 25 per cent. Of course, that is not how the British government presents the matter. By stressing the absolute number of votes, as opposed to the percentage, it poses as defender of the status quo against yet another onslaught by wild-eyed continental federalists. At present, says Mr Douglas Hurd, two large states and one small one form a blocking minority, and that must remain the case even when there are 16 member states altogether. Trumpet call By putting it like that he gets the worst of all worlds. Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers have been roused by his anti-federalist trumpet call, so that the government cannot now accept the obvious and rational solution to the problem - which is to keep the percentage as it is until the whole matter is reviewed at the Maastricht revision conference in 1996 - without provoking yet another crisis over Europe within the Conservative party. So far from showing a safe pair of hands, Mr Hurd has used his left hand to sabotage the efforts of his right, with which he has been trying to hold the party together on Europe as the European elections approach. At the same time he has yet again presented his EU partners with the image of Britain as a negative, obstructive force, bent on blocking any kind of reform or advance, even one which it purports to favour. If he does not back down the result will be either to abort the enlargement process altogether - if the European parliament goes through with its threatened veto - or to make enlargement a prescription for even greater paralysis in EU decision-making, as the majority required for a decision will be greater than before. Voting weights Moreover, he has argued his case in such a way as to bring forward the issue of the relationship between voting weights and population. Small states are over-represented in the present system, for a reason that should command the British government's sympathy: the EU is an association of sovereign states, not a federation. Yet the British foreign office has been hinting that it might accept a compromise whereby the 'blocking minority' would vary according to the combined population of the states composing it. Such a solution would be a significant step towards federalism, since it would amount to saying that the Union is composed of individual citizens - who should be equally represented in its institutions on the basis of one person, one vote - rather than of states with equal sovereign rights irrespective of their population. That federalist principle is already acknowledged in the fact that small and large states have different voting weights. But the more precisely voting weights are aligned with population, the stronger the federal character of the Union becomes, and the weaker the sovereignty of the member states. The Germans, who as the state with the largest population stand to benefit most from such a reform, have none the less held back from pushing it: they can see the danger of invoking their superior numbers as a reason for having more influence in the Union than the French. But Britain's gallant defenders of national sovereignty have blundered in where German federalists feared to tread.</p>

			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Builders predict more job cuts THE construction industry has raised its expectations of job losses suffered in the three-year recession. It fears that more than 300,000 jobs will have gone by the end of this year in spite of signs that indicators of future activity are continuing to improve. Mr John Smith, chairman of the Building Employers Confederation, said yesterday: 'There is still no sign of renewed growth in output, so 1992 will be another extremely tough year for construction firms and their employees.' Mr Smith was commenting on the confederation's latest state-of-trade inquiry, which gives a gloomy picture of trading prospects for the UK building industry. Construction output fell 9 per cent last year, but Mr Smith warned that the consensus of industry forecasts indicating a further fall in output of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent this year may prove too optimistic. Until the end of last year the confederation had expected the fall in employment since mid 1989 to be between 200,000 and 250,000. But the recession has forced it to revise its forecast. Mr Smith said: 'The jobless figure looks like continuing to rise for the rest of 1992 and into 1993.' He described a reduction of 300,000 jobs as 'disastrous' for the industry because of the loss of skilled craftsmen. The confederation draws some encouragement from an easing in the decline of inquiries for work and from an increase in optimism about future workloads. Mr Smith also noted optimism among smaller and medium-sized builders involved in refurbishment work. He was 'greatly concerned', however, that the amount of work in hand among bigger construction companies continued to fall. 'I am afraid that this reflects the gradual completion of large projects which are not being replaced by new orders.' It also emerged from the inquiry that the proportion of construction companies operating at less than half capacity has risen to 25 per cent. Mr Smith urged the government to use the opportunity created by the general election result to stimulate the housing market by abolishing stamp duty - which has been temporarily suspended - and to bring more stability to prices. The 600 companies involved in the inquiry were taken from the confederation's 8,000 members. They were asked to list three top priorities for stimulating construction demand.

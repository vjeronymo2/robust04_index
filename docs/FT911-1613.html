			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Horsham may buy oil stake HORSHAM, the Canadian holding company, expects to buy the 40 per cent minority holding in Clark Oil and Refining from St Louis oil trader Mr Tony Novelly, according to Horsham's chairman, Mr Peter Munk, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Horsham is controlled by Mr Munk, who in turn controls American Barrick Resources. In 1988, Horsham paid USDollars 454m for 60 per cent of Clark, which operates two refineries and 1,000 retail outlets in the US mid-west. Clark contributed USDollars 4.9bn to Horsham's first-quarter profits of USDollars 13.3m, or 15 cents a share. A year earlier, Horsham took a USDollars 3m loss on its Clark investment, showing total earnings of USDollars 2.4m, or 3 cents a share. Clark's refining margins doubled to USDollars 4.90 a barrel in the first quarter and the company successfully hedged against sharp falls in crude and petroleum product prices last January. Upgrading Clark's refining and marketing operations will cost USDollars 150m over the next two or three years.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOOKS AND AUTHORS: RAY BRADBURY, HIS WORDS ADORN LIBRARY POSTER  </P> <P> The setting is Ray Bradbury's cluttered basement office in his Cheviot Hills  home in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> There, looking up from his desk as if caught in mid-sentence, is the  white-maned literary lion in his natural habitat: surrounded by a lifetime's  worth of books and memorabilia. Displayed prominently in the foreground is a  copy of Bradbury's latest book, "Death Is a Lonely Business," and a library  card.  </P> <P> Which is precisely the point of the Orange County Public Library's full-color  poster featuring the prolific science fiction writer.  </P> <P> "Libraries are my university. I am their eternal graduate," Bradbury is quoted  as saying at the top of the poster, which celebrates the Orange County Public  Library as "My Kind of Place."  </P> <P> The limited edition poster was released this week in conjunction with National  Library Week. It is available, for free, at all 27 Orange County branch  libraries.  </P> <P> Bradbury is the fourth in a series of authors selected annually to appear on  the library's poster. Previously honored authors are T. Jefferson Parker of  Laguna Beach, Donald Stanwood of Santa Ana and Maxine O'Callaghan of Mission  Viejo.  </P> <P> With Bradbury, the library obviously has broken the tradition of featuring  home-grown authors.  </P> <P> "He is certainly one of the most renowned authors of our time and, while  normally in the past we've always done Orange County authors, we had the  opportunity to do Ray Bradbury . . . and he's a tremendous supporter of  libraries," said Cheryl Pruett, community relations coordinator for the Orange  County Public Library.  </P> <P> Pruett, a Bradbury fan, went along for the photo shoot in Bradbury's office.  </P> <P> "It's bigger than it appears," she said. "He opens the door and you are kind of  taken aback. It's filled. No matter where you look you see something new and  fascinating -- anything from Godzilla to a jar of what looks like formaldehyde  with something strange floating in it. There are things hanging from the  ceiling and masks and toys and world globes. . . . It's fascinating. And his  typewriter is in the middle of all this and this is where he creates."  </P> <P> Bradbury was unavailable for comment this week, but fans will have an  opportunity in May to find out how he likes being the library's latest poster  boy.  </P> <P> On May 7 the Friends of the Library Foundation will host "An Afternoon With Ray  Bradbury" from 2 to 4 p.m. at Heritage Park Regional Library, 14361 Yale Ave.,  Irvine. Posters will be given away and copies of Bradbury books will be  available for purchase during an autograph session with the author of  "Fahrenheit 451" and "The Martian Chronicles."  </P> <P> Admission is a $20 donation for a Friends of the Library Foundation Membership.  (The single $20 admission fee covers couples and families). The admission fee  for current members of local Friends of the Library organizations is $10.  Reservations may be made by calling (714) 834-6600 or 834-6835.  </P> <P> NATIONAL WRITERS: Romance writer Paula Riggs will speak at the meeting of the  Southern California chapter of the National Writers Club at 10 a.m. today at  the Irvine Marriott hotel, 18000 Von Karman Ave. Non-members: $12.  </P> <P> BOOK SIGNINGS: Michael J. Katz will sign his new mystery novel, "Last Dance in  Redondo Beach," from 1 to 3 p.m. today at Book Carnival, 870 N. Tustin Ave.,  Orange. . . . Julie Smith ("Huckleberry Fiend"), Michael Collins ("Castrato"),  Les Roberts ("A Carrot for the Donkey"), and Maxine O'Callaghan ("Hit and Run")  will sign from 3 to 5 p.m. Sunday at Little Professor Book Center, 14370 Culver  Drive, Irvine.  </P> <P> MYSTERY TALK: Author Robert Ray, whose Matt Murdock private eye mysteries are  set in Orange County, will speak at 4 p.m. Sunday at the Mary Wilson Library,  707 Electric Ave., Seal Beach.

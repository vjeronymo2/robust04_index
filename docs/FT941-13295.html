			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: EDS stake in Ibos opens the door for other banks Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander announced yesterday that EDS, the data services company, had bought a 32 per cent stake in Ibos, their cross-border electronic banking system, as part of a plan to open it to other banks. The two banks said that Ibos, a system which allows banks to transfer cash between accounts in different countries within seconds, would in future be open to any bank which paid a subscription fee of about Pounds 50,000 a year. Some 5 per cent of the new company established to market Ibos as a technology platform will be owned by Goldman Sachs, the financial adviser to Ibos. The remaining 95 per cent will be split equally by the two founding banks and EDS. Bank executives yesterday declined to say how much EDS and Goldman were paying for their stakes. However, shares in the new Ibos company are thought to have been priced at a premium to the Pounds 8m so far invested in its development. The founding banks said that EDS, which provides technology services to 7,000 companies around the world, was offered an equity stake because of its technical resources and ability to market the system among its other services. Banks that use Ibos to transfer funds rather than systems such as Swift, the Brussels-based funds transfer system owned by banks, will pay a fee per transaction. The Ibos partners believe that it will be cheaper than its competitors.</p>

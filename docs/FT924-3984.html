			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Personal View: Why France is afraid The recent EC-US compromise on the agricultural elements of the Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has provoked a strong French response. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl took a conciliatory line when faced with the possibility of a French veto. He advised us to try to understand the French problems with the proposed settlement. What are the problems? Are French fears justified? What are the relative effects of the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy, to which the French government acceded this summer, and the demands of the Gatt proposals? It is first worth mentioning some fundamental features of French political economy and culture. In France, free trade is viewed as an Anglo-Saxon convenience which, from time to time, serves the interests of the UK and the US. Postwar French-US relations have often been characterised by mutual mistrust and French resistance to American hegemony. This creates a potent mix when it is combined with food and agriculture, the core of much French culture. Specific fears aroused by the Gatt settlement concern the threat to exports of farm products, the incomes of farmers and the future of rural communities. The most difficult part for France seems to be the requirement that the volume of subsidised exports be cut by 21 per cent in 1993-99. France is the world's second largest agricultural exporter, this trade accounting for 12.7 per cent of its total exports. The farm products benefiting most from export subsidies are cereals, sugar and dairy products. These account for 40 per cent of agricultural exports. The potential loss of exports is thus about 1 per cent (21 per cent of 40 per cent of 12.7 per cent) of the total over a six-year period. While no doubt unwelcome to those involved, this does not seem a big threat to the economy. The three main elements of the Gatt settlement (reducing subsidised exports and domestic supports and improving import access) will decrease the prices to farmers and lower their gross incomes. During the 1970s average farmers' incomes declined. Most of this loss was recovered during the 1980s, during which average farm incomes rose 25 per cent. However, compared with real income growth for the rest of the population, farm incomes have fallen behind. The policy changes induced by the Gatt will thus not alter a long-established trend. Given time, farmers will adjust their production patterns, using fewer inputs, such as fertilisers, machinery and so on, and redeploying resources to products least affected by reforms. Purchased input prices will be reduced as suppliers find themselves in a declining market. Land prices and rents will also adjust downwards. Agriculture will continue to shed labour but not, in absolute terms, as much as over the last three decades. Significant relief is provided in the policy measures agreed in this year's reform of the CAP. This will reduce support prices in the cereals-oilseeds sector by 29 per cent and cut production of larger producers through a 15 per cent set-aside of arable land. This harsh treatment was made palatable by the introduction of area payments, which will more than compensate many farmers, particularly the small and less productive ones, for their loss of revenue. Calculations by Insee, the French statistical institute, demonstrate that the effect of the CAP reform is to increase farmers' incomes by 7 per cent compared with what they would have been under the existing CAP regime. The Gatt agreement offers no additional direct threat to farm incomes. However, it does represent an attack on the use of subsidies to assist exports. From a French point of view, this is an assault on agriculture and its right to produce. The expression of this concern at the political level covers the relative severity on production levels of the Gatt settlement and the CAP reform. Analyses demonstrate that the price cuts contained in the CAP reform, which encourage additional consumption of cereals and reduce production intensity, coupled with the set-aside, will meet the required fall in export volume. Thus for cereals, at least, the CAP reform was the tougher medicine. Why is it that the French government accepted CAP reform, yet rejects the apparently softer Gatt settlement? The answer is partly political - a change of minister and an attempt to extract more Community compensation for French farmers - and partly a signal that extension of CAP reform to the as-yet largely unreformed dairy, sugar and wine sectors will be resisted. However, agriculture is not the only economic activity nor the only subject in Gatt. France is the world's second largest exporter of services and intellectual property. Liberalisation of trade in services and better rules and disciplines in intellectual property offer significant economic gains, which will far outweigh the losses in agriculture. The French government has more work to do to persuade the nation of this and to find acceptable ways to compensate farmers for their loss.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Alitalia Management, Unions Unite </F> on Recapitalization"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 9 -- Agreement reached by  Alitalia, the indebted Italian flagcarrier airline, and the  trade unions came today as a unified call for fresh capital and  "the recovery and development of Alitalia as a great carrier  capable of competing on the world market," said a company  communique issued today.    The understanding worked out late Wednesday [8 June] will  clear the way for the resumption of negotiations for the merger  of Alitalia and the airline's domestic subsidiary, ATI [Italian  Air Freight Lines], and for returning flying personnel to their  full schedules through to the end of the month.    On re-capitalization, the communique said the labor side is  calling for at least 1.5 trillion lire (928 million dollars) and  that both the unions and management agree that the idea of  assigning Alitalia the status of a regional carrier should be  dropped.    On the sensitive areas of excess staff and cost-cutting, the  company referred to the unbreakable link between "recovery and  development" and the need to "pursue the objectives" set forth  in the three-year restructurization plan on reducing operation  costs and boosting productivity.    In this area, industry sources reported today, the airline  is  insisting on curbing running costs by 12 percent, the workforce  by 20 or some 4,000 workers, and hiking productivity by 25  percent. All the while, Alitalia is committed to "re-defining  organizational processes and optimizing all the group's  resources," that is, said these sources, that the number of  future layoffs will have to be agreed to by the unions.    Also coming into play will be such safety-net features as  profession training to enhance mobility within the group,  especially on the side of the administration. Also promised was  that the Alitalia-ATI merger "will not have fallout in the  Naples area," where the activities of the group will be  transferred and that changes in work rules for flight personnel,  hours in the air, rest period and the like will be dealt with in  line with the wage pact agreement of July 1993, "taking into  account the company's state of crisis."    Speaking for the labor side, Valter Cerfeda of the CGIL  [Italian General Confederation of Labor] and Paolo Brutti of the  FILT-CGIL said the problem of re-capitalization will have to be  taken up with the government, "without forays aide from the  individual ministers." The joint statement said the efforts of  Alitalia management and the unions could be nullified if the  right choices are not made by the government. "There can be no  attempt to maintain a flagcarrier airline if sufficient  resources for investments and development are not provided,"  said the statement.</p>

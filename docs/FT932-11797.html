			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (19): Designers exercised - New Technology The minds of executive car designers are being exercised in new ways as they look towards the future. It is no longer sufficient merely to extrapolate the fashionable trend of appearance, to improve performance, specification and cabin space. Contrary forces are beginning to appear in three important areas. It could be argued that the current Mercedes S-class spelled an end to the conventional approach when it appeared at Geneva in 1991. The world admired it as a technical achievement, but wondered if it should - given concerns about the relationship between conspicuous consumption and the environment - be quite so large and heavy. Mercedes mounted a stout defence based on the car's unparalleled safety and on its scrupulous attention to environmental detail, but company executives privately admitted that if the S-class design had been 'frozen' later, the car would indeed have been smaller. If not reversed, the trend had been interrupted. It could no longer be taken for granted that any new executive car would be bigger and heavier than the model it replaced. A similar anxiety has arisen in the matter of appearance. Customers have begun to mutter that many of the latest models look confusingly the same, mainly because of the influence of aerodynamics on design. Some manufacturers, notably Rover with its highly successful 800-series 'facelift', have abandoned the ultimate saving of drag coefficient in favour of a more distinctive front-end appearance. Individuality has become important. The third backlash has been in the area of specification. The 1980s was the decade of making anything that moved power-operated, and of exploiting the driver's susceptibility to 'technology' by granting him control of systems whose operation had previously been taken for granted: the shift pattern mode of the automatic transmission, the settings of the suspension damping, the information shown on the trip computer display. Executive car instrument panels and centre consoles began to resemble airliner cockpits - at a time when, as it happened, airliner cockpits were beginning to look much simpler in the interests of reduced crew workload. Now the word is filtering back to the car manufacturers that customers may actually resent the fitting of features which are never used once the first flush of experimentation has passed. The new emphasis is on improving specification in a way which is 'transparent' - the new buzzword - to the driver. Comfort, active safety and driving pleasure must be improved, but the car must perform all the necessary actions without the driver being aware of them. Such changes of attitude seem likely to be accommodated by a combination of new materials, new technologies and fundamentally new design approaches. To reverse the escalating trend of size and weight, engineers are looking to lighter materials, principally aluminium, and to subtle changes in the shape of the car itself. New shapes will also bring new opportunities for re-establishing individual marque identities. The need for technical 'transparency' will be met by new electronic concepts such as 'fuzzy logic' which will enable systems to adapt themselves to users and their needs without the user ever being aware of anything happening. Audi is likely to be the first to introduce a new model making substantial use of aluminium, later this year. Others will follow by the end of 1995. The need to reduce size as well as weight is more difficult to achieve. People continue to grow larger and therefore to need more cabin space. Car designers increasingly look to provide the maximum cabin space in the minimum road area. This is most easily done by making the car taller and sitting the occupants more upright. Such an approach brings incidental advantages such as better driver visibility and easier entry and exit, but is difficult to square with the consistent fashion trend of recent decades towards longer, lower cars. Most designers hope the evident need for a new approach will encourage customers to look at cars in a less conservative way but a debate is bound to rage around the relative merits of retaining a conventional but taller shape, or moving closer to the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) concept pioneered by designs such as the Renault Espace and Mitsubishi Space Wagon. Whichever approach is most widely adopted, designers will certainly try to avoid that uniformity of overall design which resulted from over-emphasis on low aerodynamic drag during the 1980s. The influence of electronics on the design and operation of in-car systems will continue to increase, but with the emphasis shifting from the control of engine and transmission to the management of all aspects of comfort. Engineers now expect electronic systems to play an important part in achieving a smooth, quiet and vibration-free ride. Developments in this area include noise-cancelling technology of the kind demonstrated by Lotus Engineering, and much more sophisticated control of suspension movement - and possibly also of seat spring characteristics. Many of these developments will make use of the technology which its Japanese pioneers sadly misnamed 'fuzzy logic'. There is no real element of chance in this approach, which actually implies the ability to learn from experience and thus to adapt. A fuzzy-logic automatic transmission, for example, may decide after a couple of apparently pointless down-shifts that it will henceforth remain in the higher gear in that particular situation. The technique has already been applied in other comfort-related areas of the car, most notably in the control of air conditioning. In summary, the executive car of 2003 is likely to be roomier and more comfortable, yet lighter, more economical, and more compact at least in terms of road space occupied. It will also, crucially in the eyes of some marketing men, be much easier to tell one make of executive car from another; the magic of marque is about to be rediscovered.</p>

			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / People (Names in the News): Questrom's US shopping trip completed It looks as though Allen Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Federated Department Stores, has finally done it, writes Richard Tomkins. Today, barring last-minute obstacles, the US department store chain will complete its takeover of the rival RH Macy retailing group, and Questrom will become the department store king of the US. His empire will embrace 347 department stores trading under some of the best known names in US retailing. Federated's 11 chains will include Bloomingdale's, Macy's, A&amp;S, Bon Marche and Burdines. Questrom will be chairman and chief executive of a group with annual revenues of Dollars 13.5bn. For Questrom, 54, it will be the crowning moment of his career. A native of Massachusetts, he joined Federated as a trainee at A&amp;S after graduating from Boston University, and quickly rose to the position of merchandise manager. By January 1988, he had become vice chairman of Federated itself - but four months later he stormed out to join the Neiman-Marcus department store group when Federated was taken over by Canadian financier Robert Campeau. As it turned out, his absence was only temporary. When Campeau drove Federated into bankruptcy in 1990, Questrom was wooed back to pull the company out of its troubles. Then, just as he had turned Federated round, RH Macy found itself going into bankruptcy, and Questrom started making overtures. Federated eventually won control of RH Macy by buying some of its debt from another creditor, so securing a powerful say in the company's future. Now Questrom faces the formidable task of showing that he can make the merger work. Many a successful executive has come unstuck on less; but most US retailers would say that if anyone can do it, Questrom can.</p>

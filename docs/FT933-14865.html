			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: New outlets help Pelican rise to Pounds 908,000 THE PELICAN Group of restaurants doubled pre-tax profits from Pounds 453,000 to Pounds 908,000 in the year to end-March, helped by the opening of eight new outlets. Turnover rose to Pounds 8.08m (Pounds 6.32m), bolstered by the continued expansion of the Cafe Rouge chain, which now comprises a total of 14 open and two in development. The group now operated 20 restaurants. Mr Roger Myers, chairman, said: 'The Rouge concept still has great scope for expansion throughout the UK and we are actively looking for new sites.' Last year saw rapid growth, with turnover, profit and overall development all reaching record levels. Since the year-end Pelican had purchased the Yankee Noodle group of restaurants which brought with them Mr Robert Earl, who is behind the Planet Hollywood chain, as a non-executive director. At the same time the group raised Pounds 4m in a placing with clawback, for working capital and to clear gearing. The Leadenhall Wine Bar and the Cafe Pelican made a reduced contribution because of the recession. Interest payments fell to Pounds 345,000 (Pounds 409,000) reflecting the drop in UK interest rates. The dividend is increased to 1.1p (1p) out of earnings per share of 4p (3p).</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Israeli unions consider national strike Israel's Histadrut labour movement was last night considering whether to go ahead with a nationwide public sector strike due to start today, after the government agreed to freeze the country's privatisation programme for up to four weeks pending further negotiations with unions. The move came as a restructuring plan for the financially troubled Israel Aircraft Industries, Israel's largest employer, was agreed between management and workers which should release hundred of millions of dollars of government assistance in a rescue package. Trade union leaders were divided about whether they should call off the strike involving up to 100,000 workers in government-owned companies including the electricity, telephone and water industries, state-controlled radio and television, postal and airport services. Mr Yitzhak Raza, leader of the engineers' union, said the strike would go ahead. Other trade unionists said they would call it off if the government made a more clear and unequivocal statement suspending the privatisation drive. The unions want greater involvement in privatisation plans and demanded that the government find jobs for workers fired as part of the sale of state-owned companies. Yesterday a Tel Aviv court ruled that workers in the postal and airport authorities were forbidden to take part in the strike after a last-minute appeal was lodged by the two authorities. Mr Avraham Shochat, finance minister, said he could not stop privatisation where it is already in process, such as at Bank Mizrachi, but was prepared to freeze privatisation for other companies by up to one month. At least 11 govern-ment-owned companies including Israel Chemicals, Israel Shipyards and Bezek, the telephone company, are being prepared for at least partial privatisation within the next six months. Officials at Israel Aircraft Industries, which last year reported a loss of Dollars 60m from a turnover of Dollars 1.6bn, said they expected an immediate injection of government finance following agreement on the restructuring plan. Under the agreement the 17,000-strong work force is to be reduced by 2,900. Half will accept early retirement and half will be made redundant. The agreement also states that wages will be cut by 15 per cent and there will be no wage increases until the company is profitable.</p>

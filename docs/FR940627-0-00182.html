			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) In the case of such fuels and fuel additives which,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to applicable special provisions in &sect;79.58, are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to Tier 2 requirements, all other requirements (except  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 3) must be submitted to EPA before May 27, 1997.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) In the event that Tier 3 testing is also required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (under &sect;79.54), EPA shall determine an appropriate timeline for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> completion of the additional requirements and shall communicate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this schedule to the manufacturer according to the provisions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;79.54(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) The manufacturer may at any time modify an existing fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration by submitting a request to EPA to add or delete a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulk additive to the existing registration information for such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel product, provided that any additional additive must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered by EPA for use in the specific fuel family to which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fuel product belongs. However, the addition or deletion of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bulk additive to a fuel registration may effect the grouping of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such registered fuel under the criteria of &sect;79.56, and thus may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effect the testing responsibilities of the fuel manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under this subpart.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Registrable fuels and fuel additives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) A fuel product which is not registered pursuant to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart B of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registrable if, under the criteria established by &sect;79.56, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel can be enrolled in the same fuel/additive group with one or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more currently registered fuels. A fuel additive product which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not registered for a specific type of fuel pursuant to subpart  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C of this part as of May 27, 1994 shall be considered registrable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for that type of fuel if, under the criteria established by &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 79.56, the fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive product in the specific type of fuel can be enrolled in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same fuel/additive group with one or more currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered fuels or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, currently registered fuels and bulk additives are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those with existing registrations as of the date on which EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives the basic registration data (pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product in question.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A manufacturer seeking to register under subpart B of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part a fuel product which is deemed registrable under this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, or to register under subpart C of this part a fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive product for a specific type of fuel for which it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed registrable under this section, shall submit the basic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration data (pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)) for that product as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part of the application for registration. If the Administrator  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determines that the product is registrable under this section,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then the Administrator shall promptly register the product,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided that the applicant has satisfied all of the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for registration under subpart B or subpart C of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part, and contingent upon satisfactory submission of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required information under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Registration of a registrable fuel or additive shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be subject to the same requirements and compliance schedule as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraph (c)(1) of this section for existing fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and fuel additives. Accordingly, manufacturers of registrable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuels or additives may be granted and may retain registration for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such products only if any applicable and due Tier 1, 2, and 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements have also been satisfied by either the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the product or the fuel/additive group to which the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> belongs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New fuels and fuel additives.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A fuel product shall be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered new if it is not registered pursuant to subpart B of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this part as of May 27, 1994 and if, under the criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by &sect;79.56, it cannot be enrolled in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A fuel additive product shall be considered new with respect to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific type of fuel if it is not expressly registered for that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> type of fuel pursuant to subpart C of this part as of May 27,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1994 and if, under the criteria established by &sect;79.56, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel/additive mixture resulting from use of the additive product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the specific type of fuel cannot be enrolled in the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel/additive group with one or more currently registered fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or bulk fuel additives. For the purpose of this determination,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently registered fuels and bulk additives are those with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing registrations as of the date on which EPA receives the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basic registration data (pursuant to &sect;79.59(b)) for the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in question. For such new product, the manufacturer must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfactorily complete all applicable Tier 1 and Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, followed by any Tier 3 testing which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator may require, before registration will be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notifications.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Upon receipt of a manufacturer's (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> group's) submittal in compliance with the requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart, EPA will notify such manufacturer (or group) that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application has been received and what, if any, information,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing, or retesting is necessary to bring the application into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the requirements of this subpart. EPA intends  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide such notification of receipt in a timely manner for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each such application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Registered fuel and fuel additive notification.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel additive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product who is notified that the submittal for such product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains adequate information pursuant to the Tier 1 and Tier 2  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing and reporting requirements (&sect;&sect;79.52, 79.53, and 79.59 (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through (c)) may continue to sell, offer for sale, or introduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into commerce the registered product as permitted by the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registration for the product under &sect;79.4.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive product is notified that testing or retesting is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to bring the Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance, the continued sale or importation of the product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shall be conditional upon satisfactorily completing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements within the time frame specified in paragraph (c)(1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) EPA intends to notify the manufacturer of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequacy of the submitted data within two years of EPA's receipt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of such data. However, EPA retains the right to require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate data be submitted to EPA if, upon subsequent review, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finds that the original Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 submittal is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistent with the requirements of this subpart. If EPA does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not notify the manufacturer of the adequacy of the Tier 1 and/or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tier 2 data within two years, EPA will not hold the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liable for penalties for violating this rule for the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning when the data was due until the time EPA notifies the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer of the violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) If the manufacturer of a registered fuel or fuel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additive product is notified (pursuant to &sect;79.54(b)) that Tier 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing is required for its product, then the manufacturer may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to sell, offer for sale, introduce into commerce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> registered product as permitted by the existing registration for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product under &sect;79.4. However, if the manufacturer fails to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete the specified Tier 3 requirements within the specified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time, the registration of the product will be subject to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cancellation under &sect;79.51(f)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

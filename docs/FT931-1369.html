			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Nigeria warned on debt repayments WESTERN creditor governments warned Nigeria yesterday that new loans might dry up if it failed to reduce its Dollars 3bn to Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.23bn to Pounds 3bn) arrears on official debt repayments. The warning was issued to Mr Oladele Olashore, the Nigerian finance minister, who was summoned to appear for two hours before the Paris Club of official creditors to explain why the country had fallen so far behind on payments so soon after its last agreement lapsed a year ago. 'The Nigerians were told that it will be difficult to get new money unless they regularise their payments,' said an official. Several creditors feel that they are in a difficult situation, he said. It is very rare for finance ministers to be asked to the Paris Club's regular monthly working level meetings, a mark of lenders' concern over Nigeria's case. Mr Olashore was told that Nigeria will get the debt relief it so badly needs only if it gets an IMF agreement. He told sceptical creditors that Nigeria hoped to get such an agreement before the general election, due to bring a civilian president to powerin August. Nigeria is struggling with a worsening balance of payments crisis and pressure on its currency, which have together eaten away at much of its foreign reserves, now the equivalent of less than eight weeks' import cover. By the end of last year, it had Dollars 27.6bn foreign debt, of which Dollars 16.5bn was owed to the Paris Club.</p>

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DOUBTS crept into stock index futures yesterday as the larger-than-expected swing against the Conservative party at Thursday's local elections forced the market onto the defensive. By the close the June FT-SE 100 index contract was down 14 points at 2,538, while its premium to the spot index had been whittled away to just 15 points against 22 in the previous session. With fair value, brokers' estimate of the futures market's theoretical premium, also at 15 points, the futures market is now indicating that the stock market is unlikely to rise much further. However, in the traded options market a number of bullish trades indicated that there are still investors who anticipate further immediate gains, in spite of the less certain political climate. In the FT-SE 100 index options, there were buyers of July 2,650 calls and sellers of August 2,450 puts. There were also sellers of May 2,250 calls and buyers of May 2,400 calls. The recent lowering of brokers profits forecasts in Asda prompted selling of October 110 puts. A total of 1,151 contracts changed hands, equivalent to 1.1m shares, which made it the busiest stock option. Bid speculation in Allied-Lyons lifted turnover, with the October 600 calls particularly active.</p>

			<p><P> June 29, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: BALDWIN PARK;  </P> <P> COUNCIL HANDLES SHORTFALL  </P> <P> To make up a $260,700 shortfall in the 1989-90 city budget, the City Council  has approved three belt-tightening moves, City Clerk Linda Gair said Wednesday.  </P> <P> At a meeting last week, the City Council voted to eliminate the entire  six-member code enforcement division, saving $260,300, Gair said. The  division's work, including enforcement of weed-abatement laws and issuance of  city licenses, are being absorbed by other city departments, she said.  </P> <P> The council also reallocated money from two other sources to make up the  deficit. Gair said the city will save $25,000 on lower liability insurance  premiums, and $28,400 will be transferred from the city's retirement fund  surplus.  </P> <P> Mayor Leo King said the staff cutbacks were necessary to keep the city  financially afloat. "We were getting to the point where we were borrowing from  Peter to pay Paul." He said the code enforcement division was top-heavy with  supervisors and its work could be performed by other departments.  </P></p>

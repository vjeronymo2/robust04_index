			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of China (13): A future in grain markets - Agriculture / The issues facing policy makers today are less about how to feed the people but more about how to feed them better and more efficiently One of the greatest achievements of the People's Republic has been its ability to feed the people. There are 1.2bn Chinese and, aside from the disastrous famine induced by Mao's Great Leap Forward, the government has been able to ensure they have a full belly. It is a measure of that achievement that the issues facing policy makers today are less about how to feed the people but more about how to feed them better and more efficiently. This is not to say that China's prime requirement of producing enough grain for its population has changed but more to highlight that markets and technology have an important role to play in China's agriculture policy for the 1990s. Last year, in spite of damaging floods, China produced 435m tonnes of grain, second only to the record harvest of 446m tonnes in 1990. With the storehouses overflowing, policy makers judge it time to reform the country's grain marketing system. The need to reform grain marketing is pressing. Many localities have stores of rice equal to many years consumption. These stores overhang the market and depress prices. Added to that is the problem of storing all the grain China produces. More than 50m tonnes of grain is stored in the open air, up from 45m tonnes last year and at least 20m tonnes the year before. There have been many reports of state grain procurement agencies refusing to buy grain from farmers due to insufficient storage capacity. The State Council recently issued a directive to the provinces to make every effort to expand grain storage facilities. China is expecting another big harvest this year. The grain trade in China is still relatively under developed. Under the household responsibility system, where peasants have limited land tenure, they are required to meet state-determined production quotas; anything they make in excess of the quota can be sold on the open market. However, moving grain - principally rice - from rice growing surplus provinces of the country to deficit provinces - is something which is still at a fairly rudimentary stage. China sees the development of wholesale and futures markets as one way in which to make the distribution and pricing of grain more efficient. In October 1990, with the assistance of the Chicago Board of Trade, a futures market was opened in Zhengzhou, Henan province. This market is designed to move about 3m tonnes of negotiated-price wheat from one province to another. Since then a wholesale rice market has opened in Wuhu, Anhui province, and a wholesale corn market in Changchun, Jilin province. The economic research service of the US Department of Agriculture estimates that about 25 per cent of China's grain market is strongly affected by wholesale and local market activity. However, a recent article in Problems of Agricultural Economy, a mainland journal, pointed out that China had a long way to go before the futures markets really took off. It noted that China lacked well developed wholesale markets; futures markets needed speculators in sufficient numbers to ensure competition; the market needed the backing of a developed financial system and a body of law to guarantee traders' rights, equal competition and standardised practices. Prices are still controlled, with the state purchasing grain from farmers at one price and selling it at a lower price to the cities. State subsides for grain and edible oil - which go to the 20 per cent of China's population which live in cities - amounted to Yn3.6bn in 1978; by 1990 the subsidy had reached Yn40bn, or nearly 10 per cent of total central government expenditures. To deal with this problem, the government introduced price rises for staple foods last year. Some of the price rises were quite large, although from a low base. For example, the urban price of milled flour rose 56 per cent from 37 fen to 56 fen a kilogramme. Signs that more radical reforms might be in the offing came earlier this year. Starting this April, the provinces of Guangdong and Fujien moved to free floating prices for rice sales in the cities and with very little evidence of upward pressure on prices. Indeed, in Guangzhou (Canton), one can see rice from other countries, mainly Thailand, on sale. They are, of course, two of the richest provinces in the country and can well afford to pay market prices, but is an indication of the government's desire to move towards market determination of agricultural retail prices, and even ones as sensitive as rice. In rural China farming has become much less important over the past decade as an employer. The government has been successful in developing rural and township industries which provided basic services and manufactures while at the same time absorbing rural surplus labour. They are the hope of the countryside, opined a recent editorial in the People's Daily, the principle organ of the communist party. There are more than 18m rural and township enterprises in China employing 93m rural labourers - up from 34m in 1988 - and these have gone a long way in soaking up an estimated 120m-150m labourers surplus to farm work in the countryside. Growth in output of these industries has averaged 10 per cent to 20 per cent in the past three years and accounts for 30 per cent of China's industrial output. The income generated from the growth of these industries has improved the lot of the farm household. Over the past decade the average living space per person in rural China has doubled to 18.5 sq metres. The greater wealth of rural inhabitants is seen in demand for consumer durables, such as refrigerators, washing machines and colour televisions. It is rural China which constitutes an important part of the China market and many companies located in the fast-growing regions of south-eastern China have targeted the inland rural provinces for sales of consumer durables. The communist party is aware that the past decade of rural reforms - especially the household contract system - has been a popular success in rural China. At a high level meeting of the party last year the central committee reaffirmed its support for the contract system and the limited land tenure that goes with it. The party has accepted that there will be income inequalities in rural China. As the People's Daily, said in December: 'For a fairly long period of time, excessive control over rural collective economic organisations and egalitarianism in distribution (pay) had dampened peasants' production enthusiasm and impeded the development of productive forces in the countryside.' China has turned its back on Stalinist collectivisation of agriculture, although it may be some time before it completely repudiates it. It has opted for a gradualist approach to farm and farm prices reform, while realising that urgent action is needed to improve agricultural infrastructure and internal agricultural trade.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SEVENTH &amp; EIGHTH 5-YEAR PLANS FOR AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT TARGETS (TONS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              Seventh 5-year plan   Eighth 5-year plan   Average annual                   annual average   1995 target output     increase (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Grain                     406.62               447.00              8.2 Cotton                      4.04                 4.64              0.1 Oilseed crops              14.46                17.26              0.6 Sugar crops                61.15                73.72              2.5 Meat                       21.85                30.00              2.0 Aquatic products           10.42                14.50              2.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: China Agriculture &amp; Trade Report, US Department of Agriculture  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

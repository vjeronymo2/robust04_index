			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of Sri Lanka (17): Wages have changed only a little - Company profile: Eskimo Fashions ESKIMO Fashions is a hot and dusty one-hour drive away from Colombo. At its factory in the middle of a coconut plantation Eskimo produces winter tights and gloves, mostly destined for the European market, writes Kieran Cooke. Eskimo is fully owned by the Ergee group, one of Germany's biggest textiles companies. Production started in 1982: Eskimo now produces about 18,000 pairs of tights and 6,000 pairs of gloves each day. Mr Hermann Michael-Lohs, Eskimo's managing director, says that Sri Lanka still has considerable labour cost advantages. Wages for the factory's 1,800 workers have changed little in the past 10 years. 'In 1982, the minimum wage was SLRs520 a month - now it is SLRs2,000. But in D-Mark terms, because of the devaluation of the rupee, the wage is about the same.' But Mr Michael-Lohs says that Sri Lanka's textile industry is still very underdeveloped, with no industrial base. 'We import about 50 per cent of our final product cost. That's high compared to many others - in some companies imported goods account for more than 90 per cent of the final cost. Sri Lanka is still mainly a textile producer and not a manufacturer.' Eskimo imports its yarn from India or Indonesia. Not having a local supply of such goods means that Eskimo needs to keep more than two months of materials in stock to ensure continuing production. A recent strike in the Indian textile industry underlined the need to maintain considerable stocks of material. 'That's a big financial burden and puts our costs up,' says Mr Michael-Lohs. 'We also have to find storage space.' Some design work is carried out in Sri Lanka and the workforce has been quick to learn new skills. But the more sophisticated production is still carried out at another Eskimo factory in Malaysia. 'We have a good labour force here, with good relations between workers and management,' says Mr Michael-Lohs. 'But we always have to keep a watch on wages. The moment they go up, we become uncompetitive. As a country tries to industrialise, the textile industry is always one of the pioneering industries. But it's also the first industry to move on when costs start to rise.'</p>

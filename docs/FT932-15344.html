			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Business and the Environment: Commerce and culture prompt a cleaner Japan - Worldwide Water / Tokyo wants purer supplies When the Russian navy confessed last month to having routinely dumped nuclear waste materials in the Sea of Japan, government leaders in Tokyo reacted with uncharacteristic bluntness, describing the action as 'unbelievable' and a 'disgrace'. The tough response reflects the Japanese sensitivity to water purity, a sensitivity heightened by the country's past mishandling of its own water resources and by an ongoing debate over balancing the needs of industry with the rights of domestic users to clean water. But it is typical of the Japanese response to the dilemma that the government did not only criticise Russia. Today, Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, will offer technological assistance to Russia's nuclear industry at a meeting of finance and foreign ministers of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. In a sense, the Russian navy had done in the 1990s what Japanese industry was guilty of during the rapid years of industrial growth in the 1950s and 1960s. Inspired by a desire to 'build a strong Japan', the country consciously sacrificed the quality of its river and sea water for the cause of industrial growth. The turning point in Japan came after the Minamata poisoning case, which began in 1957 and still dominates any debate on water quality. Chisso, a chemicals manufacturer, had pumped mercury refuse into the waters around the town of Minamata, on the southern island of Kyushu, contaminating fish and leading to the poisoning of the local population and the deformity of newborn children. Chisso denied responsibility and continued to pump materials into the sea long after the first cases were discovered, but has since admitted its guilt. Meanwhile, negligence actions are still moving slowly and painfully through the Japanese courts in an attempt to prove that government controls were too lax. Even without a clear court precedent, the images of Minamata were shocking enough for the government to take action. The Minamata case challenged Japan's self-image. Water and its purity are a prime inspiration for poets and painters, while the eating of fish, raw or cooked, is seen as part of the Japanese culture. The mass poisoning of a local community prompted many to conclude that the Japanese way of life, along with water, was in need of protection. Tetsuya Ikeda, chief of the water supply division at the Ministry of Health and Welfare, says the accumulation of industrial pollution from the high-growth era still affects the water supply, in spite of two decades of anti-pollution campaigning that has imposed increasingly tough standards on factories. 'The biggest problem for us now is to get rid of the foul smell and unpleasant taste of water,' Ikeda says. The problem is particularly severe in the greater Tokyo area, home to 30m people and still a heavy industrial centre. 'In 1983, we found about 80 sources were polluted, and less than 10m people suffered with bad smell and taste. Last year 100 sources had a problem and about 20m people suffered.' Concern about water quality has stimulated demand for mineral waters, increasingly used by parents fearing for their children's health. Technically, Ikeda says, that there is no danger to health from Tokyo water, but youth magazines have gone as far as encouraging their readers to use only mineral water when shampooing their hair. Domestic mineral water production rose from 101,000 kilolitres in 1989 to 300,000kl last year, while mineral water imports rose from 16,279kl to 45,594kl over the same period. The Japan Mineral Water Association says 'people are worried about their health', and want to be certain that their drinking water is pure. Demand for pure water has led to a doubling of water purifier sales in each of the past three years. Toshiba, the electronics group, this month launched new coffee makers and kettles with built-in purifiers. Mitsubishi Electric has just begun selling high-powered engines for domestic wells, increasingly popular among families wanting to draw their own water. There is also widespread concern about preserving natural water courses. The most controversial environmental issue in Japan over the past five years has been a plan to dam the Nagara River, in the Chubu region of central Japan. Local opponents to the project say the dam is unnecessary and will threaten wildlife, while the regional government argues that it will prevent flooding and make better use of water resources. The Nagara dispute and a current political scandal, involving kickbacks to politicians for public works projects, have led to greater public debate over the management of resources and stimulated interest in the privatisation of water resources. Typically, the construction ministry will undertake large infrastructure projects, while the resources will be managed by local governments. Electricity and railway networks are privately run in Japan and the government has sent a delegation to study the British experience in water privatisation. But a member of the delegation says the management efficiencies that may result from privatisation are not compelling enough to overcome bureaucratic opposition to such reforms.</p>

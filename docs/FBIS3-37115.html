The Question, However, Has Nevertheless Been Discussed in the  Corridors of Power"]    [Text] The other day POSTFACTUM distributed a report that  staffers of the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers have been  prohibited, in violation of the republic's current legislation,  from giving information to the independent mass media. The news  agency's correspondent, citing reliable sources, said that the  decision was made 7 February at a government meeting chaired by  Vagif Nagiyev, Cabinet of Ministers chief of staff. All  staffers were given an instruction prohibiting direct contacts  with the press. Only the Azerbaijan Cabinet of Ministers press  service was allowed to deal with independent journalists.    Your SEGODNYA correspondent asked Kyamal Katibli, chief of  the Cabinet of Ministers press service, to comment on the  report. Mr. Katibli said in a telephone conversation that the  matter had never been discussed at any level and that the press  reports did not square with reality. "No one has barred members  of the Cabinet of Ministers from contacting the mass media," Mr.  Katibli said.    Meanwhile, your SEGODNYA correspondent has learned that the  problem was in fact discussed unofficially in Azerbaijani  corridors of power. Government members were recommended not to  disclose information anonymously. A person speaking to  journalists should introduce himself and bear responsibility for  his words. Seeing that no government members would dare make  any sensational statements for the press given the difficult  sociopolitical situation in the republic, POSTFACTUM's report  should not be seen as false. It has simply not been fully  clarified.</p>

			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Books: All bark, no bite - Mrs Gaskell deserves better, decides Jackie Wullschlager ELIZABETH GASKELL: A HABIT OF STORIES by Jennie Uglow Faber Pounds 20, 690 pages 'Oh Mrs Gaskell - Fearful - Fearful] If I were Mr G, O Heaven, how I would beat her', wrote Charles Dickens. BUT HOW dangerous was Mrs G? Like other women writers masked by chattel names - Mrs Radcliffe, Mrs Humphrey Ward - she was a middle class wife who shot out radical novels from behind the shelter of the marriage lines. Her public image was one of charity and good deeds. Was she a seething revolutionary or a busybody who turned the wretchedness of those she helped into sensational fiction? Mrs Gaskell's life was active, happy, and uneventful. Brought up in a country town, she married at 21 a hymn-writing Unitarian minister from Manchester whose compositions included 'Meekly Take Thy Place Assigned'. She threw herself into motherhood and social work among Manchester's poor, and in 1848 wrote her first novel of working class life, Mary Barton. It was seen as a call to revolution, while a successor, Ruth, about a seamstress left with an illegitimate child, was ritually burnt by her husband's parishioners. Charles Kingsley heralded the first book as a Chartist tract but found Ruth too powerful: 'I don't think I shall go on with it. I am sure it is not going to be pleasant,' he said, after 20 pages - he had the same response to Othello. Today these worthy tales seem tame and genteel, but through the 1850s Mrs G thrived on the controversy they sparked, denied political interest - 'No one can feel more deeply than I how wicked it is to excite class against class'  -and grew rich on royalties. She became friends with Dickens and Charlotte Bronte, and dreamt of life away from Manchester. At 53, she purchased unseen a large house in Hampshire as a surprise for her husband, sped around collecting furniture, and whizzed south to see the result. Hours after crossing the threshold, she collapsed in her daughter's arms and died. For a biographer, the trouble with Mrs Gaskell is that her life was full of people more interesting than she was, and that her relations with them mark her own limited imagination. A letter to George Eliot, living openly with GH Lewes, ends: 'I should not be quite true in my ending, if I did not say that I wish you were Mrs Lewes.' The difference between Charlotte Bronte and herself, she writes, 'is that she puts all her naughtiness into her books and I put all my goodness.' And that is the biographer's second problem: where a study of Eliot or Bronte reveals rich seams of crises, passions and self doubts that fuelled Middlemarch or Jane Eyre, Elizabeth Gaskell's even, beautiful life tells unfashionably little about her work. She recognised as much in answering an enquirer: 'I do not see why the public have any more to do with me than to buy or reject the wares I supply to them.' She was every inch the bourgeoise entertainer, and not at all the alienated artist. That leaves the biographer with a socio-historical approach, and there is much here - Mrs Gaskell's energy, morality, ambition, her domination of her daughters - that is emblematic of the mid-Victorian age, as well as scope to set the outlook of novels like North and South or Ruth, which finally kow-tow to middle class respectability, against work by, say, Zola or Hardy, which really did ask inflammatory questions. John Sutherland, in his life of Mrs Humphrey Ward (1990) showed how the mind of a Victorian writer could be a fascinating focus for the thoughts and dilemmas of an age. But Miss Uglow has no insight into the Victorian world view, and she assembles the minutiae of trivia and detail, of places visited, meals eaten, without ever building them into a general picture. This is biography of the 'new year of 1852 began with the usual bustle' (page 299) genre: dull, undirected, humourless and far too long. A good literary Life sends one back to the work; this one confirms Mrs Gaskell's own modest opinion, that barely one of her novels bears re-reading. She deserves a bolder and more eloquent rescue.</p>

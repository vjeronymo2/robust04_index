			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Japan weighs the good and the bad of rising yen - Banks stand to gain, but much else will suffer TRAVEL agents in Tokyo's Ginza shopping area were doing a brisk trade yesterday afternoon as Japanese tourists eagerly counted the falling cost of an autumn holiday in the US. Tourism apart, however, the yen's rapid rise against the US dollar - which fell to a post-war low yesterday of Y120.25 - could cast an additional shadow over a Japanese economy which is flagging under the burden of stagnant consumption, deep cuts in corporate investment, falling profits and a banking system riddled with bad debts. The yen has risen as investors have retreated from Europe's turbulent currency markets, confused about the prospects for monetary co-ordination and worried about the prospects for growth in Germany. The Japanese are repatriating funds to seek a safe haven. However, the yen's strength is not simply a side effect of the currency turmoil in Europe and nor is it likely to fade quickly. The yen has strengthened 10 per cent against the D-Mark since the start of September and by 5 per cent against the US dollar, according to Mr Paul Summerville, senior economist at Jardine Fleming Securities. The consensus among Tokyo analysts is that the dollar could weaken to Y115 and possibly fall as low as Y105. The outlook for the US economy is still uncertain in the run up to the presidential election in November. However, many industrialists and financiers in Tokyo believe the Japanese economy crossed a watershed with the announcement last month of a Y10,700bn (Pounds 52bn) emergency government spending package. At the least, that has given the economy a breathing space which could last a couple of months. The prospect of a stronger yen will fuel speculation that the Bank of Japan may further cut its official discount rate which was lowered by half a point to 3.25 per cent in July. The Bank has insisted it will only cut rates further if it judges that the domestic economy needs to be stimulated, not as part of a concerted international effort to encourage growth. The Bank's problem is that the domestic economy will be clouded by a sustained rise in the yen. The authorities will have to weigh the costs and benefits it will bring to different sectors of the economy. Exporters could be hit severely. Many medium-sized manufacturers claim they need an exchange rate of Y120 to Y125 to break even. Large Japanese manufacturers invested heavily in plants overseas in the late 1980s and so are better placed to deal with a yen appreciation than they were in 1985 when they were much more dependent on exports. The domestic economy is in such a weak state, however, that exports have been one of the few sources of growth. The authorities will not want it killed off. The case for an interest rate cut to restrain the yen will be strengthened by three other factors. The appreciation amounts to a tightening of monetary policy at a time when money supply growth is minimal. A strong yen will create more downward pressure on inflation, thereby raising real interest rates and hindering the banks efforts to deal with their bad debts. The government will soon have to decide how to finance its rising spending; if it borrows heavily interest rates could be pushed up. However, the authorities may not want to take too much of the steam out of the yen. A resurgent yen would help to curb Japan's politically sensitive ballooning current account surplus which grew by 94 per cent to Dollars 56.2bn in the first six months of the year as import demand fell away and manufacturers turned to exports. The biggest beneficiaries from the yen's appreciation could be the banks, which are at the heart of the economy's weakness. The fall in stock and property prices has eroded the equity base, as they have been hit by a rising tide of bad debts on loans made to customers who got caught by the puncturing of the speculative bubble economy of the late 1980s. Investment, especially by small and medium-sized companies, and consumer spending is unlikely to revive until banks are in better shape to lend, pumping more liquidity into the economy. Indeed, Japanese financial institutions may have brought funds home as a precaution while they assess their bad debts in preparation to disclose a revised figure next month. The yen's strength could help the banks in two ways. First, the prospect of cuts in interest rates could underpin the recent stock market rally which yesterday took the Nikkei average up 327.23 to 18,609.95. With the Nikkei above 18,000, banks should have enough capital to meet their Bank for International Settlements requirements for capital adequacy ratios and so could contemplate renewed lending. Second, a large portion of Japanese banks lending is in the US, denominated in dollars. A rise in the yen against the dollar is an automatic strengthening of bank balance sheets for the purposes of their US operations. That means they will be under less pressure to raise new equity as the base for their Japanese operations. According to Mr Summerville: 'With the Nikkei at 18,000 and the dollar at Y120, all but one of the banks should be home.'</p>

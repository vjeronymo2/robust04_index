			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: IPO poised to value Thai generator at up to Bt8bn Shares of Electricity Generating (Egco), which is set to become Thailand's first partly-privatised electricity company, will be priced at between Bt17 and Bt20 for the initial public offering, valuing the company at between Bt6.8bn (Dollars 273m) and Bt8bn, the underwriters said yesterday. Egco, a subsidiary of the state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (Egat), is buying a 1,200MW Egat power station in Rayong, south-east of Bangkok; the plant accounts for 10 per cent of Thailand's generating capacity. After Egco shares are listed, the company has an option to buy the new 824MW Khanom power station in southern Thailand by 1995, and is expected to compete against private-sector rivals for independent power producer projects that will sell electricity to Egat. Egco's final IPO price will be set after a book-building roadshow this month, the underwriters said, and the shares will be sold from November 7-9. Egco has already raised Bt14.75bn in loans to pay for most of the Rayong station.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: South Africa in Ecu250m landmark offering SOUTH AFRICA's return to world capital markets yesterday received considerable impetus with the announcement that the government was raising Ecu250m (R890m). The issue is the first by South Africa in the Ecu market since 1984, and follows the country's re-entry last September into world capital markets with a DM400m issue, after an absence of six years. The issue, which was mostly pre-placed, is 'new money', unlike the D-Mark issue, half of which was used to refinance a maturing issue. The issue underlines the change in attitudes towards South Africa since the dark days of mid-1985, when the refusal of foreign banks to roll over the country's loans forced South Africa to declare a standstill on debt repayment. Since then, Pretoria has maintained what Mr Gerhard Croeser, director-general of the department of finance, yesterday called a 'meticulous' record in meeting debt commitments and complying with the conditions of the three Interim Debt Arrangements, to which South Africa's foreign debt has been subjected since the 1985 standstill. The South African authorities believe the launch also showed that international investors felt the country's political and economic prospects had been enhanced by the formation in December of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the forum for the country's constitutional negotiations. The funds, Mr Croeser said, would contribute towards the financing of the national budget, play an important role in strengthening the country's reserves, and promote economic stability and the further normalisation of South Africa's relations with its foreign creditors. Strengthening the country's foreign reserves is particularly important as it will allow the Reserve Bank (central bank) to pursue a less restrictive monetary policy, and enhance economic growth. In recent years, South Africa's ability to finance economic growth has been constrained by the need to export savings to finance debt repayments. The country exported about R30bn of capital in this way between 1986 and 1990. In international terms, South Africa is an under-borrowed country. Total external debt at December 1990 totalled USDollars 19.3bn, equivalent to 70.2 per cent of annual export earnings. The interest service ratio is 7.1 per cent. South Africa's total foreign debt was Dollars 23.7bn at the end of August 1985, when the standstill on international borrowing was declared. The Ecu issue, for maturity in 1997, has a coupon of 10.375 per cent. The Department of Finance said this was a premium of about 1.77 basis points over the average for three benchmark Ecu issues, of similar maturity, by Spain, Norway and Belgium. The premium is partly a function of political risk, the debt standstill, and the fact that having been out of the market for so long, South Africa lacks liquid issues, and it is liquidity which brings marketability and a lower price. Last week Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, said the country would push for a final debt arrangement to deal with the outstanding Dollars 5bn when the third interim arrangement ended in 1993. He said a further arrangement was necessary because South Africa could not afford to repay the whole amount in 1993. The removal of the debt standstill, and South Africa's readmission to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), are the biggest remaining obstacles to the normalisation of South Africa's relations with the international financial community.</p>

			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BARRIO LOGAN KIDS GET A SPECIAL SUMMER OFFER: SCHOOL  </P> <P> Summer school will be offered this year to as many as 115 elementary students  in the Barrio Logan area as a result of an unusual collaboration between the  San Diego city school district and UC San Diego, which school trustees are  expected to approve today.  </P> <P> The principal of Torrey Pines Elementary School in La Jolla has arranged for  UCSD to help sponsor for two weeks in August transportation and special  instruction for students -- and their parents -- who voluntarily bus to the  school every day under the school district's integration program.  </P> <P> Most of the schools in the students' neighborhoods are on year-round schedules  and do not offer summer school within walking distance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transportation the Key  </P> <P> "We've had an obvious concern that many of our (bused) kids don't have summer  school opportunities," Principal Barry Bernstein said. "Many of these kids  could benefit from a chance for some enrichment and motivation during the  summer, but the main hurdle has always been to get them transportation," since  many of the families have no cars.  </P> <P> Students living in the La Jolla area have family transportation and are able to  take advantage of summer school offered at nearby La Jolla and Pacific  Beach-area schools, Bernstein said.  </P> <P> Because of limited district funding, Bernstein earlier this spring contacted  UCSD officials with whom he has established an informal working relationship.  </P> <P> Joseph Watson, UCSD vice chancellor for undergraduate affairs, said: "Bernstein  approached us and indicated that, given our closeness to his school and our  interest in having a diverse student body, it might be a good idea if UCSD  would work with him to encourage students and parents to start thinking about  college early."  </P> <P> Watson oversees UCSD programs that encourage more minority students to attend  college, which Watson believes must increasingly reach not only high school  juniors and seniors, but students in elementary and junior high schools as  well.  </P> <P> "We told Bernstein that his was an excellent idea, particularly if we can get  both students and parents to think about getting a good, early, solid start on  academic matters and develop skills early," Watson said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Parents Will Visit  </P> <P> He has made available about $1,000 in discretionary funds for transportation.  In addition, teaching assistants from the UCSD Teacher Education Program will  help in classrooms during the two-week session, as well as with parents who  will visit both Torrey Pines and UCSD twice during the program.  </P> <P> "We'd like to have more than just two weeks, and I know that there is a  limitation to what we can do academically in that time," Bernstein said. "But  the motivation and inspiration aspects will have an effect over the long run,  and just as important for some of the children is the maintenance English  program during the summer months, because many live in Spanish-speaking  environments."  </P> <P> The parent component will continue into the regular school year next fall,  Bernstein said.  </P> <P> Watson said that, although the UCSD commitment is not "institutional in a major  way," it could pave the way for larger future efforts with elementary schools,  "particularly with community-initiated efforts."  </P> <P> "We have a lot of optimism but also some caution. . . . This is a seeding  effort but not a long-term commitment."  </P></p>

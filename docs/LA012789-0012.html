			<p><P> January 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LUJAN RULES OUT MINING, OIL DRILLING IN U.S. PARKS  </P> <P> Calling for an end to years of controversy over environmental policy, Interior  Secretary-designate Manuel Lujan Jr. took a first step Thursday, affirming that  the Bush Administration will not permit mining and oil drilling in national  parks and wilderness areas.  </P> <P> The statement appeared aimed at quelling a dispute sparked last month by the  department's Office of Surface Mining, which had proposed a regulation that  could open such areas to mining, drilling and other activities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oil Drilling in Refuge  </P> <P> But, in testimony before a Senate committee considering his nomination, Lujan  showed no sign that the Administration might also pull back on the more  contentious issue of oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.  </P> <P> A broad coalition of environmental groups has urged the new Administration to  abandon former Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel's request that Congress clear  the way for oil and gas development in the region. Bush told reporters  Wednesday that he favors "prudent development" of the region.  </P> <P> After Lujan seconded the Bush stance Thursday, some Democratic senators  indicated that the stage was set for further squabbles.  </P> <P> "I think Bush is going to run right into the meat grinder on this one," Sen.  Timothy E. Wirth (D-Colo.) said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Line 'Already Drawn'  </P> <P> "For better or for worse," George Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness  Society, testified, "I think a line has already been drawn on that issue."  </P> <P> Lujan, whose nomination is expected to be easily confirmed, had expressed hope  that his tenure as Interior secretary would not be marred by such disputes.  </P> <P> "Discussions of natural resource issues have too often been marked by bitter  controversy," he said. "We all need to lower our voice so that we can hear each  other."  </P> <P> Heeding his own advice, the 60-year-old former New Mexico congressman testified  tentatively, responding to some questions with mere nods of his head and  providing only abbreviated answers to others. He confessed repeatedly that he  did not yet know what positions the Bush Administration would take on specific  issues.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warned of Being 'Patsy'  </P> <P> That appeared to frustrate some senators, who urged Lujan to work within the  Administration as an advocate for the environment. "We would hope that you  would not be the patsy for the (Office of Management and Budget)," Sen. Mark  Hatfield (R-Ore.) said.  </P> <P> After assuring him that Bush had invited Cabinet members to volunteer their  views, Lujan pledged: "I don't intend to be a shrinking violet."  </P> <P> The goals and agenda that Lujan outlined in an opening statement Thursday gave  special attention to the Interior Department's role in the war on drugs and in  education of students in federal schools, but otherwise it contained little of  substance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Backs Resource Use  </P> <P> In tone it closely resembled the positions of his recent predecessors. "We are  committed to protecting and enhancing the nation's valuable resources, as well  as proceeding with their environmentally sound development," Lujan said of the  new Administration. "We can do both; we do not have to choose between them."  </P> <P> In later testimony, representatives of environmental groups criticized Lujan  for his congressional voting history, which records a low level of support for  environmental legislation. But they said that they envision no obstacle to his  confirmation when his nomination is sent to the full Senate next week.  </P></p>

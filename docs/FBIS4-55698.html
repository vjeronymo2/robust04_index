			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "kob," "wk": "Barrier to Privatization"] </F>   [Text] Every third person polled in an April survey  conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center [CBOS] thinks  that, six months into left-wing rule, privatization is  continuing at too slow a pace.    When Pawlak's government was being formed, over one-third of  respondents were afraid that the rate of privatization might be  slowed down. Currently, almost 70 percent think the government  has neither speeded up privatization nor slowed it down.    Let us recall that, over the first quarter of this year,  only  three enterprises were subjected to capital privatization (the  smallest number since 1990.) Between the beginning of 1990 and  September of last year, 76 companies were sold through capital  privatization. The biggest number (23) changed owners in the  first half of 1993.    Twelve percent of the CBOS respondents think that the  government's lack of interest is the main obstacle in the  privatization process.    A definitely larger number of respondents think that  politics  is not the main reason behind reducing the rate of  transformations. According to those people, privatization is  being slowed down first of all by lack of Polish capital (47  percent), poor legislation (44 percent), and the bad economic  situation of enterprises (41 percent).    Those who think privatization is beneficial for the economy  come primarily from the managerial cadre and intelligentsia.  They also reside in large cities, have higher education, are  well-off financially, and sympathize with right-wing political  parties.    Every fifth respondent is convinced of the harmful effects  of  privatization on the economy. This view is predominant among  farmers, the poorest members of society, and those holding  left-wing views.    A significant proportion of respondents remain afraid of the  effects of privatization on the company where they work.    For almost half of all employees of state-owned enterprises  who were polled, privatization brings along more fears than  hopes for a better future. They are afraid that privatization  will mean the end to guaranteed employment and that the level of  social benefits will deteriorate. Respondents who view as  positive the effects of transformations on the company where  they work say that labor discipline and labor efficiency will  increase.    "The poll's results may mean an increase in social support  for a continuation of policies of Solidarity-derived  governments. Respondents are beginning to reconcile themselves  with the notion that the election programs of the Democratic  Left Alliance and the Polish Peasant Party were just part of the  election game," write CBOS commentators in their concluding  remarks.  <H8>  * * * </H8>   The poll, entitled "Society's Position on Privatization  After  the First Six Months of Left-Wing Rule," was conducted between  14 and 18 April on a sample of 1,207 adult Poles.</p>

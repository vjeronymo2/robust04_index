			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POLAND IMPROVES  </P> <P> It is obvious that matters are improving very quickly in Poland. I received a  letter from a relative in a small town in Poland and it took only four days  from the time it was mailed. This is incredible because when the communists  were in control, mail was in transit three weeks and more.  </P> <P> JOSEPH A. KUCIA  </P> <P> Oxnard  </P></p>

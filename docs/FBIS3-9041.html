This improvement can be  achieved primarily through the completion of the division of  "the small percentage of remaining common property," Kukan said.    "It is in the interests of Slovakia to do its utmost so that  Slovak-Czech relations also develop positively in the future,  Kukan said. [no closing quotation marks as received]    He said that the current priorities of the Slovak foreign  policy remained unchanged. They were first of all orientation  towards an integration into European structures, including  security ones, and the improvement of relations with neighboring  countries, especially with Hungary. Here there exists a certain  tension, Kukan said.    Slovakia is naturally interested in maintaining good  relations with Russia, Ukraine and other East European  countries. "These are important countries, they have their  indisputable importance in the whole mosaic of international  relations. I intend to attach considerable importance to  relations with these countries given the traditions and economic  weight of these countries," Kukan said.    Asked by CTK whether he intended to try to ensure that  Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's visit to Slovakia,  which was recently postponed, took place as soon as possible,  Kukan said that "given its interest in promoting good relations  with Russia, Slovak diplomacy will take necessary initiative for  Kozyrev's visit to take place.    "We should strive for Slovakia to be perceived by the world  objectively, much more objectively than before," Kukan said,  adding that the U.S. press, for example, writes about Slovakia  largely negatively.    Kukan confirmed the United Nations' interest in sending  further Slovak troops to the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] in  the former Yugoslavia. He said this would contribute to  improving Slovakia's image abroad, but said that in the opinion  of the Slovak Defense Ministry the "current 606 Slovak soldiers  in Bosnia was the maximum that Slovakia could currently provide.    Kukan denied that the current change of government had  harmed  Slovakia's reputation abroad. Changing a cabinet which had lost  its majority in parliament was a "normal phenomenon" in the  advanced world, he said. International political circles in  fact saw the approach of the Slovak parliament and President  Michal Kovac to ending the power of Premier Vladimir Meciar's  government as proof of the fact that democratic institutions and  principles were working in Slovakia, Kukan said.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Panic accuses Milosevic of sabotaging election bid THE third minister in three days yesterday resigned from Yugoslavia's federal government, in an apparent attempt to undermine Mr Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister. The move appears to have been engineered by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, who is known to have close ties with the three cabinet ministers. It seems to be aimed at discrediting the prime minister, whom Serbian nationalists have accused of betraying the country's interests, in the run-up to elections. Mr Panic is due to announce today whether he will stand against the Serbian president in the elections slated for December 20. He dismissed the resignations as 'a transparent attempt by Milosevic to undermine a government of reconciliation and hope, in a frenzied effort to stay in power at all costs'. The ebullient Belgrade-born Californian millionaire has won popularity for promising to end the war in Bosnia and lift UN sanctions. He ranks ahead of Mr Milosevic in the latest opinion polls. Western diplomats say the elections may tip the balance between war and peace in Serbia. Mr Milosevic is widely seen as most responsible for the wars in neighbouring Bosnia and Croatia. Mr Panic is the only candidate who can seriously challenge the Serbian president. Despite more than a year of war and economic collapse, hastened by sanctions, through his tight grip on state television, Mr Milosevic remains popular. Belgrade students collected the 10,000 signatures needed to put Mr Panic on the ballot just minutes before the midnight deadline on Sunday. He joined a list of candidates which include Mr Vuk Draskovic, an opposition leader, Mr Jezdimir Vasiljevic, a millionaire businessman, and Captain Dragan, a paramilitary leader. Fighting flared throughout Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday despite a partial truce agreed by Croat and Serb forces in the former Yugoslav republic. As the United Nations-brokered truce came into force, Serb fighters accused Croats and Moslems of using it to bring in arms and reinforcements. The ceasefire called for an end to cross-border shelling and the withdrawal from Bosnia of the Croatian army. Croatia until Saturday had denied the presence of its regular army units. The mainly Moslem Bosnian government did not sign the truce. Moslems, the republic's largest ethnic group, control only a few towns, which account for about 10 per cent of Bosnian territory. Belgrade radio reported fighting in Orasje, northern Bosnia, at the Croatian border. Sarajevo radio said Serb forces shelled Olovo, Tesanj and Doboj, northern Bosnia. It also said nearby Gradacac came under heavy shelling and an infantry attack on Sunday night. Meanwhile in Geneva, a report of the UN Human Rights Commission said Bosnian Serbs were of 'primary responsibility for the human tragedy' in Bosnia-Hercegovina.</p>

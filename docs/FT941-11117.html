			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Fashion: The global wardrobe in the office - London / Letting them know the secret code - Throughout the world you will encounter a set of codes: obvious yet obscure, simple but subtle, at dinner, on the beach, by the pool, the nuances of dress that tell the world one is IN or OUT. In a six-part series, FT writers describe the feeling. First: the office Spurred on by Beau Brummell, with his passion for black, white and grey, and his preference for trousers instead of breeches and silk stockings, British tailors invented the first office uniform. Like so much else the British dreamed up in the 19th century, it conquered the world. Unlike so much else, it has lasted. With some brave exceptions, such as the arts, the media and the sunrise industries, British men must still wear dark suits if they expect to be taken seriously in the professional and business worlds. Indeed, when one Californian software company opened a British operation and moved over its top sales team, it discovered that the reason it was doing no business was its employees' Silicon Valley uniform of jeans, white T-shirt and unstructured Armani jacket (or beat-up leather biker's blouson). Potential customers shied away and a wardrobe engineer was called in. The uniform has relaxed, however. Bright ties and braces - and even coloured shirts - are acceptable these days, and a chap may even remove his jacket to flaunt them. The pinstripe no longer predominates even in the City, although the paler the suit, the more likely the wearer is to be from one of the creative professions. In the queasy aftermath of the late 1980s, a wide-trousered, shiny-textured suit by any Italian designer is just too unpleasantly deja-vu. Savile Row conservatism had a pre-Lapsarian, comfort-blanket allure. Women, admitted to the office only at the turn of the century, have had a much harder time of it, adopting at first a version of the uniform of an upper servant, a housekeeper or a governess; a dark, strictly tailored dress or two-piece with crisp white cotton at collar and cuffs. Only the second world war allowed women in in greater numbers and more feminine dress. The coupons wouldn't run to a more appropriate wardrobe. More recently women have followed the Word from the US, where ambitious women adopted what the seminal wardrobe engineer, John T. Molloy, ineptly labelled 'the skirted suit'. It was a man's suit in all but one respect and could be softened only by a pussycat bow at the throat. Pioneering women executives, for whom it was important to stand out from the secretaries, did it with the jacket. They still do. In the British office the women with jobs rather than careers may wear sweaters and leggings or even jeans and an old T-shirt (British receptionists and secretaries are the scruffiest and most cheaply dressed in the world) but, even as fashion turns its back on hard lines and short skirts, most women feel securely competitive only in a power suit.</p>

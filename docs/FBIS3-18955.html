But the monthly poll, carried out by the BVA Institute for  the weekly PARIS-MATCH, also said that 57 percent thought  Balladur had the "qualities of a head of state" while 51 percent  considered he was "thinking too much about the presidential  election," due in May next year.    Questioned about the premier's calm, conciliatory style, 58  percent said they thought Balladur "tends to try to put the  French to sleep" and 56 percent believed he did not go far  enough with his reforms.    Fifty-three percent of those polled also believed that  Balladur was too ready to "appoint his friends to top jobs in  major enterprises."    The poll showed a two-point drop in 64-year-old Balladur's  overall popularity to 53 percent, but paradoxically, 63 percent  were dissatisfied with the way France is being governed, the  same figure as a month ago.    In another poll released Tuesday, Balladur dipped below 50  percent support in a popularity poll for the first time since he  came to power nearly a year ago.    A Gallup poll in the weekly EXPRESS said 47 percent of the  French approved Balladur's policies, a drop of five points from  a month ago.    Other polls since the beginning of February have shown falls  of nine or 10 points in his popularity.    Balladur and the leader of his own Rally for the Republic  (RPR) party, Jacques Chirac, are rivals to replace President  Francois Mitterrand when he steps down in May 1995.</p>

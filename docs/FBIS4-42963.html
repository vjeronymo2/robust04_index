			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovene President Milan Kucan by </F> correspondent Filippo Landi; place and date not given; Kucan  speaks in Slovene with superimposed translation into Italian --  recorded]    [Text] Among those countries that are keen to join the  European Community is Slovenia, which has recently had some  diplomatic disputes with Italy. Our correspondent, Filippo  Landi, asked the President of Slovenia Milan Kucan, if today  Slovenia considered Italy to be a hostile country. Let us hear  what he had to say:    [Kucan] It is difficult to think of hostility between one  state and another. Perhaps there are political orientations and  parties, or even single individuals who are hostile. At this  time it is difficult to evaluate official Italian policy with  regard to Slovenia. We must wait and see what Italy's position  will be and then we will decide.    [Landi] President, would you shake hands with a  representative of the Italian Government who was also a member  of the National Alliance?    [Kucan] For me shaking hands is a confirmation of the  respect, of the willingness to talk to a person. The sole fact  that an individual belongs to a different party, even if that  party is a fascist one, is not sufficient reason not to shake  hands.    [Landi] Slovenia wants to join the European Union, but in  that case why is not possible to put an end -- as Italy is  asking -- to the contentious dispute between the two countries,  which is a consequence of World War II.    [Kucan] I do not understand Italy's position. Here we are  talking about Slovenia joining the European Union. We must  satisfy all the criteria, even the economic ones, in order to  join Europe. We must also adhere to a general European policy.  What you are talking about refers to a question that concerns  only bilateral relations.</p>

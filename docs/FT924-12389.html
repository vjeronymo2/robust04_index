			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Israel has slim chance of separate deal with Syria SINCE he agreed to negotiations with Israel last year, Mr Hafez al Assad, the Syrian president, has repeated his motto, 'Jerusalem before the Golan', countless times. As the latest round of bilateral Middle East peace talks opens in Washington today Syria's solidarity with fellow Arabs will again be tested. Syria appears unlikely to renounce its insistence on Israeli withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, while Israel continues to demand bilateral peace treaties before the question of territory is addressed. In these circumstances - further complicated by the US presidential election  -Syrian officials have little hope of substantial progress in the new round of peace talks. At a meeting of Arab delegations to the peace conference in Amman at the weekend, Mr Farouk al-Shara'a, the Syrian foreign minister, reassured Palestinian representatives that his country was committed to a comprehensive peace agreement and that Damascus would not seek to regain its own Israeli-occupied territory and abandon the Palestinians. A message conveyed in Amman by Mr Amr Moussa, the Egyptian foreign minister who has acted as a mediator between the Arab delegations and the Israelis, to Mr al-Shara'a indicated a small amount of movement: the Israelis wished to receive a complete explanation of the Syrian phrase 'full peace' and would be willing to 'expand the territorial discussion'. Israel and Syria define 'peace' differently and hold incompatible interpretations of Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, the basis of the talks. Syrian officials in Damascus denied rumours which emerged during the last round of bilateral talks that Syria might be prepared to sign a separate peace treaty with Israel in exchange for a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights. President Assad was so angered by these allegations that he refused to meet Mr Yassir Arafat, the PLO chairman, after the latter said he feared the Syrians would betray the Palestinians in the peace talks. A separate peace with Israel is anathema to the Syrians: not only would it contradict two decades of Ba'athist rhetoric, it could destabilise Syria by reviving popular resentment over the country's participation in the anti-Iraq coalition during the Gulf war. Syrian officials say that Mr Assad hopes to mitigate the influence of fundamentalists by refusing to accept Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and demanding the return of all occupied territories. If Syria concedes on these points, says a well-placed Syrian official, 'there will be no containing the fundamentalists'. False hopes of progress arose during the last round after the Syrian delegation submitted a secret, nine-point document to the Israelis. A Syrian official said the Israelis wanted to discuss Syrian recognition of Israel while ignoring passages regarding Palestinian rights, the dismantling of Israeli settlements and Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territories.</p>

The body came to this conclusion after an inspection of the  safety of all nuclear and radiation-emanating installations in  the country carried out last year in accordance with Boris  Yeltsin's decision.    According to Gosatomnadzor, issues related to use of nuclear  power, materials and substances in both peaceful and defense  purposes are solved very slowly as they lack a legislative  basis. As a result, re-cycling or dumping spent nuclear fuel  alone will require considerable financial and material costs.    At present, as many as 29 nuclear reactors with total  capacity of 21242 Megawatt function in Russia, including 13  VVER, 11 RBMK-1000, 4 low-capacity EGP-6 and one fast neutron  BN-600. All these reactors were launched between 1971 and 1990,  except for the fourth reactor of the Balakovskaya nuclear power  station which was launched in 1993.    There were no serious accidents at nuclear power stations in  1993 which would lead to releasing significant amounts of  nuclear materials into the atmosphere or hazardous fires, except  for several instances of overheating. About half of the  accidents were caused by reckless maintenance of the equipment  by personnel.    Commenting on the state of the equipment, the committee  pointed out that the reactors were maintained according to the  safety requirements which were valid when the reactors were  launched. At the moment, the reactors fail to comply with the  modern safety requirements. The committee said the  first-generation reactors installed at such stations as  Novovoronezhskaya, Kolskaya, Leningradskaya, Kurskaya and  Bilibinskaya were designed before the basic documents on atomic  safety were released in Russia. Now they need drastic  reconstruction, and such work is being carried out. The first  and second reactors of the Novovoronezhskaya and Beloyarskaya  stations have been closed down to be subsequently dumped.    An analysis of the accidents which occurred in 1991-1993  showed a sharp aggravation of the situation at the Kolskaya  nuclear power station caused by poor maintenance and repair of  its equipment.    Gosatomnadzor also pointed out that spent nuclear fuel is  practically not taken out of the stations equipped with RBMK and  EGP reactors, while its removal from other stations is not fast  enough. The accumulation of spent nuclear fuel may cause a  situation when there is no free space to dispose of the  reactor's entire active area in an emergency as safety  requirements demand. At present, none of Russia's nuclear power  stations is equipped with the entire complex of installations  for dumping liquid and solid nuclear waste. The nuclear storage  facilities are filled to an average of 70% of capacity.  The  committee believes that the storage capacities may be exhausted  in 2-3 years, given the current speed of piling up nuclear waste.</p>

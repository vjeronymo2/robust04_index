			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Ovcharenko article: "One Good Turn Deserves </F> Another"]    [Text] It was back in Moscow that the "first warning  signal" was sounded. When the U.S. President came to our city,  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen briefed the U.S. press  traveling with Clinton and said: If the rate of inflation in  Russia remains just as crazy, I am afraid that there will be a  question mark over aid from across the ocean.    Quite little time has elapsed, and already the question of  aid has moved to quite a different level. I will remark,  however, that for those few days when the stir over Fedorov's  resignation was continuing, informed sources were saying:  America wants to see him as an "active player" and even  allegedly links the granting of aid with specific personalities.    To judge from the move which Lee Hamilton, chairman of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. Congress, made  recently, this really is so. Addressing the committee, he  declared the following: "Although I support aid for Russia and  am convinced of the need to give it, I will find it very hard to  say 'yes' to economic aid for Russia if the Central Bank  generously issues credits to large state enterprises in a few  months' time. If the Central Bank does not take tough measures  against inflation, it will escalate into hyperinflation and  reduce to naught all the efforts to assist Russia."    The competence of the trans-Atlantic legislators and their  desire to participate in the long-standing litigation between  the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance are undoubtedly  pleasant. [sentence as published] America's displeasure at the  fact that the new Russian Government consists of "conservatives"  is also obvious.    Maybe it is not worthwhile to pull the wool over everyone's  eyes: In allocating money, the U.S. Congress and Administration  themselves then put the brakes on it, falling short in their  gifts and payments. On the other hand, they lobby ardently for  politicians whom they love dearly. How can we disagree with  Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, who, having quit his ambassadorial  post in Washington, has already spoken out with no allowances  for diplomatic protocol: The Americans should refrain from  commenting on the composition of the government being formed.    It is indecent to exert such pressure, particularly as "not  everything is paid for." During his visit to Moscow, Bill  Clinton tried to persuade the Russians that he had "come as a  friend," not as a mentor. Evidently impressed by these words,  our president relaxed and failed to give him instructions to be  passed on to the Congress as to who should be approved as  secretary of defense -- after all, Perry advocates the  preservation of major military programs....</p>

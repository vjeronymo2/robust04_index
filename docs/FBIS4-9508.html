			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozef Moravcik, chairman of the Democratic </F> Union of Slovakia, by Maria Hluchanova and Jana Pankovcinova;  place and date not given: "The Fulfillment of Tasks Is More  Important Than a Dynamic Appearance"]    [Text] We asked to interview Jozef Moravcik, who was  elected chairman of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS) on  23 April.    [SME] Do you consider your being elected chairman as just a  formality, inasmuch as the first deputy chairman is to lead the  party?    [Moravcik] No, I believe it a very prudent technical  solution to the problem we encountered.    [SME] Why did the Saturday merger assembly decide on this  step?    [Moravcik] We felt that such a solution could be acceptable  to the coalition partners, and it guarantees efficient control  of the party.    [SME] By this measure, you have probably denied the  philosophy, according to which political leaders were not to be  in the Cabinet, on the basis of which the coalition government  was formed.    [Moravcik] Because I am not going to actually work as  chairman of DEUS, I consider it an acceptable compromise, even  with respect to this philosophy.    [SME] How are you going to explain to the voters that almost  the entire executive of the new party worked for a while at  Meciar's side in the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia?    [Moravcik] If we peruse the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia program from the time the movement emerged and consider  the people who created the movement, we cannot ever have such  feelings because the present Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  is something altogether different from the movement we then  organized.    [SME] How do you explain the increase in your popularity to  25 percent?    [Moravcik] I would understand it unequivocally as a  government preference. It means an endorsement of the idea with  which we formed the government. We will try not to disappoint  this confidence.    [SME] You have defined yourselves as a liberal entity. What  do you intend to do to succeed, and does a liberal party have  any chance in the context of what the Slovak voter has  experienced over the past five years?    [Moravcik] The emphasis on being a liberal party is not  important to us. The important part for us is that we promote  the program we call liberal and submit it to the voter for his  own assessment.</p>

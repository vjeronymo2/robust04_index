			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Dumping of D-rams alleged MICRON Technology, a US memory chip maker, has filed a dumping complaint against South Korean semiconductor makers, accusing them of selling memory devices in the US at less than their cost of production. The anti-dumping petition, which has been filed with the US Department of Commerce and the US International Trade Commission, will prompt the US agencies to investigate the allegations of dumping, which have been a matter of growing concern among US chip makers over the past two months. If dumping is proved, the US could impose dumping duties on Korean D-rams sold in the US. D-rams (Dynamic random access memory) are data storage chips, used in all types of computers and electronics equipment. Prices have fallen precipitously over the past year, as supply outstripped demand from the recession-plagued computer industry. 'Micron has compelling data that indicates that US laws are being violated,' said Mr Joe Parkinson, Micron chairman. The company claims to have obtained invoices and delivery documents to support its claim. Micron alleges that Hyundai Electronics and Goldstar Electron are worst offenders. The anti-dumping complaint applies, however, to all Korean D-ram producers, including Samsung, which last year became the world's leading producer of one megabit D-ram chips, with a 14 per cent share of the world market.</p>

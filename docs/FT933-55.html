			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei recovers from intraday decline below 20,000 FUTURES-linked selling took the Nikkei average below 20,000 at one point, but it recovered some ground on index-linked buying in the afternoon, agencies report from Tokyo. The Nikkei closed 95.31 lower at 20,077.41. It fell to a two-month low of 19,927.69 in mid-morning as initial declines set off unwinding of arbitrage-linked trade, and hit a high of 20,156.72 later in the day. Volume rose from 235m shares to 300m. Declines led advances by 625 to 368, with 200 issues unchanged, and the broader first section Topix index was down 5.21 at 1,617.86. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.74 to 1,246.99. The market's opening weakness defied hopes that investment trusts and government insurance and pension funds would continue to buy, as they did on Tuesday, to prop up the value of equities. Brokers said their presence was minimal. However, others said attention had simply moved elsewhere. 'The Nikkei's fall below 20,000 is not very significant, as investors are now focusing on trading incentive-backed issues that are not in the average,' commented Mr Masaharu Sakudo, managing director at Tachibana Securities. 'Buying from investment trusts', he added, 'was also limited to shares which are not in the Nikkei average.' News that major steel makers were considering giving extra days off to employees to cope with weak demand for steel depressed their share prices. Kawasaki Steel fell Y8 to Y303, NKK Y12 to Y263 and Kobe Steel Y9 to Y276. Retailers remained firm on hopes that possible income tax cuts and deregulation would benefit them. York-Benimaru climbed Y150 to Y4,650 and Ito-Yokado Y90 to Y5,540. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed, with Seoul and Karachi closed for public holidays. HONG KONG perceived late buying of property issues by US and Japanese funds which took the Hang Seng index up 80.60 to 7,551.10. Turnover grew from HKDollars 2.19bn to HKDollars 2.49bn. Henderson Land, which announced strong results last week, moved ahead 40 cents to HKDollars 23.50, while Cheung Kong advanced an adjusted 54 cents to HKDollars 27.30. AUSTRALIA picked up after a slow start, the All Ordinaries index ending 9.1 higher at 1,951.4 after some end-of-quarter window dressing. News Corp rose 12 cents to a closing high of ADollars 10.92 in volume of 4.38m shares. BHP added 16 cents at ADollars 16.16 after saying that it did not know whether its diamond mine project in Canada with a joint venture partner, Dia Met Minerals, would proceed. Development costs could be about USDollars 400m. MANILA surged at the close as investors flocked to Philippine Long Distance Telephone and Philippine National Bank after the sharp fall of the peso against the dollar. The market index rose 21.29 to 1,982.41. PLDT added 60 pesos at 1,480 pesos and PNB 17.50 at 352.50. NEW ZEALAND continued to consolidate, with some analysts predicting that the current quiet phase would continue until the November 6 election. The NZSE-40 Capital index closed 3.27 off at 1,926.68 in turnover of NZDollars 38m. TAIWAN saw selling of speculative stocks and pessimism over a lack of positive news. The weighted index lost 15.77 to 3,832.69 in slow turnover of TDollars 11.27bn ahead of today's public holiday. China Steel shed 60 cents to TDollars 17.80 on media reports that the government was again making plans to resume its privatisation of the company this fiscal year, although a timetable and details have not been decided. SINGAPORE was flat as the corporate reporting season headed for its close at the end of this week. The Straits Times Industrial index edged up 0.14 to 1,989.28. BOMBAY became nervous as the income tax authorities said they were seizing proxy held shares of a number of companies. The BSE-30 index declined 53.59 to 2,696.45. Four weeks ago, prices fell sharply after the tax authorities seized shares of nine companies which, they said, belonged to Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker who is at the centre of a securities scandal.</p>

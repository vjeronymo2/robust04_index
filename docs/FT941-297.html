			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (3): Small firms face the abyss - The Brokers In a small restaurant in the maze of busy streets behind the Tokyo stock exchange, Mr Yoshihiro Emoto has been selling eels for 45 years. The slippery fish are a rare delicacy for most Japanese - a taste to be indulged only when times are good. After four years of unparalleled austerity, in the first half of last year the restaurateur detected the first signs of renewed interest. But the recovery was short-lived and business has slowed again in the past six months. Mr Emoto says the current market is like a high-flying aircraft that has landed with a bump, but is now taxi-ing down the runway. He expects it to stop for repairs later this year, then take off again. 'It will probably take two to three years before full recovery. People just have to be patient.' Mr Emoto's auguries are confirmed by more orthodox indicators of market sentiment. None of them offers much comfort to the nervous occupants of Japan's overcrowded securities market. Average daily trading volumes on the Tokyo stock exchange were up by 34 per cent in the first half of the current financial year, averaging more than 400m shares a day - a far cry from the billion shares a day frenzy of the bubble years, but enough to prompt widespread optimism that the long dark night of Tokyo's stock market was over. But the rally dissipated and trading has settled back into its diffident pattern in the second half. The threat to the broking sector is transparent. The Big Four firms - Nomura, Daiwa, Yamaichi and Nikko - are sufficiently capitalised to withstand all but the most apocalyptic of trading conditions. But it is the more than 200 small and medium-sized firms - many of whom need sustained trading volumes of 400m shares a day or more simply to stay afloat - who now stare directly into the abyss. And the chronic dearth of equity business is compounded by two other factors: the overcapacity brought about by huge investment programmes during the bubble years; and the financial deregulation that threatens brokers' very existence. For the Big Four, last year marked a turning point. Having posted historic losses (Daiwa and Yamaichi) or minimal profits (Nikko and Nomura) in 1992-3, they all returned to healthy profits in the first half of 1993-4, buoyed by higher trading levels. Although the slump in the second half will cut earnings, Alicia Ogawa, securities analyst at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo estimates that the four will all report profits for the full year. Investors' continuing reluctance to revisit the scene of their losses in the past few years is forcing brokers to place more emphasis on quality. Last year, Nomura broke with Japan's tradition of coyness and became the first large broker to introduce a 'buy, sell, hold' formula for equities. But while more attention has been paid to the product, the Big Four have been slow to cut costs. Although employee numbers did fall by 9 per cent last year, most of that decline was the result of natural wastage. They may need to dig much deeper. The Big Four have one overwhelming advantage over their smaller rivals - a diversified business. In the past few years, Japan's tiny corporate bond market has been opened up and the country's corporations have turned away from their historic dependence on bank loans for finance. In the six months to September, new bond issues were 61 per cent higher than a year earlier. Unfortunately for the brokers, the lucrative fees for bond underwriting and distribution are the business in which they now face direct competition from the broking subsidiaries of banks established in the past year in the latest wave of financial deregulation. Although the inroads made by the banks are so far small, they will grow. If the Big Four can claim to be past the worst, the rest of the broking sector expect the ordeal to continue. Despite aggressive cost-cutting, the selling, general and administration costs are still above operating revenues. Many of the brokers are saddled with huge investments from the years of plenty. Kankaku Securities is a classic middle-tier company. In the late 80s it had grandiose aims of challenging the Big Four. Huge capital projects were commissioned, including - most ambitiously - a vast computer centre 30 miles from Tokyo. Last year, the computer centre was sold, unused, a monument to the hubris of the bubble years. As the president, Mr Akihiro Ieda, says: 'Most of the smaller firms have relied too heavily on equities. The key to survival is to diversify.' The rare success stories have been those firms with a more balanced portfolio. Kokusai Securities consciously emulated the Big Four - only 31 per cent of its revenues now derive from stock commissions. The other two thirds come chiefly from bond commissions and trading income. 'We are the perfect tripod', says Mr Yoshitaka Matsutani, the company's president. 'A tripod cannot function unless all three legs are the same length.' Most firms were not so prescient. While stock commissions account for about one third of the Big Four's business, most smaller and medium-size firms still have more than half their business tied up in equities. Time is running out. Last year's recurring loss at Kankaku was equivalent to nearly 4 per cent of its capital; typical of the losses companies face. And the competition from the subsidiaries of banks is slowly eroding the extra ground available. The constant threat of the failure of smaller brokers continues to exercise the minds of the regulators at the Ministry of Finance. Most of the threatened companies are linked financially to their larger competitors or to banks. The demise of Cosmo Securities last year may provide the model for any future failures. The finance ministry, fearing systemic collapse, prevailed upon Daiwa Bank, which owned 5 per cent of Cosmos, to rescue the broker. But with liabilities of their own, would-be rescuers are expressing their alarm to the finance ministry. As a senior executive of Nomura put it: 'We understand the ministry's position, but in these difficult circumstances, we cannot do anything that is against the interests of Nomura's shareholders'. Brave words in the comfortable land of the hypothetical. They may not be repeated with such confidence, however, should the crisis come and the Big Four find themselves staring down the barrel of the finance ministry's celebrated administrative guidance.</p>

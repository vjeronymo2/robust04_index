			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Neste reports sharp downturn NESTE, the Finnish state-owned oil and petrochemicals group, reported a sharp downturn in profits for 1991, and blamed the poor performance on its chemicals division. Group profit (before extraordinary items, reserves and taxes) plummeted to FM478m (Dollars 105.2m), from FM2.41bn in the previous year. Net sales rose by 13.7 per cent to FM53.03bn, from FM46.63bn. Neste said its chemicals division suffered from the sharp fall in international prices which resulted from a downturn in the world economy and the increase in capacity in the petrochemicals and plastics industries. The group said there had been no sign of a recovery in prices. The chemicals division is Neste's second largest business area with sales of FM8.87bn. Oil operations, the group's largest business area with sales of FM42.74bn, showed 'a satisfactory result, despite the drop in oil consumption in Finland and increased competition following the deregulation of oil imports'. Neste does not release separate profit or loss figures for the individual divisions, but said its gas, shipping, and exploration and production divisions all reported increased profits compared with the 1990 figures. The state-owned group is being prepared for privatisation, although a date for the sale of shares has not been fixed.</p>

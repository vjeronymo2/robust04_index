			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / British Steel to raise many prices in April BRITISH STEEL plans to increase prices in April for some of its main products, in its most determined attempt yet to halt the fall in steel prices that has affected its profits over the past two years. The company said yesterday that it would be raising prices by between 3 per cent and 4 per cent for its main strip-mill products, which are mainly produced at its south Wales plants at Llanwern and Port Talbot. The move to raise basic prices for those products follows its decision to withdraw price discounts of about 5 per cent from the turn of the year. The increases are an attempt by British Steel to put a floor under steel prices in advance of expected sharp increases in costs, particularly raw materials, in the rest of the year. The company expects that by the end of the year its costs will be 15 per cent higher than they were in 1989, while selling prices have fallen sharply. The price of hot-rolled coil, the most basic strip-mill product, has fallen by 28 per cent to about Pounds 170 a tonne since 1989, while the price of a tonne of hot-dip galvanised steel has fallen by 32.5 per cent to Pounds 260 a tonne. The severe cost-price squeeze was one of the factors behind the company's announcement last week that it will close the last two blast furnaces at its Ravenscraig plant in Scotland by September. British Steel yesterday won the European Commission's approval to acquire two small German steel stockholders, August Degels Eisengrosshaendel and Spaltbank, which will give British Steel about 10 per cent of the German coated-steel stockholding market.

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Kwik Save advances 22% and steps up expansion programme KWIK SAVE, the discount grocery chain, lifted interim pre-tax profits by 22 per cent as it stepped up its aggressive store opening programme. Mr Graeme Seabrook, chief executive, said there was still plenty of room for growth in the UK. 'Research indicates that less than 50 per cent of the population has access to Kwik Save stores,' he said 'We will be opening one store a week over the next three years.' In April, the company spent Pounds 26.5m on buying 42 stores in north-east England from Gateway, 32 of which will be transformed into the Kwik Save format and the rest into Tates Lateshopper outlets. The group will also open a further 25 stores before the end of the year bringing the total number of Kwik Save stores to about 730. In the 28 weeks to March 9, pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 39.51m to Pounds 48.13m as sales rose strongly from Pounds 785.32m to Pounds 912.71m. The company said it had benefited from the extension of scanning which now covers over 90 per cent of sales volumes and is expected to cover all sales by the year end. The development of scanning has allowed the company to widen the margins on grocery products by broadening its product range. However, increased sales of liquor and tobacco - which have thinner margins than grocery products - meant that overall gross margins remained static. The company also announced that it was buying back the Liquorsave concessions in its stores from Argyll Group. This will give Kwik Save an additional 240 concessions in its stores to add to its 375 existing Best of Cellars outlets. Earnings per share rose by 23 per cent to 20.72p (16.82p). The interim dividend is lifted by 16 per cent to 4.3p (3.7p). COMMENT While the likes of J Sainsbury and Tesco have been slugging it out at the top of the grocery market, Kwik Save has simply and successfully got on with the job of consolidating the bottom of the heap. Although its stores may not look as fancy as those of its giant competitors, the company's financial attractions are in many ways far greater. Kwik Save's margins are undoubtedly thin but its asset turnover is considerable enabling it to achieve the best return on capital in the food retailing sector - at about 35 per cent. Much has been made of the threat posed by the arrival in the UK of the continental discount operators, Netto and Aldi, but so far the threat has largely failed to materialise. Together they still have only 25 stores and appear to have missed some opportunities to expand significantly in size. Kwik Save itself may look to take advantage of Budgens' current unfortunate predicament but the company's line is that it is only interested in an acquisition at the right price - and it does not look as though Budgens has yet fallen into that range. Assuming pre-tax profits of over Pounds 103m, the shares on a prospective multiple of 13 are still looking pretty cheap.</p>

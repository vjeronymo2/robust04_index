			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / Survey of Wales (2): Cardiff has much to offer - Financial services AT THE start of July, Hayter Brockbank, a specialist in marine insurance, chose Cardiff for the headquarters of an operation to expand its marine- and car-insurance business through direct sales, a rapidly expanding sector of the insurance market. The decision, which will mean the creation of about 250 jobs in the Welsh capital, has been described by Mr Robert Ashmead, director of the financial services initiative run by the Welsh Development Agency, as the most significant move in financial services in Wales in the past three and a half years. The move, he added, 'confirms our view that Cardiff, in particular, and south east Wales, in general, has the strength to become a very important player in the financial sector. 'Cardiff has a magnificent location in its docklands, now being developed in a coherent way, and the decision by NCM Insurance Services to move into a very large building in Cardiff Bay, as well as Prudential's decision to site a regional headquarters in the city, has started to create critical mass.' The financial services initiative was set up four years ago by Lord Walker when, as Mr Peter Walker, he was secretary of state for Wales. He was anxious to develop the attractions of south-east Wales as a site for the then rapidly-growing financial services sector. He saw financial services as an essential element in the new Wales which had emerged from the shadow of steel and coal. South Wales, and particularly the Newport area, had already had a degree of success in attracting newcomers even before the Walker initiative. TSB had located its trust arm in the town, next to the Patent Office. AA Insurance was in Cardiff, and all the major accountants were also in the Welsh capital. Lord Walker devolved the task of running the financial services initiative, which was a joint operation among local authorities in the area and the agency, on to the WDA, but he also played a very close part himself in getting the scheme off the ground. An important success for the initiative has been the decision by N M Rothschild to open a full branch in Cardiff, apart from Manchester, where the first Rothschild began in business, the only city in which the merchant bank has operations outside the City of London. It was Walker's contacts with the bank, and in particular with Sir Michael Richardson, the former managing director, whom he talked into seeing the commercial advantages of operating in Cardiff, which brought Rothschilds to the Welsh city. SOUTH WALES has always had a small financial sector by comparison with regional centres such as Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds and even nearby Bristol, not to mention Edinburgh. Standard Chartered, whicn through its Chartered Trust subsidiary acquired the former Julian Hodge loan finance operations, was an early arrival, with the establishment in the late 1960s of the Bank of Wales, now fully owned by the Bank of Scotland, another milestone. AA Insurance opened in 1977, followed by Chemical Bank which arrived in 1983. It has since passed on its mortgage business in Cardiff to Banque Nationale de Paris, while retaining its other Cardiff operations. The Julian Hodge name, synonymous for many years with financial services in Cardiff, survives in the Julian Hodge Bank, which provides a range of personal and merchant banking services. A further wave of new arrivals built quickly in the late 1980s. National Provident Institution transferred its group pensions business from Tunbridge Wells in 1988; Sedgwick James came in 1990; stockbrokers Bell Lawrie White, part of Hill Samuel, were a 1989 arrival while more recently the German-owned insurance company DAS, pensions consultants Noble Lowndes and French owned Axa have all arrived. The result, according to Mr Brian Morgan, chief economist at the WDA, is that there has been a very encouraging rise in the numbers employed in this sector. 'This is important because improved links between the industrial and financial sectors are likely to be vital in the early stages of the economy's recovery.' Mr David Lewis, deputy managing director of Willis Corroon (Wales) concurs: 'Our expansion in the past five years has been dramatic,' he says, 'and it is symptomatic of what is happening here. 'Companies have been keeping their heads down over the past year but there is plenty of expansion waiting for the moment to go.' Willis Corroon is part of that expansion. Five years ago it had 19 staff. Now it numbers more than 70, and, in addition to Cardiff, it now has offices in Swansea and Haverfordwest. As the UK economy has tumbled even further into recession, though, there is evidence that it is becoming increasingly more difficult to attract companies into Wales. Dr Gwyn Jones, chairman of the WDA, says: 'There is still a lot of interest in south Wales as a home for financial-services companies, but it is certainly hard to bring in more.' His solution is to broaden the scope of the financial services initiative to focus on those areas in particular where Wales has a definite competitive advantage over other parts of Britain. Mr Ashmead spells it out: 'Instead of going out and saying what a wonderful place Wales is, as we did originally, we have now taken the institutions, divided them into their sectors and are looking at the problems and issues, facing them individually. 'We can then go to a sector and offer a solution for their problem. Financial-services businesses operate on the bottom line. The quality-of-life approach may be important, and it has a role to play, but what is important to any company thinking of relocating to Wales is what will happen to the figures.' He believes that Wales's advantages, which include a large untapped pool of labour, especially among married women in the 25-40 age bracket returning to work, good educational standards, a willingness to adapt to new techniques and property at reasonable prices are the factors that now determine decision making. 'This is the bottom line,' he says, 'and this is what will sway a company towards making a move to Wales.' He argues that Wales's strengths will be helped by the willingness companies now have to accept that the front and back offices do not have to be in the same building. 'For years, firms were reluctant to think the two could be divorced.' he says. 'Now they not only accept the divorce but are actively looking to ways to implement it. 'We have shown in Wales that we can be the perfect base for back-office operations. We have also shown that in the retail sector of financial services this is a very good centre. Mr Nicholas Markovits, manager of Venture Link Investors, a privately-owned venture capital group which has set up a fund to provide equity capital for unquoted companies, and product development finance, sees the future as bright. 'The demand for venture capital is not much down on last year, considering the state of the economy,' he says, 'and we are in place to do good business once there is a pickup.' That is the general consensus. Wales is well placed, it is generally agreed, to develop its nascent financial services industry.</p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICAN CHURCHES LABEL APARTHEID A SIN  </P> <P> Black and white leaders of 90 of South Africa's Christian churches, concluding  their first conference in nearly 30 years, joined Friday to reject apartheid as  a sin and confess their own role in fostering segregation.  </P> <P> The action was largely a symbolic gesture because each of the participating  denominations, including the Dutch Reformed Church, has made similar statements  individually in recent years.  </P> <P> The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church, whose 1.5 million members  represent nearly 40% of all white South Africans, for years played an important  role in justifying the ruling National Party's racial segregation policies.  </P> <P> But, in a historic declaration in 1986, it acknowledged that apartheid is a  mistake and that racism is a sin.  </P> <P> The final communique from the weeklong church conference in Rustenburg,  northwest of Johannesburg, also recommended that the government remove all  apartheid laws, establish a transitional government, return land taken from  blacks and arrange an affirmative action program for blacks.  </P> <P> The Rev. Pieter Potgieter, leader of the Dutch Reformed Church delegation, said  his church accepted "the great majority of the very lovely sentiments" in the  final communique. But he added that his group could not endorse the political  recommendations, some of which the government strongly opposes, without  consulting church members.  </P> <P> "It is not for us to prescribe particular solutions to the government or  anybody else," he said.  </P> <P> Although the Dutch Reformed Church is the largest Afrikaner church, President  Frederik W. de Klerk and several key members of his Cabinet belong to a much  smaller and more politically liberal Afrikaner denomination, the Reformed  Church. That denomination formally declared apartheid a sin 25 years ago.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, police said Friday that 17 people have been killed in a fresh spasm  of political violence among black factions in South African townships, 16 of  them Thursday night in a battle in Natal province between supporters of Nelson  Mandela's African National Congress and backers of the Zulu-based Inkatha  Freedom Party.  </P></p>

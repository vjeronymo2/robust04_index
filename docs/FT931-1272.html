			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Cristiani accused over amnesty MR Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, yesterday accused the El Salvador authorities ofreneging on a UN-brokered peace settlement by granting amnesty for crimes committed in the 12-year civil war. The UN chief chided President Alfredo Cristiani for failing to fulfil a pledge to send an envoy to New York with a timetable for implementing proposals published last week by a three-member international commission. The commission called for the removal of 15 senior military officers cited as among the worst violators of human rights, including General Rene Emilio Ponce, the defence minister. The army high command is incensed and says it will offer a legal challenge to the report. The US has told Mr Cristiani it will not release further military aid until the purge is completed.</p>

			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / UK Company News: New sites help Frost to 30% growth FROST GROUP, the biggest independent petrol retailer in the UK, boosted profits and turnover sharply in the face of a 2 per cent fall in the industry's first half sales. Pre-tax profits rose by 30 per cent, from Pounds 2.57m to Pounds 3.34m. Turnover advanced by 59 per cent, from Pounds 51.5m to Pounds 81.8m. Mr John Murgatroyd, group finance director, said that sales volume had risen following the opening of 22 new sites in the first half. The group, which was floated in October 1991 with 79 sites, had 148 at the end of June, mainly in the Midlands and the north of England. A further 35 purchases were under negotiation. 'We said on flotation that we were looking for 250 sites by 1997. It looks as if we will achieve that much earlier,' he said. Mr James Frost, chairman, said the strong performance owed a lot to the large number of site acquisitions and to the ability to bring them on stream very quickly and to good effect. 'I would expect the same pattern to apply to the second half of the year', he told shareholders. The introduction of the Smilies concept of corner shop selling had gone well to date and should be completed by the year-end. Interest payable was Pounds 200,000 (nil) as borrowings rose to Pounds 5.7m at the end of June. Margins had been squeezed by the fight for market share as overall petrol and diesel sales fell. The group now expected the market to increase through more new car sales and falling unemployment, and believed itself well placed to take advantage of any upturn from 1994 and onwards. The group operates its sites through licensees, who pay a fee to run and take the profits from forecourt shops. Mr Murgatroyd said that the current spend in the shops was Pounds 76 for every 1,000 litres of fuel sold, but the figure was 'growing rapidly.' Earnings per share rose to 4.3p (3.5p) and the interim dividend is stepped up to 2.2p (1.8p).</p>

Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that a final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a rule may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. This analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital that is located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has fewer than 50 beds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, this regulation is technical in nature and merely updates the display of currently valid control numbers assigned by the Office of Management and Budget to collections of information contained in HCFA regulations. Therefore, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this final rule will not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Accordingly, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking and Delay in Effective Date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We ordinarily publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and invite prior public comment on the proposed rule. The proposed rule includes a reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and the terms of substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved. In addition, section 1871 of the Social Security Act (the Act) generally requires a 60-day public comment period. However, this procedure can be waived when an agency finds good cause that a notice-and-comment procedure is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and incorporates a statement of the finding and its reasons in the rule issued.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We routinely publish a notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  when an information collection requirement clearance request that is identified in a rule or notice is submitted to OMB and the public is offered an opportunity to comment. This regulation is technical in nature and merely updates the display of OMB-assigned control numbers of approved collection of information requirements contained in HCFA regulations text. Therefore, it would be redundant and provide an unnecessary delay to solicit comments on this display of the approved OMB control numbers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the above reasons, we find good cause to waive both proposed notice and comment rulemaking procedure and a delay in the effective date as impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest. Under these circumstances publication of the correct up-to-date rules without further delay best serves those governed by these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

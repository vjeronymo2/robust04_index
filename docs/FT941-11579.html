			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: 'Up-country' board for Thai SE The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) is expected to launch a new 'up-country board' for provincial companies this month with the planned listing of a palm oil company. Chumporn Palm Oil Industry Public Co said yesterday it was the first company to receive preliminary approval from the SET. The new category of companies, equivalent to the second board in other countries, has less stringent conditions for capital and successive years of profit than the main board. The Securities and Exchange Commission said two companies had already been approved and a further four or five were in the pipeline. Stockbrokers say foreign institutional investors are likely to be interested only in the larger companies on the provincial board, because the shares of the smaller ones will be difficult to buy or sell in large enough amounts. 'We hope that this is the start of a trend that will open up opportunities for other established up-country firms to gain access to the stock market,' Chumporn Palm said in a statement. 'The public offering will allow CP Palm to lower its funding costs as we continue to expand production of palm oil and kernel oil.' The company made a profit of Bt112m (Dollars 4.4m) in 1993 on revenues of Bt430m.</p>

			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Goode Durrant rises after realignment Shares in Goode Durrant rose by 10p to 151p yesterday after the industrial holding company said improvements resulting from the realignment of activities were beginning to show through. Pre-tax profits jumped from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 4.29m in the six months to October 31 including a Pounds 400,000 exceptional credit from the sale of the Laidlaw motor distribution subsidiary to Quicks last June. Sales fell from Pounds 90.6m to Pounds 58.1m mainly due to the sale. Mr Michael Waring, chief executive, said that Northgate, the core commercial vehicle hire business, had doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 3m. Utilisation rates had increased marginally to 92 per cent, and rates had firmed as customers, who were overwhelmingly business users, increased their activity levels. Northgate had successfully integrated two small acquisitions announced in October, Trukvan Rental and Bowey Hire. It was a priority to extend the network nationally, both organically and by acquisition. The equipment hire division made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 279,000, compared with a loss of Pounds 174,000 previously, and the Ravenstock business had returned to profit. Rawlings, the housebuilding and construction business which has been earmarked for disposal, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 134,00, compared with a Pounds 179,000 loss. Earnings per share to rose 5.8p (2.3p). Stripping out the exceptional, earnings rose to 5p. The interim dividend is increased to 2.2p (2.15p).</p>

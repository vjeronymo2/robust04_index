			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rocio Galvan] </F>   [Text] Tijuana, Baja California, 16 May--The Attorney  General's Office (PGR) will put up for sale all the properties  seized here from the Arellano Felix brothers and "Chapo Guzman,"  through public auctions to be held for two weeks starting this  Tuesday. This announcement was made today by the spokesman for  the department's local office, Jesus Velasco.    He remarked that, according to a report from the General  Directorate for Control of Confiscated Goods, the seized assets  range from real properties to luxury cars, and household items.    He gave a reminder that they were seized from the drug  traffickers Arellano Felix and "Chapo Guzman" after the murder  of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo.    He noted that, during the first auction, held on 3 May, only  one house was sold; hence, this Tuesday, both individuals and  corporate bodies may take part in the sale of these properties,  located in various parts of Tijuana.    He specified that the residences for sale this Tuesday, 17  May, are located in the Monte Bello subdivision, Colonia  Reforma, La Gloria, La Mesa, Playas de Tijuana, and Lomas de  Aguacaliente.    He explained that persons interested in purchasing any of  the  properties should submit a single bid in a sealed envelope,  accompanied by a 10 percent downpayment, to the PGR's account.    The first call for bids includes the furnishings of 110  houses, such as furniture in general and office equipment,  linens, and both electronic and decorative articles, he remarked.    Finally, he announced that, next week the date, time, and  place for the auction of 30 confiscated vehicles would be  posted. Prominent among them are a pickup truck, a van, dump  trucks, two Mercedes-Benz cars, and a Ford LTD convertible.</p>

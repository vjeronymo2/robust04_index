			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Minister dismisses wider aid-for-arms allegations Allegations that Britain's overseas aid programme was linked to arms deals with several countries were dismissed as 'absolute nonsense' by Mr Alastair Goodlad, Foreign Office minister of state, last night. He told the Commons that its foreign affairs committee should be left to deal with claims that a contract to sell Pounds 1bn of arms to Malaysia was won because the UK gave Pounds 234m aid for building the Pergau hydro-electric dam. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, is due to give evidence to the committee today. Sir David Steel, foreign affairs spokesman for the Liberal Democrats, highlighted the role of Baroness Thatcher, when prime minister, in seeking to expand British trade with Malaysia. He said her 'close circle' had been involved. 'In this case Sir Tim Bell, well known as her public relations adviser, is also adviser to the Malaysian prime minister and to Tan Sri Armugam, who controls GEC Malaysia, heavily involved in several of the contracts under the deal.' A Liberal Democrat motion asserting that the Pergau dam allegations had 'seriously undermined the credibility of the British aid programme' was defeated by a government majority of 146 (305-159). Mr Goodlad also condemned suggestions that British companies which contributed to Conservative party funds had been the main beneficiaries of contracts arising from overseas aid and trade deals. Mr Tom Clarke, shadow minister for overseas aid, accused Mr Goodlad of attempting to deal with the Pergau dam issue almost as an aside. Mr Richard Needham, the trade minister, said only 1.2 per cent of the aid budget would be allocated to the dam in any single year. He warned that the 'distortions of some sections of the press' and the attacks made by opposition MPs on Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand could put jobs at risk.</p>

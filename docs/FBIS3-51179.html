			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ambassadors of the four countries friendly to  Haiti are soliciting the Army's collaboration in facilitating  the distribution of fuel. The diplomats, representing the United  States, France, Canada, and Venezuela, invited General Cedras to  create an adequate environment within the framework of the  implementation of the humanitarian operation.    Specifying in a letter that they were not soliciting  security  assistance, the four expressed a desire for the full cooperation  of the authorities charged with security in order that the staff  in charge of this agreement may encounter no obstacle in  accomplishing its tasks. A clear warning was therefore sent. Any  obstacle to the distribution of humanitarian fuel would hinder  the ability of the international community to send food and  medications to the most deprived population, reads this letter  from the four ambassadors to Gen. Cedras.    The Army responded to the Group of Four. Regarding full  cooperation concerning the distribution of the fuel, Gen. Cedras  referred the Group of Four diplomats to the government. Such  cooperation, writes the Army chief, can be defined and ordered  only by the government, which will give the necessary  instructions to the specialized services of public  administration, unquote. [no beginning quote as heard] Gen.  Cedras, however, promised security for the unloading and  distribution of the fuel. The Army could not escape its  essential duties of maintaining order and assuring public  safety, he writes in answer to the letter from the ambassadors  of the four friendly countries.</p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> PLEASURE FAIRE FINDS A HOME  </P> <P> The San Bernardino County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted today to  approve holding the Renaissance Pleasure Faire this spring in the county's Glen  Helen Regional Park, 55 miles from downtown Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The event will take place on the 1,425-acre site for seven consecutive weekends  beginning May 13, organizers said. The park, northwest of the City of San  Bernardino, is south of the intersection of Interstates 15 and 215.  </P> <P> Forced to find a new location after its longtime site in Agoura was purchased  by a developer, the Faire had attempted to move to eastern Ventura County. But  organizers withdrew their application after residents objected to the increased  traffic the event would bring.  </P></p>

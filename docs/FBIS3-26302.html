			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, February 5 (XINHUA) -- A Chinese Foreign  Ministry spokesman said here today that the setback in  Sino-Burkina Faso relations is not what the Chinese side wishes  to see, and the responsibility for it rests entirely with the  Government of Burkina Faso.    On February 2, the Government of Burkina Faso, in disregard  of the long-standing friendly relations and cooperation between  China and Burkina Faso, announced the so-called "restoration" of  "diplomatic relations" with Taiwan, the spokesman said, adding  that the Chinese Government has lodged a strong protest with the  Government of Burkina Faso and announced the suspension of  diplomatic relations with Burkina Faso and cessation of  implementation of all agreements between the two governments.    In recent years, the spokesman pointed out, the Taiwan  authorities, taking advantage of the temporary economic  difficulties of some countries, have gone out of their way to  pursue "money diplomacy" in an attempt to create "two Chinas" or  "one China, one Taiwan".    This indecent trick, he noted, goes entirely against the  fundamental interest of the Chinese nation and is bound to meet  the opposition of the people on both sides of the Taiwan straits.    "The scheme of the Taiwan authorities is doomed to failure,"  he said.</p>

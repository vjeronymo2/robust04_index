			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [REUTER/YONHAP from Vienna] </F>   [Text] REUTER news agency has reported that it is unlikely  that an International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] inspection  team will soon enter North Korea to witness the changing of fuel  rods at North Korea's nuclear reactor in Yongbyon.    Denying ROK media reports that an advance team would leave  for North Korea over the weekend, spokesman Kyd said those  reports are groundless. Spokesman Kyd admitted that the advance  team did prepare to leave for North Korea. However, since North  Korea has not responded to a list of IAEA inspections so far,  chances are slim that the team would arrive in North Korea by 28  April, he added.</p>

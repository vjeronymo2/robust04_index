			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: CWS knocked by interest charges THE RESCUE of a struggling regional co-operative and a 'tough' trading climate pushed profits at Co-operative Wholesale Society, the UK's biggest farmer and a significant force in retailing, down 63 per cent last year. The CWS is the main supplier for the whole co-operative movement and is now the largest co-operative retailer, as well as having interests in food manufacturing and milk distribution, travel, and funeral services. Profits after exceptional items and interest for the year to January 9 fell from Pounds 13.8m to Pounds 5m, in spite of an increase in total turnover from Pounds 3.14bn to Pounds 3.25bn, with a rise in retail sales from Pounds 2.61bn to Pounds 2.83bn. While trading profit rose slightly to Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 51.7m), and the Pounds 12.7m of exceptional items - to cover continuing redundancy and rationalisation and provisions against property development work in progress  -were little changed from last year's Pounds 12.6m, interest charges rose from Pounds 25.4m to Pounds 34.5m. This stemmed largely from increased borrowings after the CWS stepped in to rescue the Greater Nottingham Society, which acquired the loss-making ELS furniture chain, which later went into receivership. The CWS agreed to merge with the society, and inherited debts and winding-up costs for ELS of more than Pounds 100m.</p>

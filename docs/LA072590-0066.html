The ruling appeared to be the first under new state emergency  regulations that stops logging that threatens the northern spotted owl.  Louisiana-Pacific spokesman Shep Tucker said he expects "some precedent" to be  set in the lawsuit, filed by environmentalists as part of a campaign to stop  the lumber company from logging in the Navarro Ridge area, 10 miles south of  Mendocino.  </P></p>

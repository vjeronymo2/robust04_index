			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HIGH PROFILE FOR A HERO OF THE MASSES  </P> <P> Odds are, if you were to make an anonymous phone call to anyone anywhere in the  United States, the person answering would know about the film "Batman." They  could also tell you that it stars Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton and is  scheduled to open this month.  </P> <P> Although "Batman's" producer Warner Bros. will not reveal research figures,  studio officials claim the movie's awareness level is higher than any film in  the studio's history, even higher, they contend, than pre-opening awareness of  Columbia Pictures' 1984 release of the first "Ghostbusters" which became the  highest-grossing comedy of all time at $220 million.  </P> <P> Of course it would be difficult to miss the "Batman" promos.  </P> <P> Anyone who has seen a movie in the last six months has probably caught a  glimpse of the 30-second trailers, screening widely since Christmas.  </P> <P> "We have heavy cable television penetration here," said Jack Major, features  editor of the Providence Journal in Rhode Island. "You can't even turn to a  station without seeing 'Batman' commercials and interviews and film clips."  </P> <P> "I was talking to a comic book dealer in Texas," said Maggie Thompson,  co-editor of the Iola, Wis.-based Comic Buyer's Guide weekly, "and he said,  'You remember smily faces and hula hoops? "Batman" is a hula hoop.' You don't  have to be a comic book fan right now to want 'Batman' material. This  phenomenon has grown to a level unlike anything we've seen before."  </P> <P> Like a dark Santa Claus carrying a bag full of merchandising goodies, "Batman"  is swooping into shopping centers and landing on the chests of thousands of  T-shirt buyers across the country. Thompson said when she received a  special-order 'Batman' catalogue last month, it was as thick as the one that  lists comic book material and merchandise for the entire industry.  </P> <P> "We sell 36 different kinds of 'Batman' shirts," said Bill Liebowitz, owner of  Golden Apple Comics shop on Los Angeles' Melrose Avenue. "We got a call from a  woman in Florida who ordered a shirt because she felt it would make her son  more popular at school. Another woman came in and bought a shirt for her son  who had heard about 'Batman' in the Philippines."  </P> <P> In a six-day period, Liebowitz sold out nine cases -- almost 7,000 individual  packets -- of "Batman" bubble gum cards.  </P> <P> Recently, Liebowitz has hired a security guard and doubled his staff on  weekends to handle the crowd overflow that jams his store.  </P> <P> Out on the streets the mania is the same. Since May, more than 1,200,  6-foot-high "Batman" posters have been stolen from display cases in New York  subway stations and bus shelters in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and St.  Louis.  </P> <P> "This is a first. We've had posters stolen before -- Paramount's U2 'Rattle and  Hum' was a target," said Doreen Roberts, vice president and general sales  manager of Gannett Transit billboard company. "But never like this. This is  unheard of."  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> Comic Buyer's Guide reports that Batman back issues that were almost impossible  to sell just a few years ago at any price are selling briskly and prices are  climbing rapidly.  </P> <P> " 'Batman: The Dark Knight Returns' is going for $35 for a first printing,"  Thompson said. "That came out three years ago with a cover price of $2.95. The  Batman issue in which Robin died is now selling for $30. That came out less  than a year ago with a cover price of 75 cents."  </P> <P> In 1984, "Uncanny X-Man," the perennial comic book leader for nearly a decade,  averaged $378,135 in paid circulation. In the same year, "Batman" averaged  $89,217. Although figures are difficult to confirm, every retailer interviewed  claims that "Batman" has recently overtaken "X-Man" and is now the top-selling  comic book title. And they attribute much of that success to the upcoming film.  </P> <P> "A lot of times I'm conservative, because when these science fiction or comic  movies come out, they don't really do anything for business," said Paul  Castrovillo, owner of New Mythology Comics and Science Fiction in Boise, Ida.  "I probably could have sold four or five times as much 'Batman' material as I  ordered, but I had to order most of it three or four months ago when  information about the movie was just beginning to leak out."  </P> <P> Boise deejay Jack Armstrong, whose station KF95 is supporting a "Batman" art  contest that Castrovillo is sponsoring, said listener reaction has been high.  "Comments have been pouring in from callers ever since we started playing  Prince's Batman dance song. . . . People call in and want to know things like:  'Does this movie happen after the death of Boy Wonder? Is it before Boy Wonder?  Is this a continuation of the comic book?' "  </P> <P> About five months ago, Los Angeles' KTTV Channel 11 began broadcasting  "Batman," starring Adam West and Burt Ward, on Saturdays and Sundays from 1  p.m. to 2 p.m. Program director Don Tillman denied the suggestion that "Batman"  was put on the air to capitalize on renewed interest created by the movie.  </P> <P> "We've owned 'Batman' for a number of years, and the reason we brought it back  is because we're doing a lot of nostalgic programming on weekends," Tillman  said.  </P> <P>  -- --  </P> <P> If there's any doubt that the world is anticipating "Batman," it seems clear  that Warner Bros. is anticipating the world.  </P> <P> Anyone who calls New York's DC Comics -- owned by the studio's parent company,  Warner Communications Inc. -- with "Batman" questions are immediately connected  to a prerecorded "Batline."  </P> <P> "We have been inundated with phone calls, so we have set up this phone message  for your convenience," a voice cheerily states. After referring all inquiries  to Warner Bros., the voice continues, "Please be patient. Studio personnel are  doing their best to handle requests. Please do not call us back for  intervention, even though you might wish to."  </P> <P> A follow-up call to Warner Bros. connects the caller to another pre-recorded  message asking for a name and number where the caller can be reached.  </P> <P> "We have to do that because of the sheer volume of phone calls we receive,"  said Charlotte Gee, Warner Bros. vice president of publicity and promotion.  "Our New York office got a call last week from a member of the public who  offered to pay $250 for a pair of tickets to see an advance screening."  </P> <P> Theater owners, movie critics and Batman fans cite a variety of reasons for the  advance interest. Some feel the buzz is due to the presence of Nicholson as the  Joker; others attribute it to the popularity of the TV show; and most cite the  wild, white-knuckle trailers that have been showing in theaters.  </P> <P> "Batman has experienced a renaissance the last few years," said Jeff Walker, a  marketing consultant for Warner Bros., who has spent much of the last year  traveling to trade shows and conventions touting "Batman."  </P> <P> "Batman's impact on popular culture has increased dramatically," he said. "The  demographics for people who read comics has gotten older. They're a literate  bunch -- we're not talking about just kids anymore."  </P> <P> Tom Fagan, a 58-year-old promotions director living in Rutland, Vt., was voted  Chief Batmanian in 1963 by the readership of the now-defunct Batmania fan  magazine. In his Batman collection, Fagan owns Detective Comic No. 27 -- the  debut of Batman -- valued at $35,000.  </P> <P> "You can say 'Shazam!' over and over and you'll never become Capt. Marvel,"  Fagan said. "But the thing about Batman is, it's possible that anyone with  determination can train his body to athletic perfection and become a hero --  most of us tried that for a few days, then gave up and kept reading Batman. We  always knew that at any time Batman could be injured. He was vulnerable."  </P> <P> "Midnight Caller," published by 29-year-old Martin Noreau, a graphic artist  living in St. Hubert, Canada, is the only known Batman fanzine.  </P> <P> "We're basically a bunch of guys who like Batman and want an opportunity to  express ourselves through writing or drawing him," said Noreau, who edits and  mails out the 130-page digest from his small apartment. "Midnight Caller" goes  out quarterly to about 200 reader/contributors, mostly from the United States.  </P></p>

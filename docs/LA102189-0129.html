			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRST INTERSTATE TO REPORT LOSS;  </P> <P> BANKING: THE FIRM SAYS $174 MILLION OF RED INK FROM ITS ARIZONA UNIT'S SHAKY  REAL ESTATE  </P> <P> First Interstate Bancorp said Friday that it will report a $16-million  quarterly loss next week because of continuing problems in Arizona, further  evidence that lenders there face growing troubles stemming from the state's  severe real estate recession.  </P> <P> The third-quarter loss for the Los Angeles banking company comes in the wake of  pressure by the U.S. comptroller of the currency on First Interstate to boost  reserves against its problem loans in Arizona. Regulators reviewed First  Interstate's Arizona unit in September and October, the bank said.  </P> <P> First Interstate said its Arizona unit will show a $174-million loss when its  results are released on Wednesday. First Interstate said the Arizona unit is  taking a huge, $350-million provision for loan losses in the quarter stemming  from problems with real estate construction loans and commercial mortgage  loans.  </P> <P> Losses for the parent company will only be $16 million because the Arizona  losses are offset by profits at healthy units, especially First Interstate's  banks in California, Washington, Oregon and Nevada. In the third quarter of  last year, First Interstate Bancorp posted a $214-million loss, largely because  of provisions for loan losses in Texas. Next week's earnings report is expected  to show improvement in the Texas operation.  </P> <P> First Interstate's announcement is a clear sign that economic problems in  Arizona are continuing with few signs of letting up, leading some to dub the  state "the next Texas."  </P> <P> Just three years ago, Arizona was booming. Now the state is suffering through a  severe real estate recession, brought on largely by overbuilding and a slowdown  in the number of people moving into the state.  </P> <P> Late Wednesday, Valley National Corp., Arizona's biggest financial institution,  posted a $72.2-million loss. Other banks, including Security Pacific Corp.,  Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and Great American also reported varying  degrees of problems with their real estate loans in Arizona.  </P> <P> For all banks in Arizona, non-performing loans -- those that are 90 days past  due or those in which banks are not earning interest -- total $1.5 billion, up  28% since the first of the year, according to Sheshunoff Information Services,  a banking research firm in Austin, Tex. The bulk of the non-performing loans  are those related to real estate, which have soared 37% to $1.2 billion since  the start of the year.  </P> <P> More important, the non-performing loans in Arizona total 7.7% of all  outstanding loans made by banks in the state, according to Sheshunoff, the  highest percentage of any state in the nation and more than twice the  percentage for both the nation and for California. Arizona's non-performing  real estate loans total 14% of all real estate loans there, also the highest  percentage of any state.  </P> <P> Non-performing loans at First Interstate's Arizona bank totaled $335 million at  the end of the quarter. The bank's non-performing assets, which also includes  foreclosed property, totaled $416 million.  </P> <P> In an interview, First Interstate Chief Executive Joseph J. Pinola acknowledged  that regulators wanted the bank to provide a bigger cushion to protect against  losses from its Arizona loans. Banking executives say regulators are putting  increasing pressure on banks to set aside money for problem loans as a result  of the nation's massive thrift bailout, which demonstrated the need for larger  cushions against real estate losses.  </P> <P> Pinola said he believes that Arizona's economic problems are much different  from those of Texas and Oklahoma, which were hit hard by both overbuilding and  a severe recession in the oil industry.  </P> <P> John F. Kooken, vice chairman and chief financial officer of Security Pacific  Corp., parent of Security Pacific National Bank, said there has been some  improvement in real estate sales in Arizona in recent weeks, but added that it  is difficult to tell if the state's economy is improving.  </P> <P> "There continue to be bad problems, and it's not 100% clear how fast it will  change," Kooken said.  </P> <P> Dan Williams, a securities analyst for Sutro &amp; Co. in San Francisco, said  that although First Interstate's problems in Arizona are well known, the size  of the loss there was unexpectedly high.  </P> <P> First Interstate's stock hardly reacted to the news, closing at $57.625, down  25 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BANK PROBLEMS IN ARIZONA  </P> <P> Bank problems in Arizona reported this month:  </P> <P> First Interstate Bancorp, Los Angeles: Arizona unit's losses in third quarter  will total $174 million, representing a $16-million loss for parent company.  </P> <P> Security Pacific Corp., Los Angeles: Net credit losses for the third quarter  rose 33%, to $109 million, largely because of Arizona problems.  </P> <P> Chase Manhattan Corp., New York: Takes $85-million after-tax charge, related to  Arizona problems.  </P> <P> Valley National Corp., Phoenix: State's largest financial institution posts  third-quarter loss of $72 million.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT TOPICS: HIGH LIFE: A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU QUIT SMOKING?  </P> <P> This year, about 390,000 people will die from smoking and smoking-related  diseases, according to the American Cancer Society. It is estimated there will  be 155,000 new cases of lung cancer this year, and smoking is responsible for  87% of lung cancer cases.  </P> <P> But there are people who continue to smoke. Surprisingly, teen-agers still pick  up the habit, despite the overwhelming evidence of its dangers.  </P> <P> Hot Topic correspondents were asked to interview teen-agers who smoke -- or  recently quit -- and ask them: "What would it take to get you to give up  cigarette smoking?" Some who responded asked to remain anonymous.  </P> <P> "I would need something to occupy all of my free time and to keep me relaxed  simultaneously." --Brett Smith, 17, senior, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "It would have to be the elimination of stress in society. I admit it is a  crutch, but so is almost everything else." --Michael Iverson, 17, senior,  Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "I would need a new drug to occupy my time. Also, I have nothing making me quit  because I can smoke at home." --Brant Austin, 16, sophomore, Brea-Olinda  </P> <P> "That's a good question. If I had the willpower or if I had a strong enough  reason -- like a pregnancy." --Chrysta Shomaker, 17, senior, Connelly  </P> <P> "When I did, it took a close relative dying for me to stop." --Name withheld,  17, senior, Connelly  </P> <P> "When I get pregnant or if I had to set an example for someone, like my kids."  --Name withheld, 17, senior, Connelly  </P> <P> "I would have to really want to, but a million dollars would help." --Kim  Roberts, 16,junior, Cypress  </P> <P> "I would have to quit for myself." --Monique Rowe, 17, senior, Cypress  </P> <P> "Money." --Brent Huffman, 16, junior, Cypress  </P> <P> "My girlfriend." --Fernando Jorge, 16, senior, Cypress  </P> <P> "It would have to be up to me -- no one could make me quit." --Ross Fielding,  15, sophomore, Cypress  </P> <P> "A million dollars." --Jason Thompson, 16, junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "Freedom." --Kad Luminarias, 16, junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "A new car." --Andy Dechartivong, 16, junior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "Less stress." --Mike Casebier, 17, senior, Dana Hills  </P> <P> "If I decided to get back into athletics, I'd quit. I guess it would take the  actual physical pain to get me to stop." --Heather Gulino, 16, junior, Dana  Hills  </P> <P> "If a doctor told me I had lung cancer or emphysema." --Dominic Peralta, 15,  sophomore, Edison  </P> <P> "Encouragement from friends." --Jon Smith, 16, junior, Estancia  </P> <P> "I ended up quitting because I used to go dancing. I had to experience chest  pain before I stopped." --Rachel Abowitt-Erice, 17, senior, Huntington Beach  </P> <P> "If I wasn't going to die anyway, I would stop smoking." --Shelley Lush, 17,  senior, Laguna Beach  </P> <P> "If I really tried, probably my own determination, or if they stopped selling  cigarettes." --S.C., 17, senior, Ocean View  </P> <P> "My dad smokes also, and the only way I'd quit is if my dad really means to  stop."  </P> <P> Albert Gomez, 16, --junior, Santa Ana Valley  </P> <P> "I would have to date a guy who tells me that he doesn't like me smoking."  --Name withheld, 14, freshman, University  </P> <P> "Someone would have to invent something to calm my nerves." --Lisa Pelletier,  15,sophomore, Woodbridge  </P> <P> Next Week's Hot Topic:  </P> <P> What is this year's "cool" word or saying at your school?

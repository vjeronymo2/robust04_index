			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Collecting: Collectors still play hard to get - Good omens in the saleroom have yet to progress into a firm revival Many antique dealers are starting to resemble Pagliaccio, the clown. Time after time they put on the motley - beautifully displaying all their wonderful goods and standing by them with their most welcoming smiles - only to be left drained and disappointed at the end of the day. Despite many false dawns a consistent improvement in the demand for antiques refuses to emerge. You can see them this weekend at the Duke of York's Headquarters in London's King's Road. For the second successive year around a hundred top dealers, all members of the British Antique Dealers Association, have gathered together in a plush marquee to show off antiques. It makes a splendid sight, but grandeur alone may not be enough to give trade the jolt it needs. The BADA Fair is pitched about half way between the hurly burly of Olympia, opening on June 2, with its 380 dealers making the exhibition centre look like an exclusive souk, and the international glitz - and mega prices - of Grosvenor House, (opening June 9), and it will appeal to the solid British collector who likes to fill his home with fine things. The problem is that such collectors have got out of the habit of buying. The travails of Lloyd's play a part: in the halcyon past many Names used to invest their annual pay outs in antiques. The trade is amazed that the crisis at Lloyd's has not forced more antiques on to the market - although this could happen when the final reckoning arrives - but it has certainly shrivelled demand. Some sectors, like furniture, have held up well during the recession, and Witney Antiques, for one, reports that business this year to date is 40 per cent higher than in 1993. But picture dealers in the main have seen too many revivals peter out after a couple of months to be really optimistic. According to a recent report by Butler Research, the number of antique dealers in the UK has fallen by a quarter, to around 8,200, since the 1990 boom, while turnover has declined from approaching Pounds 3.5b in 1989 to under Pounds 2b last year. Things should be getting better - the economy looks promising; house prices seem to be on a gentle rise, which should stimulate home re-furnishings; and there have been some healthy stock exchange bonuses this year. Leslie Weller of Michael Norman Antiques is encouraged by the number of City traders who have started to spend between Pounds 5,000 and Pounds 10,000 a year on acquiring a Georgian table or a Regency desk as a tangible expression of their success. Many become serious collectors. But to date good omens have not progressed into a firm revival. The antiques market was late into the recession and it is slow to emerge from it. The best consensus is that trade is not deteriorating and that most dealers are busier than a year ago. The impetus for the improvement is coming from the US, where business is much brisker. Many of the leading British dealers traditionally sell extensively to Americans, and there are signs that more will be coming over this summer. At the BADA Fair the red spots for a sale were appearing this week with encouraging frequency at Spinks, William Drummond, Key Antiques, and elsewhere. John Bly sold a pair of fire grates, of 1880, for Pounds 18,500 and Derek Roberts three carriage clocks for Pounds 17,000. It could mean that, with prices so comparatively low, some pent up demand is finally bursting through. This could be the ideal time to buy - the only reservation being that there is a real scarcity of top class antiques. Many of the finest items changed hands during the 1980s boom, and the minority of new owners wishing to sell are waiting, where possible, for a price upturn. If anything of top quality does emerge, it commands a premium. Some seasoned dealers, like George Levy of Blairmans, think that there might have been a sea change in the antiques business, and that there will be no return to the unsustainable boom of the late 1980s. He worries that the introduction of VAT on imported antiques from non-EC countries, even though it has been set initially at a low 2.5 per cent in the UK, sounds the death knell of London's pre-eminence as an international art centre. Once accepted, VAT could rise remorselessly. Levy also thinks that the auction houses have succeeded in convincing a substantial number of new collectors that they can buy direct from them rather than relying on the advice of dealers. This is certainly the case in such markets as 20th century British pictures and furniture. There is an obvious contrast between the current fortunes of the dealers and of the auction houses. In 1993 Sotheby's managed a 32 per cent rise in sales in sterling terms to Pounds 879m and Christie's a 14 per cent improvement to just under Pounds 730m. In contrast, only 2 per cent of British dealers managed sales in excess of Pounds 1m last year: in 1991 3 per cent hit the Pounds 1m turnover target. Not surprisingly, helped by their massive marketing teams, it is the auction houses that grab the headlines and give a rosy glow to the state of the art trade. So Christie's in March had its best modern British sale for years, with 93 per cent sold and records for such varied artists as Gillman (Pounds 110,500) and David Sheppard (Pounds 40,000) while last month Old Masters brought in Pounds 7.3m, (84.5 per cent sold) with a Canaletto way above estimate at Pounds 2.1m (in contrast, one Mayfair Old Master dealer went six months without a sale). An English furniture auction totalled Pounds 1.4m and was 86 per cent sold. Collectors have also maintained their enthusiasm and this year to date Christie's South Kensington has managed a record of Pounds 8,520 for a drawing by Beatrix Potter; a record Pounds 560 for a 1790 Valentine card; a record Pounds 3,850 for original postcard artwork; and a record Pounds 12,100 for a Disney toy, a clockwork Mickey Mouse cranking an organ. In the US Sotheby's secured a record Dollars 63,000 for a baseball bat: it had been used by Babe Ruth. Henry Wyndham, chairman of Sotheby's in London, reports that sales this year are 4 per cent up, and its good things are yet to come. This week Sotheby's announced that it was offering in its July 6 sale of Old Masters a newly discovered early Velazquez, 'The Immaculate Conception', which could make Pounds 6m. Its Impressionist and Modern sale on June 28 is its best for years, with a Pounds 3m Manet, an early version of 'Bar at the Folies-Bergere', and a Monet 'poplars', which could also make Pounds 3m. The contemporary auction is also top quality, with a major work by Lucian Freud. Obviously these important pictures have been lured out by the prospect, at last, of greater demand and higher prices. It could go wrong. Christie's came unstuck in New York this week when, encouraged by last winter's auction, it accepted higher reserves on contemporary pictures and was left with almost half the lots unsold. Buyers are still selective; there are many fewer of them than five years ago (the Japanese have almost entirely disappeared); and they are unwilling to pay over the odds. They know they are in the driving seat. The theory is that a successful New York black tie auction of Impressionist art will have a knock on effect down as far as the rag, tag and bobtail of Portobello Road. If the rich feel confident enough to buy art again then, in time, so will the middling classes, which include the true lovers of art. Many dealers have become so impoverished waiting for the upturn that they have given up the business, or cut costs by trading from home. Those that have held on, or some of them, may soon experience the first stirrings of recovery. Or maybe not.</p>

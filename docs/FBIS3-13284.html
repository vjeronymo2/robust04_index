The source's statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT came after the  discovery of five bombs in an area west of the capital Amman.  The source said that foreign parties, now known to the security  authorities, are behind the explosions and are linked to  incidents which have occurred in more than one Arab country, and  are currently providing aid for the so-called "Afghan Arabs."  He added that the "Afghan" leader now detained and under  interrogation with his group in Jordan is 45 years old and a  resident of al-Baq'ah refugee camp north of Amman, and that most  members of that organization come from that camp.    On the five hand grenades found by the security authorities,  he said that they were of the U.S. M-26 type and were hidden in  a plastic bag when they were discovered near the industrial area  adjacent to the Civil Defense Department in the area of Bayadir  Wadi al-Sayr west of Amman.    The source did not rule out the possibility that they were  planted by "Jordanian Afghans" particularly as they were similar  to the devices used in previous explosions. He said that a  security commission has been formed to investigate and find out  the source of these bombs and why they were planted in that area  close to the Civil Defense Department building.    A citizen had told the security authorities that as he was  walking around in his workshop close to the Civil Defense  Department, he discovered the bombs in a plastic bag, and called  in the explosives experts to defuse them.</p>

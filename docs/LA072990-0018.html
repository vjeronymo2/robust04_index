			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHILLING OUT IN CHILE;  </P> <P> SKIERS WHO HATE SUMMER CAN FIND FROSTY SLOPES, POWDER SNOWAND WINTER WEATHER AT  FOUR RESORTS NEAR SANTIAGO.  </P> <P> It's summertime, hot and hazy. Your skis are buried in the back of the garage.  Dig them out. Because skiers who spend their summer counting the days till  winter comes can fulfill their ski fantasies now. Snow season is in full swing  in the Chilean Andes.  </P> <P> Chile's ski season begins officially in June, but August and September are the  best months to go. The weather and snow conditions are more dependable, the  prices are lower and it's much less crowded. And it's easier to get there than  most people think. Twice-a-week flights leave Los Angeles in the afternoon and  arrive in Santiago the next morning, causing no more jet lag than taking the  red-eye to New York. Little more than an hour's bus ride later, you can be in  one of Chile's four major ski resorts.  </P> <P> Only 35 miles from Santiago up a steep curvy road, at 8,860 feet, the base  facilities for La Parva are terraced at the foot of the ski area. Old families  from Santiago have skied this area for generations. Chileans -- as well as an  increasing number of Argentines and Brazilians -- own many of the condominiums  and some private homes. La Parva is their weekend getaway.  </P> <P> I stood, on that first morning in La Parva last August, at 11,910 feet in the  clear crisp air, looking down on sumptuous white rolls and hillocks in  brilliant sunshine.  </P> <P> An overnight blizzard had dropped two feet of snow over the Andes, and without  a tree or a rock in sight, and only an occasional skier, my companions and I  had nothing to stop us from pointing our skis in any direction. Swooping down  gullies, up over ridges, making first tracks through knee-deep powder, we had  to force ourselves to end the ecstasy and traverse back to the lift -- or else  find ourselves below with a long walk back up.  </P> <P> "I never thought I could ski in powder," remarked a gasping, excited New  Yorker.  </P> <P> I never thought I could either, until I was let loose on the wide open terrain  of La Parva.  </P> <P> Always above tree-line, the runs are clearly marked, but there is nothing to  inhibit an average skier from meandering off the piste into untracked snow.  Expert skiers revel in this complete freedom to fly off cornices, drop down  chutes and to experience, without restrictions, the challenges that lure them  to the sport of skiing.  </P> <P> Beginners and intermediates can ski with reckless abandon or cautious euphoria  over miles of open terrain. In Chile, there are no rules imposed by the ski  area to protect them from liability, or you from your own negligence. You are  responsible for your own safety -- and your own adventures.  </P> <P> Accommodations in La Parva are in modern two- and three-bedroom condominiums.  It's a good idea to have your driver stop at a supermercado in Santiago to buy  food on your way to the resort. There is a dining room and small bar for hotel  guests, plus a small but lively restaurant called La Marmita.  </P> <P> This is where we ate the night of the blizzard. Long wooden tables were crowded  with cheese and meat fondue pots, devices for heating raclette (a cheese dish),  and a variety of condiments. Bottles of robust red Chilean wine from the  100-year-old vineyard of Cousino Macul were uncorked at each table.  </P> <P> The owner kept the blender whirring with pisco sours -- a mixture of lemon  juice and pisco, a Peruvian brandy. A generous local who was celebrating his  50th birthday invited us all to share his champagne. This was definitely the  locals' watering hole as ski instructors from Canada, the U.S., Australia,  Chile and Argentina mingled with the guests. Champagne and pisco flowed. The  tables were pulled to the wall and soon guests were making drinks behind the  bar. The bartender was dancing on the tables with the guests, and cooks,  waiters, instructors and local ski racers joined in the merriment that erased  all national identities and joined us as skiers in an evening of raucous  camaraderie.  </P> <P> La Parva is wide open and friendly. You can ski from your door to two chair  lifts and nine Pomalifts (a chairless lift that employs a disc which one  straddles while being pulled uphill.) These will transport you over gentle  terrain on to the more demanding slopes where the Canadian National team trains  in the summer. We watched them jumping off the roofs of farmhouses between  slalom runs. Snowboarding is a fast growing sport in Chile, as it is in the  U.S. Lessons and rentals are available and there are plenty of low cornices to  twist up, down and over along the edge of the pistes.  </P> <P> Each day ends around 5:30 p.m. with a gold alpenglow washing over the slopes,  then fading as a brilliant red sunset smolders in the western sky over  Santiago.  </P> <P> I skied with my friends over the pass from La Parva into Valle Nevado; we  started at the top, from 12,000 feet down to 9,000. There are 33 square miles  of skiable terrain, and the area is still being enlarged. Every time I got off  a lift and thought I'd reached the outer limits of the ski area, off on the  horizon, another Pomalift would unfold across another mountain top. We skied on  groomed pistes and wide open untracked powder runs. "This is like  four-and-a-half Vails," one person remarked.  </P> <P> Valle Nevado is the biggest, newest and most-talked-about ski area in South  America. When fully developed, and if joined with nearby Farellones/El Colorado  and La Parva, it will be one of the largest ski complexes in the world.  </P> <P> If you've ever longed for the solitude that cross-country skiers enjoy, with  all the conveniences of a modern resort then this ski area is for you. With  three peaks, Valle Nevado has room for 30,000 skiers. The day I was there, only  200 people were skiing. Every trail and lift has clear directional signs with  pictures showing the best route to the lodge, so, barring a blizzard, you  cannot get lost.  </P> <P> Heli-skiing is available through the hotel at reasonable rates. The open  terrain, the probability of dry, light snow and the proximity to the lodge make  this exotic option seem uncomplicated, accessible and a good investment.  </P> <P> Only about 60 miles from Santiago, Valle Nevado is being developed by the same  French company that developed Les Arcs in France. This well-funded and  dedicated group of investors plans to increase the number of lifts from the  present eight to more than 50. The attractive 160-bed hotel, the condominiums,  apartments and the superb restaurant featuring fresh vegetables and juicy  steaks from Argentina give Valle Nevado a special Chilean/French flavor.  </P> <P> The first skiers at the granddaddy of South American ski resorts -- Portillo --  were Norwegian mountaineers who came in 1890 to study the construction of a  railroad between Chile and Argentina. The first lift, built in 1937, had wooden  towers. In 1947, it was replaced by a chairlift, and by 1949, the first hotel  was built. Portillo has attracted some impressive ski personalities to its  school -- Emil Allais, Stein Erickson, Peter Estin and Othmar Schneider were  the pioneers.  </P> <P> For years I had been impressed by stories of this legendary and remote ski  area: its World-Cup-quality downhill, its speed skiing, heli-skiing, fierce  storms and avalanches. When I finally landed in a helicopter in front of the  bright yellow Portillo Hotel (the road was closed by an avalanche), I was  surprised to find such a benign little spot. Nearby was a still lake and all  around, great soaring peaks.  </P> <P> Because 80% of the its guests are repeat visitors, the hotel has a comfortable  clubbiness about it. There are only 478 beds and no plans to expand, so make  your reservations early.  </P> <P> Although the road closes infrequently, and seldom for more than two days, at  such times the management does everything possible to get travelers through.  The day I arrived, two helicopters moved 160 people in and 70 out. If you are  traveling independently, it's a good idea to call the resort before you start  out, either from Santiago or from the nearest town of Los Andes.  </P> <P> As soon as I checked into my fourth-floor room in Portillo, I stood transfixed  by the view from the window. The ice melting on the Laguna del Inca gave a  fractured reflection of rock, snow and jagged peaks slashing the sky.  Reluctantly, I dashed downstairs and out to the nearest chairlift.  </P> <P> Portillo offers some of the most challenging terrain -- and ski lifts -- in  South America. Where avalanches would wipe out lift towers on steep upper  slopes, the French invented the Va et Vient lift, also known as "the sling  shot." Portillo's contraption shoots four people standing abreast up 2,442  feet, where they scramble to disengage themselves without falling back down the  mountainside. Imagine a high-speed four-person Pomalift with no off ramp.  </P> <P> On the lower slopes are long groomed runs and the very steep garganta (throat)  that seems to drop right into the Laguna del Inca. Overall, there is an  interesting variety of terrain, but not a lot of it. There are other options,  however, such as heli-skiing near the Argentine border, guided off-piste  excursions, snowboarding and parasailing.  </P> <P> I tried tandem hang-gliding. Strapped in with an instructor, I skied straight  off a cliff and soared out over the ski runs. The hotel looked like a tiny  yellow box as we circled above and then came in low across the still icy lake,  landing with ease by the rental shop door. A camera mounted on the wing strut  recorded our flight, making the $40 fee well worth it.  </P> <P> The Portillo Hotel is the center of activities. It has a small outdoor pool, an  ice rink when the lake freezes, a large gymnasium for indoor soccer, volleyball  or basketball, and a beauty salon, massage rooms, video and game parlors. At  night, an air of Old World elegance previals; men wear coats and ties to dinner  and women dress in slacks or skirts and fancy sweaters. On the slopes and in  the hotel at Portillo, I felt I was in a serious ski resort and very much in  the Andes.  </P> <P> Some 250 miles south of Santiago is the town of Chillan, which can be reached  by car on a good road, by train (six hours), or by plane (one hour). The ski  area, known as Termas de Chillan, is 51 miles further, at an elevation of 5,900  feet.  </P> <P> The hotel at Termas de Chillan is comfortable but not luxurious. It has 350  beds in about 100 rooms, and its main attraction, (other than skiing), are the  hot baths that have existed there for 150 years. There are sulfur baths, iron  baths, mud facials, hydro massage, plus saunas and steam baths.  </P> <P> New owners of Chillan have ambitions to improve the ski facilities and enlarge  the hotel, making it a major-league ski area.  </P> <P> Arriving at the hotel with my friends for lunch, we were serenaded by an  orchestra that also played in the evenings for dancing. We devoured an abundant  buffet of meats, cheeses, salads, fruits and seafood specialties, then rushed  out to enjoy the longest run in Chillan, 5.6 miles.  </P> <P> Over unexpected rolls and into blind gullies, we skied on spring snow into a  forest of moss-covered trees. A bus was waiting at the bottom to return us to  the hotel.  </P> <P> One of the pleasures I looked forward to each day was a long soak in one of the  three large mineral pools outside the hotel. Only a few flying snowballs  launched by rambunctious Brazilians interrupted this perfect apres-ski.  </P> <P> Chillan had the most varied terrain and snow conditions of any place I skied in  Chile. We had one day of powder skiing on very steep slopes, and the next day  we rode the longest chairlift in South America (8,200 feet). It took 25 minutes  to reach the top. Someone suggested an in-flight magazine ought to come with  the ride. From there we had 15,000 acres of slopes to choose from. With  volcanoes above and thermal springs belching steam from the side of the  mountains, Chillan was yet another unusual ski experience in Chile.  </P></p>

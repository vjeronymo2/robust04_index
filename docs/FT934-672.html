			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Paramount board shifts to QVC The board of entertainment group Paramount Communications was reported yesterday to have recommended that shareholders accept a hostile Dollars 10bn (Pounds 6.7bn) bid from television shopping channel QVC Network, rather than a friendly but lower offer from cable company Viacom. The move - reported late in the morning by executives involved in the fight  -would represent a big psychological shift in the three-month-old battle for Paramount, since until now the board had shunned QVC's advances and insisted that a merger with Viacom offered better long-term benefits. But it would not spell the end of the tortuous fight since each bidder still has a 10-day period in which it can increase the value of its offer and shareholders are free to accept whichever proposal they want. Viacom was understood to be seeking finance for a higher offer yesterday from other companies which have backed its bid, such as Nynex, the regional telephone company serving the Northeastern US, and Blockbuster Entertainment, the video rental chain. No immediate comment was available from Paramount, but its shares were suspended at Dollars 80 3/8 , up Dollars  1/8 , pending an announcement. later yesterday. The board's action follows a ruling by the Delaware Supreme Court that the company must create a level playing field for both the Viacom and QVC offers. Paramount agreed to auction itself off and set a deadline of last Monday for offers. QVC increased the value of its cash offer for 51 per cent of Paramount's shares from Dollars 90 to Dollars 92, while Viacom resubmitted its existing cash offer, worth Dollars 85 a share. Both bidders are offering stock for the remaining 49 per cent. and Based on their fluctuating share prices, QVC's entire bid was worth around Dollars 10bn, or Dollars 83 1/2 a share, yesterday morning, compared with Viacom's Dollars 9.6bn, or Dollars 79 5/8 a share. After deliberating for much of Tuesday and yesterday morning, the Paramount board evidently voted to recommend the QVC offer. Analysts said it had little choice, since QVC's offer was markedly higher and the board was under close legal scrutiny to ensure it did not unfairly favour Viacom. Viacom is understood to have asked Paramount for more time to finance a higher bid. This suggests it could be facing difficulties in raising funds, or is simply involved in protracted negotiations with its partners over the terms of additional funding.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal </F> Counterintelligence Service, by Aleksandr Gamov and Vladimir  Murashkin; date and place not given: "Sergey Stepashin: We  Have Caught, Are Catching, and Will Continue to Catch Spies.  New Lubyanka Boss Gives KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA His First  Interview"]    [Text] [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, whenever  the special services were mentioned in the past, people would  first recall the spies which our agents had caught. Now the  concept of "economic security" has entered the vocabulary. To  what extent is this area a priority for the Foreign  Counterintelligence Service [FCS]?    [Stepashin] Well, first, we have been catching spies and we  will continue to do so -- we are tasked with that function by  the statute on our service published 30 March in ROSSIYSKAYA  GAZETA and ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI. Incidentally, I wrote to Sergey  Aleksandrovich Filatov, the leader of the Presidential  Administration, asking him to remove the "for official use"  classification from the document and have it published in the  press. People should know what we do.    We tackled economic security issues in the past as well, but  this applied more to security measures at defense enterprises,  nuclear power stations, and other strategic installations. All  that remains, but, at the same time, new areas have emerged. In  general, many departments should safeguard economic security, as  should the "producers" themselves -- the banks, say. We are  looking at our participation in this from the standpoint of  combating corruption in financial, lending, and banking  structures, other state and commercial organizations, and  various investment funds. Moreover, we are helping the Central  Bank of Russia to carry out credit and other operations, and  major enterprises to conclude contracts with foreign firms.    Economic security issues account for two of the FCS' five  basic directorates. To be blunt, it is quite an important force.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Doesn't it strike you that the threat  to our economy today comes not so much from abroad as from  inside the country -- a proposition which was raised quite  recently?    [Stepashin] Indeed, in the past the economic security issue  was interpreted one-sidedly -- that is, it was linked solely to  external factors. I am thinking of the restrictive policy of  the industrially developed states and the IMF, which placed bans  on lending to the USSR, on the supply of goods and advanced  technology, and so forth.    Domestic factors helping to undermine the economy were not  profoundly studied or were often simply hushed up. But their  destructive effect on all spheres of the national economy has  been far greater in scale and longer-term. Society has suffered  immense damage, for instance, from the denial on ideological  grounds of the existence of a corruption problem in the top  echelons of party and state power, or of the presence in the  country of a ramified black market system.    Today the impact of internal "time bombs" undermining the  economy has not only not been halted but is actually growing  stronger. Just take the problem of economic ties. In my view,  this is now the main destabilizing factor.    Needless to say, the main role in preventing these threats  is  played by the top organs of state power -- the government and  its structures -- since they are the people who shape economic  policy and define the mechanism for its implementation. As for  FCS subunits, we see our task -- along with those already  mentioned -- as being to ensure that top state administrative  organs have accurate and timely information on negative trends  in basic sectors and spheres of the national economy and on  emergencies, and to provide forecasts of the possible  consequences.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that the FCS is now  mainly just a forecasting and analysis body?    [Stepashin] No, of course not. Counterintelligence  operatives are above all men of action. And if the discussion  of our work to safeguard Russia's economic security were to  continue, I could mention a lot of specific cases. Because of  space constraints in your newspaper I will quote just a few of  the most typical.    In the course of the joint "Trawl" operation with organs of  the Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD], the Customs, and the  Prosecutor's Office, our territorial subunits managed to uncover  around 270 criminal structures specializing in the illegal  export of strategic raw materials and licensed products. In  total over the past year we have put a stop to more than 1,200  such illegal acts, giving rise to almost 300 criminal cases.  The illegal export from the Russian Federation of more than  636,000 tonnes of oil and oil products, 100,000-odd tonnes of  metals -- including 44,000 tonnes of nonferrous and rare-earth  metals -- as well as timber, lumber, and other products worth  around 150 billion rubles [R] in total has been prevented.    Federal security organs conducted the "Barrier" operation at  16 airports around the country and put a stop to the illegal  export from Russia by air of more than 400 kg of electronic  components containing gold, around 30 kg of gold and silver  bars, as well as 237 cutting tools with diamonds of up to two  carats worth R58 million.    As a result of the measures taken on the basis of  information  supplied by FCS organs more than 400 major disasters and the  preconditions for them were successfully prevented in 1993 --  including 54 at nuclear power generating installations.    Incidentally, a great many examples could be quoted of  Russian slackness, waste, and blatant stealing from the country.  And work in this area is terra incognita for our  counterintelligence agents.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Does this mean that we are harming  ourselves and that the West is just helping us?    [Stepashin] Things are not that simple. Foreign firms,  exploiting the situation in our country, are striving to expand  scientific and technical links with Russia to their own  advantage. They are trying to organize an intensive outflow of  Russian scientific ideas, high technology, and advanced arms and  military equipment systems.    In the United States, France, Germany, Brazil, Israel,  China,  and South Korea these actions are supported at state level. We  know that the range of theoretical and practical scientific  results in Russia that are of interest to foreigners extends to  space and aviation equipment, biotechnology, new materials,  nuclear physics, laser equipment, metallurgy, and high-tech and  defense sectors of industry.    Information reaching the Russian FCS on this problem shows  that in the very near future our country could lose its leading  position in the development of basic and applied research, be  deprived of many scientific schools and highly qualified cadres,  and suffer considerable and essentially irreparable material  damage. Calculations done by specialists from the Russian  Federation Ministry of Science and Technology Policy using UN  methods show that the country loses around $300,000 for every  specialist that goes abroad. Russia could suffer potential  damage of around $20 billion annually through emigration.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, could you describe  the work of the Western special services to safeguard their  countries' economic security?    [Stepashin] The United States devotes a great deal of  attention to strengthening the activity of counterintelligence  organs in preserving and strengthening America's leading  position militarily and economically. In the Americans'  opinion, the strategic threats to U.S. interests persist under  present-day conditions. In this connection intelligence  community experts are pointing out that Russia and the other CIS  countries are still the priority targets for the special  services.    Moreover, insofar as we are aware, the intelligence  community  is fully tasked with the function of economic counterespionage  -- and the special services are being told to be "more  aggressive" when conducting counterintelligence operations.    According to the available information, the special services  of the East European countries are also becoming an important  tool in implementing their leaderships' "eastern" policy. Their  priority effort is concentrated on infiltrating leading  structures in the CIS states in order to obtain not only  economic but military and political information.    We know that special organs from the East European states  are in close contact with the NATO special services, which give  them financial, material, and technical support.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] According to calculations by  specialists, several tens of billions of dollars are taken out  of Russia every year. Can't this outflow of foreign exchange be  sealed off?    [Stepashin] Of course it can -- but not only and not so much  with the help of the special services. In this area we have to  work in conjunction with the tax service, the tax police, the  MVD, and the Customs. We plan to set up several such joint  groupings under the auspices of the Prosecutor's Office. But  this is not enough. Our administrative law and code of criminal  procedure have long become obsolete, and we are working under  the conditions of the former political and economic system. We  have plenty of material, but we cannot act on it. The facts we  have to hand are not being used for investigations -- much less  for instituting criminal proceedings and court cases.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What about simply legalizing activity  that is currently deemed criminal? Maybe then our "dealers"  would not send their dollars abroad?    [Stepashin] Far too much has been legalized as it is! And  money is going abroad because of the unstable political  situation. Many people are scared to invest their capital here  -- they fear for their future. Moreover, some of the radical  opposition is gripped with the idea of the expropriation of the  expropriators, and the experience of 1917 is not such ancient  history for them. Consequently, it is only when we have a normal  political atmosphere that we can talk about stopping the flight  of capital. Needless to say, I do not choose people who are  indifferent to the interests of our country and its people.  These people have always been with us, are with us, and always  will be -- and if they commit crimes they need to be combated,  using special service methods if necessary.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] We talk so much about corruption!  You get the feeling that we are on top of it, when the opposite  is true....    [Stepashin] This phenomenon has been brought about primarily  by the current position in the economy and by the lack of  legislation on the civil service. We are discussing corruption,  but from the standpoint of the criminal code the subject of our  complaints essentially does not exist. We do not have any  clear-cut framework to guide civil servants*at all levels -- up  to and including government members -- about what they are  forbidden to do and what they are responsible for. That is why  people are lobbying for the most fantastic agreements.    Exploiting their important position, certain officials are  making approaches to foreign firms, selling them our  enterprises' products at considerably reduced prices, and taking  bribes in return. The most interesting point is that most  corrupt people do not think of themselves as such -- they claim  to be just entrepreneurs. We are currently investigating the  "Neftalmazinvest" Foundation. High-ranking officials from the  State Committee for the Management of State Property are  involved in this major affair.    There is a very alarming situation with oil. It is currently  monopolized by several structures. This strategic raw material  is going abroad without any controls. Ukraine has not paid  Russia for oil received throughout all of last year and the year  before, and it is still receiving oil. Who took how many bribes  for that? Why are products with different octane ratings  flowing through the same pipeline?    In other words, corruption now affects many of the most  important spheres -- privatization, the credit and financial  sphere, banking, investment and foreign economic activity....  According to available information, the degree to which the  economy has been affected by this "bacillus" is quite  considerable and is continuing to increase rapidly.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Sergey Vadimovich, be frank -- do you  believe your work will be successful (I am thinking of the fight  against corruption)?    [Stepashin] If everything depended on us alone.... Today  you can often hear voices claiming that the FCS should be  disbanded -- with one directorate being given to the Finance  Ministry, another to the Justice Ministry, and so forth. You  get the impression that people either don't know what the  Finance and Justice Ministries do, or they are deliberately  raising the question of scrapping the FCS.    This talk is coming up now that we have started active  work, particularly in opposing foreign stations. We now have  very serious approaches to a number of economic structures and  have once again gone on the attack. Certain newspapers  specialize directly in this. There are no prizes for guessing  that there are people who find counterintelligence a big problem  when it gets "too close" to them and their machinations.    And this is not just a question of the foreign "agents of  influence" to whom we often refer. Some of our  pseudocampaigners for democracy and justice are also attacking  the special services. And these actions are deliberate and by no  means the fruit of a sick fantasy run riot in the spring.    I would like to recall the words of Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin during our recent meeting -- Russia, the state, and the  president need a strong special service that can work  effectively in all areas.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] But won't the FCS, in actively  dealing with economic security, leave other "sections of the  front" exposed?    [Stepashin] No, that is ruled out. Everyone does his own  job. For instance, this year we have already arrested British  and German spies, and we caught them "clean" -- in other words,  red-handed. The other day we also caught red-handed three  staffers from the North Korean Embassy attempting to buy  state-of-the-art technology, as well as a BND (FRG intelligence)  agent trying to recruit a Russian officer in the Western Group  of Forces. Of course, such results raise the morale of  counterintelligence officers and enhance their sense of their  own worth. Military counterintelligence has become more active.  We are recording many recruitment approaches from the German  special services to the contingent of Russian troops being  withdrawn from Germany.    Means have also now been taken to improve the work of our  information and analysis subunits. In the last two weeks alone  we have sent the president 25 analytical materials on a wide  range of security problems -- including "hot" spots, foreign  special services' aspirations, and economic issues....    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] Can the reorganization of the special  service responsible for the state's security now be said to be  complete?    [Stepashin] I think so. The fundamental reform has been  completed, but we will be constantly improving our structure.    [KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA] What is the renewed profile of the  Lubyanka now?    [Stepashin] We have gotten rid of certain militia functions  -- put it that way -- which are alien to the special service.  We have also lost the Border Guards and our investigative  subunits. We have somewhat reduced our central apparatus --  particularly our administrative apparatus -- and changed our  organizational and staffing structure. The FCS has become more  compact.    I should note that these reorganizations did not begin  solely  as a result of the president's edict -- they were a call of the  times. Back in September 1993 we independently started  reforming the Security Ministry. The Russian president then  received the first note from the Security Ministry Collegium, in  which we proposed a number of new approaches. These were  subsequently implemented in the 5 January 1994 presidential  edict setting up the Russian Federation FCS.    We have completely recertificated our staff -- from  operatives to the deputy director of the FCS. But we have not  carried out any kind of "purge" -- much less one for political  motives. Certain workers were dismissed for being  professionally unsuited to the job, while some have left for  reasons of age and other reasons. I think that what we are left  with are the best -- at least from the standpoint of  understanding the need to conscientiously serve the fatherland.

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television As with some momentous state occasion, BBC2 has changed its schedules at the last moment to accommodate the Royal Opera's new production of La traviata from Covent Garden. This is the collaboration between Sir Georg Solti and the National Theatre's Richard Eyre. On the first night the reception was ecstatic. Why? The conductor was precise, energetic and unfeeling. The director had patently never worked in opera before, had nothing to offer in the way of characterisation or interpretation, and was uncertain what to do with the chorus. The leading soprano is young, pretty and mellifluous, but barely scratches the surface of Verdi's moving vision of the lady of the camellias; yet the audience reacted as if she were a combination of Maria Callas, Mother Teresa and Samantha Fox. It may be better on the box, and you can watch programmes in those interminable intervals (they're just as long in the Opera House). At least it makes a change from those obsessive relays from the New York Met, another of the BBC's little mysteries.</p>

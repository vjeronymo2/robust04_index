			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Robin Williams, Jay Leno and Billy Crystal do jokes and celebrity impressions  for Barbara Walters in her first all-comedian interview special, tonight (10-11  P.M. ET) on ABC. But the emphasis is more on stay-at-home domesticity than  stand-up routines. Williams introduces Walters to his wife and baby daughter,  Zelda, and Leno and Crystal talk about their longtime marriages. "In general, I  haven't liked doing comedians because you ask a question and you end up playing  straight man," admits Walters, with whom Eddie Murphy was uncooperative in an  early interview. "But these three were very nice, funny and revealing -- and  maybe I'm able to sit and laugh more than I might have in the past." Claudia  Puig  </P></p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Shephard orders overhaul of careers advice Government curriculum advisers have been asked to overhaul careers advice in secondary education, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the education secretary, announced yesterday. Her move is part of a package of measures, launched jointly with the employment secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, to improve careers advice. She said there would be more funding for training careers teachers - although she could not give an amount before the Budget - and schools would be required to plan careers policy jointly with local employers and careers services. Ministers have rejected proposals by employers' organisations to introduce vouchers for careers guidance. Mrs Shephard said she had asked Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the School Curriculum and Assessment Authority, to produce new guidelines for careers guidance in secondary education. She said that 'young people from the age of 11 do need to understand that they are aiming for the world of work'. Careers services, which are directly funded by the Department of Employment, claimed that schools were not providing impartial advice but they were influenced by funding incentives to recruit students to A-level courses, rather than sending them to do vocational courses with further education colleges, which compete with them for funds. Mr Mike Eastwood, from the UK Heads of Career Services Association, claimed there was 'evidence that some head teachers, because of the amount of money flowing from having a young person in their sixth form, are very loath to have unbiased guidance from school careers service officers'. This follows last month's report by Ofsted, the schools watchdog, and by the Further Education Funding Council for England, which said too many sixth-formers were attempting inappropriate academic A-level courses, and should be encouraged to take vocational qualifications instead. Mr David Blunkett, the shadow education secretary, said that careers advice was being hampered by the government's 'market dogma'. He added: 'Commercialising careers services has brought uncertainty and confusion to an area in which quality and consistency of advice are essential.' But Mr Tony Webb, the Confederation of British Industry's education director, said he was pleased with the package. He added that the partnership approach was realistic, given that there were not yet enough providers of careers advice for a fully competitive market.</p>

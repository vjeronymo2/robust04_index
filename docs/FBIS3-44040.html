			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] It has been a good week for the peace process in  Mozambique. Recently, the Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]  government came under intense criticism from both the opposition  Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] movement and the UN  representative in Mozambique for not sending its troops into the  UN assembly areas as fast as the former rebels of Renamo were  doing. But now it seems the government is at last getting its  act together, as Barnaby Philips reports from Maputo.    The movement of government soldiers into UN assembly areas  increased dramatically over the last week. Since last Monday,  1,500 Frelimo troops have arrived in assembly areas across the  country, compared to a mere 60 in the first two weeks of 1994.  Many UN observers, who had been twiddling their thumbs in  previously deserted assembly areas, finally had some work to do,  as the first Frelimo troops showed up.    Aldo Ajello told a Maputo press conference yesterday that he  was satisfied with the speed with which government forces were  assembling. Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama had threatened to  paralyze the peace process unless he had received an explanation  by today from President Chissano as to what was going on. In  the light of the improved situation, that threat seems to have  been quietly forgotten, but as so often in the Mozambican peace  process, it is a case of two steps forward, one step back.    Today, the problem of funding for Renamo resurfaced. Afonso  Dhlakama told the first edition of the independent SAVANA  newspaper that money that had been promised to Renamo by the  international community to assist the former rebels as they  attempt to transform themselves into a political party was still  not forthcoming. Dhlakama laid down another ultimatum: If there  is no money by February, he told SAVANA, Renamo will not contest  the elections. In the past, Dhlakama's bark has proved worse  than his bite. The donors meeting in Maputo on Monday will  [words indistinct] bear his words in mind.</p>

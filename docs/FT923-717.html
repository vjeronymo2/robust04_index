			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Fortnum &amp; Mason profits little changed PRE-TAX profits at Fortnum &amp; Mason, the Piccadilly department store, remained virtually unchanged in adverse economic conditions. Fortnum made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.46m in the 76 weeks to July 11 1992, following a change of accounting period. In the 52 weeks to July, profits were down 0.5 per cent against Pounds 2.16m for the same period of 1990-91. Mr Garry Weston, chairman, said this was a creditable result at a time of economic recession and reflected tighter management and cost controls. Sales at the Piccadilly store rose 6 per cent in the 24 weeks to July, but this reflected adverse trading conditions in the same period last year during the Gulf War. Mr Weston said sales at the store over the 76 weeks and 52 weeks to July 1992 were down 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent over comparable periods the year before. Total sales for 76 weeks, were up Pounds 900,000 to Pounds 33.33m, boosted by a surge in exports in the early part of the period. Earnings per share for the 76 weeks were 383p (311p for previous 52 weeks). A third interim of 12p was declared making a total of 108p (90p).</p>

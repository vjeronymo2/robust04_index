This treaty is expected to be ratified by the end of 1994 and implemented on January 1, 1995. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Article XXIV: 7(a) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT contracting parties must formally notify the GATT of their intention to enter into a customs union, such as the European Union. A GATT working party will then be established to examine the proposed customs union in relation to the standards of Article XXIV, including the rule that the ``duties and other regulations of commerce imposed *&blank;*&blank;* in respect of trade with contracting parties not parties to such union *&blank;*&blank;* shall not on the whole be higher or ore restrictive than the general incidence of the duties and other regulations of commerce applicable in the constituent territories prior to the formation of such union <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> *&blank;*&blank;*'' The GATT working party will examine the agreement to determine whether the duties and trade regulations of the enlarged EU will be higher or more restrictive with respect to the EU's trading partners than the duties and trade regulations of the EU and the four countries individually prior to accession. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the treaty of accession, Austria, Finland, Norway and Sweden will begin to apply the EU's trade regime, including the EU's common external tariff schedule, for almost all items, on January 1, 1995. While the United States has yet to receive trade information from the European Union upon which to evaluate the expected trade consequences of this accession, it is likely that U.S. production and trade in some sectors will be adversely affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a country joining a customs union plans to raise a duty rate which is bound in its GATT schedule of concessions, it may renegotiate the tariff concession under GATT Article XXIV: 6 and the procedures of Article XXVIII. This renegotiation may result in the provision of tariff compensation (reduction of duties) covering an equivalent value of trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Chairman of the Trade Policy Staff Committee invites written submissions from the public on the expected implications of the accession treaty on access to the markets of Austria, Finland, Norway, Sweden, or the existing EU member states for U.S. products and services. Submissions will be used in decisions regarding U.S. negotiating priorities with respect to the EU enlargement. The information obtained from these submissions will be considered during the GATT working party examination of the EU accession and the GATT Article XXIV: 6 tariff compensation negotiations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Submissions should describe the product or service in question, and, in the case of products, should include the Harmonized System tariff heading(s). Submissions should describe the present market access for the products or services, including value and quantity of exports, any existing problems, and should identify the changes that are expected to result from the implementation of the accession treaty. Submissions may also include recommendations for appropriate compensation to be sought for instances of diminished market access. These recommendations could include such items as reductions in the EU common external tariff on goods, improvements to EU market access commitments on services, or other changes in the EU trade regime for goods and services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments must be submitted in English and provided in twenty copies to Carolyn Frank, Secretary of the Trade Policy Staff Committee, Room 414, 600 17th Street NW., Washington, D.C. 20506, no later than 12:00 noon on Friday, September 16, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Public Inspection of Submissions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for information granted ``business confidential'' status pursuant to 15 CFR 2003.6, submissions will be available for public inspection by appointment at the USTR Public Reading Room, in room 101, Office of the United States Trade Representative, 600 17th Street, NW, Washington, D.C.

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANY CANDIDATES BUT ONLY 1 PLATFORM IN LITHUANIA;  </P> <P> SOVIET ELECTION: THE REPUBLIC MUST BE INDEPENDENT, MOST AGREE. AND THAT MAKES  FOR A LACKLUSTER CAMPAIGN.  </P> <P> A visitor doesn't have to go any farther than the Central Square in front of  Communist Party headquarters here in the Lithuanian capital to grasp the  significance of today's republic-wide elections.  </P> <P> Twin signs in the national colors of red, yellow and green -- one in Russian,  one in Lithuanian -- proclaim, "A Lithuania without sovereignty is a Lithuania  without a future."  </P> <P> As little as two years ago, the idea of Lithuanian independence from the Soviet  Union was still too radical for public discussion. And it was only a year ago  that the powerful grass-roots reform movement known as Sajudis clearly embraced  the cause.  </P> <P> Now, most Lithuanian Communists proclaim independence as their goal. And it is  clear that the republic's new Parliament, to be chosen today in the Soviet  Union's first real multi-party elections since 1918, will be pioneers,  attempting an unprecedented peaceful secession from the world's last great  empire.  </P> <P> "Of course, the new Parliament will want to put itself in the pages of history  and declare independence," commented Algis Zukas, an aide to Lithuania's reform  Communist president, Algirdas Brazauskas.  </P> <P> More than 80% of the nearly 500 candidates competing for 141 seats in the new  Parliament are running on platforms calling for independence. The mood of the  ethnic Lithuanian majority in the republic is also clear.  </P> <P> At a campaign debate at a school in the Kosmonautu district of Vilnius the  other night, a disgusted Lithuanian woman stormed out after an ethnic Russian  candidate running as an unreconstructed Communist rejected a questioner's  contention that the republic is occupied by Moscow.  </P> <P> "I just don't have the patience to listen to them," the woman explained. "They  just don't understand Lithuanians."  </P> <P> Agreement on the independence issue is so widespread, in fact, that the  election campaign itself has been relatively unexciting. There are campaign  posters around, a lot of political advertising on television and daily public  meetings at which opposing candidates answer questions from the constituents.  </P> <P> There is a faint hint of American-style political glitz, such as the reform  Communist whose official campaign portrait shows him riding a bicycle in his  track suit, or the ethnic Russian who is depicted snuggling his young daughter.  </P> <P> Generally, however, there is such a lack of street rallies or other signs of  public enthusiasm that some politicians say they expect many voters will simply  stay home.  </P> <P> There aren't even any juicy vote-rigging scandals or other types of campaign  skulduggery so far, according to Election Commission officials.  </P> <P> Recalling the heady political atmosphere that reigned here when Sajudis-backed,  non-party candidates trounced the Communists in voting for the national  Congress of People's Deputies last March, editor and People's Deputy Algimantas  Cekuolis commented: "It's as if a person was hungry for weeks or months. Then  he gorged himself, and now he doesn't want to think of food."  </P> <P> The political scene has also gotten a lot more complicated here since those  earlier elections. The Lithuanian Communist Party split in December after  reformers under President Brazauskas divorced themselves from the policies of  the national party leadership in Moscow. They jumped aboard the independence  bandwagon for fear that otherwise they would be wiped out in today's elections.  </P> <P> The move won the reformers an immediate boost in the opinion polls and the  endorsement by Sajudis of 32 of their candidates for the republic's Parliament.  </P> <P> Brazauskas, whose campaign literature doesn't even contain the word communism  any more, suddenly has an unprecedented 85% public-approval rating.  </P> <P> Brazauskas aide Zukas said in an interview that the reformed party hopes to win  30% to 40% of the seats in the new legislature.  </P> <P> A half-dozen credible new parties have also appeared since Lithuania became the  first Soviet republic to approve a multi-party system late last year. Sajudis,  which prefers to remain an umbrella movement rather than become a political  party itself, has also endorsed some candidates from those new parties, as well  as 92 non-party candidates.  </P> <P> "We are the Alice-in-Wonderland country," quipped Cekuolis about the profusion  and confusion of candidates.  </P> <P> Except for those Communists who still swear allegiance to Moscow -- mostly  members of the ethnic Russian minority living in Lithuania -- the only  difference among the rest of the parties is over the form of independence they  seek and how hard they are ready to push for it.  </P> <P> "This election will decide at what tempo and what grade of determination we  will go to independence," said Vytautas Landsbergis, chairman of the Sajudis  Executive Council.  </P> <P> The reform Communists are cautious.  </P> <P> "Even in the United States, it took years after the Declaration of Independence  for this independence to become a fact of life," Brazauskas said in an  interview with a Lithuanian newspaper earlier this month. "So, I am ready for a  difficult road ahead on the way to our goal."  </P> <P> "The question is not independence," Zukas said. "It's more how we are going to  achieve it. The (reform) Communist Party is for achieving it in small steps."  </P> <P> The Social Democrats, under economist Kazimieras Antanivicius, 52, have no  apparent quarrel with the reform Communists' program but are anxious to  disassociate themselves from any part in the old system.  </P> <P> "We're for getting rid of the kind of socialism that existed here for 70  years," Antanivicius told about 150 people at a defense-plant social club the  other day. "That socialism was slavery. It was worse than feudalism."  </P> <P> More to the right are the Christian Democrats, Democrats and the most radical  Lithuanian Freedom League, which argues that the current leadership of both the  reformist Communists and Sajudis have so discredited themselves by past  compromise with the system that they are unfit to lead the way to independence.  </P> <P> With so few issues involved, the race focuses heavily on personalities.  </P> <P> The final list of candidates makes it clear that the largely inexperienced  politicians who will be trying soon to negotiate Lithuania's independence will  be a highly educated, mostly male and middle-aged lot.  </P> <P> Nearly 94% of them have college degrees, an extraordinary figure in a country  where workers and peasants have long been allotted seats in government.  </P> <P> Only 28 of the candidates are women. "This is different from all previous  elections, when the number of women was fixed from above," said Sajudis  Election Committee official Angonita Rupsyte. Also, she said, noting the  hardships of everyday life in Lithuania, "it's very difficult to harmonize a  family and politics in our conditions."  </P> <P> About one-third of the candidates are under 40, another third 40 to 50 and the  rest over 50.  </P> <P> Final results of the elections may be some time coming. Run-offs may be  required in many constituencies if fewer than half the registered voters turn  up or no candidate manages to win more than 50% of the votes.  </P> <P> It is expected that the elections will result in the first coalition government  in the Soviet Union since shortly after the Bolshevik Revolution. And that  government will try to negotiate the terms of Lithuania's independence with  Moscow.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most encouraging news on that front came out of Paris this week,  where an aide to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said no one could prevent  Lithuania's seceding from the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Aide Andrei Grachev said he hopes that all three Baltic republics can be  convinced that it is in their interest to remain in a revitalized Soviet  federation.  </P> <P> "But if this discussion doesn't convince the Lithuanian people that their  interest is to remain within a renewed federation, they make the decision, and  no one can prevent them from fulfilling it," Grachev said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> The Baltic states of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were independent countries  from just after World War I until they were annexed by the Soviet Union in  1940. Under a secret protocol to a 1939 nonaggression treaty between Josef  Stalin's Communist regime and Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany, the Communist and  Fascist powers had conspired to carve up Eastern Europe into areas of control.  Soviet military units began occupying the three nations that year. Annexation  was completed after "elections" that purportedly supported the Soviet takeover.  The nonaggression pact was abrogated on June 22, 1941, when Nazi forces  attacked the Soviet Union.  </P></p>

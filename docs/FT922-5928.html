			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / Ten banks put up Pounds 25m to build foreign exchange trading system TEN LEADING banks in the foreign exchange markets are to put up Pounds 25m (Dollars 45m) to build a new electronic trading system to rival Reuters, the UK information group which dominates foreign exchange trading. The 10, from the US, UK and Switzerland, have been planning the development of the trading system, known as Electronic Broking Service (EBS), for two years. EBS, which is planned for launch early next year, follows Reuters' own Dealing 2000-2 service, launched a month ago and in use at 23 banks. Both are intended as substitutes for the brokers who act as middlemen in around 40 per cent of foreign exchange deals. Electronic broking systems, which replicate the work of human brokers, are estimated to cut broking costs to around a quarter of their current level. Commissions paid to these brokers are one of the largest costs faced by banks in the foreign exchange market. One leading British bank says its commissions last year totalled around Pounds 8m. The banks involved in EBS are Barclays, Midland and National Westminster of the UK; Bank of America, Chemical Bank, Citibank and J P Morgan of the US; and Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland. Each is putting up an equal share in the investment, with Quotron, the information services company owned by Citicorp of the US, providing a similar stake. Quotron will build EBS, which will be based on its recently-launched F/X Trader dealing system. The development of EBS reflects in part the banks' concern at Reuters' dominance of the foreign exchange markets. From its foothold in supplying prices, the company succeeded in capturing around 50 per cent of all foreign exchange deals with its last generation of dealing terminals. Many banks privately complain about Reuters' charges. A third electronic broking system, Minex, is planned by KDD, the Japanese telecommunications firm, with the backing of Japanese banks. Reuters said yesterday that Dealing 2000-2, which had suffered delays and was finally launched last month after several years in development, was performing well and meeting all expectations.</p>

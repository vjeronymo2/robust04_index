			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Drach, chairman of Ukrainian World </F> Coordinating Council: "Ukraine and Russia: Prospects for  Interrelations"]    [Text] Two years after the official disappearance of the  unforgettable Soviet Union, dialogue by intellectuals with a  highly developed sense of responsibility to their nations and  peoples--Ukraine, Russia, and the CIS countries--is the same  kind of global necessity as the earlier process of detente  between the two world ideological camps that prevented nuclear  war between the United States and the USSR. This applies in  particular to representatives of Russia and Ukraine.    My choice of the common and--as history  demonstrated--productive term "detente" is deliberate. Just as  all mankind was on the verge of the apocalypse for a long time  during the cold war years, now the Russian and Ukrainian people  have been driven to the point of suicide and are being urged to  take the fatal step, and if the blockheads endowed with  political and spiritual authority manage to cross this line,  only the blind, deaf, and mute can expect this to remain a  regional conflict, like those tormenting the Caucasus, Central  Asia, and Moldova. The whole explanation can be found in the  single word "Chernobyl."    The main prerequisites for this dialogue, which will be  truly  pivotal for all of us, are sincerity, honesty, and goodwill. We  will leave the propagandistic intimidation and nerve-gas methods  to the honored veterans of psychological warfare against  decadent capitalism and their highly enlightened disciples, who  did not manage to achieve worldwide fame before 24 August 1991  and are now selling their erudition to the same warring parties  within the boundaries of yesterday's empire. You and I cannot  immediately pacify Ostankino or the chauvinistic newspapers and  other mouthpieces of the warmongers, who are now calling for  Russo-Ukrainian war instead of world war and are certain to  engender equally radical forces of armed resistance in Ukraine.  You and I, even if we were able to find a common language right  away, could not quickly bring the hard-nosed experts back to  their senses, not to mention the excessively passionate and  belligerent deputies who already see the expanses to the north  and south of the town of Mikhaylovskoye as a theater of military  operations. Nevertheless, just as common sense once began  building bridges, quietly and imperceptibly, across the abyss  between East and West to the accompaniment of the usual  propaganda crossfire and volleys, now we must begin laying the  foundation for the normal, just, peaceful, and mutually  beneficial coexistence of the Russian and Ukrainian people,  which will be just as essential to the survival of all of us  within the territory of the former USSR as the mutual  understanding between Moscow and Washington was essential to  global detente in the recent past. That is why I would define  Russo-Ukrainian relations as the decisive factor at this time. I  am not an economist, political scientist, or diplomat, but I am  certain that the deep inner feelings of the nation, or at least  of its ruling elite--feelings that might be described as its  emotional state--are making their way into these specific  spheres and are influencing each of these spheres in their own  way. It is the state of our emotions, as the primary factor in  Russo-Ukrainian relations, that I will be discussing.    I do not want each of my theses to be taken solely as an  indictment of the other side or an insult to anyone's  self-esteem, or to be interpreted as a final and inflexible  position brooking no evolution or reconsideration. I think that  we are all ready to regard the expression of a different point  of view, even an opposite one, not as the erection of  fortifications for attack or defense or for the seizure of  commanding heights and bridgeheads, but as the removal of  existing obstacles and barriers impeding fraternization.    Here are a few of the theses aimed at this kind of mutual  understanding.    The first thesis is that we Ukrainians have to understand  the  Russians, who grew accustomed to calling themselves nothing less  than Great Russians for a century or two. Actually, it makes no  difference whether they had good reason to call themselves this  or were mere pretenders. The meaning with which they invested  this title is also unimportant. We simply have to realize that  Russia did show the world its potential for large-scale, and  even global expansionism for several centuries, until it had  completely exhausted itself and the nations it had conquered and  was forced to retreat from all continents, back to the borders  of the enfeebled empire, under the pressure of the  unquestionably stronger force of the rest of mankind, the world  community, and not just the West.    We are firmly convinced that Russia will never be an empire  again: Anything else would contradict all of the known natural  tendencies in the progression of historical events and the  biographies of all empires. We are not capable, however, of  communicating this knowledge to not only the Russian hawks and  eagles, not only the Russian super-nationalist crusaders, but  even the average Russian--yesterday's Great Russian.  Furthermore, our references to this obvious historical fact  might only complicate the Russians' own acknowledgement of this  fact. Sooner or later the Russians will realize this themselves:  In the final analysis, there has never been a nation that  completely lost its ability to judge its own behavior accurately  and change it in response to cardinal changes in the basic  circumstances of its existence. We have to be patient, tactful,  considerate, and kind. We also have to be active participants in  dialogue, however, because we are fated to be neighbors. Our  activities have to take the form of confessions rather than  sermons. We have to teach the Russians as much as we can about  ourselves instead of telling them about themselves. Regrettably,  they know virtually nothing about the Ukrainian soul, although  they have always called their own soul enigmatic, and they still  believe this. It is possible that we also do not know everything  about ourselves, but it would be useful to inform the Russians  now and then that the Ukrainians will never accept the myth of  the "thousand-year Russian state"--the myth that the Ukrainians  are not a nation, that the Cathedral of St. Sophia in Kiev can  belong to the state-controlled Moscow Church forever, and that  our 700-year struggle for the restoration of our own state has  been the result of the whims of nationalists, who for some  reason have passed their ideas down to each new generation, no  matter how much they have been violated and eradicated by all  barbarous and "civilized" methods. This is not an invocation:  These are the facts of Ukrainian history, which became,  regrettably, the facts of Russian history as well.    I will not mention the fact that half of the Ukrainian  nationality was exterminated by Moscow during just the Soviet  period: Convincing proof of this was presented at the recent  "Famine-33" international science conference in Kiev. We invite  thinking Russians to take a closer look at the tendencies in the  development of Ukrainian-Russian coexistence, and not just  Russia's present superiority in terms of brute military force  and economic strength. The Ukrainophobes are right: 90 percent  of the feelings expressed on 1 December 1991 were signs of  Khmelnitskiy-ism, Mazepa-ism, Petlyura-ism, and Bandera-ism (I  am deliberately using these Russian ideological cliches). This  means that in spite of all defeats and retreats, the will of  Ukrainians to establish themselves as a nation on the land of  their thousand-year-old ancestors will never be broken. It will  be extinguished only when the last Ukrainian dies. The new  Russian leaders' encouragement of our people to achieve this  goal will obviously depend on the consequences they foresee for  the Russian people. The historical precedents of the Aztecs, the  Mayans, the North American Indians, the Australian Aborigines,  or Russia's own Northern nationalities belong to other times and  other states of human civilization and should not concern even  the patriots of the old Russia. These mass sacrifices of some  ethnic groups on the altars of others can no longer serve as an  alibi for today's champions of old traditions. Furthermore, the  Ukrainian nationality is a special case: No one could destroy it  even in the 750 years it had to live without a state of its own,  even in the brutal barbarian ages. A holocaust against the  Ukrainian nationality is not a realistic or predictable stage of  Russian history. Just look at how the body of Russia is already  being devoured by Moscow's ancien-regime reaction to the  attitudes of Tatarstan or Chechnya, turning healthy processes in  these regions into dangerously unhealthy ones.    Even the general public in Ukraine has heard of some of the  analytical recommendations Russian strategists have made with  regard to policy toward Ukraine: The memorable notes of Vladimir  Lukin are a good example. It is clear that these were only  fragments, metaphorically speaking, of something like a Russian  "Barbarossa Plan" for Ukraine, the rough draft of an Anschluss.  We have to let the Russian politicians and experts know that, in  spite of all their secret codes, hostile intentions of this kind  cannot fail to evoke the appropriate reaction in the Ukrainian  mind. Even if these official and unofficial Russian state  secrets were to be guarded more closely than they are today,  Russia's political practice of weakening and eradicating  Ukrainian independence in every way possible is sowing the seeds  of resentment in the souls of millions of citizens and  demoralizing millions of Russians.    Ukraine is defending itself. It is not doing this to the  fullest extent yet, but I simply want to point out the fact that  anyone defending his honor and dignity and his right to exist is  always in a position of moral superiority to those who infringe  them. These feelings are familiar to the Russians themselves,  and they were instrumental in shaping their patriotism--from the  battles of Kulikovo and Lake Chudskoye to those of Borodino and  Stalingrad. Perhaps this simple reminder will help them  understand the contemporary origins of Ukrainian patriotism.    Here is the second thesis: The Russians might be interested  in knowing that foreigners regard the Kremlin dreamers' emphasis  on the so-called Russian-speaking population as a disastrous  form of self-deception. They see it as an unscientific and  adventuristic notion--and, consequently, as just another utopia.  This can be judged from the heightened activity of the Ukrainian  communities in Russia and other CIS countries, representatives  of which are in frequent contact with us. We are not encouraging  our fellow-countrymen from nearby foreign countries to remember  the shocking recent horrors of their de-Ukrainization and the  disdain for all of their human rights and liberties as long as  they had the courage to remain Ukrainian. The elements of  apartheid and national segregation that were used against them  are common knowledge. I simply want to say something about the  ineradicable features of national identity, and not only in the  Ukrainians: Canadians do not cease to be Canadian, regardless of  whether they speak French or English. Africans or Indians do not  become French or English simply on linguistic grounds. The  imaginary successes of Russophile propaganda--in east Ukraine,  for example--are transparent when they have to serve as the  basis for the strategy of the territorial segmentation of our  state along linguistic lines. In short, I am advising  consideration of the effects of today's actions on Ukraine and  on Russia. All of us are aware of the value of the euphoria of  public rallies and the speed with which these attitudes can  change, and we are also aware, on the other hand, of the staying  power of the fundamental qualities and characteristics of ethnic  communities. In view of the fact that the Ukrainian-Russians  already Russified the northern principalities and now have no  intention whatsoever of Ukrainizing Russia, we have the right  and obligation to let everyone know that Russia will never  conquer Ukraine. It will only defeat itself by arousing  Ukrainian resistance. This is something we do not want.    We can and must discuss some of the other illusions that are  engendered, like nightmares, when the intellect is dozing. We  can and must speak of the political games that are being played  with the various "zones"--economic, informational, etc.--that  are compounding hypocrisy and fraud and, consequently, their own  futility. This applies to the efforts to disguise expansionism  first as internationalism, then as integration, and then as  other developments described in "Latin" terms, with which they  are unpatriotically violating the great Russian language,  because it obviously does not contain enough insidious  euphemisms. My third thesis is that we must not confine  ourselves to phantom-terms in the hope of deceiving one another.  People usually fall prey to the very mythology they invent for  export. One of the latest examples of this was the global  self-deception and self-blinding of the omnipotent CPSU.    Here is my last thesis: There is still time to stop the  Russo-Ukrainian arms race, still time to begin mutual  psychological, political, and every other kind of disarmament.  We realize that thousands of qualified experts on Nicaragua,  Cuba, Angola, and Afghanistan are now unoccupied in Moscow's  many institutes, and they have a strong subjective wish to  exonerate themselves for the failures on all continents by  turning their attention to their fraternal neighbors. But would  it not be better to put the rich organizational, procedural,  diplomatic, and other experience Moscow accumulated in the talks  with Washington to good use along the Moscow-Kiev axis? After  all, it is unlikely that any of us can find a reasonable  explanation for today's absolutely unanticipated reversal: The  new Russia is cultivating a sincere friendship with America and  is constantly fighting with Ukraine.</p>

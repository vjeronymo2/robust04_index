			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE SETS BACK ACLU'S PUSH FOR PROP. F POLICE PANEL  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge dealt the ACLU a setback Thursday in its effort to force  the city to implement a police review board with investigative powers.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Kevin M. Midlam issued a narrow ruling against the  American Civil Liberties Union, which is trying to get one of two ballot  measures on police review panels put into effect. Both measures were passed by  voters in November.  </P> <P> However, the judge expressed concern that voters were confused by the competing  ballot measures. One of the measures called for a review panel with  investigative powers, the other for a panel without the powers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Method of Challenge  </P> <P> Midlam ruled that state law requires, in matters involving changes in city  charters such as the creation of the review board, that the legal challenge be  brought by the state attorney general or with his approval. The ACLU had argued  that such action is not necessary in this case.  </P> <P> "We believe the route we've taken with the court is the proper one," said Betty  Wheeler, legal director for the ACLU of San Diego and Imperial counties, after  the decision. "We do not believe this is a case that requires the attorney  general."  </P> <P> Wheeler said the group is undecided about its next step. But she said that,  rather than turn to the attorney general, it is more likely that the  organization will appeal Midlam's ruling.  </P> <P> The ruling is a blow to the ACLU's attempt to force the city to implement  Proposition F, which would set up a police review board with the power to  subpoena officers to testify in closed hearings about allegations of  misconduct. A competing measure, City Council-sponsored Proposition G, sets up  a review panel that has no subpoena or other investigative powers.  </P> <P> Both ballot proposals received majority "yes" votes in November.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A 'Killer Clause'  </P> <P> Proposition F passed by a 179,102 to 155,341 vote, and Proposition G passed  179,917 to 160,166. But the city attorney ruled that, because Proposition G  received more "yes" votes and contained a "killer clause" calling for its  implementation should both measures pass, its board was the one that should be  created.  </P> <P> Midlam ruled only on the narrow issue of whether the suit had to be brought by  the attorney general or with his approval. He said he could not rule on the  question of which or how many boards should be created unless the case is  brought with the participation or approval of the attorney general.  </P> <P> But, in comments accompanying his ruling, he indicated that he is frustrated by  the confusion voters faced in choos  </P> <P> ing between the two propositions. Midlam rejected Wheeler's contention that the  panels could exist simultaneously.  </P> <P> He called the proposals poorly drafted legislation, but said that to create a  second panel would "add insult to injury."  </P> <P> Midlam said that, although the wording of Proposition G appeared to mean that  its passage took precedence over Proposition F, nothing in the ballot arguments  that accompanied the propositions made that point clear to voters. He suggested  that setting aside the results and holding another election might be one way to  settle the dispute.  </P> <P> Harry Eastus, general manager of the San Diego Police Officers Assn., said his  organization welcomed the ruling, but he expects the legal challenges to  continue.  </P> <P> "It is only Round 1, so to speak," said Eastus, whose group has joined the city  in its defense of the suit.  </P> <P> The suit has not stopped the city from trying to implement the weaker board  required by Proposition G. The city manager's office has narrowed a group of  about 75 to 100 board applicants to fewer than 25 finalists, said George Penn,  an assistant to the city manager. Penn said board members could be appointed  next week and the panel could hold its first meeting in June.  </P></p>

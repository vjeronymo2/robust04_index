			<p>BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 12 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the republic of Srpska assembly, said this evening  that the republic of Srpska rejected the Vienna agreement  between the Muslims and Croats, by which they were asking for 58  percent of the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina.    "This is a provocation and a form of pressure by the Muslims  and their overlords and is out of the question," Krajisnik said  in a statement for Radio Jagodina. "Whatever is over 50 percent  of the territory--regardless of quality--is out of the  question," he specified.    "Percentages--how much territory everyone will get--depend  on  numerous elements in this struggle and these divisions,"  Krajisnik stressed. "Without maps, everything is an auction and  pressure." "I cannot see where the Muslims and Croats got the  idea that they are entitled to so much territory, they simply  cannot lay claim to it--they are neither military nor moral  victors--unless some of their mentors want this in order to  monitor the Serbs more easily," Krajisnik underlined.    Commenting on tomorrow's Geneva meeting, Krajisnik said:  "There might be some results because this high-level gathering  will also include those who want peace in these regions."    "Some other forces want war in the case of Brcko, and they  are instigating the Muslims and Croats; if it were not for Brcko  they would have passed a resolution that we would oppose and  would thus have rekindled the war," Krajisnik said. "Posavina  is of vital importance for the national interest of the Serbian  people and there is no such force that could occupy it."    "We were embittered at our assembly in Brcko because of  Muslim shelling--we had let them pass through our territories so  many times, we had forgiven and yielded so much, they could have  displayed at least a semblance of respect during the assembly,  at least toward civilians and the innocent," Krajisnik  underlined.</p>

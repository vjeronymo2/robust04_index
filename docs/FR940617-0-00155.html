A FEL must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expressed to the same number of decimal places as the applicable emission standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Gross power <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the power measured at the crankshaft or its equivalent, the engine being equipped only with the standard accessories (such as oil pumps, coolant pumps, and so forth) necessary for its operation on the test bed. Alternators must be used, if necessary, to run the engine. Fans, air conditioners, and other accessories may be used at the discretion of the manufacturer, but no power adjustments for these accessories may be made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Identification number <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a specification (for example, model number/serial number combination) which allows a particular nonroad engine to be distinguished from other similar engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Locomotive <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a self-propelled piece of on-track equipment (other than equipment designed for operation both on highways and rails, specialized maintenance equipment, and other similar equipment) designed for moving other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment, freight or passenger traffic.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Model year (MY) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means the manufacturer's annual new model production period which includes January 1 of the calendar year, ends no later than December 31 of the calendar year, and does not begin earlier than January 2 of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous calendar year. Where a manufacturer has no annual new model production period, model year means calendar year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> New, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for the purposes of this part, means a domestic or imported nonroad engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad equipment the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. Where the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equitable or legal title to the engine, vehicle, or equipment is not transferred to an ultimate purchaser until after the engine, vehicle or equipment is placed into service, then the engine, vehicle, or equipment will no longer be new after it is placed into service. A nonroad engine, vehicle, or equipment is placed into service when it is used for its functional purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonroad compression-ignition engine <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a nonroad engine which utilizes the compression-ignition combustion cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonroad engine <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Except as discussed in paragraph (2) of this definition, a nonroad engine is any internal combustion engine:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) in or on a piece of equipment that is self-propelled or serves a dual purpose by both propelling itself and performing another function (such as garden tractors, off-highway mobile cranes and bulldozers); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) in or on a piece of equipment that is intended to be propelled while performing its function (such as lawnmowers and string trimmers); or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) that, by itself or in or on a piece of equipment, is portable or transportable, meaning designed to be and capable of being carried or moved from one location to another. Indicia of transportability include, but are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited to, wheels, skids, carrying handles, dolly, trailer, or platform.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) An internal combustion engine is not a nonroad engine if:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) the engine is used to propel a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition, or is subject to standards promulgated under section 202 of the Act; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) the engine is regulated by a federal New Source Performance Standard promulgated under section 111 of the Act; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) the engine otherwise included in paragraph (1)(iii) of this definition remains or will remain at a location for more than 12 consecutive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> months or a shorter period of time for an engine located at a seasonal source. A location is any single site at a building, structure, facility, or installation. Any engine (or engines) that replaces an engine at a location and that is intended to perform the same or similar function as the engine replaced will be included in calculating the consecutive time period. An engine located at a seasonal source is an engine that remains at a seasonal source during the full annual operating period of the seasonal source. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seasonal source is a stationary source that remains in a single location on a permanent basis (i.e., at least two years) and that operates at that single location approximately three months (or more) each year. This paragraph does not apply to an engine after the engine is removed from the location.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonroad equipment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means equipment that is powered by nonroad engines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonroad vehicle <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means a vehicle that is powered by a nonroad engine as defined in this section and that is not a motor vehicle or a vehicle used solely for competition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nonroad vehicle or nonroad equipment manufacturer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means any person engaged in the manufacturing or assembling of new nonroad vehicles or equipment or importing such vehicles or equipment for resale, or who acts for and is under the control of any such person in connection with the distribution of such vehicles or equipment.

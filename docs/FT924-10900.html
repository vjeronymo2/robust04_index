			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Nissan Diesel posts Y119m half-year loss NISSAN Diesel, the leading Japanese truckmaker which is part of the Nissan Motor group, yesterday announced a net loss of Y119m (Dollars 972,000) in the six months to the end of September. The sharp downturn in domestic and overseas truck markets, combined with heavy spending on research and development, pushed the company into operating losses for the first half of Y1.42bn, a swing of more than Y3bn from its Y1.61bn operating profits in the first half of last year. The company said it would be passing its interim dividend payment, which was Y2.5 a share last year. It made pre-tax profits of Y533m but only due to Y1.2bn from a sale of part of its securities holdings. Nissan Diesel said it expected to make pre-tax profits for the year of Y1.5bn, a fall of 55.3 per cent from last year, on a projected 8.5 per cent fall in sales to Y345,000m. The downturn in truck markets was confirmed by Hino Motors, the leading Japanese truckmaker which said its pre-tax profits for the first six months of the financial year were 59 per cent down at Y2.84bn. Hino, part of the Toyota Motor Group, said it would maintain its interim dividend at last year's Y3 per share. Hino is managing to weather the storm better than Nissan Diesel. It managed to limit its fall in sales to a 2.5 per cent drop to Y307.24bn. This was largely due to a surge in exports which rose by 22.3 per cent, mainly with higher sales in south-east Asia. Hino is forecasting a full year pre-tax profit of Y6bn, down 40 per cent from last year. In a separate development Toyota, Japan's largest carmaker, said it was cutting worldwide car production by 90,000 this year, from 4.78m units last year. The company said the move was a result of a 150,000 drop in domestic sales and tighter limits on exports to the US. Japan exported 550,073 cars, buses and trucks in September, an 8.1 per cent rise from the previous year.</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE HIKES FHA LOAN CAP IN HIGH-COST AREAS  </P> <P> The Senate on Tuesday approved an increase in the FHA loan ceiling for  high-cost areas from $101,250 to $125,000 in a compromise move to provide some  help to home buyers in such places as Southern California and metropolitan New  York.  </P> <P> Responding to objections by the Bush Administration and lawmakers from rural  states, however, the Senate refused to eliminate the ceiling and to base  Federal Housing Administration lending limits on median statewide or areawide  housing costs. That proposal, from the Appropriations Committee, would have  allowed the FHA to make loans up to $153,900 in California and up to $189,000  in the New York region.  </P> <P> Sen. Don Nickles (D-Okla.) argued successfully that a ceiling based on housing  costs could raise the FHA's liability and expose the government agency to  increased defaults. The Senate rejected his proposal for a $118,000 ceiling for  high-cost areas but when he tried again with a cap of $125,000, it sailed  through on a voice vote.  </P> <P> Under present law, FHA loans for residential housing are limited to 95% of the  median price in an area, subject to an overall national ceiling of $67,500  except for high-cost areas. In those areas there is the special ceiling of  $101,250.  </P> <P> Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) argued that real estate prices in California are  so high -- with a median cost of $153,900 for a single-family home -- that the  FHA has been "simply knocked out of the market."  </P> <P> The 5% down payment allowed by FHA, he said, is a strong incentive for  first-time home buyers who may have good incomes but lack the funds to put down  the higher amounts required with a conventional mortgage loan.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Help the Rich'  </P> <P> "The FHA will be stronger under this proposal because of better credit risks it  will be insuring," Cranston argued.  </P> <P> Nickles, however, said that the FHA is already losing money -- $500 million in  1988 -- and that it cannot afford to take even greater risks. Senate Minority  Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) sided with Nickles, contending that FHA loan defaults  are at the $2-billion level already.  </P> <P> Proponents of the higher FHA ceilings, Dole said, are "reaching out to help the  rich" buy expensive homes.  </P> <P> The measure approved Tuesday is part of a $67.2-billion measure pending before  the Senate that will finance federal housing, veterans, space and environmental  programs for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. If the bill passes, it would be  considered by a Senate-House conference committee.  </P></p>

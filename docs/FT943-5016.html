			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd's attracts US insurer Medical Insurance Exchange of California, a professional liability insurer, has become the latest organisation to take advantage of the drive by Lloyd's of London to attract corporate investors. The US group will begin contributing its corporate capacity to the Lloyd's market for 1995, and is expected to write premium income of about Pounds 5m. It will allocate its capacity to specialist medical malpractices syndicates. Stace Barr has been appointed as MIE's Lloyd's adviser. Lloyd's currently has 25 corporate member groups, the first to be allowed since the insurance market changed its rules a year ago in a radical move to allow investors to take advantage of limited liability. The new protected members have been backed by institutional and private money and have been able to contribute Pounds 1.6bn in capacity for the 1994 underwriting year.</p>

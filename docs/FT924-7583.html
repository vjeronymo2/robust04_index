			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Union challenge to 24-hour banking THE Bifu banking, insurance and finance union is considering industrial action against TSB, Britain's sixth biggest bank, which is planning an around-the-clock telephone banking service. The experimental telephone service, staffed 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, will offer full banking and insurance services. Bifu, which represents about 90 per cent of TSB's 25,000 employees in Britain, believes the changes, which TSB is to evaluate with a view to their introduction nationally, are bound to mean job cuts and a poorer career structure, with fewer branch-manager posts and a reduction in skilled jobs. Mr David Carter, Bifu north-east England organiser, said: 'It will set the precedent nationally. We aren't going to stand in the way of progress but it's a question of how they do it.' The Teleservice project is part of an Pounds 8.5m package of measures, including weekday evening and all-day Saturday opening, which are being introduced as a prototype into Tyneside, a TSB strong-hold. TSB said the experiment, which included increased automation of branches and the closure of a small number of its 22 Tyneside outlets, was aimed at enhancing its services. It would not mean job losses. Tyneside has been chosen for the experiment because it has a strong TSB customer base and a large network of branches. The bank is also investing Pounds 1.5m in its sole Watford branch to see if upgraded services there can win more customers. The Gateshead-based service, initially for use only by Tyneside and Watford TSB customers, has started operating during the day, but will start around-the-clock operation in February.</p>

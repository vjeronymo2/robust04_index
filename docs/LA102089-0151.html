			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BREEDING BIRDS: AMERICAN COOT;  </P> <P> AMERICAN COOT, (CALYPTE ANNA)  </P> <P> Description: Black head and neck, with small reddish-brown forehead shield,  light bill with dark band near tip. Outer feathers of undertail coverts are  white, inner ones black. Leg color ranges from greenish-gray in young birds to  yellow or orangish in adults. In flight, a white trailing edge on most of wing  is distinctive.  </P> <P> Habitat: Freshwater marshes, wetlands or near lakes and ponds.  </P> <P> Diet: Mostly aquatic vegetation and algae; also tadpoles, fish, crustaceans,  snails, worms, aquatic and terrestrial insects, eggs of other marsh- nesting  birds.  </P> <P> Displays: Male paddles after female, flapping wings; female dives if too  closely pressed. Male paddles with head and neck on water, wingtips raised  above, spreads and elevates tail to display white patches. Female assumes  similar pose. .  </P> <P> Nest: Usually over water, in vegetation tall enough to conceal; consists of  large floating cup of dead stems on platforms anchored to vegetation, lined  with finer materials. Other platforms for resting and roosting, especially  brood platform built mostly by male.  </P> <P> Eggs: Pinkish-buff, marked with blackish-brown. Eggs are around 1.9 inches  long.  </P> <P> Natural history notes: Each year from October to April, Orange County is  inundated with American coots. Last year, 50 permits to shoot coots were  issued, mostly to golf courses. Mission Viejo, Woodbridge (Irvine) and many  other communities with man-made lakes have the same complaint annually about  these birds. They eat vegetation, destroy grass and defecate widely.  Considering flocks may number up to 1,500 birds, coots may readily attain pest  status.  </P> <P> Coots are noisy and aggressively territorial. They select from a repertoire of  some 14 displays to communicate among themselves. Not only are coots  demonstrative, they are also hardy. They can adjust quite well to hot  temperatures. They have lobed feet, which, in addition to their use in battle,  can effectively conduct heat out of the body.  </P> <P> They are opportunistic feeders. Besides hunting for themselves, coots also feed  commensally by taking leftovers from other species such as dabbling ducks, or  pirate plants brought to the surface by diving ducks. Groups of up to five  juveniles may pirate aquatic vegetation from the bills of ducks and swans.  </P> <P> These birds are the least graceful of all marsh birds. Commonly called  "splatterers," coots bob their heads while walking, quite likely because the  head movements help them to judge the distance to their prey.  </P> <P> Breeding bird atlas: To report bird breeding activity in your neighborhood, or  to get information on the breeding bird atlas (now in its fifth and final  year), call Sea and Sage Audubon Society members Sylvia Gallagher, (714)  962-8990, or Nancy Kenyon, (714) 786-3160.  </P> <P> vl,12  </P> <P> Note: Map is divided into 5-kilometer squares so that Audubon Society  volunteers can more easily survey areas on a regular basis.  </P> <P> Sources: Sea and Sage Audubon Society; "The Birder's Handbook," Ehrlich, Dobkin  and Wheye, Fireside Books (1988); "Field Guide to the Birds of North America,"  National Geographic Society (1987); "Birds of Southern California: Status and  Distribution," Garrett and Dunn, Los Angeles Audubon Society (1981).  </P></p>

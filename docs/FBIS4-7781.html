			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 5 (AFP) -- Hundreds of refugees  poured into Gorazde from neighbouring villages Tuesday as Serb  forces pressed on with an offensive against the Moslem enclave  in eastern Bosnia, the United Nations said.    According to UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR]  spokesman Kris Janowski, 52 people have died and 249 had been  wounded in the week-old offensive.    Radio Sarajevo put the toll even higher: at least 73 dead  and over 300 injured.    Witnesses reported eight villages destroyed by Serb  artillery  in the southern part of the enclave, leaving some 1,500 people  wandering around looking for shelter, the UN refugee agency said.    Major Rob Annink, a spokesman for the UN Protection Force  [UNPROFOR] in Sarajevo, said Serb forces had penetrated eight to  10 kilometers (five to six miles) into the southern part of the  enclave and were continuing their attacks on the northeast and  southeast sectors.    There were conflicting reports on how far the Serbs were  from  Gorazde itself. Annink said they were 10 kilometers (six miles)  away, but one military source speaking on condition of anonymity  put them at just over three kilometers (two miles) from the  southern suburbs of the town.    Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic spoke by telephone with  the U.S. Secretary of State Warren Cristopher about the  situation in Gorazde as well as with President Clinton's special  envoy Charles Redman and UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi.    At the end of a special meeting, the Bosnian Presidency  issued a statement informing the Bosnian Army and population  that "they have to be ready for all contingencies."    "The situation in Gorazde and Bihac (another besieged Moslem  enclave, in northwestern Bosnia) as well as the ethnic cleansing  are proof that, unfortunately, the war is not over," the  statement said.    The fighting in Gorazde and Bihac comes as ceasefires are  generally holding in Sarajevo and central Bosnia.    Around 300 people marched in Sarajevo Tuesday to protest  what  they called the international community's indifference to Serb  aggression.</p>

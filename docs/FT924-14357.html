			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Irish government to sell ACCBank THE IRISH government has put up for sale ACCBank, a banking network of 45 branches with deposits of IPounds 535m, a loan book of IPounds 482m and total assets worth IPounds 741m. The price tag was thought to be in the region of IPounds 60m, or Pounds 62.7m. The finance ministry said 'all interested parties will be given an opportunity to bid'. It had also reiterated its intention to sell another state bank known as ICCBank, which had been on the market for two years. 'A decision to sell these bodies will depend on the sale terms being acceptable to the government,' the ministry said. ACCBank recently reported pre-tax profits of IPounds 3.6m for the first half of 1992, and had strengthened considerably since its restructuring in 1987, when it suffered substantial losses. The bank was originally established by the state in the 1920s to provide loans exclusively to the agricultural sector, but now trades as an ordinary high street bank. ICC Bank is an industrial credit institution and was thought to have a price tag in the region of IPounds 40m. The branch network and loan book of ACCBank will be a valuable addition to a number of Irish financial institutions looking to extend their banking operations in the republic. The most interested contenders were thought to be Woodchester/Credit Lyonnais, Ulster Bank, Irish Permanent Building Society, and the National Irish Bank.</p>

			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / UN optimistic on agreement over Cyprus AN agreement over Cyprus could move a step closer with a new round of talks due to begin in October, according to a report yesterday to the United Nations Security Council, Michael Littlejohns reports from New York. Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, who arranged intensive negotiations between Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot leaders, said the international community expected such an accord. Turkish-Cypriots want more than 29 per cent of the island in a federated state that would have political equality with a Greek-Cypriot federated state in a single sovereign, secular Cyprus republic.</p>

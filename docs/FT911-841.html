			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Hogg to cut involvement at Courtaulds SIR CHRISTOPHER Hogg, chairman and chief executive of Courtaulds, the speciality materials manufacturer, will in August relinquish his position as chief executive, clearing the way for Mr Sipko Huismans, the group's managing director, to take over. Yesterday's announcement of Sir Christopher's impending move to part-time chairman, marks a further stage in the company's evolution during his 11 1/2 years as chairman and chief executive. Mr Huismans' appointment is indicative of Courtaulds' internationalisation in recent years: he will be the first non-Englishman to hold a position of such seniority. When Sir Christopher became chairman and chief executive at the start of 1980 Courtaulds was an ailing textiles and chemicals conglomerate. He has overseen a transformation through rationalisation and internationalisation which culminated in the demerger of Courtaulds Textiles and Courtaulds in 1990. Mr Huismans said of Sir Christopher: 'He took a group which was an unwieldy mess and turned it into two sensible, sizeable companies.' Sir Christopher's move is bound to provoke speculation that he plans to move to another senior job in industry. He will leave the chief executive post on August 1, a day before his 55th birthday, still significantly younger than many chairmen of comparable industrial groups. However, he said he had no plans beyond fulfilling his duties as part time chairman of Courtaulds, Courtaulds Textiles and Reuters, the financial information group. Although Sir Christopher said there was 'non-hidden agenda' in the move he did not rule out moving to another post in due course. Mr Huismans, who was born in the Netherlands, joined Courtaulds 30 years ago as a chemist in Swaziland after an education in South Africa. He has been managing director of Courtaulds for the last two years. His appointment, with a main background in sales and marketing, will present a significant change of style from the quietly spoken and intellectual Sir Christopher. With the radical restructuring of the group largely completed Mr Huismans said his main task would be to raise performance throughout the group to the highest international standards.

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Survey of Argentina (9): No guarantee of stability - Mr Menem's chances of re-election look strong Last year President Carlos Menem's chances of fulfilling his over-arching ambition of removing the constitution's ban on successive presidential terms and standing for re-election to a second term looked remote. Now, the constitution is being changed and already Mr Menem looks unbeatable in the 1995 elections. Mr Menem achieved this by enlisting the opposition Radical party - which had used its blocking minority of 84 seats in the lower house of Congress to prevent reform - as allies in amending the US-style 1853 constitution. In a deal last December with his old rival Raul Alfonsin, the Radical leader and former president, Mr Menem agreed to a constitutional reform formula that strengthens the judiciary and legislature and introduces a semi-parliamentary form of government in exchange for being allowed to stand for a second term. Most Argentines are treating the reform process with considerable cynicism. Rosendo Fraga, a political commentator, says: 'None of these reforms are essential. The only reason for reform is Menem's re-election. The other clauses are only there to justify this.' But optimists, especially those in the business world, say a second Menem term will further extend the horizon of political stability, allowing his free market reforms to consolidate themselves. Mr Menem has stated repeatedly that he will reappoint Domingo Cavallo as his economy minister. However, many foreign executives would have preferred a Chilean-style transition in which the direction of economic policy has remained unchanged, in spite of two changes of government. The core of the new constitution is contained in a Congressional resolution passed last December with a two-thirds majority with unanimous backing from Mr Menem's Peronist party and the Radicals. The resolution's text was drafted in secret by Radical and Peronist negotiators. The two sides agreed that an assembly elected in April to rewrite the constitution must accept or reject this reform package without any modification. In addition to the reforms already agreed by the two parties, Congress has allowed the assembly to introduce additional changes such as introducing referenda or entrenching consumer rights in the constitution. Pollsters say that although the public shows little interest in the constitutional reform process, it seems content to allow a successful government to continue in office for a second term. However, a second term for Mr Menem creates as many doubts as it does certainties. There are those who believe he will do little to strengthen Argentina's weak democratic institutions: no other president in Argentina's history has resorted to emergency decrees - 308 of them in four years - as much as Mr Menem has. The draft constitution is vague on congressional ratification of presidential decrees. It does not say whether Congress may even overturn decrees. Successful economic reforms are the foundations of Mr Menem's political popularity. But Manuel Mora y Araujo, a pollster, warns that Mr Menem may be making a serious mistake by believing that economic stability and growth are sufficient to satisfy voters. He says: 'People want other things. People have other priorities. The dominating themes today are unemployment, corruption, education, health.' However, few politicians are responding to these demands. The Radicals have been discredited by Mr Alfonsin's disastrous 1983-89 government and his alliance with Mr Menem. Mr Mora y Araujo also notes a deepening contempt for conventional politics and politicians. These factors, plus a strong anti-corruption message, account for the rise of the Frente Grande, a loose coalition of left wing parties, dissident Peronists and environmental groups. The Frente is led by Carlos Alvarez, a charismatic Congressman. He says: 'Our view is that most officials are part of a corrupt system and Menem allows and generates and approves of corruption'. The Frente carried the federal district of Buenos Aires during the April 10 elections for delegates to the constituent assembly and took 14 per cent of the national vote, finishing third behind the Radicals. Still, few analysts believe Mr Alvarez threatens Mr Menem's re-election. A diplomat commented that the elections were more akin to a by-election in which voters registered discontent. But in a presidential election they would probably cast their vote for Mr Menem. There are those who wonder how Mr Menem would react to an economic downturn. Many fear his latent populist tendencies would come to the surface. A former minister says he worries about Mr Menem's 'authoritarian tendencies'. Mr Menem is given to lashing out at critics with incendiary statements. He has compared the opposition press to terrorists and bomb throwers. He has said human rights campaigners are 'attempting to undermine the foundation of the institutions, including the armed forces. We will never again tolerate subversion in our country'. Neither is Mr Menem, in spite of his protestations, in the best of health. Last October he underwent emergency surgery to remove a blockage in the carotid artery which carries blood to the brain. Mr Menem came dangerously close to an incapacitating stroke. It also emerged that he suffers from diabetes. His deteriorating health has made the once unattractive post of vice-president a desirable political prize, with several Peronists discreetly pressing their claims. However, Mr Menem has said his running mate will be Eduardo Duhalde, his vice-president until his election as governor of Buenos Aires. If Mr Menem were to disappear from the scene, his successor could change course abruptly. Mr Duhalde is a consummate machine politician with little attachment to Mr Cavallo's economic policies. Mr Cavallo's tight control over spending and unpredictable outbursts of fury have made him deeply unpopular in the government. In May he stormed out of a cabinet meeting shrieking that fellow ministers were conspiring against him. Argentina's weak political institutions, further unsettled by the constitutional reform process, and its history of violent, unpredictable upheaval mean that Mr Menem's re-election does not guarantee that stability will continue.</p>

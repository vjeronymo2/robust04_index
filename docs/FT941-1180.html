			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / BA fare cuts set to spark price war British Airways yesterday announced a package of bargain fares for customers booking within the next three weeks. The cuts, ranging from a third to a half, have been made in an attempt to attract more leisure travellers. Virgin Atlantic immediately pledged to file new fares in the next few days to counter the BA move. Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chief, said: 'We will never let BA undercut us.' BA said savings of more than Pounds 300 could be made on trips to the Far East or Mexico, Pounds 200 to the Caribbean and Pounds 100 to the US, South Africa and Europe. Trips to Europe or North America must include a Saturday night and those elsewhere must be for at least a week. Backed by a Pounds 3m advertising campaign, tickets go on sale today and include return flights from London to New York for Pounds 239 - saving Pounds 110 on the lowest BA fare. Under the World Offers scheme, which lasts until April 15, a ticket to Mexico will cost Pounds 349 (saving Pounds 387); and Jamaica will cost Pounds 539 (saving Pounds 250). Mr Robert Ayling, BA group managing director, said yesterday: 'We want to be the leisure traveller's favourite airline as well as the business traveller's' BA added that these discounted fares are not eligible for air miles on their Executive Club frequent flyer programme. Only full-fare tickets are eligible for air mile credits.</p>

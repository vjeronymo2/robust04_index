			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Olympics flurry subsides among markets EQUITIES finished lower after shedding early gains, mainly on arbitrage-linked trading and selling linked to the expiry of margin contracts, agencies report from Tokyo. The 225-share Nikkei average lost 213.42, or 1 per cent, to 20,094.11, after an intraday high of 20,384.44 and low of 20,000.00 . Volume was estimated at about 200m shares, compared to 303m on Friday. Declines outscored advances by 607 to 379, with 176 stocks unchanged. The Topix index fell 11.00 to 1,620.36, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index put on 1.23 at 1,247.78. The market opened firmer, led by buying of pharmaceutical and retail sectors, while strength in the Nikkei futures also helped encourage prices. Positive news from weekend talks by G7 delegates failed to excite much interest: the meeting in Washington urged Japan to reform its tax system and cut income taxes in an effort to revitalise the domestic economy. Pharmaceuticals rose on expectations that forthcoming biotechnology conferences could unveil new products. Sankyo moved ahead Y30 to Y2,970 and Eisai Y60 to Y2,060. Roundup THE destination of the 2000 Olympic Games, which caused a flurry in the region late last week, reverted mostly to the sports pages yesterday. HONG KONG fell as Sino-British talks on the colony ended with the UK saying the two sides were still far apart. The Hang Seng index dipped 72.96 to 7,452.09 as turnover shrank again, from HKDollars 3.22bn to HKDollars 2.16bn. Blue chips took the heaviest blows, with HSBC sliding HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 79, its Hang Seng Bank unit losing 50 cents to HKDollars 53 and Cheung Kong shedding 30 cents to HKDollars 26.90. But Henderson Land, which announced a 64 per cent jump in net profits on Friday, appreciated HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 22.70. BANGKOK traders decided that the market was a technical sell, while investors were kept on the sidelines by the impending enforcement of stricter rules on margin requirements. The SET index retreated 14.68, or 1.5 per cent, to 964.90 in thin turnover of Bt4.02bn. New rules on margin requirements, which will become effective on Friday, will force investors to sell stocks in their portfolios if share prices fall to certain levels. AUSTRALIA sobered after Friday's buying spree on the choice of Sydney as host city for the 2000 Olympics. The All Ordinaries index eased 3.5 to 1,943.0 as turnover slumped from ADollars 794.2m to ADollars 268.1m. Building and construction groups, the major movers last week, were little changed, although brokers said there was still selective off-shore buying on the Sydney Olympics theme. SEOUL decided that equities would rise after this week's Chusok holiday, and anticipated the gains with the composite index rising by 14.28, or just over 2 per cent, to 717.83. A broker said institutions had turned around from being recent net sellers. SINGAPORE saw late bargain hunting and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.10 to 1,989.35. But volume was mostly in Malaysian shares as it expanded from 287.8m shares to 324.3m. KUALA LUMPUR was led higher by second-line stocks. The KLSE composite index gained 5.45 at 851.94. SHANGHAI's China 'B' shares jumped after more than a month of consolidation. Instititutional investment buying attributed to both China and US funds lifted the Standard Chartered Securities Shanghai 'B' Share index by 3 points, or 5 per cent, to 63.46, while the SCS SHENZHEN 'B' Share index added only 0.48, or 0.8 per cent, at 63.6.</p>

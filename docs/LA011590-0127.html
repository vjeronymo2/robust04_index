			<p><P> January 15, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'FOURTH' STILL TOPS BOX OFFICE  </P> <P> Oliver Stone's "Born on the Fourth of July" again topped the weekend movie box  office chart, taking in $8 million at 1,315 theaters across the U.S. But the  film's business dipped 25% from its previous weekend grosses, the largest drop  by any of the top five films in wide national release.  </P> <P> Danny DeVito's marriage-on-the-rocks comedy, "The War of the Roses," kept its  affair with moviegoers going, grossing $5.8 million -- a 17% decline -- to  finish second while the Kurt Russell-Sylvester Stallone buddy-cops drama,  "Tango and Cash," held on to the No. 3 spot with a $5.4 million weekend.  </P> <P> Mike Figgis' "Internal Affairs," a violent drama about the investigation of a  corrupt Los Angeles cop, led all newcomers in the market, grossing a solid $5  million at 975 theaters. Three other new releases -- "Leatherface," a sequel to  "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," "Downtown," and "Ski Patrol" -- all did poor  opening weekend business while Ed Zwick's critically-praised Civil War drama,  "Glory," expanded from 8 to 392 screens where it averaged a very strong $7,653.  </P> <P> The weekend's top five: "Born on the Fourth of July" ($8 million for weekend,  $23.8 million total gross); "The War of the Roses" ($5.7 million, $61 million);  "Tango and Cash" ($5.4 million, $38.6 million); "Internal Affairs" ($5  million); and "Always" ($4.2 million, $26.1 million).  </P></p>

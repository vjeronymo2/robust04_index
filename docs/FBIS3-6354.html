			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 15 (KNS-KCNA) [dateline as received] --  The leading officials of organisations under the General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) released  statements denouncing criminal dumping of nuclear waste by the  South Korean authorities.    Om Chang-pom, chief director of the Federation of Korean  Traders and Industrialists in Japan, charged that the Kim  Yong-sam clique which has dumped radioactive substances into the  sea, ignoring the international convention totally banning it,  is, indeed, a group of savages who have no idea of the nation  and international law.    He urged the Kim Yong-sam clique to immediately stop seeking  confrontation and division in conspiracy with outside forces,  scrap the "National Security Law," an anti-reunification law,  and open to the public the amount of the nuclear waste they have  already dumped into the sea, its kinds and the dumping places  and apologize to the nation.    The chairman of the League of Korean Youth in Japan, Pak  Ku-ho, said that the grave anti-national, anti-human criminal  act committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is directly  linked with the nuclear weapon development that has been  promoted in secrecy and has already reached a dangerous stage in  South Korea.    "The purpose sought by the Kim Yong-sam group in its  malicious anti-DPRK smear campaign over the fictitious `nuclear  issue of the North' is to divert the attention of the people at  home and abroad to the North and then hasten its nuclear weapon  development," he emphasized.    So Cha-yon, chairwoman of the Democratic Union of Korean  Women in Japan, Pak Yong-kon, chairman of the Association of  Korean Social Scientists in Japan, and Kim Chong-su, chairman of  the Association of Koreans in Japan for Peaceful Reunification,  also denounced the nuclear waste dumping by the Kim Yong-sam  group as a towering crime against the nation and mankind.</p>

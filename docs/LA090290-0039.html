			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE USE OF ANTI-RACKETEERING LAW TO FIGHT SPEEDING TICKETS  </P> <P> I was a little upset as I read that Seal Beach lawyer Ernest J. Franceschi Jr.  had filed a federal case against Huntington Beach ("Huntington Beach Open to  Anti-Racketeering Suit," Aug. 23) for allegedly operating an illegal speed  trap.  </P> <P> As a Huntington Beach taxpayer, I was dismayed to see my tax dollars used to  fight Franceschi's self-serving and frivolous lawsuit.  </P> <P> Franceschi never denied that he was guilty of speeding the three times he was  cited; he hid behind a legal technicality to get off. Like most, when cited I  was guilty and I paid my fines.  </P> <P> I was outraged when I took a look at the photograph of Franceschi's new Porsche  and realized his license plates are from Oregon!  </P> <P> I work and live here and, therefore, pay for California license plates, which  are much more expensive than Oregon registration. What puts Franceschi above  the laws that the rest of us have to obey?  </P> <P> STEVE CHAUNCEY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

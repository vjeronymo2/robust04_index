			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / 500 jobs to go at Devonport naval dockyard PLYMOUTH'S Devonport naval dockyard, which earlier this year won a bitter battle to refit Britain's Trident nuclear submarines, yesterday announced plans to shed 500 jobs. The reduction, more than a tenth of its workforce, is more severe than was indicated by Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, in June. He predicted that the reorganised naval refitting programme would mean 350 job losses. Devonport Management (DML), which operates the dockyard, said it hoped to achieve the cut through voluntary redundancies. The reduction, to be carried out in the next six months, will leave a workforce of 4,400, one third of the level in the mid-1980s before the dockyard was placed under private-sector management. Redundancy payments will be borne by the government, which still owns the dockyard facilities. DML said the earlier government predictions were based on business forecasts for 2000. The company hoped that the level of employment would be maintained or increased by then, although not necessarily through permanent jobs. But Mr Bill Goffin, Plymouth district secretary of the AEEU electrical and engineering workers' union, said the latest job losses would not be the last. 'You can double that figure over the next six to 12 months,' he said. The announcement from DML came a week after confirmation from Mr Rifkind of the government's decision to concentrate future work on nuclear submarines at Devonport. This work has been the backbone of business for Devonport and the rival Rosyth yard in Scotland. In compensation, Rosyth is to be allocated more than half the programme of work on navy surface ships. Devonport will have to compete for remaining surface ship work against Rosyth and private-sector shipyards. Yesterday's announcement, while not unexpected, is a serious blow to the Plymouth area, where the dockyard is easily the biggest employer. Unemployment in the Plymouth travel-to-work area is well above the national average at 12.7 per cent. Devon County Council said: 'When Devonport catches a cold, the whole of Devon sneezes.' The decision showed the need for broadening the area's industrial base. 'We will being pushing even harder for government and European assistance.' The job cuts partly reflect a dip in DML's commercial business due to the completion of yacht-building contracts. Turnover in the current financial year to the end of March is expected to be similar to last year's at around Pounds 250m.</p>

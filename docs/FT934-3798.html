			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow ends just off record on growth hopes Wall Street US blue chip stocks gained ground yesterday, buoyed by last week's batch of good economic news and gathering strength in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. By the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 6.14 ahead at 3,710.21, just below the all-time closing high of 3,710.77 set on November 16. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 1.54 at 466.43. After a sharp early decline, the Nasdaq composite partially recovered to end 1.13 off at 771.09. Activity on the NYSE was heavy, with 292m shares dealt. With no fresh economic indicators to offer direction, investors had an opportunity to digest last week's stream of data, most of which pointed to strong, non-inflationary growth. A growing sense of optimism quickly translated into advances for blue chip issues. The bond market, which continued to weather the economic tide with surprising resilience, reinforced the positive sentiment. In late trading the inflation-sensitive 30-year government bond was 25/32 higher at 101 1/16 , as traders anticipated favourable retail and wholesale price data later this week. However, equities slipped from their earlier highs late in the session as investors began to book profits after nearly a week of steady gains. Seagram was near the top of the NYSE's most active list after a trust which manages finances for Mr Charles Bronfman, Seagram's co-chairman, sold 3.7m shares in the company for nearly Dollars 100m. The stock slipped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 26 3/4 . Mellon Bank was marked down Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 53 on news that it would take a Dollars 70m after-tax charge as a result of its agreed Dollars 1.85bn merger with Dreyfus, which climbed Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 46 3/8 . In other banking issues, Bankers Trust advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 79 1/4 , Citicorp was up Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 and JP Morgan put on Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 72 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, semiconductor issues fell sharply. Intel dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 59 1/2 after Merrill Lynch cut its near-term investment rating on the stock. Applied Materials weakened Dollars 2 to Dollars 35 3/4 . On the NYSE, Motorola declined Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 94 after it was downgraded by Merrill. Among other semiconductor stocks, Texas Instruments shed Dollars 2 to Dollars 62 1/8 and National Semiconductor was down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 14 7/8 . Canada Toronto relinquished an early rise to end a shade easier on balance as a late retreat by gold shares and soft consumer products outweighed a strong performance by bank issues. The TSE 300 index lost 3.4 at 4,236.0 and declines narrowly outscored advances by 409 to 393. Volume came to 56.6m shares valued at CDollars 626m. The consumer products group fell 1.29 per cent and the golds index shed 1.2 per cent, while financial services gained 1.04 per cent.</p>

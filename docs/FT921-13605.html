			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Arts: Today's Television BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment (7.45) begins a new run with a programme about this year's presidential election in the US. Cameras have been following the main Democrat contenders for the past six months and Gavin Esler (an excellent reporter on 'Newsnight') assesses their prospects. Channel 4 screens the third and last part of Brother Felix And The Virgin Saint, an account of 15th century tourism which has so far proved not only informative but charming, funny, and sometimes - as in last week's Rules for Pilgrims (Don't paint your coat of arms on monuments) - astonishing. This week Brother Felix achieves his life's ambition and reaches the bones of St Catherine (8.00). 40 Minutes (9.50 BBC2) takes a look at 'real men'. The irony about this movement in the US (where else) is that it is so obviously a product of the age of feminism. What do real men do? They hug one another, howl, get in touch with their childhood selves ..in fact they seem to behave awfully like feminists, yet we are told this is all a reaction against feminism. Hmm. Omnibus (10.55 BBC1) tries to decide whether London is a city in crisis.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / People: HP Bulmer HP Bulmer, the cider maker, has appointed Alan Flockhart, 49, as its new finance director, replacing Michael Ward, who recently took up the same role with Lloyds Chemists. Ward in turn replaced Richard Steele, now finance director at Storehouse. Ward first joined the company in May 1989, leaving his post as finance director of Bassett Foods. Flockhart is no stranger to brewing; he is joining Bulmer from Wolverhampton and Dudley Breweries, where he has been finance director since 1985. Before that he was finance director of Scottish Brewers, a subsidiary of Scottish and Newcastle. The UK's largest cider producer - it makes nearly half of the 92m gallons annually consumed - Bulmer recently adopted a new policy of recruiting 200 part-time tasters to help maintain quality.</p>

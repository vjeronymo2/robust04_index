			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PRE-DAWN TRANSFORMER BLAST DELAYS OPENING OF EXCHANGES  </P> <P> An electrical transformer exploded early today in the Wall Street district,  setting off a fire and delaying trading on the two major stock exchanges for 90  minutes.  </P> <P> Flames shot eight stories high after the transformer blew up beneath the  sidewalk outside the 54-story building that houses the stock markets' computer  center.  </P> <P> Between 100 and 200 late-night office workers fled the building into freezing  temperatures after the pre-dawn explosion.  </P> <P> Trading on the New York and American Stock Exchanges, which usually open at  9:30 a.m. EST, did not begin until 11 a.m. after preliminary test results found  no signs of PCB contamination in the building housing the Securities Industry  Automation Corp., the computer center serving both exchanges.  </P> <P> The Securities and Exchange Commission asked all outside stock exchanges to  delay opening until SIAC computers were back in service so that all "market  participants have access to the same information."  </P> <P> Forty people, including more than two dozen firefighters, were treated for  possible exposure to deadly PCBs. Four of the firefighters were hospitalized  and the others took decontamination showers using a special unit brought to the  scene.  </P> <P> A Consolidated Edison spokeswoman said the cause of the fire was under  investigation.  </P> <P> Trading disruptions are relatively rare. More than a year ago, trading on the  NYSE was halted when a fire-related power problem at SIAC briefly delayed the  opening one day.  </P> <P> Last month, a power failure disrupted trading on the NYSE for 90 minutes. The  exchange shut down 11 minutes after the opening bell on Nov. 23 and resumed  later that morning.  </P> <P> In mid-August, a fire at a Con Edison power substation forced the American  Stock Exchange, New York Mercantile Exchange and other futures markets in  southern Manhattan to close by early afternoon.  </P></p>

			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Lower fixed rates Fixed-rate investment accounts continue to be withdrawn or reduced and new fixed rates are for shorter terms and at lower rates than of late. New three-year fixed rates have been launched by Chelsea paying 7.75 per cent yearly or 7.49 per cent monthly. Yorkshire is paying 8.00 per cent yearly or 7.75 per cent monthly, which is currently the best rate on offer although lower than the 8.50 per cent over four years it was offering earlier in the week. The trend continues through to Guaranteed Income Bonds. While the top five-year rate remains at 7.75 per cent net from Eurolife, the majority of institutions have reduced their long-term rates in recent weeks. However, shorter-term rates of one year have been increased by Liberty Life and AIG Life. The latter has also introduced a two-year bond for the first time, with market leading rates. The building societies now seem to be concentrating their efforts on the authorised overdraft front. Halifax started the trend in June by announcing a reduction in its authorised overdraft rate from July 1 to an effective annual rate (EAR) of 12.4 per cent. This was soon leapfrogged by Abbey National which reduced its rate to 9.9 per cent EAR. The Woolwich BS and Alliance &amp; Leicester have since reduced their rates - down to 9.8 per cent EAR and 9.5 per cent EAR respectively. Rates will also be down at the Nationwide from August 1 to 11.5 per cent EAR (or 8.74 per cent if you have a Nationwide mortgage). Britannia will also be reducing its authorised rate to 12.02 per cent EAR, although the Pounds 5 per month arrangement fee remains.</p>

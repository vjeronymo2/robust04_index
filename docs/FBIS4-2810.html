			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul, April 9 (XINHUA) -- Bosnia has warned that  the unresolved conflicts in the country are threats to global  peace.    The Bosnian ambassador to Washington, Necip Sacirbey,  appealed Friday [8 April] at the four-day international  conference on the Balkans to "the world not to tolerate what was  happening in Bosnia."    The conference, which organized by the Solidarity Foundation  of Turkey, is being held here from April 7 to 10, with  participants from representatives from Austria, the United  States, Britain, South Africa, Germany, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and  Malaysia.    "In the war in Bosnia," Sacirbey stated, "there are victims,  aggressors, and observers. All of us are observers."    He asked that the observers not be passive, but to be just,  and he appealed to them to remember Sarajevo, the capital city  of Bosnia.    "Sarajevo is symbolic of the suffering of each group of  people in today's world. When we are fighting for Sarajevo, we  are fighting for a better tomorrow. Please help us," Sacirbey  said.    Meanwhile, turkey Friday renewed a call to the Serbs to join  the Bosnian-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying  "Ankara is ready to do what it can."    Turkey, which shares cultural and religious ties with the  Bosnian Moslems, has launched a series of diplomatic initiatives  on use of force to stop the fighting in Bosnia.    Fighting broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina in late February of  1992 when 4.3 million population in the former Yugoslav republic  voted for independence from Belgrade.</p>

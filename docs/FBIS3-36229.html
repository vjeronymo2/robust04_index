			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aydyn Mekhtiyev under the "Azerbaijan" rubric: </F> "Compromise Did Not Materialize. Vladimir Kazimirov Ends Baku  Visit"]    [Text] Azerbaijani leaders have turned down Moscow's  proposal for a cease-fire in the area of the  Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict that would have gone into effect  at 0000 on 1 February. This transpired on the afternoon of 31  January after the completion of talks in Baku between  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev and Vladimir Kazimirov,  chief of the Russian Federation's mediatory mission, who had  arrived in Azerbaijani capital. According to reports from  Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry sources, the talks were held in a  difficult atmosphere. Before noon the Russian diplomat  discussed the Russian plan for a peaceful settlement with  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov one on one for more  than two hours. The two sides considered the possibility of a  cease-fire to go into force on the night of 1 February along the  entire front line.    Vladimir Kazimirov, who earlier visited Yerevan and  Khankendi  (Stepanakert), managed to obtain the Armenian side's agreement  to the cease-fire. He then had to convince the Baku authorities  of the need to reciprocate. To all appearances, the meeting of  the Russian diplomat with the Azerbaijani foreign minister was  inconclusive. In a press release on the results of the meeting,  Vladimir Kazimirov said that "the conflicting parties still hold  uncompromising stances." Nonetheless he expressed his hope that  a cease-fire agreement would finally be reached and would go  into force on the night of 1 February. However, Kazimirov's  meeting with the Azerbaijani president, which took place a bit  later, confirmed that Baku was unprepared to compromise with the  Armenian side. After the meeting with the Russian diplomat,  Geydar Aliyev said that signing a cease-fire agreement would be  possible only after Armenian troops left occupied Azerbaijani  territories. According to Aliyev, currently Armenian troops  occupy seven Azerbaijani districts outside Nagorno-Karabakh, and  agreeing to negotiate with Armenia before the troop withdrawal  would mean Azerbaijan's submission to Yerevan's pressure.    To all appearances, Azerbaijan's refusal to sign a  cease-fire  in the region without preconditions means that a meeting of the  foreign ministers of Russia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia in Moscow  scheduled for this week will be postponed indefinitely.    An official spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry told  your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that Moscow was not  inclined to see the results of the Baku talks as a failure of  the mediatory mission. In the near future Moscow will continue  its peacekeeping efforts to broker a truce in the region.  "Without a cease-fire none of the parties is likely to have its  demands satisfied," the representative of the Russian Foreign  Ministry said.</p>

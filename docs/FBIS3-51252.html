			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] We now have the president's return from the  Mercosur [Common Market of the South] summit in Colonia,  Uruguay. Jose Rojas is now at Silvio Pettirossi International  Airport.    [Begin live report] [Jose Rojas] Thank you Benito. At this  precise moment President Juan Carlos Wasmosy now is stepping off  the plane and is being met by Vice President Angel Roberto  Seifart, who was acting president while the president was out of  the country. [passage omitted]    We will see if we can reach the place where the president  will give his news conference. [passage omitted]    [Wasmosy] Very well, I believe that before you ask your  questions it would be better if we inform you of everything. I  would like to answer your questions, but before I do I would  like you to listen to the reports of Foreign Minister [Luis  Maria Ramirez Boettner] and Finance Minister [Crispiniano  Sandoval] about the meetings that we had, and afterward I will  answer your questions in case you have any doubts or on anything  that may not have been clear.    [Rojas] We are in direct contact with the studio, and I beg  your pardon Mr. President, this will be my last question. Were  you happy with everything that was discussed.    [Wasmosy] Well, it was a meeting in which I participated for  the first time as president and I am an engineer by profession  and very pragmatic. I made known Paraguay's position in a very  clear and categorical manner in that if macroeconomic policies  cannot be coordinated, if there is not agreement and equilibrium  in the discussions, then we must try and get each country to  expound its internal problems while trying to understand, with  solidarity, the problems of the other countries.    [Rojas] How was your proposal received?    [Wasmosy] Very well. My address was the only one that  really touched on the key points of that meeting. And I believe  that during these meetings we must discuss the real problems  affecting the integration treaty and not just give a lyrical  address.    [Rojas] Is it true that Mercosur's timetable is going to be  delayed?    [Wasmosy] The foreign minister will explain that.    [Rojas] We now return to the studio to continue with the  newscast and we will expand this information in other newscasts.  Thank you and we return to the studio. [end live report]</p>

			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Dollar Climbs in Tokyo: The dollar rose against the yen as stock prices fell in  sluggish trading in Tokyo amid concerns about the Middle East and political  problems in the Soviet Union. The dollar closed at 135.95 yen, up 0.25 yen from  Friday's close of 135.70 yen.  </P> <P> Financial markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday. Dealers said  most investors are waiting until next year to make any new moves. "If there  should be any move, the only possibility is upward for the dollar," said  Chizuko Satsukawa, a dealer at Chemical Bank. On the Tokyo stock exchange, the  stronger dollar, lower bond prices and worries about the Persian Gulf and the  Soviet Union helped push the Nikkei average down 351.72 to 23,767.88 points.  Investors tend to buy the dollar as a safe haven in times of international  turmoil. European markets were closed.  </P></p>

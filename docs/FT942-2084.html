			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / State cash needed to build new nuclear power station Substantial state support will be needed if the UK is to build another nuclear power station, it emerged yesterday as Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator, published its evidence to the government's nuclear review. The company acknowledged the cost of producing electricity from a third plant at Sizewell would be about 50 per cent higher than current market prices if the plant was funded by the private sector. Mr Bob Hawley, Nuclear Electric chief executive, said he expected this year's market price of about 2.4p a kilowatt hour to rise in future years but it would still 'take government commitment and support to build any new nuclear power station'. Nuclear Electric's submission, totalling more than 150 pages, pleads the case for the 2,600MW Sizewell C on the Suffolk coast but also raises the possibility of building a third, smaller plant at Hinkley Point. The company already has planning permission for such a plant. Hinkley C would be easier to finance than Sizewell C, due its smaller capital cost, Pounds 2bn compared with Pounds 3.5bn at Sizewell, but it would offer a slightly lower return on capital, said Nuclear Electric. In its submission, Nuclear Electric confirmed privatisation was its 'top priority'. Mr John Collier, company chairman, said: 'We need commercial freedom to compete on equal terms and to develop our business.' The company wants to sell its advanced gas-cooled reactor and pressurised water reactor stations but it said its Magnox stations and their liabilities should remain in the public sector. It backed its case for privatisation by announcing sharp improvements in efficiencies, with operating losses cut to Pounds 224m last year against Pounds 564m in 1992-93 and costs per unit of electricity down from 3.6p to 3.1p. In addition, it said, major progress in quantifying and reducing liabilities for fuel cycle and decommissioning costs had largely removed the original obstacles to privatisation. Nuclear Electric's submission will be strongly contested during the review which is likely to take up at least most of this year. Greenpeace, the environmental pressure group, condemned the company's case as wishful thinking. Rival power generation companies believe the figures used by the company are optimistic. They dispute its claim that it will soon become the UK's lowest-cost producer of electricity. Mr Mike Kirwan, finance director, said building Sizewell C would need government help in securing long-term contracts. Nuclear Electric wants commercial freedom, Page 12</p>

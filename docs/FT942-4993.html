			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy It is tempting to conclude from the latest statistics on consumer credit and the housing market that April's tax increases are starting to bite. Perhaps, though, it would be more relevant to ask how far the economy would now be set to overheat if there were no tax increases to dampen consumer demand. Consumer credit may have fallen compared with March but April's total of Pounds 413m was still higher than January and February and more than double that of April last year. The slippage in housing market activity is more unsettling, but it seems unrelated to the tax increases: more likely it reflects the bunching of transactions earlier in the year while the cheapest fixed-rate mortgages were still available. It will take a month or two to tell how serious is the housing market setback. So far nothing has happened to deter the upward drift of City estimates for this year's economic growth to 3 per cent or even higher. Expansion at that pace cannot be entirely consumer-led. Happily there are glimmerings of increased investment demand which should help pick up any slack, while the nascent recovery in Europe should bolster exports. If that makes the recovery more sustainable, the risk remains that tax increases combined with fears of higher interest rates will eventually sap confidence. Base rate concerns, though, are still only a matter of expectations. If fears of higher rates did upset the recovery, the authorities would be spared the political embarrassment of having to implement the steep rate rises now predicted by the money market.</p>

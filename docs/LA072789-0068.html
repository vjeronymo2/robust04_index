			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BLUESMAN CHARLES BROWN RECALLS THE GLORY YEARS  </P> <P> It's a mystery how a performer like Charles Brown can slip so far between the  cracks that he doesn't appear in Hollywood for more than 40 years. Yet, there  he was Tuesday night at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill -- a vigorous, 66-year-old  blues singer/pianist whose skills are still comparable with the best work of  Otis Redding, Sam Cooke and Bobby (Blue) Bland.  </P> <P> Brown, who scored a string of R&amp;B hits with Johnny Moore's Three Blazers in  the post-World War II era, seemed to bear little resentment over his slide into  obscurity in the early '50s. His set was peppered with colorful, upbeat tales  of his glory years in the turbulent, postwar L.A. scene.  </P> <P> Predictably, he played the blues in every size and shape, but mostly in the  sleek, sensual night-music style that had a powerful effect on such performers  as Ray Charles, Little Richard, Cooke and Redding. Brown sang the likes of the  Blazers' classic "Drifting Blues," "I Cried Last Night" and "Every Day I Have  the Blues" with simmering intensity, the heat turned up via energetic solos  from guitarist Danny Caron and tenor saxophonist Clifford Solomon.  </P> <P> Brown's ballad work was no less convincing. "I'm Looking for Someone to Love,"  framed in a rhapsodic, Gershwinesque setting, and the standard "Cottage for  Sale" were richly enhanced by an almost symbiotic interaction between Brown's  voice and his piano.

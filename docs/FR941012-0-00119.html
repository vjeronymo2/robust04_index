			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraphs (f)(2)(viii) and (ix) of the final rule, OSHA is prohibiting riders on machines and loads. At paragraph (f)(2)(viii), OSHA is specifying that no employee, other than the operator, be allowed to ride on the machine unless seating, seat belts and other protection equivalent to that provided for the operator is available for the rider. There were no comments opposing this provision. In paragraph (f)(2)(ix), OSHA is prohibiting riding on any load. These requirements parallel the provisions contained in the proposed rule. Several comments were received on these provisions and have been discussed above in the Major Issues section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(2)(x) of the final rule requires that before any machine is shut down, the machine brake locks or parking brakes shall be applied. This provision also requires that each moving element, such as but not limited to, blades, buckets and shears, shall be grounded. As defined in the final rule, grounded means the placement of a component of a machine on the ground or on a device where it is firmly supported. This requirement was also contained in the pulpwood logging and the 1978 ANSI logging standards. The proposed rule would have required that the moving elements of any machine be lowered to the ground.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters said employers should be viewed in compliance with this provision if the moving element is placed in on a device on the equipment designed to hold moving elements in a stationary, secure position (Ex. 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92). This is the method used to ground moving elements on certain machines, such as knuckleboom loaders. OSHA agrees with these commenters that it may be appropriate for the moving elements of a machine to be grounded if the moving elements can be placed on a device that can hold it in a stationary and secure position. However, in those situations when the machine does not have a device to place the moving element, the moving element must be lowered to the ground. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because the record shows that logging employees are injured and killed when they are crushed between equipment and equipment parts or struck by falling and swinging equipment components (Ex. 4&hyph;61).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (f)(2)(xi) of the final rule requires that after each machine is shut down, pressure or stored energy from hydraulic and pneumatic storage devices shall be discharged. This provision has been adopted from the proposed rule. The 1978 ANSI logging standard also contained a similar requirement. OSHA believes this provision is necessary because if pressure or stored energy is not discharged water will accumulate in the storage device thereby decreasing the amount of fluid to carry out the function of the system. For example, many machines use air brake systems. If the compressed air reservoir fills up with water and displaces the air, there may not be enough air to stop the machine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At paragraphs (f)(2)(xii) and (xiii) of this final rule, OSHA is adopting provisions for transporting machines. Paragraph (f)(2)(xii) requires that the rated capacity of any vehicle transporting a machine not be exceeded. Paragraph (f)(2)(xiii) requires that the machine be loaded, secured and unloaded so that it will not create a hazard for any employee. These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed rule. OSHA did not receive any comments opposing these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that the reasoning and explanation on machine rated capacity (paragraph (f)(2)(iii)) applies as well to transporting machines on trailers. Machines, as defined in this standard, are material handling equipment that are not operated on the public highways. Therefore, they must be transported on trailers across public roads from work site to work site. The loading and unloading of a machine on a trailer can be a hazardous event. The principal hazards occur due to rollover of the machine as it is driven up or down the trailer ramp or the ramp failing under the weight of the machine. Rollover can occur when a machine is not properly aligned when being driven onto or off a trailer or when the machine operator unsuccessfully attempts to make minor corrections in the direction of travel of the machine on the ramp. The latter case is particularly likely when the machine runs on tracks rather than wheels, and directional corrections are much more difficult to achieve. OSHA believes these machine transport provisions are necessary to prevent injury to machine operators and other employees in the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Protective Structures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At paragraph (f)(3) of this final rule, OSHA is adopting various requirements for protective structures on machines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

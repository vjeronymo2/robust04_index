			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- Jiang Zemin, general  secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee and  Chinese president, called on party and government officials to  study economics so that they can better lead the nation in  developing a socialist market economy.    Jiang made the call when he participated in separate group  discussions attended by deputies to the National People's  Congress from Fujian, Qinghai and Liaoning Provinces.    "Leading officials should learn more about basic Marxist  economic theories, especially Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking,  and general knowledge about the market economy," he said.    Jiang described studying economics as "an urgent task."    "Many party and government officials used to work in the  fields of natural sciences and engineering," he said. "Today,  however, they are taking the reins of economic development at  central and local levels. They need to `make up' their missed  lessons."    In his talks with the deputies, Jiang also stressed two  major  issues: development of rural economy and development of large  and medium-sized state enterprises.    "Now that our goal has been set and major policies decided,  the key to achieving success is to get down to work in a  concerted way," he said. "Nationwide, we should always pay  priority attention to two major issues. One is the rural  economy; and the other is large and medium-sized state  enterprises."    Jiang called on Fujian Province to improve its investment  environment to attract more capital influx from Taiwan and  overseas Chinese.    When he was with Qinghai deputies, Jiang emphasized the  importance of maintaining unity among all nationalities in the  province and the need for the province to exploit its natural  resources in an efficient way.    Liaoning in northeast China has a concentration of state  enterprises. The province has adopted a policy of invigorating  such enterprises mainly by way of technology upgrading. Jiang  expressed appreciation of the policy.    The state president also praised Liaoning for achieving  self-  sufficiency in grain and foodstuffs.</p>

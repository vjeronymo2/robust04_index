			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Good-humoured accountant in charge of sell-off numbers MR RAY Proctor occasionally has to field a joke among his executive colleagues at British Coal over the book he wrote about finance. Called Finance for the Perplexed Executive, it is 'an attempt to interest people in accountancy with a modicum of humour', he says. Mr Proctor will need to use all the good humour he has at his disposal as he grapples over the next few years with the intricacies, financial and otherwise, of British Coal's privatisation. The government is expected to announce within the next few weeks that it has chosen him to fill the role it announced in last week's white paper for a British Coal board member with special responsibility for privatisation. He is also likely to take over as finance director from Mr Michael Butler, who is to step down from the job at the end of this month. Mr Proctor yesterday had no comment on what he called speculation over his appointment, although ministers have already indicated that the job is his. As board director with responsibility for privatisation, Mr Proctor would deal with the list of more than 20 private-sector companies that have expressed interest in mining under licence or buying the 19 pits which British Coal said last week it would close or mothball. He would then be expected to advise the government on its legislation to sell the whole company to the private sector and the price that should be asked. Such an influential role would be an early reward for a man who has only been on the British Coal executive, a body next down the line from the board, for a year. Appointed to the executive because the board felt it needed a stronger presence from the opencast operation which he headed, Mr Proctor was - after the death of Dr Kenneth Moses, deputy director - asked to head the privatisation operation in a less senior role than the government now envisages for him. He was also influential in British Coal's response to the government's and parliament's coal inquiries, co-ordinating for example the corporation's submission to the trade and industry committee. Like most of the executive and board members at British Coal, Mr Proctor, 47, has spent virtually all his adult working life at the corporation. He joined as a management trainee after attending Hertford College, Oxford, and qualified as an accountant shortly afterwards. Mr Proctor, who speaks with a slow Yorkshire accent, is shares a keenness for privatisation with most of the other British Coal executives. But he is not a man who verbalises his enthusiasm. 'The government has decided it is going to happen,' he said recently, 'and it is our job to make sure it happens in the most effective way.'</p>

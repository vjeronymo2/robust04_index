			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Milan, March 16 (AFP) -- A Milan judge on Wednesday  [16 March] rejected a request for the arrest of six businessmen,  including three officials in media magnate Silvio Berlusconi's  communications group Fininvest, judicial sources said.    But while turning down the demands, judge Anna Introini  ruled  that investigations into the accused would continue. Judicial  sources said this was "because of serious indications of guilt."    The arrests were demanded last week by prosecutors leading  the Clean Hands corruption investigating, in connection with  fraud and false accounting allegations.    Berlusconi, head of the Go, Italy party [Forza Italia] in  general elections due for March 27 and 28, immediately welcomed  Wednesday's decision, saying that "justice had been carried out."    The judge said she had decided not to order their arrests as  there was no danger they would flee, or that they could tamper  with documents involved in the investigation.    Berlusconi, who has been ahead in some recent polls, has  accused some of the investigating magistrates, above all  Gherardo Colombo of Milan, of seeking to bring him down in the  middle of an election campaign.    The three Berlusconi officials involved are: Marcello  Dell`Utri, the administrator for his advertising agency  Publitalia, Romano Luzzi, who also works for Publitalia, and the  director general of his Telepiu television channel, Valerio  Ghilardelli.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The four liberal parties [the Alliance of Free  Democrats, SZDSZ; the Federation of Young Democrats, Fidesz; the  Agrarian Alliance; and the Entrepreneurs Party] have concluded a  concrete agreement on the question of where and who is to step  back in favor of another party's candidate in cases where the  difference between the number of votes for the parties'  candidates is at least 4 percent. Judit Laszlo reports.    [Laszlo] There are SZDSZ and Fidesz politicians among the  first three candidates in 11 individual parliamentary  constituencies. According to the liberal cooperation agreement  signed before the first round of the elections, the following  decision was taken at the talks today. SZDSZ campaign chief  Balint Magyar briefed the press about it.    [Begin Magyar recording] There were five constituencies  where  candidates stepped back automatically in favor of another  liberal candidate. In four cases it happened in favor of an  SZDSZ candidate and in one case in favor of a Fidesz candidate.  There were six constituencies where the difference between the  votes cast for the SZDSZ and Fidesz was less than 4 percent, but  SZDSZ candidates were ahead of the others there. The Fidesz has  expressed its intention to appeal to its candidates there to  step back, so that SZDSZ candidates can compete as the only  liberal candidates. We have also offered in one constituency  that the SZDSZ candidate, Andras Szelier, who won the second  largest number of votes, would step back in favor of [Fidesz  Chairman] Viktor Orban in Szekesfehervar, but the Fidesz has  explicitly asked the SZDSZ candidate to continue to compete.  [end recording] [passage omitted]    [Laszlo] The liberal agreement concerns the Agrarian  Alliance  only in one case. The party's parliamentary candidate will step  back in favor of a better performing SZDSZ candidate in Edeleny  of county Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen, campaign chief Lajos Buzasi  said. Tamas Nagy, chairman of the Agrarian Alliance, who is  still in competition, will be supported by the liberal parties  in the second round as well. The same applies to Peter Zwack,  chairman of the Entrepreneurs Party, who was a joint candidate  of the four liberal parties even in the first round.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ACTION DELAYED ON HISTORIC STATUS FOR VAN NUYS HANGARS  </P> <P> Debate over the historic value of two hangars at Van Nuys Airport prompted the  Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission to postpone action Wednesday on a  request to preserve the aging structures.  </P> <P> Commission President Armajit Marwah delayed a decision for a month after city  Department of Airports officials, who want to raze the hangars, argued the  preservation effort is a ploy by the corporate tenant occupying the buildings,  Volpar Aircraft Corp., to save millions of dollars in relocation costs.  </P> <P> The accusation was denied by executives of Volpar, which retrofits jet aircraft  and is operating under a five-year lease on the site. Volpar officials and  Commissioner Helen Madrid-Worthen of Woodland Hills argued that the hangars  bore witness to San Fernando Valley aviation history.  </P> <P> The city's Cultural Heritage Commission agreed to continue the hearing at a  meeting May 2. If the hangars are deemed monuments, efforts to demolish them  can be delayed up to a year.  </P> <P> The hangars were built in 1943 by the Lockheed Corp. Through the years, they  were used in production of B-24 bombers, T-33 training planes, F-94 Starfire  fighters and the Army's Cheyenne helicopters, said Volpar President A.E. Savva.  The site was also home to Lockheed's missile division, and U-2 spy planes were  serviced in the hangars, he said.  </P> <P> Sheryl Meshack, an assistant city attorney for the city's Department of  Airports, told commissioners the effort to protect the hangars was a ploy by  Volpar to halt department plans to redevelop the property.  </P> <P> John Malloy, a real estate agent for the Airports Department, said Volpar would  save "millions of dollars" in relocation costs by staying at the site.  </P> <P> Malloy said granting monument status would keep the department from building  other aviation-related structures on the site that could bring the city  $300,000 to $750,000 more per year in revenue. The department is seeking bids  from about 25 groups interested in leasing and developing the property.  </P> <P> Commissioner Harold Becks said he was "concerned about the ultimate cost to  taxpayers" if the hangars were preserved. "It's a lot of land to put aside . .  . when the cultural significance is in doubt," Becks said.  </P> <P> Savva, whose firm filed an application to preserve the hangars, told  commissioners that the Department of Airports said in documents in 1979 that  the hangars were historic.  </P> <P> Dan Harnett, an attorney for Volpar, said the five-member commission should  remember that old hangars at Santa Monica Airport, formerly the site of a large  McDonnell Douglas production plant, had been demolished. "Perhaps a token of  that era ought to be preserved," he said.  </P> <P> Madrid-Worthen said the hangars are a source of aviation history in the San  Fernando Valley. She said that in the decades after World War II, aircraft  manufacturing grew from a fledgling Valley industry to one that played a large  role in the area's life and economy.  </P> <P> But the architecture of the hangars was not special enough to warrant  preservation, Marwah argued. As for history: "Three or four decades is not that  old," he said.  </P> <P> Marwah was reminded by cultural heritage staff and by private citizens that the  commission had recently designated a 40-year-old house in Pacific Palisades as  a landmark.  </P></p>

			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Shares ease as base rate hopes cool HOPES FOR further reductions in domestic interest rates were put on hold in the UK stock market yesterday, leaving shares to drift easier in sluggish trading. A renewed fall in sterling, together with an inflation warning from the president of the Bundesbank, provided a nervous setting for the important economic speech to be delivered in the City of London on Thursday by Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer; the same day also brings the parliamentary debate on the Maastricht proposals and a trading statement from ICI, still the bellwether of the London stock market. A weekend featured by growing political pressures on the UK Conservative government of Mr John Major was followed by new evidence of the damage wrought by the economic recession in the UK. British Steel disclosed that it is cutting production by up to one fifth in the face of falling demand in UK and export markets. Share prices opened higher but the rise was soon reversed when it became clear that technical pressures in the stock index sector had turned negative. The FT-SE Index was soon 13 points off and struggling to rally. London was keeping a wary eye on Wall Street as the US market braces itself for the Presidential election and tensions eased a little after the Dow came in almost unchanged in UK trading hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE Index at 2,661.6 for a net loss on the day of 8.1 points. Dealers said that trading had been nervous, with investors unwilling to see last week's gains extended while the corporate reporting season remains so uncertain. Seaq volume, slow at first, picked up a little as the December futures contract steadied to maintain a good premium. By the end of the session, 456.3m shares had traded through the Seaq network, compared with 586.3m on Friday. Yesterday's Seaq total was boosted by heavy turnover in a few shares, including British Steel and also Invesco MIM, the investment management group, where a substantial stake changed hands. Retail, or customer, business was worth Pounds 1.4bn on Friday, maintaining the increased volume of genuine investment activity that has featured the UK equity market since Britain's abrupt departure from the ERM network in mid-September. The market's performance was helped by firmness in the international pharmaceutical stocks, where prospects are believed to be particularly vulnerable to the outcome of the US presidential election and to federal welfare policy. ICI also provided a good lead for equities, in spite of increasing nervousness ahead of this week's profits statement, which will be scanned for news on the plans to split the chemical monarch into two separate groups. But the firmness in the US dollar did little to help the wider range of multi-national stocks which remained uncertain as traders studied the latest opinion poll ratings of the US presidential candidates, which indicated a narrowing in the lead of Democratic governor Bill Clinton over President Bush.</p>

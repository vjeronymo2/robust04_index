			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Granada executive tipped to lead ITV MR ANDREW QUINN, chief executive of Granada Television, has emerged as favourite for the top job in ITV, running the Pounds 500m-a-year network. The ITV companies have turned to Mr Quinn after Mr David Arculus, group managing director of Emap, the publishing and exhibitions company, turned the job down in spite of the offer of a package worth Pounds 400,000 a year. Mr Quinn was one of the first to be considered for the job of chief executive of the newly centralised ITV network. He turned it down, partly because of serious managerial difficulties at Granada Television earlier this year when Mr David Plowright, chairman of the company's television operations, was forced to resign. Having failed to get an acceptable outsider, ITV executives have now returned to one of their own. More than 70 people have been considered to run ITV when the new franchises begin in January. Mr Quinn, who has worked at Granada Television for 27 years, originally in personnel, chaired an ITV committee that drew up the rules for a new ITV network. The rules are being considered by the Office of Fair Trading. It was not clear last night whether Mr Quinn was prepared to take the chief executive's job.</p>

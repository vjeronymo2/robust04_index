			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: Frank Zappa - Obituary Frank Zappa, the guitarist and composer, has died in Los Angeles, aged 52, from prostate cancer. Born in Baltimore, Maryland, he grew up in southern California, attending the same high school as Captain Beefheart, aka Don Van Vliet. His musical career began, legend has it, through a need to pay fines for his involvement in making porn films. For the record, he began by co-writing low-budget Western film scores with Beefheart while playing white soul music in bars. By the mid-1960s Zappa's prodigious talent for the electric guitar, lyrical innuendo and compositional energy was recognised and the first of some of 70 disparate albums was recorded. With his everchanging band, The Mothers of Invention, and records with titles like 'Burnt Weeny Sandwich', Zappa's crazed collage of jazz improvisation, doo-wop and fierce electric guitar rock heroics made him an underground hero. In 1970, increasing interest in major compositional works brought about the first of many classical collaborations, 200 Motels with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Later joint ventures included three volumes with the London Symphony Orchestra baroque trio recording of the music of Francesco Zappa (circa 1763) and, most importantly, 'The Perfect Stranger' with Pierre Boulez and his ensemble Intercontemporain. But it is the slickly produced and cruelly executed misanthropic rock anthems of the 1970s and '80s for which Zappa is chiefly remembered: songs populated by perverts ('The Detroit Enema Bandit') and Middle American obsessions ('Jesus Thinks You're a Jerk'), with lyrics intoned by a deadpan Zappa and terrifying solos delivered by stunt sidemen in beautifully arranged composition. As well as these scabrous musical observations, he will also be remembered for a contrary code of ethics which brought him simultaneously into conflict with the US establishment (over censorship), with hippiedom (over his contempt for drug culture), and with Cold War eastern bloc governments (over his funding of alternative art there). Zappa is survived by his son Dweezil and daughter Moon Unit, who are both rock musicians.</p>

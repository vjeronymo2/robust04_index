			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jorge Katin] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, the Sandinist Assembly made an fervent  call to the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] grass  roots to "unite around revolutionary objectives within the  framework of decisions taken by the [FSLN National] Congress to  set an example of flexibility by rejecting malicious traps,  intolerance, and to strengthen camaraderie as well as  constructive criticism."    The Sandinist Assembly, recently elected during the party's  congress, met yesterday for the first time and proceeded to  discuss the results of the elections, to select members of the  Ethics and Judicial Commission, to elect a permanent Electoral  Commission, to appoint three secretaries to the National  Directorate, and to establish five work commissions.    Likewise, the assembly discussed issues such as a public  debate on the results of the Sandinist congress and the thorny  controversy of the media's support to Sandinism, especially the  case of BARRICADA.    The new members of the Judicial and Ethics Commission  include  Miguel Angel Casco, Orlando Tardencilla, Onofre Guevara, Jose  Pasos, Gladis Gomez, Yadira Centeno, Jorge Samper, Bruno  Gallardo, Gloria Hernandez, Erwin Izaba.    The Electoral Commission includes Julian Corrales  (president), Jeannete Chavez, Zadrach Zeledon, Ruth Herrera, and  Jose Luis Villavicencio as principal members, and Edwin Castro  as well as Josefina Ramos as alternates.    As has already been reported by BARRICADA, Monica Baltodano,  Lumberto Campbell, and Victor Hugo Tinoco were elected  secretaries of organization and education, communications, and  international relations respectively.    Likewise, the Sandinist Assembly approved the creation of  other commissions such as an agriculture commission, a youth  commission, a women's commission, an Atlantic coast commission,  and an economic-social commission.    Upon concluding the event, FSLN Deputy Secretary General  Tomas Borge said that with respect to the media issue, it had  been decided to "assess the situation" within the National  Directorate, and to present a proposal afterwards before the  Sandinist Assembly.    With respect to the debate to take place after the congress,  it was confirmed the debate would be "free, open, and within the  framework of the organizations members of the FSLN."    The absence of National Directorate member Henry Ruiz was  quite obvious. Ruiz has abstained from participating in any of  the meetings of the newly elected national directorate.  <H5>  Calls for Penalties and More Media Control </H5>   The issue of the public debate over the congress results,  and  the role of the media was included as part of the agenda under  "other issues." Discussions began when Modesto Mungia, an  assembly member and Managua District Three leader, stated that  the media could be useful as instruments to continue "examining"  the problem of divisions within the FSLN.    On the other hand, Felix Contreras pointed out that not only  is the legitimacy of the congress under attack, but that "groups  are organized to further split the FSLN." As an example, he  pointed to a recent call to all Sandinists professionals to  participate in an assembly scheduled to take place next Tuesday  at the UCA [Central American University].    William Grisgbi urged the National Directorate to "state its  position on the scope of action of journalists, and  responsibilities as assemblymen." Grisbi was referring to the  controversy involving BARRICADA Director Carlos Fernando  Chamorro and Danilo Aguirre, EL NUEVO DIARIO deputy director.    Nelson Artola, a San Ramon municipal leader asked "Who owns  BARRICADA?" and immediately urged the FSLN to appropriate the  media.    "We must penalize those comrades who are manipulating the  results of the Congress, and we should do it with a steady hand  and voice," Elias Chavez suggested.    In the meantime, National Directorate member Luis Carrion  pointed out that "Neither the Assembly or the National  Directorate should become media directors." In his opinion,  overseeing mechanisms such as a directors council similar to the  one operating at BARRICADA must be encouraged.    Nevertheless, Carlos Fonseca Teran insisted that "the  problem  lies in the clear intent to tarnish the congress' results."    In this respect, the harshest criticisms were directed at  Sandinist Assembly member Danilo Aguirre, who is also EL NUEVO  DIARIO deputy director.    Monica Baltodano, also a National Directorate member, urged  all to "grab the bull by its horns," and that all those whom --  it would seem -- are attempting to "give a free rein to their  ideas" should be called in and urged to speak clearly.    The controversy seemed to lose steam when BARRICADA Editor  Carlos Fernando Chamorro addressed the assembly and indicated  that this newspaper had been one of the few to cover the debates  prior to, as well as following the congress. He also contended  that the debate had been treated as taboo by the other media  associated with Sandinism.    "Let's put the subject of the other media that did not cover  the debate on the carpet," Chamorro pointed out.    Nevertheless, former BARRICADA sports director Emmett Lang  restarted the controversy when he asked "what was the problem  with suggesting Carlos Fernando's departure if he has already  occupied the position for the past 14 years." Lang immediately  added that "I am aware that because of this suggestion I will be  attacked in tomorrow's edition of BARRICADA."</p>

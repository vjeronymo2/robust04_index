			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: The road to insanity On Wednesday I hurled myself out of London and down the motorway to Solsbury Hill, overlooking the village of Swainswick, very close to Bath. Solsbury Hill was the site of an Iron Age fort, and is a place of great beauty. But now it is being raped by a bypass scheme which will stand, unless work is halted, as a monument to the madness of John Major's doomed government. It had been several months since I last broke free of London, so I was stunned by what I saw as I steered my car westward. England, it was clear, is being sundered by two colliding forces: the death throes of the Tories and the first black waves of PMT (pre-millennial tension). There were peculiar sights everywhere. In some localities there were floods. Whole villages were drowned. Survivors clutched church steeples. But after a few miles the land would turn to desert, as though gripped by drought. In places, mahogany forests flourished, or stands of bamboo; in others, stretching to the horizon, was a tundra of ice-age flowers, speckled and malevolent. The sky kept changing colour, from pearl to sulphur to scarlet, and was filled with unusual birds: cockatoos, flamingos and the largest of the albatrosses. On those village greens not drowned by floods, the villagers were building straw figures with hideously-painted faces - Major, Heseltine, Clarke - or else they were building arks, or what you might call coracles, enormously bigger than usual, and floating them down rivers, packed with their possessions, and with household pets. In some places I glimpsed bands of archaic homo sapiens, 6 1/2 ft tall, rudimentarily dressed, or even archaically nude, skulking past coppices or emerging from earth mounds. As a result of all this, I reached Swainswick, near Bath, in a state of some terror. But my brain swiftly cleared the moment I saw Solsbury Hill and understood what the fuss over the bypass is about. It is about insanity: about carving a two-mile stretch of dual-carriageway, together with sound barriers, bridges and a roundabout, through the trees and water-meadows of a famously beautiful hill for a tiny gain in convenience for a small number of people in the villages of Swainswick and Batheaston. The cost of this desecration is put at Pounds 75m. This is road-building mania on a completely crazy scale: an indication of madness among ministers and officials at the Department of Transport, and of degeneracy and decadence at the core of the Major government. Go to Solsbury Hill. Walk up it, down it, round it. Examine the rape and vandalism. Ponder the huge cost. Then join the protest. At present, the protest is centred on the pale figure of Bel Mooney, a prominent journalist (and recently-installed fellow of University College, London) who has a house on Solsbury Hill and who is now on hunger strike - consuming only water and fruit juice - to protest against the pillage. Yes, there was a public inquiry, in 1990. Yet when she reflects on the cynical limitations of that inquiry, says Mooney, she feels outraged by the acquiescence which allows this destruction in the name of the people. She told me: 'The bypass is expected to generate extra traffic of about 600 cars daily, but it is a two-mile stretch of dual-carriageway going from nowhere to nowhere. Bath itself will still be heavily congested. What we want is for them to halt the building work now, before the trees and water-meadows are damaged beyond repair and pending a transport review for the whole of the south-west. 'This story is a dreadful can of worms that needs exposing. I cried the other day when the diggers tore down some trees. You have no idea until you see it what a physical assault it is.' The issue of roads and the environment, she insists, is not local but national. After talking to Mooney, I walked up and down the hill, chatting to the people that are rallying to the cause and gathering on Solsbury Hill, before the concrete mixers start their work. I visited the eco-warriors' camps, which the wreckers and the robo-cops plan to destroy. It is not too late. The madness can be stopped. But time is running short. Unless the roads minister, Robert Key, swiftly gains his wits, he will find the whole of England over-run by ancient homo sapiens risen from their graves, clamouring for blood.</p>

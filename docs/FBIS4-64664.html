			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Forza Italia economist Antonio Martino by </F> Alberto Statera; place and date not given: "Politics Has  Infected Him"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Statera] Mr. Martino, what  impression are you making on your friends in Chicago, who hoped  to see an immediate victory for the inalienable rules of the  market?    [Martino] I received a telephone call from one of my  teachers  in Chicago, who told me: "People will say that you belong to  the `Chicago boy's' government, but you must be realistic and  acknowledge that you are now, by virtue of your age, a `Chicago  man.'"    [Statera] That is amusing, Mr. Martino, but there is also a  real problem: You formulated an election program based on  extreme economic liberalism, but now the prime  minister-designate is engaging in consultations for all he is  worth. What is your opinion of his meetings with the so-called  social partners?    [Martino] Bad, very bad: How could I deny it? I cannot  approve of consultations with the social partners. An advocate  of economic liberalism such as myself cannot accept the very  idea of pay trends being determined from the top. That would be  an abandonment of my principles.    [Statera] And so?    [Martino] So I am reassured by the fact that consultations  of  this kind will make no difference, insofar as pay trends will  violate any ceiling. Pay trends do not honor agreements.    [Statera] What do you man?    [Martino] That if a firm is doing well, nobody can prevent  it  from increasing wages above the set ceilings.    [Statera] What would your friends in Chicago say about  Berlusconi's consultations?    [Martino] That whatever does no harm is tolerable. In this  specific instance, it is an old ritual of give and take that is  tolerable if we succeed in achieving the harmony essential for  creating the conditions for development. Unfortunately, there  is no such thing as a free lunch.    [Statera] As Friedman said?    [Martino] No, the attribution to Friedman is a common one,  but mistaken. Do you know who said it? An Italian emigre in  the United States. What he said was more or less this: "This  is a great country but it does not give any free lunches."    [Statera] If that is so, does it mean that there are no free  lunches for Mr. Berlusconi, either?    [Martino] Precisely. There are no free lunches for anyone.    [Statera] Has the lunch been paid for?    [Martino] It is my opinion that pledges must be honored. But  then there must be no more consultations, with the rationale of  the grand three-way agreements. The government is not an  arbiter between the social partners; it simply establishes the  rules. Then employers and trade unions can reach their own  agreements.    [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martino, you will be a minister in  a  government whose likely prime minister is already following  ideological guidelines with which you do not agree. Do you  consider that normal?    [Martino] It seems to me that in this instance it is an  acceptable compromise, and the word "compromise" applies more to  me than to Berlusconi, because he has always spoken to me about  his desire to engage in dialogue with the social partners.  However, I am of course talking personally; I am stating my  opinions, and I reaffirm that not everything can be negotiated  with the social partners.    [Statera] If you continue to say one thing and your  colleagues another, does this not pose a danger to the prime  minister?    [Martino] Mr. Berlusconi has asked me to make it clear when  I  am talking in a personal capacity and illustrating my own  opinions, which is what I am doing now. Many of us are new to  politics, but for this very reason I foresee an attitude of  great cooperation.    [Statera] Berlusconi too is new to active politics, but he  is  displaying wonderful qualities as a Doroteo. Do you remember  the Santa Dorotea convent at which that Christian Democratic  faction was formed?    [Martino] I think it is not Doroteism, but an inevitable  compromise, the price to be paid for the first lunch.  Berlusconi has been infected by the political virus more  severely than you can imagine. He would even be willing to sell  everything as long as he could engage in politics.    [Statera] Pardon me, Mr. Martino, but we have an even worse  suspicion -- namely, that you have been diverted from economics  to foreign policy because the government's line will not  actually be so committed to economic liberalism, because your  policies will be set aside somewhat, because -- if I may be  permitted to say so -- some people perhaps believe that less  harm can be done at the Foreign Ministry.    [Martino] Do you mean that I will be given the Foreign  Ministry as a way of rendering me harmless?    [Statera] More or less.    [Martino] Well, I deny that absolutely: I willingly agreed  to the suggestion of the Foreign Ministry, and I consider it a  very prominent position.    [Martino] Will the Berlusconi government not align with the  economic policy of the Amato and Ciampi governments, more out of  necessity than out of conviction?    [Statera] I really hope that this does not happen, and  indeed  I am certain of it: You cannot increase revenue without working  on the decisionmaking rules affecting expenditure.    [Martino] Be that as it may, you will be at the Foreign  Ministry.    [Martino] Yes, and very gladly. At present I am doing my  homework, examining the unresolved issues. They are alarmingly  numerous and difficult.</p>

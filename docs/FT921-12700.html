			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / International Company News: Tandem Computers falls into red in first quarter TANDEM Computers reported a net loss for its first fiscal quarter after restructuring charges. The manufacturer of fault-tolerant computers said that economic and competitive pressures had permanently changed the computer industry, writes Louise Kehoe. The company reported a net loss for the quarter of Dollars 94.6m, or 88 cents a share including a restructuring charge of Dollars 80.5m, or 74 cents a share. In the corresponding quarter of fiscal 1991, Tandem earned Dollars 7m, or 7 cents a share. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 454.5m, 2 per cent above the Dollars 443.8m in the same period a year ago. Tandem reduced spending and cut its workforce in the first quarter. However, 'revenues were lower than we anticipated and our actions were not enough to offset historically weak first quarter revenue patterns', said Mr James Treybig, Tandem president and chief executive. 'Now we are moving to restructure the company to increase both productivity and profitability.' Earlier this month, the company announced restructuring plans to be implemented over the next nine months, including consolidation of offices and facilities, write-offs of assets and job cuts. The company said that the restructuring would reduce expenses by Dollars 40 to Dollars 50m in the current fiscal year, and Dollars 90 to Dollars 100m in fiscal 1993.</p>

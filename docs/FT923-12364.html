			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / International Company News: Olsen announcement lifts Digital stock DIGITAL Equipment's stock rose yesterday following the surprise announcement that Mr Kenneth Olsen, president, chief executive and founder of the minicomputer manufacturer, will retire in October and the sudden resignation of Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, president of Digital's European operations. Digital rose Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 3/8 in late trading. Mr Olsen, 66, has headed Digital since he founded the company in 1957. His departure has long been the subject of speculation, but the timing of the announcement took analysts by surprise. Digital is expected to announce substantial fourth-quarter losses, following one of the most difficult years in the company's history. Mr Olsen had appeared to be unwilling to let go of the reins of the company that he has headed for over 30 years. There have, however, been signs of growing discontent among senior executives at Digital over the past year as its financial performance slumped. Mr Olsen will be succeeded as president and chief executive by Mr Robert Palmer, vice-president of manufacturing. Mr Palmer, 51, joined Digital in 1985 to take charge of the company's semiconductor operations. Previously he was a founder of Mostek, a US semiconductor manufacturer subsequently acquired by United Technologies. Mr Palmer has been closely associated with Digital's new 'Alpha' technology upon which the company plans to base a new range of computer products. The resignation of Mr Pier Carlo Falotti, 'to pursue other interests' also came as a shock to industry analysts. Mr Falotti is credited with having built Digital's European business into one of the most successful segments of its operations. The company said Mr John Smith, senior vice-president of operations, to whom Mr Falotti reported, will assume Mr Falotti's duties in the interim. In spite of the timing, a senior Digital executive said Mr Falotti's resignation did not come as a consequence of Mr Olsen's retirement or the appointment of his successor. Mr Falotti 'has done a staggering amount for Digital and for Europe and will be enormously missed,' he said. 'It would be wrong to portray him as throwing his rattle out of the crib.'</p>

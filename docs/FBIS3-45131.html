Zhao, also chairman of Pudong's Administrative Committee,  told a press conference that 2.5 billion yuan will be invested  in ten key infrastructure projects in the area, including a  1.5-sq-km park, the expansion of schools, and a boulevard in the  Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone.    Unmarked on a sizable map only three years ago, the Pudong  area, covering 518 sq km on the east bank of the Huangpu River,  has become a symbol of and a bridgehead for Shanghai's comeback  as an economic and financial center for the Asia and Pacific  region.    Therefore, construction of its infrastructure has to be  top-flight from the very beginning, Zhao said.    Statistics show that in 1993 the area recorded an output  value of 16.4 billion yuan, double that for 1990. The figure is  also up 30.2 percent over 1992, and 15.3 percentage points  higher than the growth rate for the area on the river's west  bank.    Last year Pudong had 16 billion yuan-worth of fixed assets,  far surpassing the 7.5 billion yuan for 1992. Its revenue  growth was 60 percent, and 924 foreign-funded projects were  approved by the local government in the same year.    So far, with a total investment of 15 billion yuan, the  first  ten projects, involving transportation, energy and  telecommunications, have been completed, two years ahead of  schedule.    Thanks to this, the skeleton of a modern metropolis has  taken  shape, especially on the 50 sq km of developed land which  embraces the Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, Waigaoqiao  Free-Trade Zone, Jinqiao Export-Processing Zone and Zhangjiang  Hi-Tech Zone.    In 1.7-sq-km Lujiazui, which aims to become the largest  business center in China, construction of 50 financial and  commercial office buildings has begun, with a total floor space  of over two million sq m, and work on another 30 buildings  designed to be up to the world advanced level will start within  this year.    According to the blueprint, by the end of this century 150  large buildings will come into existence in Lujiazui.    So far, 20 out of the top 100 world conglomerates have set  up  branches in Pudong. In the Jinqiao District there are 202  foreign-invested projects, financed to the tune of an average of  some 13 million U.S. dollars each.    Zhao said that by the year 2000 Pudong will expand its  development area by another 60 sq km, with the urbanized area  reaching more than 100 sq km.</p>

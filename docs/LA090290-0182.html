			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY STOPS BREEDING MONKEYS FOR RESEARCH  </P> <P> The national Centers for Disease Control has closed its monkey breeding program  after an outcry by animal rights activists over the deaths of 14 monkeys during  a heat wave.  </P> <P> The CDC shipped more than 100 monkeys from the Lawrenceville, Ga., facility on  Friday to another government research center in Louisiana. A spokeswoman said  monkeys used for research still will be housed at the compound northeast of  Atlanta, but the agency will no longer breed the animals.  </P></p>

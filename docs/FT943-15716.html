			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / FT Exporter (16): Competition for orders is tough - The World Bank and other agencies are a vital source of finance for projects in developing countries, writes Alan Spence / Multilateral lending agencies Project financing by the World Bank, regional institutions such as the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the EU and other multilateral agencies is big business. International companies secured project contracts financed by the World Bank worth Dollars 9,098m in 1992 alone. In heavily indebted developing countries and cash-strapped regions, such as eastern Europe, the intervention of multilateral international financial institutions (IFIs) is often essential if a project is to go ahead. Competition for orders can be severe. It is not unusual to find dozens of companies pre-qualifying for the more attractive orders. The EU's Tacis programme for the former Soviet Union received more than 200 requests to pre-qualify for one military conversion contract. Project cycles may be long and even having the guarantee of World Bank or EU financing does not ensure that the contract will be trouble free. But the rewards may be substantial. World Bank-financed orders totalling Dollars 607m went to UK exporters in 1992 and in 1993 the figure rose to Dollars 727m. The World Bank says it finances more than 200 projects every year, leading to the award of some 30,000 contracts. About 70 per cent of these are for equipment and other capital goods. Contracts for dams, power networks and other big ticket contracts make headlines, but a high proportion of multilateral financing backs much smaller orders. According to the World Bank typical contracts secured in early 1994 by UK companies were ASC, which has a Dollars 12.95m order for grain handling equipment for China, and Telspec, whose Dollars 5.99m contract is to supply loop carrier equipment to the Slovak Republic. In regions such as Africa, accessing multilateral-funded contracts is often the only way to do business. 'Most of our sub-Saharan business is based on aid,' a UK exporter says. His company employs specialist teams to monitor aid-related business opportunities across the globe. 'Such is the range of aid-related lending that many companies either focus on just one or several related countries where they can build up specialist knowledge. For SMEs and even multinationals, such approaches may not prove practical. Support from government to help identify opportunities is available to most exporters. The UK's Department of Trade &amp; Industry (DTI), for example, provides specialist advice through its World Aid Section (WAS), which receives some 20,000 telephone enquiries and 3,000 company visits annually. The WAS helps to target markets and sectors for UK exporters unsure of what is on offer. It holds the details of more than 5,000 projects on its files, published through the DTI's Export Intelligence Service. For a company seeking to tap multilateral financing for the first time, the initial priority is to learn more about the multilateral's operations and business practices. Bidding for multilateral finance work can be a protracted process. One exporter, who has secured a Dollars 1.6m supply deal in south-east Asia financed by the ADB, sums up a wider view: while he is pleased with the business, there are frustrations. 'It takes a long time for the bureaucratic wheels to turn,' he says. Local contacts are essential. Having identified that international financing is available for a project - often through an advance tender notice published by the World Bank, ADB or other agency in their own or commercial publications - a company should seek out the relevant implementing agency. WAS officials suggest providing the buyer with product information and establishing contact with officials. The World Bank's international competitive bidding (ICB) process is designed to allow local and international companies equal opportunities to bid. ICB sets out standard rules for bidding. These include regulations stipulating that documents must be written in English, Spanish or French. A margin of preference must be given to local firms. Manufactured goods with a minimum of 20 per cent of domestic content are afforded a margin of preference equal to the applicable customs and import tariff, or 15 per cent of the cost, insurance and freight price of the imported goods by the competitor. Contracts must be awarded to the lowest evaluated bid, although this may not be the cheapest. WAS officials say it is crucial that firms price their bids competitively, comply precisely with all contractual specifications and pay special attention to security and deadline arrangements. This can prove expensive. ICB tenders issued by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) specify security to accompany the bid of 'not less than 2 per cent of the total bid amount in any freely convertible currency'. Increasing flows of financing from the World Bank, EBRD, the EU's Phare and Tacis technical assistance programmes means that eastern Europe is a substantial area for aid-related growth. This is critical in countries where mobilising other forms of export financing can prove highly problematic. A pointer to the future is the EBRD's policy of signing agreements with bilateral agencies and banks to back export-related projects. To assist private sector buyers, the London-based bank has recently signed agreements with the Export-Import Bank of Japan, Mexico's Banco Nacional de Comercio Exterior (Bancomext) and the Austrian government. These accords give EBRD backing to export credits, insurance and guarantees and investment-related financing - helping banks and export credit agencies to increase their funding capacity in difficult markets. The EBRD has also established a Dollars 10m trade facility for Macedonia, guaranteeing designated correspondent banks of the Skopje-based Komercijalna Banka against non-payment of unconfirmed letters of credit. The facility is intended to increase commercial trade finance flows to a 'difficult market'. It marks the recognition that in many parts of the world IFI support is essential if contracts of all sizes are to be signed - and that the development finance institutions and their clients can no longer live by prestige projects alone.

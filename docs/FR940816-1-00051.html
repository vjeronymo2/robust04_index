While hunting waterfowl, a tribal member must carry on his/her person a valid tribal waterfowl hunting permit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Except as otherwise noted, tribal members will be required to comply with tribal codes that will be no less restrictive than the provisions of Chapter 10 of the Model Off-Reservation Code. Except as modified by the Service rules adopted in response to this proposal, these amended regulations parallel Federal requirements, 50 CFR Part 20 and shooting hour regulations in 50 CFR Part 20, Subpart K, as to hunting methods, transportation, sale, exportation and other conditions generally applicable to migratory bird hunting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Tribal members in each zone will comply with State regulations providing for closed and restricted waterfowl hunting areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Possession limits for each species are double the daily bag limit, except on the opening day of the season, when the possession limit equals the daily bag limit, unless otherwise noted above.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Possession limits are applicable only to transportation and do not include birds which are cleaned, dressed, and at a member's primary residence. For purposes of enforcing bag and possession limits, all migratory birds in the possession or custody of tribal members on ceded lands will be considered to have been taken on those lands unless tagged by a tribal or State conservation warden as having been taken on-reservation. In Wisconsin, such tagging will comply with applicable State laws. All migratory birds which fall on reservation lands will not count as part of any off-reservation bag or possession limit. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Minnesota and Michigan_Duck Blinds and Decoys. Tribal members hunting in Michigan and Minnesota will comply with tribal codes that contain provisions that parallel applicable State laws concerning duck blinds and/or decoys. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> Kalispel Tribe, Kalispel Reservation, Usk, Washington <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Kalispel Reservation was established by Executive Order in 1914, and currently comprises approximately 4600 acres. All Reservation land is owned by the tribe and it has full management authority. Currently, the tribe has no recognized rights to hunt, fish or gather off-reservation. The Kalispel Tribe has a fully developed wildlife program with hunting and fishing codes. The tribe enjoys excellent wildlife management relations with the State of Washington, with which it has an operational Memorandum of Understanding with emphasis on fisheries but also for wildlife. The seasons described below pertain to non-tribal hunters that would be allowed to harvest waterfowl on a 176 acre waterfowl management unit. The tribe is utilizing this opportunity to rehabilitate an area that needs protection because of past land use practices, as well as to provide additional waterfowl hunting in the area. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the 1994&hyph;95 migratory bird hunting seasons, the Kalispel Tribe is proposing duck and goose seasons that begin 2 weeks earlier and end 2 weeks later than those for the State of Washington in the same area. The outside framework for ducks and geese would run from October 1, 1994, through January 29, 1995. In that period, non-tribal hunters would be allowed to hunt on Wednesdays, weekends, holidays and for a continuous period from November 28 through December 31; the total being 77 days. Hunters should obtain further information on days from the Kalispel Tribe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Daily bag and possession limits would be the same as those for the State of Washington. All other State and Federal regulations contained in 50 CFR Part 20, such as use of steel shot and possession of a signed migratory bird hunting stamp, will be observed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service proposes to agree to the regulations requested by the Kalispel Tribe. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

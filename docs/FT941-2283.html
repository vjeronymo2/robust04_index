			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / The construction industry: have the foundations been laid for recovery? The decline in the construction industry has halted and a slow recovery appears to be under way, recently published statistics suggest, Andrew Taylor writes. They show output no longer declining and construction orders rising consistently since the autumn in almost every sector. Bricks, cement and ready-mixed concrete sales have increased, albeit slowly, for the first time since the late 1980s. Prices of some building materials have started to rise, increasing pressure on contractors to put up their own prices. Commercial property sales have risen, although it will be a long time before this works through to increased development activity. Housebuilding is leading the way out of recession. Demand for new homes has increased as the cost of buying has fallen to the lowest for more than a decade. Prices have also started to edge up again, according to building societies. The Building Societies Association says net new mortgage commitments, the best guide to demand for home loans, totalled Pounds 2.93bn last month, a 7.8 per cent increase on last February. The pace of recovery for the construction industry as a whole is likely to remain slow, reflecting the faltering nature of the recovery in the general economy. Companies remain concerned that recent progress could be reversed if the fragile confidence of prospective house buyers were sapped by tax increases scheduled for the end of this month. Contractors and building material producers are alarmed that efforts to restrain public spending could damage parts of the industry further if the government announced further reductions in the road programme. Demand over the next few years is expected to remain well below levels in the late 1980s.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. Construction output UK construction output is forecast to rise by up to 2 per cent this year, having fallen by a similar amount in 1993. Since 1990 the annual value of output at constant prices has fallen by more than 12 per cent. Orders won by contractors in the UK rose by 30 per cent during the three months to the end of January 1994 compared with the corresponding period 12 months earlier. The value of orders in constant prices rose last year by 12 per cent, the first annual increase since 1988.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 2. Building equipment Unit sales rose 42 per cent last year after falling 45 per cent in the previous three years. The Corporate Intelligence Group forecasts a further 11 per cent rise this year, still leaving sales at 1986-87 levels.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 3. Housing starts Builders started work on 185,400 homes last year, an increase of 18.4 per cent on 1992. This was the first annual increase since 1988. Work was started on 142,200 private sector homes last year, also an increase of more than 18 per cent.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 4. Construction company failures About 640 companies went into receivership in the 12 months to last December compared to 977 in the year before. There were 27 company failures last December, compared with 78 in December 1992, according to accountants Touche Ross.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 5. House sales Total house sales rose by 5 per cent last year to 1.19m. This was the first annual rise since 1988, when 2.15m sales were recorded, according to Inland Revenue conveyancing figures.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 6. House prices The annual rise in house prices increased to 3.8 per cent in February, according to the Halifax Building Society. It expects prices on average to rise by about 5 per cent this year, following a 1.2 per cent increase last year, the first annual increase recorded by the society since 1990.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 7. Building materials Bricks: Unit sales rose by 6.8 per cent to 3.13bn, the first annual increase since 1988 when the industry sold 4.72bn bricks. Cement: Sales are estimated to have risen by 5 per cent during the first 10 weeks of this year compared with the corresponding period in 1993. Annual sales last year were flat, having fallen by a third since 1989.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 8. Employees in industry Employment peaked at 1.85m in 1989. By this January it had fallen to 1.4m, with a sharp rise in self-employment offsetting a fall in direct employment. Building employers say there is little sign of recent increases in orders feeding through into jobs. At their most optimistic they say that employment stabilised late last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

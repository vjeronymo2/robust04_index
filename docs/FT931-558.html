			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Balladur named French PM after Socialist election rout PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night named Mr Edouard Balladur as France's new prime minister after the centre-right swept the Socialists out of power by winning 484 of the 577 seats in the new parliament. Mr Balladur said he planned to form a small, tightly-knit cabinet dedicated to 'setting our country to rights' and restoring confidence. 'Our country is in crisis,' he said. 'All our efforts must be mobilised to overcome it.' Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister under the defeated Socialists, handed in his resignation earlier in the day. Mr Mitterrand said he had chosen Mr Balladur, a former Gaullist finance minister, 'not only because he is the most suitable to bring together the different components of the new (government) majority, but also because of his competence.' Mr Mitterrand started a brief television address by telling his countrymen that: 'By your vote, you have clearly marked your desire for a new policy,' adding: 'I will scrupulously respect this.' However, the 76-year-old president - whose term runs until 1995 if his health permits - signalled that he intended to exercise his constitutional right to influence foreign and defence policy. He underlined the importance to France of European integration, the implementation of the Maastricht treaty and the linking of the franc to the D-Mark as a step to European monetary union. The president has a free hand in selecting a prime minister. But after the landslide victory for RPR Gaullists and centre-right UDF parties, he seemed to have little choice but to fall in with their preference for Mr Balladur. The odds on Mr Balladur getting the top government job had shortened further yesterday when he won endorsement from the UDF. Its leader, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said that, after the RPR had outdistanced his party by winning 247 seats against 213 for the UDF, it was natural the premiership should go to someone from the RPR. In return, Mr Giscard d'Estaing said the RPR should leave the UDF to provide the president of the new National Assembly, which opens on Friday. The job of finance minister is also considered likely to go to a UDF member. Among names being mentioned as possible candidates are Mr Pierre Mehaignerie and Mr Edmond Alphandery. Both Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, and Mr Giscard d'Estaing had indicated before last night's announcement that they would stay out of the government. Each has an interest in keepinghis hands free to run for the presidency to succeed Mr Mitterrand. Most French apparently believe Mr Mitterrand should ignore calls by RPR leaders, including Mr Chirac, for him to resign early in spite of the margin of the conservative parties' election triumph.  ------------------------------- FINAL RESULTS  ------------------------------- Parties                    Seats  ------------------------------- RIGHT  ------------------------------- RPR (Gaullists)              247 UDF (centre-right)           213 Other right                   24 National Front                 0                              484  ------------------------------- LEFT  ------------------------------- Socialist party               54 Communist party               23 Left Radicals                  6 Other                         10                               93  ------------------------------- Source: Interior Ministry/Reuter  ------------------------------- Analysis and reports, Page 2</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sears easier Long-standing rumours that the Fayed brothers might be seeking to place their 10.5 per cent stake in Sears, the high street retailing group, resurfaced yesterday. Dealers reported that one leading securities house had been approaching institutions in what seemed to be a pre-placing exercise. Some market traders believed the Fayed Brothers, owners of the House of Fraser group, want to use the proceeds of a Sears placing to fund a hotel building programme. The share price weakened 2 to 97p in turnover of 2.4m. However, analysts were somewhat dismissive of the reports, largely on the grounds that the Fayeds, who paid around 140p apiece for their shares six years ago, would be unlikely to accept such a large loss. A spokesman for House of Fraser also dismissed the rumour, asserting that the Fayed brothers remained long-term investors in Sears. No one was available for comment at Sears. A substantial and unreservedly bullish research document from BZW, joint broker to Zeneca, the intended pharmaceutical arm of the demerged ICI, helped drive shares in the blue chip chemical group sharply higher in an otherwise depressed stock market. The shares also benefited from impact of several institutional presentations by ICI itself. Income funds were also said to have been supporters of the shares which go ex the 34p dividend on Monday. The BZW health and household team described the Zeneca demerger from ICI as a 'bold initiative, already benefiting shareholders and company alike, the former from a steadily rising share price as demerger benefits unfold, the latter from a sharper management focus'. ICI closed 9 higher at 1272p. The market was caught on the wrong foot by Pilkington's purchase of Heywood Williams' glass merchanting business. Dealers had braced themselves for a series of profits downgrades earlier in the week after Pilkington called in a number of selected analysts for a briefing. The deal was accompanied by Heywood's preliminary figures, showing a steep decline in profits but a maintained dividend. The market's reaction was to mark Heywood shares sharply higher on the view that the board had achieved a good price for the assets. They closed a net 53 higher at 239p after turnover of 4.7m shares. Pilkington closed 7 higher at 108p on turnover 6.5m. Shares in Thorn EMI weakened for a second session as rumours of problems with one of its US subsidiaries combined with some technical selling pressure. There were suggestions from New York that an official inquiry might be launched into Rentacentre, Thorn's US subsidiary. The company rents and sells white goods, but, according to analysts, has come in for criticism over disclosures to potential customers of rates and terms. The shares closed 8 adrift at 853p. The steep fall on the Hong Kong market upset HSBC, which was also affected by a bout of nervousness ahead of Monday's preliminary figures. It dropped 37 to 604p. Cable &amp; Wireless dipped 10 to 713p. Inchcape fell 26 to 583p. Around 32 per cent of the company's 1991 earnings came from the Far East. Standard Chartered on the other hand, rallied strongly from an initially depressed 694p to close a net 11 higher at 714p. Bass rebounded from its recent underperformance as Kleinwort Benson turned from seller to hold. Activity in the traded options market focused interest on Forte as one institution decided that the hotel group's results next month could prompt a volatile time for the shares. Forte was the top traded option, with the equivalent of over 3m shares traded. In the equity market, the shares shaded 3 to 203p in turnover of 3.3m. In a largely resilient stores sector, Storehouse responded to positive pressure from NatWest Securities, the shares up 2 to 192p. Hopes of debt restructuring plans boosted ADT and the shares put on 25 to 463p. Among engineering and aerospace stocks, TI Group, which raised the dividend this week as it reported figures, was in demand and the shares added 5 to 321p in trade of 4.4m.</p>

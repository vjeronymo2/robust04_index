			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Companies face growing crime risk: Organised theft and fraud set to replace terrorism as top concern The threat of organised crime will become a top item on boardroom agendas next year, according to a report published today by Control Risks, the London-based international corporate security and intelligence consultants. The report identifies four main reasons why financial crime and fraud will replace terrorism as the most pressing security concern for international business: Increasing sophistication by criminal groups in the use of banking instruments and exploitation of recently-opened borders to trade and investment. 'The globalisation of legitimate business is matched by the globalisation of organised crime,' says the report. Involvement of 'demobilised' and 'jobless' terrorists in racketeering. Intensifying social dislocation caused by urban migration and growing economic disparities. Absence of predominant ideologies: 'In the 1990s the emphasis is on personal enrichment . . . disenchanted youths who might once have turned to radical politics now are more likely to model themselves on successful entrepreneurs, including those who operate on the wrong side of the law.' The report includes the results of a British companies' security outlook survey which singles out Russia, China, Nigeria and Egypt as the perceived areas of highest risk for doing business. The survey was conducted among a representative sample of more than 100 top UK companies. Topping the list is Nigeria, which Control Risks describes as a country in which business has been 'caught up in opposition strikes and protests, crime and corruption'. In Russia, the report notes, 'extortion and racketeering are currently the major threats posed by organised crime . . . but foreign business also faces the threat of kidnapping and violent crime'. China is described as the world's largest emerging market, but one in which the environment for foreign business is fraught with difficulties. The main problem is an 'archaic and communist-inspired legal system' which cannot cope with business disputes. 'Large legal loopholes leave ample scope for institutionalised corruption,' the report states. While agreeing with the surveyed UK companies about the extent of the risks in Russia, Nigeria and China, Control Risks claims the threat in Egypt is overestimated. It notes what it claims are the Egyptian government's successes in combating terrorism, which have brought about a 'more stable security environment'. But it is critical of the progress on privatisation and the government's refusal to devalue the Egyptian pound. Control Risks describes Algeria as the 'most dangerous country in the world for foreign business', predicting growing political instability provoked by violence between Islamic extremists and the security forces.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, May 6, RIA -- The Parliament of  Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic in Central Asia, has passed  a law guaranteeing the security of foreign investments and  foreign property and granting foreign investors a number of  benefits. One of the clauses of the new legislation says that  should any subsequent law deteriorate investment conditions, the  legislation that was in force when the contract was signed would  be applied to foreigners for 10 years.    Uzbekistan also plans to set up a state insurance company to  protect its clients from political risks. The company's assets  will be deposited in foreign banks.</p>

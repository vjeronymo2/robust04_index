			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Turkish state-owned banks to merge TURKIYE Ogretmenler Bankasi (Tobank), has been absorbed by Halkbank, after five years of unsuccessful attempts by the Turkish Treasury to get it back to profits. Both banks are state-owned. Tobank did not publish accounts for 1991, but at the end of 1990 it ranked 16th out of Turkey's 33 locally-owned banks with a network of 93 branches. Its total assets in its last published accounts for December 1990 were TL1,861bn (Dollars 636m) when it reported a small profit of TL2.4bn. Halkbank, which specialises mainly in loans to small businesses and craftsmen, had assets of TL8,220bn in 1990. The Treasury had been trying to nurse Tobank back to health for the past five years, but this spring its loan book was hit by new losses and its closure became a matter of urgency. There was some surprise among bankers in Turkey that the Treasury selected Halk Bankasi as Tobank's takeover partner, rather than much larger state banks such as Ziraat Bank or Vakiflar Bankasi which have handled similar operations in the mid-1980s. Halkbank will place the residue of Tobank's losses in a special account. Tobank's 93 branches are currently trading as part of Halkbank but some closures are planned. The closure of Tobank brings to an end one of the most curious institutional histories in the Turkish banking world. The bank was founded in the late 1950s as a teachers' co-operative bank, but was later controlled by a single shareholder. It was nationalised in 1987 as part of the Treasury rescue operation. Turkey is planning to offer its 18 per cent shareholding in Teletas Telekomunikasyon Endustri Ticaret to local investors via a tender issue. Teletas is 39 per cent owned by Alcatel Alsthom, the French telecommunications group.</p>

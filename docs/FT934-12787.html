			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Prizefighter goes into the ring with Bock: Robert Peston and Roland Rudd analyse the ongoing boardroom battle at Lonrho Ever since Mr Tiny Rowland patched up his longstanding and highly expensive quarrel with the Fayed Brothers, he has been swaggering around like a prizefighter who has just made a successful comeback. The reason for his euphoria is that for the past six months, his influence at Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate he has dominated for more than thirty years, has been on the wane. Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier who at the beginning of the year acquired 18.8 per cent of Lonrho's shares and became joint chief executive of the company with Mr Rowland, has appeared to have been calling the shots. The company's strategic moves have apparently been dictated by Mr Bock - whether it was the disposal of businesses, such as the Observer newspaper, property in Brussels or last week's appointment of independent non-executives to the board for first time in 20 years. But Mr Rowland believes that his success in ending the legal dispute over the Fayed's 1985 purchase of the stores group House of Fraser - a truce he negotiated single-handedly between Wednesday and Friday of last week - shows that he is far from redundant. 'None of my colleagues knew (about the negotiations) and were surprised when it was signed,' he said. The two men rarely communicate with each other. Indeed by yesterday lunchtime, Mr Bock had still not telephoned to talk to him about it. 'I am sure Bock should be delighted with the deal,' Mr Rowland said. 'I am sure he will want to ring and congratulate me.' Furthermore, Mr Rowland denies that most of the disposals are the doing of Mr Bock, who he says has failed to pull off a single deal. Most of the disposals had, according to Mr Rowland, been planned for some time. By way of example he said the sale of GewoG, a German holding company with a portfolio of apartments, had been initiated by Mr Roger Badger, a former Lonrho director, and not by Mr Bock. 'All these deals were agreed well before Mr Bock arrived.' He is also critical of the one sale he does credit Mr Bock with achieving - the 50 per cent stake in the trading company which it owed jointly with Krupp-Hoesch. 'This was a poor deal,' he says. Though he insists he is not in conflict with Mr Bock - and says he has 'no desire' that the German financier should leave the company - he makes no secret of his discomfort with his management style. Mr Rowland said: 'He thinks Lonrho joined him and not vice versa. He will have to get used to working for Lonrho which is a public company.' Mr Bock's reply would almost certainly be that his aim over the past few months has been to transform Lonrho into a far more conventional public company, rather than the vehicle of Mr Rowland's will. He campaigned to secure the appointment of three non-executive directors - including two nominated by him, Mr Stephen Walls of Albert Fisher and Mr Peter Harper of Hanson - as part of a plan to make Lonrho more open and accountable to its shareholders. Whether by chance or design, the appointment of non-executives also changed the balance of power on the board to the point where he is convinced that he has more support than Mr Rowland. Mr Bock has also been bolstered by the support of the group's four big shareholders: Fidelity, with 8.9 per cent; PDFM, the fund management arm of UBS, with 2 per cent; Postel with 1.5 per cent; and Genting, a Malaysian plantations and gaming group, with 3.9 per cent. His plans to make the company more open and to increase the number of big institutional shareholders have been welcomed in the City of London. Nonetheless, in his attempts to make Lonrho a more 'normal' company, there was one deal he could never achieve. The dispute with the Fayeds was very much Mr Rowland's personal fight, because of his bitterness at having seen the stores group he longed to own being bought by Fayeds, whom he had regarded as close associates and friends. Because the fight was so personal, only Mr Rowland could end it, even though Mr Bock has been desperate that the group should cease spending millions of pounds on it - as much as Pounds 50m has been spent by the Fayeds and Lonrho on the dispute to date, according to Mr Rowland. Now that peace has broken out with the Fayeds, Mr Bock may become less frightened of open war between him and Mr Rowland. Mr Bock does not believe that Mr Rowland's famous network of political and business contacts in Africa and the Middle East contributes as much to profits as many believe. Were Mr Rowland to leave Lonrho, it would not do terrible damage to the group, Mr Bock believes. He would be delighted to buy Mr Rowland's stake, on which he has a call option, which is to be exercised at the end of 1995 or when Mr Rowland decides to leave the board, if he decides to go earlier. Mr Rowland made it clear yesterday he had no desire to quit: 'I started the company with six people and I have no intention of leaving it,' he said. 'I have no sense of when I will be less hands on. I have not given a second thought to being less executive.'</p>

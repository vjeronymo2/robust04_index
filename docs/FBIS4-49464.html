			<p>BFN     [Text] Governor He Zhiqiang, who is now studying at the  Central Party School, sent a written address entitled "Opening  Up, Forge Ahead, and Score New Brilliant Achievements" to the  Provincial Propaganda and Ideological Work Meeting. In this  speech, He Zhiqiang recalled the remarkable achievements scored  on all fronts in reform and opening up in our province over the  past 15 years. He emphasized that to achieve the strategic  second-step goal under the new situation, we must pay great  attention to the party's propaganda and ideological work;  constantly raise the level of ethics and political consciousness  of the masses of people of various nationalities; and form a  powerful ideological propelling force and a spiritual force of  unity among the people in the course of reform, opening up, and  modernization. It is not only party committees that should  grasp propaganda and ideological work, but governments as well.  It is not only propaganda departments that should grasp  propaganda and ideological work, but economic departments, as  well. The leadership and the rank and file, and various trades  and professions should make concerted efforts to carry out work  in this regard. Only in this way will a new situation emerge in  propaganda and ideological work. Propaganda and ideological  work should focus closely on the main theme of reform,  development, and stability; take economic construction as the  center; and uphold unity, stability, and promotion. It is  necessary to more widely publicize the study of the theory of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics; by publicizing  theories on the socialist market economy, to enable the cadres  and the people to establish a sense of the socialist market  economy and concentrate their attention on the four  modernizations so that the economy will grow further; and to lay  a foundation for social progress and social stability.    Propaganda and ideological work should regard as its  objective the training of four have's new people, should uphold  the standard of three beneficial's, should have clearer targets,  and should encourage and carry forward the pioneering spirit.  Through propaganda and education, propaganda and ideological  work should integrate new concepts that are in line with the  market economy with traditional fine values of the Chinese  nation, and should develop the spirit of hard work and selfless  dedication so that the dynamic role of the pioneering spirit in  the new period can be brought into full play in the practice of  reform and construction.    Propaganda and ideological work should energetically explore  new ways and new methods; improve operational mechanisms;  develop various carriers; and make use of modern transmitting  devices so that propaganda and ideological work can change from  something invisible into something visible, thus increasing its  impact and effectiveness. It should fully arouse the enthusiasm  of cadres, workers, and staff members concerning the promotion  of progress and the development of various trades, professions,  and undertakings, Governor He Zhiqiang said in conclusion.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Survey of Swiss Banking and Finance (6): Back to traditional values - Higher yield bond issues may lure retail investors THE SWISS bond market has enjoyed a second year of recovery, helped by falling interest rates and the unusual emergence of a substantial public sector deficit. The big three - Union Bank of Switzerland, CS Holding and Swiss Bank Corporation - now dominate the lead managing of issues even more than in the days of the bond syndicate cartel. They expect another six months of strong primary activity, but are uncertain what will follow. Some traditional characteristics of the bond market have reappeared, following an exotic period in the 1980s which saw an outbreak of equity-linked Japanese issues and swapped deals by borrowers without triple and double A ratings. Although volume in the first nine months of 1993 equalled that of the whole of last year, there has been a renewed emphasis on simplicity and quality. The unanswered question is whether Swiss retail investors, who buy most foreign issues, will be drawn into higher yielding bonds when interest rates fall further. 'Our investors are very conservative. I imagine that we may see some change when we have very low rates, and they start to accept higher risk,' says Mr Jean-Luc de Buman, a first vice-president of Union Bank of Switzerland. 'Investors will look for higher risk again eventually. That will give people like us the chance to bring new names or structured deals to the market,' says Mr Jules Keller, of SG Warburg Securities in Geneva. But that time has not yet arrived. SFr10.9bn of foreign straight issues up to November 4 were rated AAA, while SFr8.5bn were AA, SFr1.9bn were A and only SFr450m were lower than A. In addition, the fall in interest rates this year - government bond yields have dropped from about 5.6 per cent to 4.2 per cent - has not yet turned the yield curve positive. This has limited the scope for foreign borrowers to tap the market through swapped issues. Only a third of foreign straight issues so far in the second half have been swapped, compared with as much as 75 per cent at times in the 1980s. Nonetheless, domestic and foreign markets have been active. The foreign market has been helped by liberalisation, including the abolition of stamp duty and by the end of the requirement for banks participating in syndicates to be domiciled in Switzerland. The fall in interest rates has helped the Swiss market to join in the worldwide trend towards refinancing of corporate debt and capital raising. This activity has been matched by the domestic sector, which issued SFr29.3bn of bonds in the first 10 months compared with SFr33.5bn in foreign issues. The biggest innovations have also occured in the domestic market, including synthetic option bonds lead managed by Swiss Bank Corporation, offering options on Zurich Insurance equity in the case of a SFr154m issue for the City of Zurich. Despite market liberalisation, the dominance of the big three banks has, if anything, strengthened since the Cartel Commission insisted on an end to the agreement by which business was shared out among Swiss institutions. Their share of lead management of foreign issues in the first 10 months was 72 per cent, with only Nomura Bank (Switzerland) achieving more than 5 per cent among the rest. This is largely because of their immense placing power with Swiss retail investors, which allows them to operate profitably in a market where underwriting fees are virtually given away in issue pricing. Allegations that the big three also gain by being able to 'stuff' their investors' portfolios have largely disappeared as competition among them has stiffened following the end of the cartel. 'If someone says the Swiss are not opening up their market, I say: 'What can you contribute? What can you offer?',' says Mr Hans Rudolf Zehnder, the head of syndicate and primary sales at Credit Suisse. He argues that the big three banks have 'a unique situation' in the Swiss market because it is dominated by retail investors that only they can reach through their investment networks. Opinions vary on whether the big three have also been helped in to gaining market share by the rise in volume this year. Some competitors say that their placing power allows them to take the risk of mispricing an issue without becoming over-stretched. But others acknowledge that the fall in interest rates has reduced the obstacles to competitors with less placing power clearing an issue. Whichever is true, the big three's dominance of underwriting raises the question of whether they will sustain losses next year as short-term rates reach a floor and they face difficulties in distributing the whole of the most aggressively priced issues. Most banks expect a floor in yields to be reached in the middle of 1994. When it happens, primary activity may subside, although the emergence of a mildly positive yield curve is likely to sustain investment in medium-term and long bonds and improve conditions for swapped issues. Banks are also preparing for a structural shift towards higher yielding bonds. It is not only banks outside the big three that want to encourage this. Mr de Buman of UBS says the market must protect itself against a slackening of supply by persuading investors to consider issues outside the higher investment grade 'religion'. But the big three know that the wider the spread of issuers, the more competition they will face from other lead managers. One of their strongest protections against losing market share is their expertise in derivatives, which has already allowed them to structure innovative domestic issues, and will be helpful if greater interest in swapped foreign issues emerges next year.</p>

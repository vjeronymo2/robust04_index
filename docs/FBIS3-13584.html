What is  required from the UN Security Council is neither strange nor  abnormal. What is required is only a resolution in harmony with  its previous resolutions. What is required is a resolution  entrenching the objective for which the Security Council and the  international organization were established. What is required  is a resolution condemning the massacre, defining international  protective measures so that the massacre will not be repeated,  and demanding the disarming of the settlers who came to our land  to commit massacres.    However, days and weeks have passed since the massacre, and  no such resolution has been issued. Why? Because the United  States is exerting pressure to prevent such a resolution. The  United States believes there is no need for resolutions because  Israel alone can take such measures, can protect the  Palestinians from itself, and can put pressure on its settlers  to hold their terrorism at bay. Efforts are being exerted to  issue such a resolution by the permanent members of the Security  Council, such as Russia, France, Britain, and China, as well as  by many European, Arab, Islamic, and African countries.  However, the United States, the most powerful country in the  world -- which speaks day and night about human rights,  international legitimacy, and sponsoring the peace process -- is  resisting this desire for justice by the international community  and insists on its support for, bias toward, and collusion with  Israel; that is, in favor of terrorism, crime, and massacre.    If we scrutinize the U.S. stand we will find the United  States saying to us: Israel is the enemy and the arbiter;  Israel is the killer and the savior. This is strange and  abnormal logic that runs counter to justice and history. It is  logic that pours salt in the wounds and makes those with faith  in peace question their faith. This logic destroys the  foundations of the peace process. If this happens, the  Palestinians are not the only losers. All parties, including  Israel and the protector of its terrorism, the United States,  will also lose.    Does power and force blind people to this extent? Will  Israel continue to commit crimes and seek the protection of the  United States?</p>

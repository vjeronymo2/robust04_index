			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ambassador Virgil Constantinescu, general </F> director of the General Directorate for Security and  Euro-Atlantic Integration of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, by  Alexandra Dragoi; place and date not given]    [Text] [Dragoi] What does participation in the  `Partnership for Peace' program mean for Romania?    [Constantinescu] By participating in the `Partnership for  Peace' program and trying to get completely involved, Romania is  pursuing its integration into NATO structures. It views this  program just as an initial stage, bearing in mind that there are  difficulties, both logistical and over the incompatibility of  our military systems. The application of this accord needs time  and problems will probably surface as we go along; nor do its  initiators have a clear image of what it should include.    Romania was particularly interested in this initiative for  its comprehensive nature, because it does not draw a new  demarcation line in Europe. We were the first country to sign  this document. Now we are at the stage of preparing a document  to consist of two parts: one linked to the political aspect --  the continuation of the economic and democratic reform process,  observance of the CSCE norms, the transparency of the military  doctrines -- and another linked to the military aspect, namely  to offers in the military area. Linked to this aspect, by the  end of the year a first elite battalion, including volunteers,  will be made available for peacekeeping actions. Its training  will be complex and will include English-language lessons. The  individual 16 plus 1 Partnership Program is being worked out in  Brussels; it will represent the foundation of cooperation among  NATO's partner states. Joint exercises will also take place.    Romania also wants to capitalize on the advantages in the  political area that participation in this accord offers, such as  settling the differences of opinion that mark relations with  Hungary. One of the conditions is to solve the disputes that  still exist; it being viewed as a "historic reconciliation."  True, no guarantees for security are offered like those offered  by NATO, but a mechanism is established for consultations should  problems of that kind emerge; the given state has the  possibility of approaching the Alliance.    We should not forget that Partnership for Peace has an  economic aspect, namely partnership for development, offering  access to NATO programs in such areas as: the conversion of the  defense and weapons industry for peaceful purposes, research in  the military area, and assistance in the case of nuclear  accidents or calamities.    Now all states are in the same position; after this program  is launched, however, changes will occur, particularly because  the resources of the participating states are different.  Partnership means substantial expenses for ensuring the  compatibility between our own army and NATO's army; this will  require special financial efforts, especially since we have the  lowest military budget per capita. Consequently, the economic  aspect is very important and probably certain facilities will be  granted in the future; in any case, the military budget has to  be transparent.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUTUMN IS AN EXCELLENT SEASON FOR PLANTING SHRUBS, TREES OR BULBS  </P> <P> Summer is winding down, but that's no signal to neglect your yard and garden.  Autumn is an excellent time to plant many kinds of shrubs, trees and  spring-blooming bulbs.  </P> <P> Fall plantings will add beauty and value to your home grounds. The plantings  will develop roots during the winter, getting them off to a strong start next  spring.  </P> <P> As you plan your landscaping, think of the benefits: sight-screening, comfort,  beauty, convenience, safety and easy maintenance.  </P> <P> The American Assn. of Nurserymen says that most homeowners want their yards to  afford some privacy. A hedge of trees and shrubs can screen out unsightly views  while affording some privacy.  </P> <P> Your yard can provide outdoor room for comfort and relaxation. The temperature  in a tree's shade, for instance, may be 15 to 20 degrees cooler than in the  sun. A row of trees and shrubs can protect against disturbing winds. Thick  foliage can muffle city noise and help cleanse a polluted atmosphere.  </P> <P> Maintenance can be a pleasure rather than a burden. Flat borders of brick or  stone between flower beds and lawn can minimize edging and trimming around  beds. Planting in containers can ease gardening chores by eliminating the need  for stooping. Some lawn mowing, watering and weeding work can be reduced by the  use of mulches and ground-cover plants.  </P> <P> The association also advises: "Once your plan has been made for your yard,  don't feel installation can be done immediately. If the design is sufficiently  flexible, it can take shape over months or even years, as circumstances  dictate, whether you do it yourself or have professionals do it."  </P></p>

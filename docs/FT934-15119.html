			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / International Company News: US brokers post strong advances SHARES in US securities brokerages rose sharply yesterday after three big Wall Street firms reported strong quarterly earnings. The results were better than analysts and investors expected and confirmed that low domestic interest rates, heavy investor interest in stock and bond markets and buoyant corporate demand for underwriting services are continuing to fuel Wall Street's profits boom. Merrill Lynch, the industry leader, led the way with record third-quarter net income of Dollars 360m, up 57 per cent from a year ago, on record net revenues of Dollars 2.64bn. Investment banking put in the strongest performance, with revenues rising 24 per cent to Dollars 452m as the firm cemented its position as the world's biggest underwriter of debt and equities. So far this year, Merrill has helped its clients raise Dollars 155bn in financings on US and overseas securities markets. Revenues from principal transactions rose 20 per cent to Dollars 733m, due to big profits from trading derivatives, equities and money market instruments. Commission revenues climbed 23 per cent to Dollars 690m, while asset management and custodial fees rose 18 per cent to Dollars 250m. Non-interest expenses rose in line with business activity, increasing by 13 per cent to Dollars 2bn. As expected, Merrill announced a two-for-one stock split aimed at making its shares, which rose above Dollars 100 for the first time yesterday, more attractive to a wider group of investors. By the close Merrill's shares were up Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 101 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. The factors which spurred Merrill's earnings also played a part in the healthy profit gains recorded at PaineWebber and Bear Stearns. PaineWebber reported a 14 per cent increase in third-quarter net income to Dollars 59.1m, earned on revenues of Dollars 736.8m, up from Dollars 625.8m a year earlier. Revenues from commissions, principal transactions and asset management were all higher. The one disappointment was investment banking, where revenues remained strong at Dollars 100.8m but still came in 5 per cent lower than a year ago. The firm's non-interest expenses increased 17.5 per cent to Dollars 637.4m. PaineWebber's shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 34 3/8 on the NYSE. Bear Stearns recorded the biggest increase in earnings of the three, with net income jumping 66 per cent to Dollars 104.3m in the company's fiscal first quarter. Commissions and principal transactions revenues were both strong, but the investment banking business sparkled, with revenues rising 91 per cent to Dollars 119.2m. On the NYSE, Bear Stearns shares were up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 24 3/4 at the close. Discount brokerage Charles Schwab, which two weeks ago said it would post a big increase in third-quarter earnings, announced profits for the period of Dollars 22.2m, up from Dollars 7.8m a year earlier. The results were better than expected and Schwab's shares rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

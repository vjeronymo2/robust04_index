			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Letter: US stance on shipping ignores spirit of Gatt Sir, I read with interest Frances Williams's report, 'EC farm stance seen as biggest threat to Gatt talks' (January 14). I must note, however, that apart from the well-known problems with agriculture, there are, also, difficulties in other sectors of the negotiations. The attitude of the US with regard to maritime transport is one of great concern to my country - for which shipping is an economic activity of paramount importance - and, I would say, to other maritime countries too. The US insists on preserving its own right to sign bilateral most favoured nation (MFN) agreements even after a postulated successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round. This approach is by no means compatible with the spirit of the negotiations and cannot be considered as helpful. Maritime transport is a sector already liberalised to a great extent. It is then hardly conceivable that, as a result of the Uruguay Round, more restrictions than those existing at the beginning of the negotiations would be imposed on shipping. If the right of bilateral MFN agreements is to be preserved, and if an effective standstill and a gradual and progressive roll-back are not to be included in the framework of the agreement under negotiation, then the exemption of maritime transport from the Uruguay Round altogether is preferable. At least, in this case, no more restrictions would be imposed on shipping as a result of its 'liberalisation'. Efthimios Christodoulou, Minister of National Economy, Athens</p>

			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Convoy ambush sparks fresh Bosnia fighting THE ATTACK on a relief convoy in Bosnia led to a fresh upsurge of fighting between Moslems and Croats yesterday. At the same time clashes between Moslems and Bosnian Serbs also escalated on several fronts, Reuter reports. Croatian gunmen pounced on a column of some 170 trucks taking food and other supplies to the Moslem town of Tuzla. United Nations sources said at least eight civilian drivers were dragged from their cabins and shot. Croats then ransacked and looted some of the trucks. The attack, near the disputed town of Novi Travnik, prompted a fresh outburst of fighting in the area. Flashes from exploding artillery shells were seen to the south-east of Novi Travnik as Moslem artillery evidently resumed blasting Croatian targets. Croat-Moslem battles over the past few days have killed hundreds and driven thousands of Croats from their homes in the region. Fighting between Moslems and Serbs, meanwhile, appeared to be intensifying on several fronts. The Bosnian capital of Sarajevo shook to the noise of mortar and artillery shells after darkness fell. Hospital and mortuary officials reported that at least six people had been killed and 37 wounded in the latest barrage. Sarajevo radio said 3,000 shells had crashed into the besieged Moslem city of Gorazde and its surroundings yesterday. In the town of Maglaj, civilians huddled in basements and shelters as Serb gunners blasted Moslem targets. In New York, the UN Security Council last night took a step towards monitoring the Yugoslavia-Bosnia border, apparently including air surveillance to check on weapons and other supplies to Bosnian Serbs. A resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, asks the secretary-general to study deployment and report back to the council, as well as seek intelligence on border movements. The measure is a far cry from earlier plans to deploy inspectors on the Serb-dominated Yugoslav side of the Bosnian border, which diplomats last month thought Belgrade would accept.</p>

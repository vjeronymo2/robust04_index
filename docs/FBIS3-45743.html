According to the decision of the top  CPC leadership, the meeting will mainly consider and arrange the  work of the mass media, including newspapers and journals,  cultural work, broadcast and television affairs, publishing  affairs, and overseas propaganda, through further emancipating  the minds in the course of establishing the socialist market  economy.    According to sources, this will be the second propaganda  work  conference that has been undertaken on such a grand scale and at  such a high level since the founding of the PRC. The previous  national propaganda work conference was held in 1957. CPC  General Secretary Jiang Zemin will give a speech at the meeting.  During the national propaganda work conference, the XINHUA NEWS  AGENCY, journalist and publishing institutions, radio and  television system, institutions in charge of cultural affairs,  and the overseas propaganda department will also separately hold  their own meetings at the same time.    The central leadership fully affirmed the orientation of  opinion in the recent period and said that it was necessary to  continue to carry out the principle of unity, stability, and  encouragement, to maintain continuity in propaganda work, and to  stress the key points in various periods under the new situation  of building the socialist market economy. This so-called  continuity refers to the point that the propaganda work as a  whole should be conducted around the main theme of Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. At the same time, an emphasis should be placed  on specific key points in various periods.</p>

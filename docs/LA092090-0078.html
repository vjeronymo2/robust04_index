			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> 4 ARRESTED IN BURGLARIES  </P> <P> West Hollywood sheriff's deputies have made four arrests and are seeking other  suspects in connection with 11 burglaries that have taken place since May at  antique, jewelry and secondhand stores in and near West Hollywood.  </P> <P> Lt. Maynard Davis said detectives from the West Hollywood sheriff's station  have recovered two small truckloads of stolen merchandise, including 90  antiques pieces, paintings and other collectibles and an assortment of jewelry.  </P> <P> Most of the burglaries, Davis said, have been committed at night when the shops  were closed. In most cases, he said, the burglars smashed the front windows of  the stores, grabbed loot that was readily at hand and fled.  </P> <P> Arrested and charged with the burglaries are John D. Garrett, 28, and Edward K.  Douglas, 25, of West Hollywood. Glenn J. Spurbeck, 28, of West Hollywood,  Terence L. Kienzle, 43, who gave no permanent address, were also arrested and  charged with receiving stolen property. Deputies are seeking three additional  suspects.  </P> <P> The four arrests were made after deputies received a tip from a witness who  said he saw Garrett smash the window of a store and steal several items inside,  Davis said. Garrett and the others were traced to an apartment on North Fairfax  Avenue, which deputies described as a "crash pad for street people."  </P> <P> The recovered merchandise has been put on display at the sheriff's station.  Merchants who have been burglarized and would like to view the recovered goods  may contact Detective Arthur Lucas at the West Hollywood sheriff's station at  (213) 855-8850.  </P></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House Stories of Trafalgar wanting out of Cunard and the Ritz are far from fanciful, official denials notwithstanding. Here, it would seem, is a company at the crossroads, anxious to throw off the unfashionable conglomerate tag and focus investor attention on its newly enlarged and probably underrated construction and engineering skills. After years of dabbling in newspapers, luxury cruise ships and North Sea oil, a proper Trafalgar identity may finally be to hand. The actual restructuring process may not be so smooth. The market was clearly disappointed by the vague commitment to sell peripheral assets, which on top of the dividend cut left the shares 8 per cent lower at 147p. No doubt it is hard for Sir Nigel Broackes to contemplate leisure and hotel sales given the prices on offer, but Trafalgar's balance sheet raises the question of whether the company will ultimately have much choice. Gearing by the September year-end is likely to be 60 to 70 per cent and heading higher  -in part due to working capital demands for construction and engineering - just when the commercial property side may be needing new investment. Another rights scarcely seems a realistic option.</p>

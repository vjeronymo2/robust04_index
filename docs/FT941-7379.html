			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Trade row could harm important relationship: A senior foreign ministry official in Tokyo talks to William Dawkins Japan's senior foreign ministry official warned yesterday that the US-Japan trade row, if mishandled, could harm one of the world's most important bilateral relationships. 'If badly handled ..those trade issues have the danger of affecting our overall relations,' said Mr Kunihiko Saito, vice-minister for foreign affairs. He was 'quite embarrassed and even worried' by Japanese press applause for prime minister Morihiro Hosokawa's ref usal to accept US demands for a fixed target for a decline in Japan's record trade surplus. Japan had turned down US demands before, on fishery and aviation rights, and Mr Saito did not wish Tokyo to be thought to have recently become assertive to the US. 'We failed to reach agreement on only three specific areas in all the many aspects of our relationship. . . so we should not lose sight of the vast perspective,' said Mr Saito, in an interview in which he showed a sharp contrast to the bombastic recent line taken by US officials. Mr Saito admitted the row had caused damage and that Washington appeared 'mainly interested in improving trade relations with Japan' when Tokyo was trying to reduce the weight of economic interests on its overall foreign policy. 'We are getting more and more aware that we cannot continue to pursue only an economic role for ever and we have to try to meet expectations held by the rest of the world,' he said. Despite the row, Japan believed its US relationship was 'essentially sound' and accorded more importance than ever to keeping close links with Washington, not least because of its value as guarantor of security in Asia. 'Japan depends on the US for its defence. . . Although the Cold War is now over, the pot-ential threat to our security continues to exist and we have no wish whatsoever to develop our military capability. All Asian countries, particularly members of Asean, think the US-Japan relationship is essential for the safety, security and prosperity of the whole region. In that sense, Japan and the US have a responsibility to try to remain friendly,' he said. Whether the US continued to place such importance on Japan since the collapse of the Soviet Union was one of the most uncomfortable questions facing Tokyo's foreign policy planners. 'A few people' in the US government might not share Japan's view of the paramount strategic value of the relationship, Mr Saito feared. 'We hope the number of these people will not increase in the future. Perhaps we need more efforts now than at the time of the Cold War to convince the Americans of the importance of our bilateral relations.' Mr Saito drew a distinction between Japan's unchanging desire for close co-operation with the US and its preparedness to alter policies towards other countries, in the light of post-Cold War changes. Despite the risk of the dispute spilling over to other aspects of US-Japan relations, the government planned to stand firm against numerical targets. He understood why the US wanted to try new methods of reducing the Japanese trade surplus in the light of the failure of many previous attempts. Accepting a precise target 'may alleviate the present pressure but it will only postpone the problem one year or two years', said Mr Saito. Other governments, not just the US, would be tempted to blame Japan for missing such a target and might then restrict Japanese imports on the pretext of helping Tokyo to meet the goal, he argued.</p>

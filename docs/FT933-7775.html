			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Nedlloyd suffers mid-term deficit DEPRESSED freight rates pushed Nedlloyd, the Dutch shipping and road haulage group, into a Fl 116m (Dollars 60m) net loss for the 1993 first half from a slim profit of Fl 1m a year earlier. The company, which described the result as 'most unsatisfactory', said results in the second half were expected to show clear improvement, though the figure would remain negative. In a breakdown of developments over the first six months, Nedlloyd said a 'low point' was reached in the first quarter when losses totalled Fl 86m. This was followed by a narrowing of losses to Fl 30m in the second quarter. The ocean-shipping division swung into an operating loss of Fl 62m in the first half from a Fl 34m profit a year earlier. Although land-based transport and distribution remained profitable, operating results fell to Fl 5m from Fl 8m. The company said it was not clear whether road haulage second-half results would match those in the same period of 1992 because of continuing recession in Europe.</p>

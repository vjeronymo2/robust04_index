			<p><P> April 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISSILES  </P> <P> Your March 22 report, "Deal to Build Two Missile Systems Seen," characterizes  funding both MX and Midgetman missiles as a compromise. The Air Force and  Congress can't agree which missile is needed. Neither missile can increase  national security because land-based missiles are no longer survivable.  </P> <P> Building both missiles resolves the controversy in the wrong direction by  increasing the budget deficit without increasing national security.  </P> <P> A better answer is to build neither missile and to negotiate cuts to nuclear  arsenals.  </P> <P> DICK HEISER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

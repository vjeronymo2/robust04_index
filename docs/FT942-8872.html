			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: US stores post sharp gains in opening quarter J. C. Penney and Dayton Hudson, two of the biggest US store groups, both reported sharp increases in sales and profits for the first quarter to April. J. C. Penney's net income rose to Dollars 223m, a 30 per cent increase on the Dollars 172m reported before extraordinary items last time. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose to 84 cents from 65 cents before extraordinary items. The profits increase was partly driven by a 10 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 4.35bn. J. C. Penney's mix of own-label and brand-name apparel has been selling well in its department stores, and the group's catalogue operations have benefited from Sears's exit from the catalogue business. The company also benefited from tight control of costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell to 25.1 per cent of sales this time from 25.9 per cent in last year's first quarter. Dayton Hudson increased profits by 31 per cent in the same period, but from a lower base than J. C. Penney. Net income rose to Dollars 39m from Dollars 30m on sales up by 11 per cent to Dollars 4.47bn. Fully-diluted earnings per share rose to 47 cents from 35 cents. Mr Robert Ulrich, who took over last month as chief executive, said the Target stores had continued their solid performance. Mervyn's results were starting to reflect the benefits of a new merchandising strategy, especially in women's apparel, and the department store division was continuing to gain momentum from its emphasis on value. US West, the regional Bell telephone company, plans to launch an interactive video merchandising service, Reuter reports from Seattle. Mr Andrew Orgel, executive vice-president of US West's Interactive Video Enterprises division, said retailers Nord strom and J. C. Penney were among the businesses participating in the new venture. They would help design, develop and promote the system. He said the service would be offered on a variety of platforms and would be available to consumers through their television sets or over personal computers. Mr Orgel said the service was a planned national system available for distribution by a variety of providers.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Croatia tightens grip on south-west Bosnia CROATIA yesterday moved to consolidate its grip over south-western Bosnia-Hercegovina by signing a military alliance with the Bosnian government. The alliance coincides with fresh moves by President Franjo Tudjman to end the United Nations mandate in Croatia so that Croatia can regain control over its territory. At present UN peace-keeping forces in Croatia are located in three sectors seized by Serb forces last year. The Croatian press has recently stepped up a campaign against the UN, accusing it of consolidating Serb gains in the republic, and preventing Croat refugees from returning to these sectors. But UN officials said yesterday the ethnic tensions in the sectors prevent the refugees from returning. They added that if the UN forces withdrew, Croatia could be plunged into another war. Military experts in Belgrade yesterday said Croatia was now heavily armed, despite the UN arms embargo on the former Yugoslavia. However Mr Goran Hadzic, leader of the militant Serbs in sector east, the UN-protected region in eastern Croatia, yesterday said his forces would never live in an independent Croatia. He also vowed to fight until it was united with Serbia. The military alliance with Bosnia, drawn up last June by Mr Tudjman, was signed by Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic in an attempt to defend its territory against Serb forces which have already seized large parts of eastern Bosnia, and have maintained a five-month siege on Sarajevo. But instead of supporting the Bosnian/Moslem forces, as agreed in June, Croatian units seized parts of western Bosnia and regions around Sarajevo, and even prevented supplies reaching Bosnian troops. As a result, Bosnian forces are now sandwiched between Serb and Croat army units intent on dividing the republic between Croatia and Serbia.</p>

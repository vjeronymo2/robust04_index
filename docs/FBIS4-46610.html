			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by D. A. Belyayev, chief, Production </F> Analysis and Forecasting Administration, Center for Economic  Conditions under Russian Federation Government: "Conversion of  Military Production"]    [Text] The production slump in defense sectors of industry  continued to deepen in the first quarter of 1994. According to  Russian Federation Goskomstat [State Committee for Statistics]  data, the reduction in product output was 35 percent with  respect to the first quarter of last year, which is more than  for industry as a whole (25 percent). According to 1993 results,  the production slump in the defense complex was 16 percent,  i.e., it was equal to the Russian Federation industry average.    The drop in production affected all defense sectors without  exception. Compared with the first quarter of 1993, product  output was cut almost in half at enterprises of the aircraft  industry and armament industry and by 40 percent in the  electronics industry and communications equipment industry. A  significant reduction in production volume also is seen in the  atomic industry, previously distinguished by stability.    The output of defense products was reduced by 40 percent in  the first quarter. Its rates of reduction continue to exceed  those of civilian production, but a trend has appeared toward  rates of decline in military and civilian production gradually  drawing together.    The reduction in output of civilian products, which was 11  percent in the defense complex according to 1993 results,  accelerated in the fourth quarter of that same year, and during  January-March 1994 reached 33 percent compared with the  corresponding period of last year. For the first time during  conversion the slump in production of civilian products proved  more substantial than in civilian sectors of production. A  further drop in output of civilian products for technical and  production purposes was predetermined by the continuing limited  nature of investment opportunities for all consumers of  machine-building products. As a result of a drop in demand on  the part of light industry, the agro-industrial complex,  transportation and a number of other sectors, output of  equipment for light industry in the defense complex fell by 55  percent in the first quarter of 1994, output of equipment for  processing sectors of the agro-industrial complex fell by 44  percent, output of equipment for trade and public dining fell by  41 percent, output of mainline freight cars fell by 76 percent  and so on. At the same time, the need for replacing equipment in  sectors where the defense complex is the major supplier remains  very high. For example, the proportion of main technological  equipment in light industry over 10 years of age was one-third  as of the end of 1992, including more than a third of spinning  machines and almost half of looms. Existing replacement rates of  main kinds of technological equipment in light industry (around  3-5 percent a year) make its overcoming of technological  backwardness, transition to new technologies and output of  competitive products problematical. The very same situation also  is taking shape in other sectors of the economy putting out  products needed by the country's economy and its population.    Production of consumer goods in defense sectors developed  relatively successfully in 1993. With an overall 7 percent  reduction for many of the most important kinds, a production  growth of 7 percent was achieved for television sets (including  4 percent for color sets), 7 percent for refrigerators and  freezers, 1.2-1.4 times for small farm machinery, and more than  one and one-half times for automobile spare parts.    But a trend toward a slump in production of non-food  consumer  goods (less light industry) appeared in the defense complex in  the fall of last year, and their output in the first quarter of  1994 was only 63 percent of the first quarter of 1993 (70  percent for industry as a whole). The production of television  sets (including color sets), knitting machines, electric meat  cutters and juicers was cut by a fourth, and that of washing  machines, electric vacuum cleaners, radios, bicycles, sewing  machines, and paints and varnishes by half. The output of tape  recorders, microcalculators, cameras and motorcycles was cut by  almost two-thirds, and children's strollers and bicycles by  three-fourths. Production of multipurpose kitchen appliances  remained at the previous level. The production of double and  triple refrigerators rose somewhat. Population demand is of  greatest importance here. Imported durable goods are beginning  to occupy an ever greater proportion in satisfying that demand.  Therefore substantially increasing quality characteristics,  technical level and, as a result, competitiveness of goods  manufactured for the population while observing a sensible  pricing policy becomes one of the main tasks of defense sector  enterprises.    The process of a decline in capital investments in  enterprises of Goskomoboronprom [State Committee for the Defense  Industry] continued in 1993 against the background of an overall  reduction in investments in all sectors of the national economy.    In 1993 Goskomoboronprom enterprises assimilated R530.2  billion from all sources of financing, which, according to the  center's calculations, is 36 percent lower in comparable prices  than in 1992. The decline in volumes of capital investments was  29 percent for industry as a whole, including machine-building.  There was a reduction from 2.8 percent in 1992 to 2.1 percent in  1993 in the proportion of capital investments assimilated by  Goskomoboronprom enterprises and organizations in the overall  volume of capital investments for the national economy.    Under conditions of a limitation of financial resources,  there was a reorientation in use of funds in Goskomoboronprom  enterprises from the construction of production facilities to  the construction of nonproduction facilities. While 62 percent  of the total volume of capital investments were expended for  production construction in 1992, it was 55 percent in 1993. The  proportion of funds being directed toward production  construction was 60 percent for the national economy as a whole.  As a result of a redistribution of funds, 1.6 million  m[.sup]2[/] of housing were placed in use, which is 16  percent below last year's level, but the overall reduction of  investments for Goskomoboronprom was more significant.    Internal and borrowed funds of enterprises continue to be  the  basic source for financing capital construction, despite the  fact that their proportion in the overall volume of capital  investments dropped from 88 percent in 1992 to 84 percent in  1993.    The proportion of centralized capital investments increased  from 12 percent to 16 percent. In 1993 the volume of centralized  capital investments increased, albeit slightly, at the expense  of funds of local budgets, which previously essentially had not  financed the defense industry. While R0.3 billion were allocated  to defense enterprises from local budgets in 1992, it was R5.2  billion in 1993 (in existing prices of the corresponding years).  The greatest proportion of investments from centralized sources  was directed toward developing the shipbuilding industry (21  percent) and armament industry (18 percent).    Assimilation of capital investments in Goskomoboronprom  enterprises on the territory of Russia in 1993 was concentrated  basically in two economic areas, Central and Urals, where almost  half of all capital investments were assimilated. With respect  to centralized investments, the Central area accounts for a  third.    The direction of qualitative improvement both of military as  well as civilian products remains one of the main tasks of  defense complex investment policy even under the extremely  difficult conditions which have taken shape. It is necessary to  consistently implement a line toward tieing in investment  activity above all with qualitative parameters of manufactured  products, since measures of state paternalism alone cannot  protect the domestic market against the inflow of imported  products nor preserve positions of military equipment in world  markets.    The number of industrial-production personnel in the defense  complex declined by 14 percent in the first quarter compared  with the first quarter of 1993, which is somewhat greater than  last year (12 percent). The outflow of the labor force from  defense sectors is occurring faster than for industry as a  whole. As happened last year, the greatest first quarter drop in  numbers occurred in the electronics industry, where a deep  production slump and the lowest pay (two times lower than for  the industry average) are seen.</p>

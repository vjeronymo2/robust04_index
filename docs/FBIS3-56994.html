			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ukrainian leader Leonid Kravchuk says "those who  offer Ukraine to hold back to its nuclear arsenal want the  country to become hostage to the nuclear weapons signing a death  warrant to the people of Ukraine". He was speaking in Kiev on  Friday [21 January] while attending the national stock exchange.    Kravchuk said that by signing the three-nation nuclear  disarmament agreement in Moscow, "we have met the conditions set  by the Ukrainian parliament during the ratification of the  Start-1 agreement." He said the government embarked on the road  of implementing rather than blocking parliamentary resolutions  and had to strike compromise and make concessions as it should  be.</p>

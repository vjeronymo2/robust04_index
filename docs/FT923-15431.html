			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / International Capital Markets: Japanese exchanges plan to form secondary market FIVE regional stock exchanges in Japan plan to set up a secondary stock market with easier listing requirements, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Officials said the exchanges, in Sapporo, Niigata, Kyoto, Hiroshima and Fukuoka, would accept listing applications from today. They expect to see the first listing on the new section by the end of this year. The listing criteria will be the same as for the new second section of the Osaka Securities Exchange, which requires companies to have at least 1m shares outstanding and at least 300 shareholders at the time of listing. At present, companies that want to list on the ordinary sections of the regional exchanges must have at least 2m shares outstanding and 400 shareholders. Stricter profit and dividend criteria also apply. Japan has eight stock exchanges, Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya plus the five regional exchanges.</p>

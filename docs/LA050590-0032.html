			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH A BORING BALLPARK  </P> <P>  I wish to clarify a statement Mike Reilley made in his story about baseball  parks.  </P> <P> While the Dodger Stadium cafeteria does have a varied menu and decent food, the  ushers will allow only fans sitting in the expensive seats access to it.  </P> <P> Two-thirds of the stadium has only one real food choice -- hot dogs that are  burned on the outside and cold on the inside. I have been to more than a dozen  stadiums, and Dodger Stadium ranks near the bottom in quality and is without  question at the bottom in variety.  </P> <P> An organization that draws 3 million people each year should do more for their  fans.  </P> <P> MIKE LORRAINE, Simi Valley  </P></p>

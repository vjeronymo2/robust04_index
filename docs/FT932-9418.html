			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / GPA Group - The Refinancing: Shannon dependent on aviation spin-offs IRISH businessmen and politicians will breathe a sigh of relief if GE Capital's rescue of GPA, outlined last night, is approved by shareholders, banks and bondholders. Irish companies such as Aer Lingus, the flag carrier which provided the seed money for Mr Tony Ryan to start up GPA in 1975, and institutional investors such as Irish Life, have seen their investment in GPA wiped out by its financial problems. Workers in Shannon, moreover, have become increasingly dependent on GPA as a source of local employment as the role of Shannon airport in trans-Atlantic travel has waned. GPA was established in the Shannon Free Zone in the south-west of Ireland to take advantage of its low 10 per cent corporate tax rate. A restructured GPA will most likely remain in Shannon for the same reasons. The local spin-offs have been substantial. Shannon Aerospace, a GPA joint venture with the airlines Swissair and Lufthansa, opened an IPounds 80m (Pounds 78.6m) aircraft maintenance facility last September. This is the centrepiece of a planned European hub for jet aircraft maintenance, overhaul and repair, around which 11,500 jobs are expected to be created by the end of the decade. Shannon Turbine Technologies, a IPounds 24m GPA joint venture with Sulzer, the Swiss engineering company, will open this year, to provide jet engine maintenance. Several thousand jobs are expected to result when both projects are running at full capacity. According to a spokeswoman for the Shannon Development Authority, 'GPA has been an important player for us in developing the concept of the aviation park. Whatever happens to GPA will not affect our plans to develop that'.</p>

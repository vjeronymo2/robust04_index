He was speaking at  the end of an inter-regional forum in the central Russian city  of Tambov on Wednesday.    The forum was attended by representatives of a number of  regional associations from central and northwestern Russia,  Siberia, the Northern Caucuses, Urals and elsewhere.    However, such a change will take a long time to happen,  Shakhray told a meeting of students and lecturers of the Moscow  Institute for International Relations Thursday. He said Russia  was "destined for a long interim period during which its current  structure built along ethnic lines will adapt itself to a new  pattern based on a territorial principle".    Shakhray is skeptical about attempts to try to break Russia  into provinces either from on-high or below. A lengthy interim  period is needed because of the huge variety of Russian regions,  he said. Only 23 out of 89 regions is economically  self-reliant, others have to be subsidized. As it is now, said  Shakhray, the federal government is having to act as an agency  for the redistribution of wealth which creates a highly  dangerous situation.    The minister reiterated support for the recent agreement  between Moscow and Tatarstan describing it as a first ever test  of the new method aimed at resolving a power struggle between  the center and a region. Shakhray believes this will also help  resolve a similar dispute between Moscow and the southern  autonomy of Chechnya which appears to be ready for some kind of  accommodation.    Shakhray believes that a lack of coordinated effort by the  center and political dialogue between North Ossetia and  Ingushetia are the main stumbling blocks to regional peace.    However, he does not believe in any regional settlement  unless Moscow applies some pressure. Shakhray said the federal  government must use economic leverage to bring the two sides to  the negotiating table. He reminded the audience that North  Ossetia and Ingushetia depended on federal subsidy by 60 and 97  percent respectively.</p>

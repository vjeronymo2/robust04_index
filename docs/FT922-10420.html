			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / More doorsteps bring parties down to earth: How weary politicians are preparing to fight next week's council elections FOR THE parties at Westminster, next Thursday's local elections are less than a month and yet more than a world away from the general election. The national election required politicians to make predictions of victory that were derided as hopelessly bullish by all but hardened supporters. The local polls, in contrast, have produced a chorus of modesty. The profile of this second contest is much lower. There are no poster campaigns, no national newspaper advertisements, and - apart from Mr Paddy Ashdown of the Liberal Democrats - there is not a party leader in sight. There is the faint impression that the parties might even have forgone the election broadcast to which each is entitled if such a course could have been arranged. Labour is on the defensive in the aftermath of a general election defeat many voters did not expect. 'We wouldn't regard April 9 as the best preparation,' said one party official with masterly understatement. The party is also contesting seats it won at a peak of local success in 1988. A veil is drawn over Labour morale in some areas, though it is said to be adequate in areas where the party captured parliamentary seats. There are still attempts to look on the bright side. The record of Labour-led authorities such as York in developing ideas for good-quality services is mentioned with pride as a justification for trust in Labour local government. For the Liberal Democrats, the main fear is that their failure to win some of their main parliamentary targets may have created a bandwagon stuck in reverse gear. Against this is Mr Ashdown's vision of a nation anxious to purge itself of the shame of voting Tory last month, and the fact that the party does not, this time, have to spend weeks just trying to imprint its identity on voters' minds. The Tory campaign seems the most relaxed. The strategy of Central Office's local-government unit strategy appears to be to rely on the momentum created at the general election. Ministerial campaigning seems confined to the environment team. The campaign has been reinforced by successful Tory candidates for the Commons repaying canvassing done on their behalf by councillors. Former MPs who lost their seats, including at least one ex-minister, are also taking part. The Tories, at least, need not worry about the message they are seeking to convey. It is simply a variation on the theme in the general election of better management providing good yet affordable public services, with a dash of reform. The other parties face the dilemma of how far to play up the government's policies for local government. They know that these may well be unpopular, but also that they cannot offer much hope of change on fundamental issues. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said that it was 'the counsel of despair' to point out that no matter what the results next Thursday, the council tax devised by the Tories would still replace poll tax. That does not make its replacement any less likely. Labour has sought to broaden its message to appeal to voters worried about the future of local services under the 'arch-privatisation' ministers now at the Department of the Environment, and to offer local government as a constitutional check on an untrammelled fourth Tory term. The Liberal Democrats have argued the constitutional line and promised to deliver services more efficiently within the current system. Such claims may seem more grandiose than their forecast of the result. Though starting from a base year - 1988 - which marked the nadir of their fortunes, when they lost about 70 seats, the Liberal Democrats talk merely about gaining only 'more than 50'. Similarly, fresh from the election triumph, Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, spoke of perhaps gaining control of a few councils rather than concentrating on the total number of seats gained. This has led Labour to suspect that the Tories may seek to produce the 'Westminster and Wandsworth' effect of 1990, so that highlighting one or two gains allows losses elsewhere across the country to slip into obscurity.</p>

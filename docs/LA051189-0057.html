			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Lacking a two-thirds majority, a ballot measure to raise property taxes to pay  for new schools in the Capistrano Unified School District went down to defeat.  The final, unofficial tally of the vote on Measure A was 10,278 to 9,420, or  52.2% to 47.8%, the Orange County Registrar of Voters said. About 20.5% of the  district's 96,521 registered voters went to the polls. The measure would have  raised property taxes $100 a year on existing single-family homes and $60 a  year on existing condominiums, apartments and mobile homes. School Supt. Jerome  Thornsley blamed the defeat on some voters' beliefs that having inadequate  schools would discourage new housing and that only new home buyers should pay  for new school facilities.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nur Batur under the "Diplomacy Corridor" rubric: </F> "Clinton's Policy on Iraq and Disappointment for Ciller"]    [Text] Turkey has been unable to find a way out of the  impasse in which it found itself after the Gulf war. So, Prime  Minister Tansu Ciller justifiably decided to take up the file on  the embargo on Iraq as soon as she came to power.    Ciller may have made a mistake at first by launching a  campaign to lift the embargo and by revealing that she might  even cooperate with President Yeltsin on the issue. She had to  retract her initiative when she visited Washington. But her  starting point was right. The United States is debating the  embargo on Haiti and Europe seems to have forgotten Saddam  Husayn. Apart from a few UN and U.S. State Department officials  who watch Iraq, everyone else seems to have forgotten the  embargo. But the forgotten embargo has cost Turkey $20 billion  and the figure is rising every day.    Obviously, Ciller was right to discuss the loss Turkey  incurred from the embargo with President Clinton in Washington,  a loss that is gradually having more serious effects on the  economic and social fields in Turkey. Clinton showed  understanding toward Ciller's complaints at first.  <H5>  Disappointment for Ciller </H5>   What happened later? The Turkish and U.S. delegations met to  hold talks. Files were opened and the measures needed to help  Turkey redeem its loss were discussed. The U.S. proposal  emerged at the end of the talks: "The United States should  extend credit to Turkey." Needless to say, that disappointed  Ankara. Clinton hasn't moved to help Ankara reduce the  embargo's heavy burden on Turkey and has even failed to agree to  clearing the oil from the Ceyhan-Iskenderun pipeline, which has  begun to corrode, in return for Iraq's debts to Turkey.  Consequently, Ciller is looking for a new escape route.  <H5>  Can She Persuade Saddam? </H5>   Considering Washington's approach, Ankara has moved to find  a  way to persuade Baghdad. That was why the under secretary of  the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs was recently invited to  visit Turkey for the first time since the Gulf War. Washington  may have been displeased with the invitation but Ankara believes  the visit is very important. The talks that are expected to  take place next week can be viewed as Turkey's move to persuade  Saddam Husayn. Turkey is convinced that the controlled sale of  oil from the Ceyhan-Iskenderun pipeline will be helpful to  Turkey and Iraq.    The UN proposal that Iraq be allowed to sell oil worth $1.6  million to meet its urgent needs is not new. But Saddam Husayn  is opposed to any UN control over the use of the profit Iraq  will make from the sale. The UN officials insist that they  control the way Iraq will use the amount it will have after  Baghdad's debts to Turkey are paid and an amount is allocated to  the war reparation fund.    Saddam Husayn agreeing to the UN proposal without objection  will be an important political and economic development for  Iraq. It may be allowed to sell more of its oil if the Baghdad  administration agrees to the UN formula, regardless of its sales  being subject to control. That will be an important step for  lifting the embargo.    Resuming oil sales will prevent corrosion in the pipeline,  which has cost millions of dollars. Undoubtedly, the sale is  regarded as a way to help Turkey reduce the loss it has suffered  during the past three years. The political implications of  putting that formula into effect are equally important. Baghdad  can have its sovereignty over north Iraq registered.    Naturally, Baghdad's anxiety is justified. It is convinced  that the Kurds may move to sabotage the pipeline when the  pumping of oil is resumed. But the Turkish Government is  prepared to maintain the pipeline's security.  <H5>  Can Ciller Persuade Saddam? </H5>   In short, Turkey is not only trying to redeem the loss it  has  incurred because of the embargo but it is also intensifying its  diplomatic initiatives aimed at obstructing the establishment of  a Kurdish State in north Iraq.    Can Ciller, who has not received Clinton's approval,  persuade  Saddam Husayn?</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Teachers signal support for Labour TEACHERS INTEND to vote overwhelmingly against the Conservatives in the coming general election, according to a Gallup poll published yesterday. The poll, of 507 state-sector teachers in England and Wales conducted earlier this month, shows 48 per cent proposing to vote Labour, 22 per cent Liberal Democrat and 17 per cent Conservative while 10 per cent did not know. Conservative support slumped to 13 per cent in the north of England but even in the south the Tories trailed the Liberal Democrats by four percentage points at 21 per cent. The poll, commissioned by the NASUWT teachers' union, was conducted shortly before the government announced a generous 7.5 per cent teachers pay increase for next year. Most teachers (87 per cent) support the decision to establish a review body. It is unclear whether its findings have helped endear the government to teachers. Voting intentions were broadly similar among primary and secondary teachers. The Conservatives were third-placed even among head teachers. The government slipped further still on the question 'Which party has the best education policies?'. Responses were: Labour 43 per cent, Liberal Democrat 12 per cent, Conservative 8 per cent, none 23 per cent, don't know 13 per cent. The poll reflects a steady decline in teacher support for the Conservatives since 1979, if it is compared with surveys commissioned by the Times Educational Supplement immediately before the last three elections. Of secondary teachers, the proportions intending to vote Tory in the earlier surveys were 45 per cent in 1979, 39 per cent in 1983 and 24 per cent in 1987. The poll also showed firm support for teacher unions. In all, 84 per cent of teachers said unions still had an effective role to play.</p>

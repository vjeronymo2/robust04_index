			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, February 24 (XINHUA) -- Russian President  Boris Yeltsin stressed on Thursday that state management is  necessary for Russia in promoting market reforms.    In a 110-page state of the nation message to the parliament,  the Russian president said: "The creation of a system of  regulations of market economy is not a regress, but movement  ahead, development of the reform, strengthening of the Russian  state."    Market reforms in the country are impeded by excessive  monopolism, according to the president, who warned that  demonopolization is not an easy process and will take  considerable time.    The taxation system is also to be considerably changed. "At  least it should be understandable and stable during a year. The  number of taxes is to be reduced and the rules of their payment  eased," Yeltsin said.    Summing up the results of two years of economic reforms in  the country, the president stressed that the "cost of reforms  was high."    The high cost of reforms which Russians have to afford is  explained by the difficult starting situation in 1991 when the  economy was in a very complicated state, Yeltsin said.    Besides, he continued, the price of the reform also  increased  because of the political stand-off in the country which lasted  for two years.    Mistakes of state authorities in carrying out reforms  comprised yet another reason. He accused the government of not  working for reform, but concentrating on "solving routine  problems."</p>

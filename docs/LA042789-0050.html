			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> AULD DEFIES TIME  </P> <P> Georgie Auld's public appearances in recent years have been about as common as  total eclipses; but unlike eclipses, Auld's performances shed light instead of  reducing it. That, at least, was the impression Tuesday when his radiant tenor  saxophone illuminated the Grand Avenue Bar of the Biltmore.  </P> <P> It took only a few bars of "Just You, Just Me" to provide renewed evidence of a  sound and style that have defied the inroads of time. Now three weeks short of  his 70th birthday, Auld is as buoyantly expressive now as he was on classic  Benny Goodman recordings almost a half-century ago.  </P> <P> His tone is close to that of the memorable Ben Webster; his ballads, "Misty"  and "Body And Soul," exuded a very special warmth.  </P> <P> Pianist Marty Harris, bassist Tony Dumas and drummer Dick Berk offered vigorous  and sympathetic support.

			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Summit maybe affected by strike THE EC summit in Brussels on Friday could face disruption from a one-day strike called by a key section of the country's socialist trade union to protest against the government's austerity measures, writes Andrew Hill. The summit could be affected by expected traffic chaos, other work stoppages and street demonstrations. Last week, the socialist unions walked out of talks on how to revive the economy. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, yesterday unveiled outline measures which the country's centre-left coalition will now try to push through without the support of the socialist trade unionists.</p>

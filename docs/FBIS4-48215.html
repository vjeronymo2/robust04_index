			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique from the Niger Media Workers' Union Executive </F> Council; place and date not given]    [Text] We have learned with dismay and indignation of the  arrest of four fellow members of the Customs Workers' Union  [SNAD], including the union's secretary general, who is also the  financial secretary for the Federation of Labor Unions of Niger.  On behalf of all state media workers, the national executive  council denounces this action, which does not foster a social  climate conducive to the spirit of partnership. It demands the  unconditional release of the SNAD workers and urges the  government to show better judgment in the search for a solution  to workers' problems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with EU Commissioner Karel van Miert by Robert </F> Hochner in Vienna on 27 June -- recorded]    [Text] [Hochner] What is behind the current controversy  within the European Union [EU] over the successor to Commission  President Jacques Delors?    [Van Miert] Behind this controversy over personalities there  are also different concepts. The British are in favor of a --  how should I say -- very flexible Europe, a sort of free-trade  area, and would prefer to do as little as possible as far as  environmental or social issues are concerned. So their concept  is completely different to that of Mr. Kohl or Mr. Mitterrand,  for example. Behind this crisis over electing a new Commission  president is actually also a more profound crisis. I think that  this is why the coming years will be very difficult.    [Hochner] One sign of the crisis -- not of the EU but of the  member countries -- is the horrendous unemployment figures:  Official figures speak of 17 million, while some have said that  the actual figure may be as high as 20 million. If it wants to  be or to remain credible in the eyes of its citizens, does the  EU not have to develop and implement adequate concepts quickly  against unemployment?    [Van Miert] Of course, it has to. This is why the European  Commission with the driving force of Jacques Delors presented  this White Book, which actually creates the framework conditions  for a common policy toward employment policy, stimulating the  economy again, of course, also for environmental policy, and for  better protection of the EU against third countries.  Unfortunately, all this was not dealt with adequately in Corfu.  Therefore, I am most disappointed that all that happened there  was the dispute over who will succeed Delors. The great  problems such as unemployment, the competitive strength of our  economy, etc., were actually only dealt with marginally, which  is a shame.    [Hochner] One of the problems of the future -- you have  mentioned competition -- is to make competitive strength  compatible with the protection of the environment. There are  those who say that environmental protection kills jobs --  industry representatives often hold that view, whereas others  say that environmental protection creates jobs. Is this linkage  appropriate at all, or does one not have to say clearly that  environmental protection is necessary to protect the  environment, and jobs have to be created or saved because we  need jobs.    [Van Miert] I think that a modern economy has to do both,  which is why we need an overall strategy. There can be no doubt  that we must try to achieve enough growth. Yet, this must not  be done in the old way, for we need growth in quality. Of  course, we have to do something to reduce the cost of labor; for  example, if we introduce a new carbon dioxide tax, an energy  tax, then we could use the money to reduce the social costs of  work. So there is a lot to do and, as I said before, all  relevant proposals are already included in the EU's white book.  What we lack are the joint efforts by the member states to  tackle this challenge. The real tragedy is that today we do not  have too much of Europe but too little to tackle these great  challenges in the sphere of growth -- growth in quality --  environmental policy, competitive strength, and employment  policy; efforts are still too much based on national priorities  and sometimes one member state even does something against other  member states. My conclusion is clear, and it is something  against the currently prevailing opinion in Europe: We will  manage to overcome this great challenge only when we cooperate  more and cooperate more efficiently than in the past. This  means that we must also depart from the veto right, from the  principle of unanimous decisions. If we fail to do that, things  will never turn out as they should.</p>

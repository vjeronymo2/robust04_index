			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR MALIBU QUAKE POSSIBLE, EXPERTS SAY  </P> <P> New data indicates that a complex fault system along the Malibu coast is both  active and capable of causing a major earthquake of magnitude 6 or 7, two  geologists who have closely studied the area warned Wednesday.  </P> <P> The warning, backed up by findings from other geologists, may prompt the  California Coastal Commission to ask the state to designate the Malibu coast a  "special study zone" in which development would be tightly regulated because of  the seismic danger.  </P> <P> After hearing the warning, one commissioner urged her colleagues to press for  the designation, and commission Executive Director Peter Douglas said a letter  already is being drafted to send to the state if the commission votes to move  forward with the request.  </P> <P> Former State Geologist James E. Slosson told the commission at a special  workshop in Marina del Rey that recent geologic findings show such a  designation is appropriate for Malibu.  </P> <P> With one exception, the 10 geologists who also appeared before the commission  agreed.  </P> <P> Slosson, who has studied the area for 30 years, said a major quake along the  Malibu coast fault zone -- previously thought to be inactive -- could cause  extensive property damage and threaten lives by triggering "very serious"  landslides and rock falls along Pacific Coast Highway and Malibu Canyon Road.  The rocks along the coastline, he said, are "highly shattered and susceptible  to failure in a major earthquake."  </P> <P> In an interview, Slosson likened the danger to that posed by the  Newport-Inglewood fault, which runs north to south across Los Angeles and  Orange counties and caused the devastating Long Beach earthquake in 1933.  </P> <P> The second geologist, Gary Greene of the U.S. Geological Survey, said that  based on historical data the Malibu coast fault system is probably capable of a  magnitude 6 earthquake and "it could be higher."  </P> <P> An earthquake registering 5.7 and centered off Point Mugu caused more than  $1-million damage in the Oxnard-Ventura area in February, 1973.  </P> <P> Previously, geologists had not focused on the potential magnitude of a temblor  from the Malibu fault because it was thought to be inactive.  </P> <P> But the recent discoveries have lead Greene and others to the conclusion that  "we are dealing with a fairly active seismic zone."  </P> <P> Greene said recent evidence indicates there is more than one fault in the  Malibu area. "My feeling is it is a system of . . . maybe a half-dozen faults."  </P> <P> Geologists have known of the main Malibu fault for many years. But in the last  few years, evidence has been found to indicate that it is active and more  extensive than previously realized. Among the significant recent discoveries  are two splays or splinter faults off the main Malibu fault that have been  active within the last 11,000 years -- the benchmark for what constitutes an  "active" fault in California.  </P> <P> The first discovery of an active splinter fault, in 1987, forced General Motors  Corp. to abandon plans for construction of an $11-million advanced design  center across Pacific Coast Highway from Pepperdine University.  </P> <P> And in recent months, digging at the site of a single-family home in Latigo  Canyon also yielded evidence of an active fault.  </P> <P> Under provisions of the Alquist-Priolo Act, passed by the Legislature after the  1971 Sylmar earthquake, the state geologist is required to designate special  zones along known earthquake faults in California. The law prevents  construction of buildings for human occupancy within 50 feet of an active  fault.  </P> <P> Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, who lives in Malibu, urged her  colleagues to press for such a designation. The matter is expected to be  considered at the commission's meeting next month.  </P> <P> Joe Cobarrubias, geologist for the city of Los Angeles, said he has seen enough  evidence to convince him that a special study zone is needed in Malibu. "The  right thing to do would be to recommend to the state that the area be zoned as  a special study zone," he said.  </P> <P> Newport Beach private geologist Roy Shlemon said the new information "strongly  suggests" that two splays of the Malibu coast fault zone are "probably active."  </P> <P> But geologist Howard Spellman said he does not believe enough evidence has been  collected to justify a special study zone. Instead, he suggested that the  Coastal Commission deal with projects in Malibu on a case-by-case basis. "I  don't think it should be zoned indiscriminately," he said.  </P> <P> In their testimony, the geologists told the commission that the Malibu fault  zone runs parallel to the coastline, onshore in some areas and slightly  offshore in others. Federal geologist Greene described it as a "thrust fault,"  in which one section of the earth's crust is moving vertically relative to the  other. This contrasts with a "strike-slip fault," such as the San Andreas, in  which the two sections move laterally.  </P> <P> Greene said it is possible that the Malibu fault system ties in with the Santa  Cruz Island fault, which runs beneath the ocean off the Santa Barbara County  coast. If so, Greene suggested, the system could be "very significant as far as  a serious hazard."  </P></p>

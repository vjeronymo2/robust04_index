			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "No Comment From Chief of Staff on </F> UN Report"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 31 -- Italy's army chief of staff  Bonifazio Inciso di Camerana refused to comment, Thursday [31  March], on unconfirmed reports from New York that the conduct of  Italian troops in Somalia was criticised in a United Nations  document. "This is a political problem," he said. "This is the  responsibility of governments, they are international  responsibilities.... We soldiers just do our job and carry out  orders given to us by governments."    According to well-informed sources close to UN headquarters  in New York, a top-secret document drawn up last November  criticised the conduct of United States and Italian troops in  the peace-making operation in Somalia, saying that they both  acted on their own initiative, failing to take orders from the  UN command.    The report is also said to demand that the United States pay  reparations for loss of life during a campaign to capture  warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.</p>

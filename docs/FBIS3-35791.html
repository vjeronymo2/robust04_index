In his opinion, this  will not hamper the talks between the interested sides. This is  supposedly being done exclusively for self-defense purposes to  support the 36,000-strong U.S. military contingent and the South  Korean Army.    But, as commentators point out, the Patriots clearly will  not  contribute to the slight progress that had become apparent in  the "Korean nuclear problem."</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Dokpek Meuangphouan: "Public Security Activities </F> in Feuang District"]    [Excerpts] Feuang District of Vientiane Province lies in  the distant mountains. [passage omitted]    Relying on the special characteristics of the district, a  number of bad groups have in the past spread propaganda  slandering the policies and plans of our party and have seduced  and deceived some ignorant members of ethnic minorities into  being their lackeys, whom they used to create disorder in the  localities and cause difficulties for the people in making a  living. Since 1993, in order to bring the peace and stability of  a base area to the entire district, the party committee and  administrative committee of the district as well as its military  headquarters and public security service have worked together  closely both in planning and actual operations. [passage omitted]    Then they mobilized the able-bodied LPRYU members to  volunteer to serve the nation. They mobilized the multi-ethnic  people and various mass organizations such as the LPRYU, the  women's organization, trade unions, and the united fronts in  each village to put their material possessions at the disposal  of the cadres and combatants who were maintaining the peace in  the localities at various points. The guerrilla forces,  self-defense forces, police and district soldiers, in addition  to coordinating closely in inspecting and defending the peace in  their localities, also improved their political and military  skills. [passage omitted] In particular they set up a security  service for each village to be on duty 24 hours a day which  inspected the papers of people entering and leaving and  inspected for gamblers and other dangers to society. When  something bad happened, they quickly coordinated their  activities and reported in a timely fashion.    Because the party committee, administrative committee, and  the district military headquaters always recognized the  importance of public security activities and because the  multi-ethnic people throughout the district were very patriotic  and had a tradition of brave struggle and unwillingness to  submit to the enemy, the unrest in the district has now been  overcome, and we can now say that the entire district has the  peace and stability of a base area.

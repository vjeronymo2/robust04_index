			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Taylor Woodrow achieves Pounds 30m - Improvement results from lack of property and closure provisions Taylor Woodrow, the house-building, property and construction group, bounced back into the black in 1993 with pre-tax profits of Pounds 30.2m against losses of Pounds 94.5m, restated in accordance with FRS 3. The improvement reflected the lack of large property and closure provisions which depressed the restated 1992 figure by Pounds 86.8m. The final dividend is doubled to 1p for a total of 1.5p (1p), payable from earnings per share of 4.1p (22.4p losses). The rise in the dividend was unexpected but the shares were unchanged at 153p. Profits also benefited from the absence of large provisions on prestige contracts such as the Channel tunnel, Euro-Disney and Storebaelt which led to a restated Pounds 61.3m construction loss in 1992. Last year contracting made a Pounds 1.3m pre-tax profit following the settlement of claims on Euro-Disney, Storebaelt and John Wayne airport in the US. Outstanding claims on the Channel tunnel have still to be resolved but were subject to an interim settlement last summer preventing cash losses. Mr Colin Parsons, chairman, said construction turnover had fallen by 19 per cent to Pounds 721m reflecting the group's determination to avoid potentially lossmaking contracts. Housebuilding moved from a Pounds 26.1m loss to a Pounds 9m profit with completed sales in the UK, north America, Australia and continental Europe rising by 31 per cent to 2,769. In the UK housing completions jumped by 60 per cent to 1,087. There was a also a strong performance in Florida, offset by a Dollars 10m write-down of housing land in California. The group announced plans to raise up to CDollars 35m (Pounds 17.8m) to fund expansion at its 58.8 per cent owned Canadian and US housebuilding subsidiary through a public issue of 3m shares. Following the issue Taylor Woodrow's stake will fall to 54.1 per cent. Commercial property moved from a Pounds 14.2m loss to a Pounds 14.5m profit. Some Pounds 69m had been raised from property disposals including Pounds 31m from the US and Australia where the company was withdrawing from the market. COMMENT Management deserves full marks for the way in which it has cut overheads, brought the balance sheet under control and refocused a series of rather poorly run separate companies into a coherent business strategy. The rise in the dividend was a good move psychologically. It was disconcerting, however, that more information was not available on the status of contracting provisions. The shares have had a good run of late and most of the good news is already in the price. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 45m would put the group on a prospective p/e of more than 24 times which is high enough given that contracting may yet cast a shadow over better housebuilding and commercial property results.</p>

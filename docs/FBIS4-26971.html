			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Gao Xin (7559 2946) and He Daxin (0149 1129 </F> 2450)]    [Text] Shenyang, 23 Jun (XINHUA) -- During an inspection  trip to Jilin and Liaoning, Zhu Rongji, member of the CPC  Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and vice  premier of the State Council, stated: We must reform the  distribution system for agricultural means of production, keep  the prices of such materials stable, and consolidate the gains  in reforming the grain purchase and marketing system to maintain  peasants' enthusiasm for growing grain.    From 14 to 21 June, Zhu Rongji and officials in charge of  relevant State Council departments traveling with him heard  briefings on the economic work of Jilin and Liaoning Provinces.  Accompanied by He Zhukang, secretary of the Jilin Provincial CPC  Committee; Jilin Governor Gao Yan; Gu Jinchi, secretary of the  Liaoning Provincial CPC Committee; and acting Liaoning Governor  Wen Shizhen, they visited markets for farm produce, granaries,  and grain production households; held forums on reforming the  distribution system for agricultural means of production;  inspected factories; and held informal discussions with the  leaders of some state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises.    Zhu Rongji fully affirmed the achievements of Jilin and  Liaoning Provinces in economic work. He said: Under the  leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin  as the core, and thanks to careful arrangements by the  provincial party committees and governments, the economic  situation in both provinces is favorable as several key reforms  are functioning normally, agricultural production has generated  notable results, bumper grain harvests are within reach, diverse  operations and village and town enterprises are developing  rapidly, industrial production is increasing steadily, and  markets are replete with commodities. The situation will get  even better if people work hard together.    Zhu Rongji noted: Reform of the grain purchase and marketing  system has proceeded smoothly in the two provinces where grain  market prices are basically stable, peasants are quite satisfied  and are even more enthusiastic about growing grain, and urban  residents are understanding and supportive. The situation in  the two provinces fully attests to the fact that the policy  decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council are  correct. Grain prices are at the core of the party's rural  policy, as well as an important economic lever with which to  inspire peasants' enthusiasm. Now that peasants' enthusiasm has  been kindled, we must keep the prices of fertilizer and other  agricultural means of production stable, and make every effort  to bring those prices down, so that peasants will genuinely gain  tangible benefits. This will boost agricultural development to  a new high. After we have developed agricultural production,  increased peasants' incomes, and expanded purchasing power in  rural areas, industrial goods will find wide demand and the  national economy will develop on a solid basis. Therefore, we  should not underestimate the profound and far-reaching effects  of the current reform of the grain purchase and marketing  system, as well as the current price reform.    The main purpose of Zhu Rongji's recent inspection,  investigative, and fact-finding trip was to find a way to reform  the distribution system for agricultural means of production and  to bring under effective control price increases for chemical  fertilizer and other agricultural means of production. During  his visits with peasant families and informal discussions with  cadres at all levels and peasants, he stated: Chemical  fertilizer prices have risen sharply since the beginning of this  year because of the acute imbalance between supply and demand,  price increases for raw and semifinished materials, and the  untimely supply of chemical fertilizer. The main reasons,  however, are the existence of many intermediate links in the  distribution chain, market disorder, the race among some  production enterprises and operating units for higher prices to  seek profits in violation of state provisions, and poor  supervision and management by competent departments. He noted:  To keep chemical fertilizer prices stable and consolidate gains  in reforming the grain purchase and marketing system, we should,  first of all, balance total supply and demand. At present, we  should go all-out to produce quality chemical fertilizer,  improve product quality, ensure the delivery and distribution of  imported chemical fertilizer, and increase supplies to meet  peasants' demand. Second, we should reform the distribution  system for agricultural means of production. The state should  control the supply of most agricultural means of production,  allow supply and marketing cooperatives to serve as the main  channel through which such materials are distributed, strictly  enforce government-set prices, and ensure supplies in rural  areas. Departments engaged in the supply and management of  agricultural means of production should reduce intermediate  links in the distribution chain, streamline their organizations  and personnel, improve management and administration, and reduce  circulating costs. We should unify the basic prices of and  operating charges for chemical fertilizer and other major  agricultural means of production, and permit seasonal price  differentials caused by regional and seasonal factors. Third,  we should earnestly improve market administration and restore  order in the distribution field. All units must operate  strictly in accordance with state provisions; those who disrupt  the market, drive up prices, and seek staggering profits in  violation of relevant provisions must be investigated and dealt  with resolutely. The State Council will further study the issue  of reforming the distribution system for agricultural means of  production, and intensify efforts to draw up documents to be  relayed to subordinate units for implementation.    Zhu Rongji added: There are signs of opportunistic price  increases for meats, poultry, eggs, and vegetable oil in a few  areas, and they merit attention. Corn market prices have not  risen, nor have feed prices. The price increases for meats,  poultry, and eggs are not compatible with the laws of the  market, because these goods are in ample supply. State-run  commercial departments should organize supplies, sell off  stockpiles, and roll back prices. Meanwhile, industrial,  commercial, and commodity price departments should send  inspection teams to the grass roots to stop indiscriminate price  increases. This is also an important means of consolidating the  gains in reforming the grain purchase and marketing system.    Speaking of the troubles currently plaguing some state-owned  enterprises, Zhu Rongji said: On the whole, state-owned  enterprises are taking a turn for the better. To overcome the  troubles currently plaguing some enterprises, we must correctly  analyze the causes of the troubles and develop clear ideas for  running state- owned enterprises effectively. First, we should  persistently separate government and enterprise functions so  that the government will help enterprises strengthen leadership  bodies, create a good macroeconomic environment for enterprises,  and oversee the way enterprises implement state principles and  policies. Second, enterprises should change their operating  mechanisms, improve their "internal functions," readjust product  mix in accordance with market demand, and improve product  quality and their own reputation. Third, we should stress  investment returns, upgrade enterprises technologically, and  avoid launching new projects recklessly.    Accompanying Zhu Rongji during his inspection trip were Yao  Zhenyan, Xu Youfang, Sheng Huaren, Luo Zhiling, Yang Changji,  Hong Hu, Xiang Huicheng, and Chen Yuan, who are comrades in  charge of relevant State Council departments.</p>

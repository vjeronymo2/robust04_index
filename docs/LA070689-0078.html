			<p><P> July 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> GOP SEEN AS HAVING MOST TO LOSE IN ABORTION 'WAR'  </P> <P> The coming legislative war over abortion poses deep risks for both political  parties but could be particularly costly to Republicans, according to  politicians and political analysts.  </P> <P> For Democrats, who generally have staked out an abortion rights stance, an  increased focus on abortion could accelerate the flight of ethnic Catholics and  conservative rural voters to the Republicans. That could further weaken the  party in strongly anti-abortion states such as Pennsylvania, Missouri and many  in the South.  </P> <P> However, the GOP, which has benefited from the abortion issue in the past, now  may have more to lose.  </P> <P> Republicans "were always better off promising the sizzle and not delivering the  steak" on the abortion issue, said Republican analyst Kevin Phillips. By  promising to change the law on abortion, the GOP attracted anti-abortion  voters.  </P> <P> But delivering on that promise could drive a wedge into the coalition forged in  1980 by Ronald Reagan, according to Phillips and William Schneider, a political  analyst for The Times. The abortion issue could divide upscale, well-educated  suburban voters who generally favor abortion rights from less well-off,  less-educated, religiously motivated anti-abortion voters, they said.  </P> <P> At the extreme, these analysts suggested, a national fight over abortion could  split Republicans in much the same way that struggles over civil rights split  the Democratic Party.  </P> <P> The outlines of the debate may soon begin to become apparent.  </P> <P> On Wednesday, the first working day after the Supreme Court gave states new  power to restrict abortions, Florida Gov. Bob Martinez called a special session  of the Legislature. He wants to convene the session by the end of September and  is meeting with legislative leaders to choose a date.  </P> <P> </P> <P> First of Many Struggles  </P> <P> And Florida's battle, pitting a determinedly anti-abortion Republican governor  against Democratic state legislative leaders who favor abortion rights, almost  certainly will be only the first of many such confrontations.  </P> <P> For both parties, the difficulty is that abortion cuts across traditional  coalitions but leaves very little room for compromise.  </P> <P> To date, both parties have staked out strong positions on the issue on the  national level -- the Democrats pro- and the Republicans anti-abortion -- even  though both parties have large groups of dissenters. For the dissenters, the  issue has long been uncomfortable; but so long as the courts kept control of  the issue, that discomfort was manageable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unendurable Discomfort  </P> <P> Now, the chief political questions are likely to be how quickly that discomfort  becomes unendurable and which side's dissenters fall away first.  </P> <P> The worry for Republicans is that most of the Democrats likely to switch  allegiances because of abortion may already have done so but the bulk of GOP  desertions may be yet to come.  </P> <P> Many Republicans accepted the party position on abortion even though they  didn't agree with it "for the simple reason that they felt the Supreme Court  would never let" that position be implemented, said GOP strategist Peter  Teeley, a leading campaign adviser to President Bush during the 1988 election.  "So they could focus on other issues. I'm not sure that applies any more."  </P> <P> That could pose problems for GOP moderates such as Illinois Gov. James R.  Thompson, who repeatedly has vetoed anti-abortion legislation. Thompson argued  that the bills clashed with the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision,  which made abortion legal, but he has refused to take a public stand on  abortion itself.  </P> <P> Now, as the governor weighs whether to seek an unprecedented fifth term, the  Supreme Court has taken that political cover away from him. Wednesday, with  riot police standing by, both sides rallied hundreds of demonstrators outside  the state office complex in Chicago, calling on Thompson to take a stand.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hopes for Compromise  </P> <P> The only stand he has taken so far is a statement Monday cautioning lawmakers  not to move hastily and saying that he hopes for a compromise that would  "balance liberties."  </P> <P> But "balance" may be a hard position to sell to voters. "There's very little  middle ground" on the abortion issue, GOP strategist John Buckley said.  </P> <P> Similar difficulties could befall abortion rights Republicans in California,  Democratic strategists hope. Sen. Pete Wilson, a candidate for governor, has  succeeded so far in bridging the gap over abortion by persuading anti-abortion  conservatives to support him on other issues. The more important abortion  becomes as a voting issue, however, the more difficult that maneuver will  become, said Democratic consultant Kam Kuwata.  </P> <P> Anti-abortionists in California are in the odd situation of providing great  sums of money to finance activist crusades across the nation while they lack a  strong, identifiable political leader of their own.  </P> <P> Once Republican Gov. George Deukmejian retires, anti-abortion activists looking  for champions will be left with a grab bag of legislators who are unlikely  allies -- such as Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Los Angeles, a  liberal Democrat, and Sen. John Doolittle of Rocklin, a conservative  Republican. In this case, Roberti is likely to be kept on a tight leash by  other Democrats who strongly disagree with his Catholic religious view of  abortion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Anti-Abortion Democrats  </P> <P> As for anti-abortion Democrats across the country, the party's national  position "is something we always have to make apologies for," said Rep. Gerard  A. Kosinski, an anti-abortion legislator in Pennsylvania, one of the most  strongly anti-abortion states.  </P> <P> Democratic legislators such as Kosinski have had many years to practice those  apologies, but anti-abortion leaders now hope to raise the pressure. "If the  Democrats are going to succeed, they are going to have to make room for the  pro-lifers," said Brian Young of the American Life League.  </P> <P> In New York, Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, saying the U.S. Supreme Court  follows a "lower standard," Wednesday promised his continued support for  Medicaid funding in New York to pay for poor women's abortions. Cuomo, a Roman  Catholic, said that nothing in the court's Monday decision "changes my opinion  about the right to abortion or the right of poor people to receive funding."  </P> <P> The unknown variable in the abortion dispute is how rapidly each side will  organize. So far, all agree, the anti-abortion side is far ahead. But the  court's decision has provided the other side something to rally around, and  abortion rights forces "are rabid, they are not going to be taken to the  cleaners again," said Iowa Democratic leader Bonnie Campbell.  </P> <P> The fight over abortion will hit American politics at a critical point. Both  Democrats and Republicans have been planning to pour thousands of hours and  millions of dollars into state-level elections this year and in 1990 as each  party seeks to control the state legislatures, which will draw legislative and  congressional district lines after the 1990 census.  </P> <P> With the high court's decision, many of those state elections are likely to  turn into referendums on abortion. With the combination of an intensely  partisan election and a heated debate over the premier emotional issue of the  day, Campbell said, "it's going to be a long, hot election cycle."  </P> <P> Staff writers John Balzar in Los Angeles and Bob Secter in Chicago contributed  to this story.  </P></p>

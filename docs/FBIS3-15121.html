The date and procedure for the  elections are to be determined by a round-table conference of  all parties and political movements of the country, according to  the party's central committee coordinating secretary, Sergey  Skvortsov. He published this statement in Moscow today on the  eve of an expanded government meeting to discuss ways out of the  economic crisis scheduled for March 4.    According to Skvortsov, the way out of the crisis "lies in  the total rejection of the so-called course of reforms rather  than its adjustment proposed by the Duma opposition. It is  evident that a bankrupt president does not want this and cannot  do this, just as the stillborn Duma does not want this and  cannot give up the course either."    In Skvortsov's opinion, Russian President Boris Yeltsin "in  his address 'On the state of the nation' virtually recognized  the total bankruptcy of his policy and recognized the existing  practice of unilateral concessions to the West as unbefitting."    However, "Yeltsin made these statements by no means to  ground  his resignation." Vice versa, "having lost a considerable part  of his social base, the president is trying not to let power out  of his hands by looking for support in the present Duma  opposition," according to the coordinating secretary.    To avoid social upheavals, it is necessary to bring about  changes to the current situation in the country and find  politicians who would really stand up for the people's  interests, the renovated Communist Party leader believes.</p>

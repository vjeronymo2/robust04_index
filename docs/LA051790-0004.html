			<p><P> May 17, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FATHER SAYS SON ENJOYED TAKING RISKS;  </P> <P> THOUSAND OAKS: THE 14-YEAR-OLD DIED AFTER DRINKING TWO TO THREE INCHES OF  WHISKEY IN A JUG, ALLEGEDLY ON A DARE.  </P> <P> The father of a Thousand Oaks boy who died of alcohol poisoning last month  after two older chaperons allegedly dared him to chug whiskey described his  14-year-old son Wednesday as a boy inclined to take on dangerous challenges.  </P> <P> Leland (Lee) Scovis was a boy who dreamed of adventure stories, his father  said. And he had hopes of someday becoming a professional writer.  </P> <P> "He was a really good kid. He had a lot of spirit," said Art Scovis, dabbing at  tears as he spoke of his adopted son. "Yes, he would have taken a challenge.  </P> <P> "Lee was right in this case: He could drink the rest of that liquor," Scovis  added. "He just didn't realize what it would do to him."  </P> <P> On April 14, Leland went on a camping trip at Leo Carrillo State Beach with  four other teen-age boys. Two of the chaperons -- construction workers David  Campbell, 29, and his brother Patrick Campbell, 23 -- allegedly bet Leland that  he could not drink the two to three inches of alcohol left in a gallon jug of  whiskey without getting sick.  </P> <P> Leland drank the whiskey quickly and collapsed about 15 minutes later,  according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Two hours later,  after Leland had developed breathing problems, one of the Campbell brothers  began attempts at cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  </P> <P> Leland was taken by helicopter to Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village  on the morning of April 15. At 3 a.m., Art Scovis got the call that his son was  in cardiac arrest. For the next two days, before the boy died, the anxious  family waited and hoped that he would regain consciousness and recover.  </P> <P> Scovis said he brought a tape player into the intensive care unit at the  hospital, hoping that the heavy metal music his son loved would awake him.  </P> <P> "You have hope, and we talked to him hoping to bring him to," Scovis said. "And  all that time his brain was dead."  </P> <P> Two of the boys on the camping trip had been Leland's best friends for the past  five years, Scovis said. A third chaperon, Priscilla Vernon, 21, of Newbury  Park, had been known to the Scovis family for about seven years. She is the  sister of one of Leland's friends and is engaged to David Campbell.  </P> <P> "These were old friends," Scovis said. "What sort of crazy adult gets a kick  out of getting a kid drunk?"  </P> <P> On Monday, the Campbells were each charged with one count of involuntary  manslaughter, four counts of furnishing alcohol to a minor and four counts of  contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Vernon was charged with being an  accessory to involuntary manslaughter and one count of contributing to the  delinquency of a minor.  </P> <P> The Campbells surrendered to Los Angeles County deputies on Tuesday and were  released Wednesday on bail. Vernon, who also turned herself in, was cited and  released.  </P> <P> The three defendants are scheduled to be arraigned June 13, said Los Angeles  County Deputy Dist. Atty. Scott Gordon.  </P> <P> Leland was born in Korea and adopted by Scovis and his wife, Jenny, when he was  2 years old. He has two older sisters.  </P> <P> As he discussed his son on Wednesday, Scovis said he has heard that Leland --  who was 5 feet, 8 inches tall and weighed 155 pounds -- was the kind of boy who  would protect classmates from school bullies.  </P> <P> Leland was a freshman at Thousand Oaks High School. Classmates there described  him Wednesday as a loner at times. His father said the boy indulged in  fantasies, enjoyed playing Dungeons and Dragons and sometimes lost himself in  adventure stories.  </P> <P> The boy's room was testimony to a thirst for swashbuckling adventure. On the  walls hung his father's old fencing sword, a sword from the Philippines and an  18th-Century English cutlass -- a gift from his parents.  </P> <P> Just last fall, a fantasy story that Leland had written about a young hero  rescuing people with the aid of his sword was accepted for publication in Young  People Today magazine.  </P> <P> Leland, tremendously excited by his first publication, never cashed the $5  check he was paid for the story.  </P> <P> Scovis said that after Leland's death, he found a notebook of stories Leland  had started and stopped.  </P> <P> "He showed a lot of talent," Scovis said. "He wasn't a great student. He wasn't  a great athlete. He was a good person."  </P></p>

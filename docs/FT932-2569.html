			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Egypt to seek IMF deal to ease debt SENIOR Egyptian economic policy makers will go to Washington early next week to try to reach an accord with the International Monetary Fund which would trigger forgiveness of around Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) in Paris Club debts. Mr Atef Sidiki, the prime minister, said after a gathering of Egypt's top economic aides on Wednesday that talks towards the agreement, which have been under way since April, were 'advancing with rapid steps'. He said differences between the government and the IMF and World Bank were 'limited to small areas'. But western economists say neither the IMF nor World Bank is entirely happy with Egypt's speed or energy in implementing reforms designed to steer the economy towards a free market. An official familiar with the talks put the chances of reaching an agreement during next week's discussions at '40:60 against'. The IMF executive board endorsed Egypt's first agreement with the agency in March, after several months' delay. Under this accord Egypt trimmed its budget deficit, cut inflation, stabilised its currency and bolstered reserves while making a start on structural reforms. Next week's trip by Egyptian officials follows IMF visits to Cairo in April and May which made 'some progress', according to officials, but left a series of outstanding differences. Western economists say agreement has to be found on a figure for Egypt's budget deficit - government officials have said the IMF is seeking a cut from 3.5 per cent of GDP under the present agreement to 2 per cent - the pace and breadth of proposed income tax reforms and the IMF's call tariff cuts. The World Bank, meanwhile, wants Egypt to accelerate a privatisation programme now running well behind schedule. The government in February bowed to heavy IMF and World Bank pressure by listing 16 assets and companies for immediate sale, but no deal has been finalised. 'The big question is if the government is unable to sell them, or doesn't want to sell them,' said a western economist. World Bank approval of Egypt's structural reform efforts is an informal precondition for final IMF agreement to a new accord. Cairo's need for an accord lies not in any attendant standby loan, since Egypt is sitting on record reserves of Dollars 14.3bn, but rather in the triggering of further debt relief. Egypt's Paris Club donors agreed in 1991 to forgive 15 per cent of its then outstanding Dollars 20bn debt and write off a further 15 per cent on reaching a first IMF accord - which was achieved in March.</p>

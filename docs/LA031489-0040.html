			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CURRENCY;  </P> <P> DOLLAR EDGES HIGHER AS DEALERS AWAIT 3 KEY ECONOMIC REPORTS  </P> <P> The dollar drifted higher Monday against most key currencies in quiet worldwide  trading as dealers awaited the release of key economic data.  </P> <P> Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late  bid of $393 an ounce, down 50 cents from Friday's late bid.  </P> <P> Daniel Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp., said internal market  influences were largely responsible for the dollar's advance but that most  dealers were keeping a low profile until economic reports from the United  States, Britain and Japan were released today.  </P> <P> "The market is a little cautious," he said.  </P> <P> British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson will present the spring  federal budget to Parliament, the U.S. Commerce Department reports the  fourth-quarter current account trade balance and Japan releases its latest  report on wholesale prices.  </P> <P> Dealers said sentiment toward the dollar remained fairly bullish, although  worries of possible central bank intervention kept trading in a fairly narrow  range.  </P> <P> In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins, the dollar  rose 0.69 Japanese yen to 129.57 yen. It was quoted at 129.86 yen in London,  and later in New York it stood at 130.175 yen, up from 129.40 on Friday.  </P> <P> The dollar gained against the British pound.

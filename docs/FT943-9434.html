			<p>940811 FT  11 AUG 94 / Cereal story with a wholesome ending: UK farmers have not gone organic, but are profiting from going green An unusual phenomenon has occurred across the UK's farmland this summer  - a scattering of poppies has appeared amid the regimented rows of golden wheat. The poppies would normally be wiped out by liberal doses of herbicide, but this year they are evidence of a trend by European farmers towards curtailing the use of chemicals. 'There's a growing mood that we don't mind seeing the odd weed or two amid our cereals - a few years ago that would be a matter of shame,' one producer commented. The change has been brought about partly by public demands for farmers to be more environmentally sensitive and reduce their use of pesticides, herbicides and artificial fertilisers. The trend has been strengthened by the pressure on farmers to cut costs, as European Union subsidies are reduced under reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. As well as cutting subsidies, the CAP reforms are designed to give financial incentives to farmers who adopt measures to safeguard the environment. Already some payments under the CAP depend on farmers taking action such as limiting grazing in environmentally fragile areas. While only 5 per cent of CAP payouts currently depend on meeting environmental standards, a further 'greening' of EU agriculture policy seems likely. Mr Rene Steichen, farm commissioner, is among those wanting change: 'Environmentally compatible production methods should be introduced as quickly as possible into general practice,' he said recently. In the UK, some large producers and environmentalists have joined forces to lobby for changes to the CAP, to bring it more into line with environmentally friendly methods of farming. The Gay Hussar group, named after the London restaurant where it first met, was officially launched last month at the Royal Show, organised by the Royal Agricultural Society of England, in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. Many farmers in the group advocate a concept called 'sustainable farming', which encourages producers to cut their use of agrochemicals - but not eliminate their use completely as in 'organic' production. Mrs Gillian Shephard, before she moved from agriculture minister to education secretary last month, was keen to encourage sustainable methods - a system under which, she said, 'crops must be profitable, meet the needs of consumers and the environment and conserve the soil'. Under such a system, farmers cut their use of weedkillers, artificial fertilisers and pesticides and, as a consequence, suffer a small drop in production. But they remain profitable because, by using fewer chemicals, they can reduce costs. A research project, partly sponsored by the EU, at the Long Ashton Research Centre in Bristol is currently investigating how much farmers can cut chemical use and still remain profitable. It estimates that, if the use of chemicals was reduced such that crop yields fell by 8 per cent, costs would fall by 32 per cent - meaning the holding would remain profitable. Mr Mike Calvert is one of the pioneers of the sustainable approach. As general manager of CWS Agriculture - an arm of the Co-operative Wholesale Society - he is one of Britain's biggest farmers with a total of 45,000 acres under his care. Keen to address the concerns raised by environmentalists, Mr Calvert initially tested organic farming methods. Five years ago he converted 300 acres of his 5,200-acre holding in Leicestershire, but soon found it was not profitable. While conventional farming methods have given him an average profit of Pounds 150 an acre at the Leicestershire farm over the past three years, the organic part has made losses - last year it lost Pounds 9,000. Mr Calvert said his organic holding needed a large investment of costly labour to control weeds. He reckoned that in organic farming the overheads per unit of production were double those of conventional methods because so much manpower was used and crop yields were lower. This year, Mr Calvert is testing sustainable farming on 130 acres of his land. He described it as 'integrated farm management'. Instead of using labour-intensive organic methods, he is devoting the man-hours to drawing up plans for using chemicals and artificial fertilisers more efficiently. Instead of spraying chemicals on all crops, he and his team spend up to six hours a day inspecting wheat fields for patches of disease or poor fertility to target later. Mr Alastair Leake, who manages the test area, said: 'You're looking at specific problems and treating them, rather than blanket spraying as in normal farming. We're abandoning the blunderbuss and picking up a rifle.' Sustainable farming also offers a chance to break a vicious circle in conventional farming, whereby producers often need to step up their use of chemicals to deal with problems created by an earlier application of other chemicals. For example, said Mr Leake, wheat that has had its growth enhanced by chemical fertilisers is susceptible to a problem called 'lodging' - when the straw is battered flat by the rain. If this happens, the crop does not mature and is hard to harvest. To avoid this, farmers apply a growth regulator which causes the wheat to grow shorter, so making it less vulnerable to lodging. Mr Leake's solution is to be more careful in the initial use of fertilisers so that the wheat does not grow so high and thus requires less growth regulator. It is the sort of common sense which was often lacking in British agriculture in the 1980s, when the use of chemicals peaked as farmers sought to maximise food production. Now the conventional wisdom has changed - to such an extent that the large agrochemical producers and their trade organisation, the British Agro-Chemicals Association, have co-sponsored with supermarket groups a pressure group, Linking Environment and Farming (Leaf), which campaigns for sustainable methods. The chemical companies appear to have decided that it is better to promote the use of chemicals at a lower level, rather than risk organic farming becoming widespread. By promoting sustainable farming, chemical producers may also be able to head off the threat that CAP reforms will lead to severe restrictions on the use of their products. Leaf, which has set up a number of demonstration farms, has attracted 100 members and affiliated organisations - of which CWS is one - in the UK and more on the Continent, including 800 in Germany. It encourages farmers to carry out environmental audits based on a questionnaire it has compiled. Leaf reports strong interest in its audit system: it has sold 1,000 copies of the questionnaire at Pounds 20 each. But that represents less than 1 per cent of the UK's 250,000 farmers. It is a hard message to sell to the majority of producers, who are being encouraged to farm in a totally different way than they were 10 years ago. Mr Fraser Hart, an arable and pig farmer in Gloucestershire who has adopted sustainable methods, said the transition was not easy. 'It's more difficult to farm this way, and what do you do when you're faced with a major epidemic of pest?' For example, the orange blossom midge threatened to cut wheat yields by 30 per cent this summer. 'That's bankruptcy for some farmers and I'm afraid we chickened out. We didn't want to spray, but we did it to save our crops,' he explained. At the same time, farmers trying to stick to environmental guidelines can still be their own worst enemies, Mr Calvert said. 'You have to change your perception of what is pretty. Pretty to a conventional farmer is wheat which is dark green and lush in straight rows, whereas to the public it may look much better with poppies in it. Farmers may have to lose their obsession with neatness and tidiness. We were the scruffiest place in Leicestershire for a time.'</p>

Kamer was  particularly interested in the possibility of the present  composition of parliament resolving the issue of Ukraine's  accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Valentyn  Lemish noted the advisability of submitting this issue to the  Supreme Council for examination in March of this year. The  commission chairman also emphasized that it was desirable that  the United States and Russia take practical steps now in reply  to the Supreme Council resolution withdrawing the reservations  to Article 5 of the protocol to the START Treaty.</p>

			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Lone Star state of mind: All eyes are on Texas as election day nears The coffee mug in Bill Hobby's office reads: 'Life's too short not to live it as a Texan.' Election day is now a short 4 1/2 weeks away and the country is destined to live it with Texans on its mind. George Bush, by adoption, and Ross Perot, by birth, claim the Lone Star state as home. The man who is likely to get the fourth highest number of votes for the presidency, Andre Marrou, the Libertarian party candidate, was born in south Texas. The invisible man, James Baker, who whispers into the president's ear, is a Houston blue blood. Even the fifth man and still favourite for the White House, Bill Clinton, was born just across its border. Texas could be excused, therefore, for thinking itself the centre of the universe this year. Bill Hobby, its lieutenant governor for 14 years until 1990, will argue that the state is 'a kind of microcosm of the nation'. Politically, the hypothesis holds water. Since the second world war, no Democratic or Republican has become president without carrying Texas. Until Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, went down to defeat four years ago, a Texan on the national ticket was a guarantee of success. This political year began with the widespread assumption that nothing could prise Texas, the third most populous state in the nation, from the grip of its adopted native son, George Bush. Severely depressed four years ago, its economy, while not back to the glory days, looks better now. Its political class, a strong progressive strain notwithstanding, seemed more conservative. And there is no state where the appetite for 'down and dirty' politics remains so keen. Yet the president, with or without Ross Perot, is in trouble in Texas. He might still win it, though the polls now have him fractionally behind. But, the argument runs, if he cannot comfortably carry Texas, then all his previous electoral base south of the Mason-Dixon line and west of the Mississippi looks very fragile. There are general and particular reasons for this frailty. Dave McNeely, political columnist on the Austin Statesman-American, simply says that Mr Bush 'has lost touch' with the concerns of ordinary people, here and elsewhere. Bill Hobby says Mr Bush has 'no particular claim on Texans, but then nor does anybody else'. Mr Clinton does not attract enormous empathy either, but, as Jim Hightower, the former state agricultural commissioner, puts it, 'you don't have to be in love to dance'. The Texas contrast with 1988 is especially marked. Then a well-financed Republican organisation, backed by an incumbent Republican governor in Austin, the state capital, had Mr Michael Dukakis firmly in its sights by midsummer. It had plenty of outside help, too. The National Rifle Association had been blanketing east Texas for weeks with posters and bumper stickers claiming that Mr Dukakis would take away the guns, AK-47s and tactical nuclear weapons that many east Texans use to transfer whatever flies or swims to the dinner table or trophy room. Now, state patronage is in the hands of Ann Richards, the hard-nosed and still popular Democratic governor and a featured speaker at both of the last two Democratic conventions. Mrs Richards is not, according to those who know her well, over-enamoured with Mr Clinton. But she pulls weight and, according to Mr Hobby, 'at least Texans can pronounce Clinton's name'. Texas has liberal voting and voter registration laws. Even the casual observer is more aware of public attempts to get people registered here than in any other state. According to Robert Stein, the Rice University pollster, the Democratic effort is proving particularly effective among Hispanics in Harris County, Houston, threatening to eat into Republican dominance of the area. Equally, the Republican campaign is not firing on all cylinders. There has been internal dissension over who runs what, delays in setting up phone banks; and money is said to be in short supply, to the point that the Clinton headquarters, initially reticent about pouring funds into a Texas dry well, is sending down more financial lubricant. But then along comes Ross Perot again. It is hard to find a public Texan, Democrat or Republican, who has a kind word to say about him. But observers such as Robert Stein concede Mr Perot has a state base in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where he has been a large employer and which has a large concentration of military and retired people, who seem to like him. Tactically, both national campaigns have been recently hewing to the good advice Governor Richards offered Mr Clinton some weeks ago about how best to deal with Mr Perot - 'just don't get him mad'. This resulted in the dispatch of delegations to his Dallas court on Monday, which the Republicans hoped might cause Mr Perot to forget certain earlier denunciations, of which 'autocratic tycoon' and 'lunatic' were among the more polite. The trouble is that Mr Perot is indeed plenty mad, as his statement on Thursday demonstrated, and his temper will be made no sunnier by the fresh torrent of accusations about his singular ways. The worst of these concern his portrayal of his movement as 'bottoms up', whereas evidence grows that it has been controlled tightly by the little man himself, including to the extent of investigating his own 'volunteers' suspected of insufficient loyalty or other trangressions. On Thursday he put up the shutters and said he would answer no questions on subjects unrelated to the real concerns of Americans, the definition of which rests exclusively with himself and his volunteers. Curiously, it is a defence that might work in the limited time before election day. But the heavy odds are that Mr Perot cannot defy gravity and he knows it, too. The alternative explanation, therefore, is that he is a calculating businessman who is playing the political game for a profit, which can only be derived from the perception that he helped somebody else win. So deep is his presumed loathing of Mr Bush that all logic suggests he wants something from Mr Clinton. Giving Mr Perot the benefit of the doubt that he believes what he says, that means a commitment to budget cutting with a vengeance. But that depends on him getting enough votes to make a difference. Ten per cent in Texas - the ballpark estimate of the best he will do there  - may tip the balance to either candidate. But if Mr Clinton, or even, much more improbably, Mr Bush, feels that Texas is not necessary to win the White House, then Mr Perot's leverage remains hypothetical. But, as a gamble, it is something that Texans, accustomed to drilling holes in the ground, understand. To turn around Bill Hobby's coffee mug, 'some Texans are too short not to make life interesting'.</p>

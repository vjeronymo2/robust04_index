			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Failure on IMF deal puts Kenya's reform at risk BOLD STEPS by the Kenyan government to liberalise its economy were in jeopardy at the weekend after International Monetary Fund officials left the country without agreeing a provisional deal that would pave the way to the restoration of foreign aid. The IMF departure came at the end of three weeks marked by the most radical reform of the economy ever carried out by the embattled government of President Daniel arap Moi. A positive verdict from the IMF was seen as crucial for Kenya to regain desperately needed quick-disbursing foreign aid worth about Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) a month which was suspended in September 1991 because of the government's long record of unfulfilled promises, mismanagement and corruption. The government has said that without the urgent resumption of aid the reforms, including foreign exchange liberalisation, reduction of price controls and resumption of measures to free the farm sector, will be unsustainable. However both donors and the IMF, who welcomed the measures, have warned further steps would have to be taken urgently to curb monetary liquidity and avoid the mounting risk of massive currency depreciation, hyper-inflation and possible social unrest among the urban poor. The government has said that donors are asking them to plunge into uncertainty without promising an injection of foreign exchange to sustain the reforms. On the eve of the IMF visit three weeks ago the government removed exchange controls, leaving the exchange rate to be set for commercial transactions by the banking sector. The central bank said it would still operate a foreign exchange window at a lower official rate for government imports, official debt service and publicly guaranteed debts. The government also announced the complete liberalisation of the wheat trade from the producer to the consumer and a relaxation of price controls on other commodities. 'More has been achieved in the past three weeks than in the previous three years,' said one western donor. Since the liberalisation the shilling has depreciated more than 50 per cent against sterling. Money supply growth exceeded 35 per cent last year, mostly in the last six months, as a result of corrupt commodity and foreign exchange trading activities and the injection of money for election campaign finance. Inflation in the past four months is estimated at 40 to 60 per cent.</p>

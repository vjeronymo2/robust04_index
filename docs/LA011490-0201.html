			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1,000 MAKE AN IMPASSIONED PLEA FOR SOS;  </P> <P> CHARITY: THE PLIGHT OF SHARE OUR SELVES BROUGHT OUT PEOPLE NOT NORMALLY  INVOVLED IN SOCIAL ISSUES. ABOUT 40 FOES OF THE ASSISTANCE CENTER ALSO GATHERED  NEAR THE REA COMMUNITY CENTER.  </P> <P> Bill and Jane O'Shields-Hayner say they're not the type of people to jump on  every social bandwagon that passes their way.  </P> <P> But when their two young daughters learned that the Share Our Selves charity  was being forced out of its lease, and insisted that the family make an effort  to keep the organization operating, the Fullerton couple agreed to attend the  Saturday rally to show their support for SOS.  </P> <P> "I just thought it was important -- we shouldn't ignore it," said 11-year-old  Rebekah. "I don't know how someone could think with such a cruel mind, that  they don't want to look at these people."  </P> <P> The family joined almost 1,000 others Saturday under gray skies on the soggy  park grass near the Rea Community Center to show solidarity for the 20-year-old  agency, which offers food, clothing and assistance to those in need.  </P> <P> Last July, amid growing discontent about SOS among its neighbors, the City  Council voted to cancel the charity's lease at the city-managed center, and  gave SOS six months to vacate.  </P> <P> Since then, SOS has raised $300,000 in donations to relocate, and has appealed  to the council to extend its lease a few months, rather than force it to move  to a temporary location, and then move again to its permanent site. The council  denied that request two weeks ago, but on Monday will again take up the issue,  as well as Mayor Peter F. Buffa's proposal to help settle SOS in a commercial  area.  </P> <P> Those attending the afternoon rally seemed determined to save the charity,  despite the imposing political and financial struggles, as well as about 40  counterdemonstration picketers at the entrance to the park area, who flashed  placards with a circle and red line through "SOS."  </P> <P> "We have a dream too," Jean Forbath, executive director of SOS, told the crowd,  in reference to the Monday holiday marking the birthday of slain civil rights  leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "We'll get through this . . . and make a  difference in Orange County."  </P> <P> "We have to ask ourselves, 'Why are people hungry? Why are people homeless? Why  do people have to line up at SOS for the little we can give them?' " she asked  those who sat wrapped in blankets or stood drinking hot coffee and tea amid the  drizzle and blustery wind.  </P> <P> As supporters listened to the speeches of SOS organizers, prayers of religious  leaders and an acoustic guitar player strumming folk and protest songs, they  applauded and shouted approval.  </P> <P> Kathy McCoy of Costa Mesa sat on a blanket rocking her sleeping 6-month-old  daughter, Lauren, snuggled in a blanket and fuzzy knit cap. McCoy describes  herself as usually "passive" about political and social issues, but said the  SOS story moved her and her husband, David, to action.  </P> <P> "I've been listening to the City Council meetings, and I just think it stinks  what they're doing," McCoy said. "It comes down to, where are these people  going to go? I think if anybody really looks at themselves, they would realize  that it wouldn't take much for any one of us to be in that situation."  </P> <P> The picketers on the other side of the issue, who police say protested without  incident, insist that SOS should be moved to a non-residential area, where the  homeless and hungry won't infringe on the safety and serenity of the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> "We're not against the homeless, we're for our neighborhoods," said Lee  Litterell, who has lived in the area near SOS for six years. "We just want them  to go to an industrial-type area, where most Skid Rows are. We don't want to be  the Skid Row of Orange County."  </P> <P> After the rally, about 150 supporters of SOS walked the nearly three miles to  City Hall, where a few dozen began a 50-hour fast and sleep-over that they plan  to continue until the council meets Monday.  </P> <P> Said Forbath: "Even though we're not going to suffer very much, we offer it  (the hunger strike) as a token of what we feel is a beginning, a small  beginning."  </P></p>

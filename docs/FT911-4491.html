			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / World Trade News: Brussels opens its doors to trade with eastern Europe - The EC association accord with Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia POLAND, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have put their collective weight against the EC's door, shoved, and won themselves further valuable access to the European Community market. It now seems certain that these three countries will this year reach a new type of association accord with Brussels, extending to them by the turn of the century the freedom of movement of goods, services, labour and capital in the Community's single market, and an option on full EC membership. Only a couple of weeks ago, however, the eastern Europeans were fulminating at the Community's hypocrisy in showering them with fine political words empty of economic content. Sensitive to this charge, on Monday EC foreign ministers softened the EC's negotiating stance in several key respects. Membership of the EC may now figure in the preamble to the agreements as 'an ultimate, though not automatic' goal. EC ministers conceded this, believing the three states are likely to be in a second wave of new members, after some European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries join in the mid-1990s. But this preamble could come back to haunt Brussels, as has the reference to possible membership for Turkey in the 1963 EC-Turkish association agreement. The EC has dropped its call for a review half-way through the 10-year period during which trade barriers will be phased out. Hungary, in particular, argued that such a review, giving the EC a chance to go back on its free trade words, would discourage western entrepreneurs wanting firm assurance of an EC outlet for their investments in eastern Europe. But the EC still wants a mid-term review of liberalisation in services, capital and labour. The eastern Europeans will get more time to erect tariffs which they will then spend the next 10 years dismantling. With these negotiations coming so relatively soon after the collapse of communism, the eastern Europeans have removed all the non-tariff barriers of central planning without yet replacing them with a transparent tariff system. Thus, in many cases they are left with markets more open and vulnerable than the EC, contrary to the agreed aim of phasing in free trade so as to benefit the eastern Europeans faster than the EC. A further complication is that a long-standing member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) like Czechoslovakia will need its Gatt partners' agreement to raise its very low 'bound' tariffs of 4-5 per cent on average. Already the US is grumbling that eastern Europe will be making a general increase in its tariffs, followed by a selective reduction only towards the EC. Washington's counter has been to twist the knife in the EC's side by insisting the planned EC-central European free trade area conform with Gatt in covering all aspects of trade, including agriculture. Partly as a result of this, EC members overruled Spain in promising extra concessions on farm exports. East Europeans will be probably able to sell more fruit, vegetables, pork, game, rather than mainline items like cereals, beef, lamb, dairy products that will continue to get the full protection of the Common Agricultural Policy. Northern EC members overruled Mediterranean objections to giving eastern Europe more on textiles and steel. All textile tariffs will disappear over the 10 year transition period (despite complaints from Portugal and Greece), while steel import duties and quotas will go within five years (against Spain's wishes). But the country most concerned to keep out eastern European (mainly Polish) coal was Germany, which has insisted on a special regime for coal. To help the three eastern economies integrate, the EC is now ready to allow regional 'cumulation' in its rules of origin. For example, a product exported from Poland but using components from Hungary or Czechoslovakia would not, by virtue of those components, be considered any less 'Polish' or less eligible for duty-free entry into the EC. The Commission had hoped to open up the EC labour market more, in particular by 'communitarising' any immigration quotas granted by individual EC member states to eastern European workers. But Britain, for one, opposed this. The main EC focus is on promising non-discrimination for those eastern Europeans already legally established in an EC state, rather than letting them move around the Community more easily or letting more come in from outside.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- EC TRADE WITH EASTERN EUROPE (Ecu bns)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           Exports to the EC       Imports from the EC                           Jan-Sept Jan-Sept         Jan-Sept Jan-Sept  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                           1989         1990       1989           1990  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Poland                    2.83         3.70       2.83           2.85 Czechoslovakia*           1.84         1.95       1.63           1.76 Hungary                   1.84         2.10       2.14           2.09  --------------------------------------------------------------------- * Full trade accord with EC only in force since 1/11/90.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Eurostat  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

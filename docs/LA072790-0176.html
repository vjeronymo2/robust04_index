			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> PRANK IMPERILS 2 FIREFIGHTERS  </P> <P> Two British firefighters had to be rescued from a sewer today after trudging  through water in search of children imitating the cartoon capers of the Teenage  Mutant Ninja Turtles.  </P> <P> The youngsters were already above ground by the time their exhausted would-be  rescuers, carrying heavy resuscitation equipment, radioed a colleague to come  and get them.  </P> <P> "It may be a craze but these children need a good spanking," said a fire  brigade spokesman in this northern city. "It's a dangerous game and it nearly  cost the lives of three firemen."  </P> <P> The sewer-dwelling turtles have an avid following among children in Britain  where they are known as Heroes rather than Ninja turtles in the interests of  nonviolence.  </P></p>

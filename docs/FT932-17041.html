			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Yeltsin accepts referendum planned by Congress RUSSIAN president Boris Yeltsin has dropped plans to hold his own plebiscite in order to brave a much tougher referendum set by the Congress of People's Deputies, one of his closest colleagues said yesterday. 'The president is not going to come out with a separate vote and he will take part in the referendum whatever its rules are,' said Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the head of the government information service. Such a decision would spare the country the chaos of two rival polls, each with its own set of questions and rules. But it would also mean Mr Yeltsin faces a near impossible task, unless he can secure new terms, either through the constitutional court or in backroom negotiations with the parliamentary leadership. Under terms set down by Congress, Mr Yeltsin would have to obtain the support of more than 50 per cent of all registered voters to declare that he has the nation's trust to conduct economic and political reforms. Mr Yeltsin had proposed a majority of those who turned out to vote. The president has asked the Constitutional Court to examine the legality of the terms. Meanwhile, the Congress of People's Deputies has virtually guaranteed protection against the threat of its removal by requiring an equally high number of Russians to demand early parliamentary elections. Even then, no date is fixed. The two other questions posed by parliament are on early presidential elections and on whether the electorate approves socio-economic policies. Mr Yeltsin, in going along with parliament's version, would also be deprived of two questions he wanted to ask: do you want a new constitution and do you want private land ownership? Meanwhile, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, who has come under attack from the parliament which elected him, claimed that the government would stay out of political battles to focus on the economy. He also promised further 'corrections' to government economic policy as part of the government's attempts to drum up popular support before the April 25 vote. He told a meeting of enterprise directors in St Petersburg that this would include stronger state control over the tax and financial system, and changes to the enterprise and privatisation laws. Mr Chernomyrdin also made his first public attack on Mr Anatoly Chubais, the dynamic young privatisation minister, comparing the rapid pace of the sale of state-owned enterprises to Stalin's bloody collectivisation policies which destroyed private agriculture in the 1930s.

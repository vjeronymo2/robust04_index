			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / World Trade News: Tough US trade bill passed by House THE House of Representatives yesterday passed a Democratic-backed trade bill which would resurrect for five years 'Super 301' - a provision aimed mainly at Japan - and make a controversial change in US anti-dumping law. Super 301 requires the Administration to negotiate away foreign trade barriers or retaliate against closed markets with US sanctions. The bill also caps Japanese car imports at 1.65m vehicles and imposes a 70 per cent domestic content requirement on cars produced by Japanese subsidiaries in the US. The anti-dumping provision would close a loophole in the 1988 trade law which allows foreign companies to avoid anti-dumping duties by setting up 'phantom' factories in the US. These assembly operations import all their parts from third countries which are not covered by the anti-dumping order. The bill would give the US Commerce Department added authority to judge whether a company is evading anti-dumping duties by considering 'actual and potential' threats to US industries. Congressman Don Sunquist, a Tennessee Republican, yesterday said the provision 'attacks nearly every US-based manufacturing plant owned by a foreign company.' It would target a plant in his district, owned by Brother Industries of Japan, which has been engaged in a long-running feud with Smith Corona. Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, charges Brother with establishing the low-wage, low-skill assembly plant expressly to circumvent the 60 per cent duty. Its parts are imported from Singapore and Malaysia. Brother admits it swallows losses to keep market share (a tacit admission of dumping, argues Smith Corona).</p>

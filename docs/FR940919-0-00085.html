			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While no consensus was reached, the following principles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were generally arrived at by most of the participants at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meeting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Microencapsulation: Participants at the meeting seem to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that using a leach test may be more appropriate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate effective microencapsulation immobilization over an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach of developing design and operating standards. It was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that treatment of hazardous debris is very waste and debris  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific; if one could define design and operating standards that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were generally applicable, they would likely be too burdensome in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> many cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Macroencapsulation/Sealing: The participants seem to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indicate that the grinding requirement in the TCLP leach test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made it inappropriate for predicting performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> macroencapsulation/sealing immobilization technologies. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technologies rely on an impermeable coating applied to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside of the debris. Rather, the participants suggested a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural test to determine whether the given debris/technology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination was sufficient to maintain the coating or a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permeability test for the coating media. While the participants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conceptually believed that such an approach was workable, no one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was able to suggest a specific test or standard. In addition, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was felt by some of the participants that the development of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a test could be difficult to develop.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While no data or information was provided at the meeting, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was indicated that if such information was submitted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency, the Agency would consider such information in making its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. EPA Investigations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to the above roundtable discussions, EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also been reviewing the literature and talking to vendors in an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effort to obtain sufficient information on how to propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that could allow the exclusion of immobilized hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debris. At the time the Phase II LDR rule was proposed, no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful insights had been gained on how to specify design and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operating standards that would ensure that immobilized hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> debris was nonhazardous; the reason for this was the paucity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experience in immobilizing hazardous debris. Nevertheless, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency expressed interest in pursuing this area and specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sought assistance from the regulated community on this issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Specific Questions for Which Comments Were Solicited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> While the Agency had a better sense of the types of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards that may be appropriate for excluding immobilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous debris from Subtitle C control at the time of the Phase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> II proposal, the Agency still did not have the data to propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific exclusions. For microencapsulation in particular, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leach test were the most appropriate mechanism for determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether such treated debris is nonhazardous, the Agency expressed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the belief that HWIR may be the most appropriate rulemaking to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> address this issue. The Agency had a series of studies underway,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was evaluating comments, but was not in a position to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> what such levels were at that time. With respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> macroencapsulation/sealing, additional data or information needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be gathered before the Agency would be in a position to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclude this type of immobilized hazardous debris. To assist the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency in this effort, we specifically solicited comment on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following questions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Microencapsulation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is the use of a leach test for excluding immobilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  hazardous debris more appropriate than specification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  design and operating standards?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Is exclusion of immobilized hazardous debris using design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  and operating standards workable?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Macroencapsulation/Sealing:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What type of structural or other test could be used?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;What type of criteria should be applied in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  whether such debris is nonhazardous?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency is also considering allowing stabilization for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> soils containing low levels of organic constituents, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicited comment on whether similar stabilization techniques or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tests to ensure the effectiveness of such stabilization would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate for excluding debris from Subtitle C control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Agency specifically solicited comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any available data or information to demonstrate that immobilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous debris (if treated properly) would not pose a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial hazard to human health and the environment, stating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if such information were submitted to the Agency, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would exclude such debris from Subtitle C control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Comments Received and Conclusions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Microencapsulation: One commenter stated that specifying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design and operating standards is appropriate for excluding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immobilized hazardous debris from subtitle C, asserting that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nothing is gained in performing a leach test on hazardous debris.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters suggested that EPA consider a combination of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural test combined with a leaching test conducted on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative intact sample of the encapsulated waste. None of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these commenters submitted any supporting information to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantiate these conflicting claims. However, the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did agree that if a leach test is used, the TCLP as it is now  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined is inappropriate for immobilized debris.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Macroencapsulation/Sealing: Several commenters claimed that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the TCLP test is inappropriate for immobilized material because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the size reduction required by the test protocol destroys the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encapsulant, thereby defeating the purpose of the technology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These commenters suggested that EPA instead consider a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination of a structural test (a 50 psi standard was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested) combined with a leaching test conducted on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representative intact sample of the encapsulated waste. These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters did not submit any data to verify that a 50 psi  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard would insure the integrity of the immobilized waste, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> although some commenters recommended that a new leach test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocol be developed, they did not suggest any specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protocols for a leach test on the intact debris waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exclusion of Immobilized Debris from Subtitle C Regulation:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters maintained that debris treated with an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immobilization technology should be excluded from Subtitle C  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. However, these commenters did not submit any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting data to verify this claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

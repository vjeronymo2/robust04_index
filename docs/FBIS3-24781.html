After several weeks of intense  discussions, the future national police issue was finally  wrapped up today. Now the issue of national reconciliation will  be on the negotiating table, and it is believed to be an equally  tough assignment. Pedro Manuel, our special correspondent in  the Zambian capital, provides the details:    [Begin Pedro recording] This round of the Lusaka peace talks  has taken yet another step forward. The negotiators have put an  end to discussions concerning the future national police force  issue. It is not known how responsibilities were apportioned,  but [words indistinct] last weekend, according to rumors the  National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] had  lowered its demands to participate with 40 percent of the Public  Order Police force and 50 percent of the Rapid Intervention  Police force. It has reduced its demands to a general [figure  indistinct] percent. This report has not been confirmed by any  source whatever so far.    Another as yet unconfirmed report says that UNITA is to have  5,500 men in the future national police force.    With the shelving of the future national police dossier, the  negotiators began discussing national reconciliation this  afternoon. Observers believe this will be one (?of the most  difficult) hurdles to overcome at this round of talks. This  part of the talks will discuss the possibility that UNITA will  also participate in government. In other words, it will focus  on what ministerial portfolios the government can award UNITA.  As is already known, UNITA wants some portfolios for itself  that, according to some analysts, would put in a position where  it would be sharing power. We are talking about its requests for  the defense, information, foreign affairs, economy and finance,  and territorial administration portfolios.    As of this afternoon, the talks will focus on national  reconciliation and the negotiators will also have to discuss the  mandate of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2, Unavem-2. That  is an issue that [words indistinct] meanwhile, UN Special  Representative Alioune Blondin Beye is to go to Cote d'Ivoire on  2 February to attend the funeral ceremony honoring the late  President Felix Houphouet-Boigny.    In Lusaka, the talks will continue under the chairmanship of  Nigerian General Garuba [words indistinct] of Unavem. [end  recording]</p>

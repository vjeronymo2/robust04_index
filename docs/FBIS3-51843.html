			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from the National Assembly in Managua </F> on talks between representatives of the transportation industry  and the government; from the "The Nation Radio Newspaper"]    [Excerpt] This afternoon, the National Transport Commission  failed to attend negotiations that the government opened with  the four organizations that make up the National Transportation  Council. The two transportation chambers and the two  transportation federations -- Fetracanic [Federation of  Nicaraguan Cargo Carriers] and Fetracolnic [Federation of  Nicaraguan of Passenger Carriers] -- are holding a meeting on  the second floor of the Presidency in an effort to reach  agreements to put an end to the problems caused by this strike.  Journalists outside the Presidency have been denied access to  the meeting on instructions from the Presidency's Public  Relations Office. The journalists, however, are waiting for  results of the talks.    Nevertheless, the strike will not be resolved, at least  today, because of the National Transportation Commission's  absence. The vehicles that had been blocking the nearby streets  were removed this afternoon. Talks are expected to be resumed  tomorrow. [passage omitted]</p>

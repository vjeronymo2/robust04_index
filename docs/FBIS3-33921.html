Peres  disclosed that Yasir 'Arafat informed him in Davos that the PLO  leadership does not work toward establishing a Palestinian  state, but seeks to set up a confederation with Jordan. Peres  added that 'Arafat told him that Fatah and other Palestinian  organizations, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC], led by Ahmad Jibril,  support confederation.    George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front for  the  Liberation of Palestine [PFLP], said that this stand reiterates  that the Gaza-Jericho accord constitutes, to the PLO leadership,  the ceiling of the final solution to the Palestine question.    The PFLP-GC categorically denied that it has informed  'Arafat  of its support for confederation. Our correspondent Sana'  al-Imam reports from Damascus:    [Begin al-Imam recording] The PFLP-GC has denied Peres'  statement in which he cited PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat [on  PFLP-GC's support for confederation]. A PFLP-GC official  spokesman said: What 'Arafat is saying is absolutely baseless.  He added that 'Arafat has no right to speak on behalf of the  PFLP-GC or any Palestinian citizen after all active factions and  forces in the Palestinian arena have deprived him of his  legitimacy. The PFLP-GC spokesman added that the organizational  and political relationship between the front and 'Arafat has  been severed since 1982 and that the PFLP-GC's position is still  based on the strategy of armed struggle to liberate the  Palestinian territory and restore the national and historical  rights.    Commenting on the issue of confederation and 'Arafat's  relinquishment of establishing an independent state, PFLP  Secretary General George Habash noted that this reiterates that  the Gaza-Jericho accord constitutes, to 'Arafat and his team,  the ceiling of the Palestinian solution. He added that the  Palestinian people will not agree on setting up a confederation  or federation with Jordan or any other Arab state, noting that  'Arafat's remarks mean transferring administrative rule to  Jordan and aim at reassuring Israel.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Seventh of seven question-and-answer talks sponsored by the </F> State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC) and the State General  Administration of Taxation, chaired by Wei Dong, deputy director  of the SETC's Department of Enterprises: "Answers to Questions  Regarding Enterprises' Implementation of the New Tax System" --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Wei] In today's talk, we will discuss some  special questions confronting some special trades. Deputy  Director [of the State General Administration of Taxation's  Department of Indirect Taxes] Chen [Jie], in our previous talks,  we have discussed issues relevant to value-added taxes,  consumption taxes, and income taxes. Today we would like you to  answer some questions relevant to special trades. [passage  omitted]    [Gao Feng, deputy director of the Policies and Regulations  Department under the Ministry of Coal] In the past, enterprises  paid a 3-percent product tax, which was the previous tax rate.  Now that the product tax rate has been raised to 17 percent,  the additional tax must be reflected in prices. Should we  assume that this problem can only be solved by setting new  prices?    [Chen] This problem should be observed through the central  authorities' price policy. First of all, we must understand  that prices must not be changed. But how can problems caused by  additional taxes be solved if prices cannot be changed? In most  cases, the problems can be solved in two ways. First, while  introducing the value-added taxes, the state has also adopted  tax- cutting measures, such as exempting enterprises from paying  the two funds [fund for major energy and communications  development products and fund for budget regulation] and  reducing enterprises' income taxes. The second solution rests  with enterprises themselves. Enterprises should have more  efficient management and they should tap their potential. While  the majority of enterprises can cope, some enterprises have  problems dealing with the higher taxes. The state has been  studying ways to help these enterprises. [passage omitted]    [Zheng Guangzhao, chief accountant of the Beijing  Papermaking  and Packaging Industrial Company] I remember that in 1987, the  State Council encouraged enterprises to recycle renewable  resources. The Ministry of Finance, the State Economic  Commission, and the General Administration of Supply and  Marketing Cooperatives in those days also supported the policy  by deducting or exempting these enterprises' tax payments.  Because this preferential policy has not been specified in the  new tax policy, these enterprises face the problem of having to  pay higher taxes during the transitional period. Can you  comment on this issue?    [Chen] [word indistinct] invoice and [word indistinct]  constitute the foundation of the new value-added taxes. If the  paper you produce by recycling waste paper is tax-exempted when  it is being marketed, then you are neither entitled to tax  deductions nor to the use of a special invoice. And if your  buyers cannot enjoy the deductions, then they may not want to  buy paper from you and your sales will be affected. In the  past, nobody was sure what new problems might be caused by the  policy of giving preferential treatment to the comprehensive use  of material resources. However, we have decided to carry out a  serious follow-up study of this issue following the introduction  of the new tax system. We believe that there will be a proper  solution. [passage omitted]    [Wei] Deputy Director Chen, some enterprises recently  asked us some tax-related questions. I would like to mention  two of the questions here. The first one is how are retail  sales of paging equipment and cellular phones taxed? The other  one is how are products made of grain -- like steamed stuffed  buns and pastries -- taxed?    [Chen] The way that retail sales of pagers and cellular  phones are taxed is different from how retail food products are  taxed. According to what we know, some pagers are now sold by  the telecommunications bureau, and some are sold by stores on  its behalf. Generally speaking, the prices of papers and  cellular phones are made up of two parts: the prices of the  pagers themselves and the prices charged by the  telecommunications bureau. After a customer has purchased a  pager, the telecommunications bureau has to provide the buyer  the needed services, including labor services. As for cellular  phones, some are also sold by the telecommunications bureau, and  some are sold by retail stores. The prices of cellular phones,  however, are different from pagers. Some prices are the prices  of the phones themselves, and some prices also include  telecommunications services to be provided in the future. This  being the case, we have decided to impose business taxes on the  prices of pagers or cellular phones sold by all units providing  telecommunications services -- including the telecommunications  bureau and other units engaging in the telecommunications  business -- as well as service charges. The tax rate is 3  percent. The sales of pagers and cellular phones alone are  subject to value-added taxes.    When a retail store sells pagers or cellular phones on  behalf  of telecommunications units, the prices it charges are subject  to value-added taxes, no matter whether or not labor services  will be provided in the future. Of course, after this store has  sold the equipment for the telecommunications units and  delivered the money to them, we will not tax the  telecommunications units for the money in question.    As for the sales of commodities such as cakes, pastries, and  candies, they are taxed like other commodities. When they are  sold, their pretax prices should be multiplied by 17 percent,  and then the taxes stated in the special invoices issued when  they were purchased should be subtracted from the total.

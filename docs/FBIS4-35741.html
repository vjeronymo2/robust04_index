			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Furayh Abu-Middayn, "justice minister in the </F> Palestinian Authority," by Rashid Khashanah in Tunis; date not  given]    [Excerpts] [Khashanah] The "Palestinian Authority's  program" has underscored the importance of reorganizing the  judicial system to ensure independence of the judiciary and the  rule of law. How will that reorganization and the creation of  national judicial bodies be done?    [Abu-Middayn] The judicial bodies are there and the  Palestinian law existed before the occupation but it needs to be  adapted to international developments in all fields such as  international communication and economic relations, and that  requires legislative adjustment.    So far, our legislative powers are limited because the  autonomy we got does not come up to the level of our aspirations  but we must amend legislations and adapt to the changes of the  era. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] In your view, what funds are needed for  developing the judicial system?    [Abu-Middayn] We need two central courts in the Gaza Strip.  We have requested aid from the United Nations and European  states and we have set an emergency budget of $4.5 million.  [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] Rabin has challenged the PLO's decision to  abolish the Israeli military orders issued after the occupation.  How is the justice ministry tackling this situation?    [Abu-Middayn] The aim of the decision was to restore the  situation which existed before June 1967. Rabin should know  that all the orders and legislations introduced after that date  in violation of the Geneva conventions are not sacrosanct as far  as we are concerned. Rabin did not understand the significance  of our decision. He has withdrawn his forces and, therefore,  the role of his military courts and their interference in  civilian affairs is at an end. We have decided to abolish the  extraordinary measures. We, of course, will not take his place  on the basis of his own laws in the framework of military courts  but we will restore the judicial powers of the civilian courts.    What Rabin said was a violation of the Geneva conventions  and  the Hague agreement. It reflects a desire to continue to link  the Gaza Strip to Israel and make it a permanent nest for  hatching cheap labor in Israel's interests. Logic dictates  abolition of the emergency laws which were introduced  illegitimately and unconstitutionally. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] What are the expected legislative repercussions  of the promulgation of the Palestinian constitution?    [Abu-Middayn] Rabin has expressed displeasure at the steps  we have taken, especially in connection with the promulgation of  the Palestinian constitution, but our constitution was actually  issued in 1922 under the British mandate and it was later  modernized in the days of 'Abd-al-Nasir in 1962. It is an  advanced constitution because it guarantees personal and public  freedoms and carefully regulates powers. When we talk about the  return of Jerusalem, Rabin says that Jerusalem is the soul of  the Jewish people, forgetting that there were no Jews in East  Jerusalem before 1967 but then they brought in tens of thousands  of Jewish immigrants. So the ratio went from 0:100 percent to  50-50, that is 150,000 Arabs and 150,000 Jews. Furthermore,  Jerusalem does not just belong to us. People in Fes, Maknas,  Mecca, Baghdad, and Malaysia have a right to it. We are  advocates of peace but the Palestinians see the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, despite its many flaws and shortcomings, as a step  toward a final settlement based on Resolutions 242 and 338.    [Khashanah] Do you not believe that Israeli measures such  as the closure of the Gaza Strip and the postponement of the  implementation of the economic agreement confirm that, with the  present imbalance of powers, the Israeli views prevail?    [Abu-Middayn] Israel wants to go all the way in aborting the  peace process. It wants out of the Gaza Strip because it  considers that to be in its favor, and also it wants to show the  world that we failed to produce a model of coexistence and  failed to manage our own affairs. [passage omitted]    We realize that the closure of the Gaza Strip is not in the  interest of peace and that open borders, work for the  Palestinians in Israel, and mutual benefits are factors that  would strengthen peace. Closure of borders would mean wars  within 10 or 15 years. The Palestinians are today in a weak  position but they have a "secret" key which is passive power, if  that is the right expression. We can overturn the table in the  entire peace process. Israel cannot possibly succeed in  establishing peace and achieving security for itself unless  Palestinian rights are fulfilled. [passage omitted]    Israel should know that the age of imperialism and  occupation  is gone and that we will be good neighbors but would never be  subservient if it tried to impose hegemony and occupation on us.    [Khashanah] What are the ramifications of the postponement  of the implementation of the economic agreements?    [Abu-Middayn] Egypt is on our southern border and Jordan is  on our eastern border. If Israel wants these to be the borders  between us and it then that would be fine and we will open lines  with our brothers in Egypt and Jordan for water, oil, and  everything our economy needs. [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] How will the Justice Ministry handle the issue  of the Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons and detention  camps?    [Abu-Middayn] That is the most serious, complex, and urgent  issue today. It is the issue that will determine the  credibility, or lack of it, of any step we take in the eyes of  the Palestinian people.    The issue of the prisoners should not be used for political  blackmail and bargaining. [passage omitted] The recent Cairo  agreement provides for the release of 5,000 detainees within  five weeks from the date the agreement was signed but Israel has  only released 1,200-1,300. That constitutes a violation of the  agreement. [passage omitted]    We will tackle this issue continuously, particularly as  there  is an agreement on this matter despite Israeli maneuvering  attempts. I do not reveal a secret by saying that Israel  believes that the Palestinians know what happened to the bodies  of three of its soldiers killed during the 1982 siege of Beirut.  It is trying to use that as a bargaining card. Morally and  religiously, we Arabs and Muslims could not possibly keep these  bodies for such a long time. The Israelis should show goodwill  and release the 5,000 detainees as agreed, even gradually.    We know that there are conflicts and that there is right and  left.    That leaves the major files. We have rejected the  classification of detainees (Fatah, Hamas, and so on) because we  do not view the matter from a factional or partisan angle.  Israel has raised the issue of written undertakings although it  had been agreed that the detainees should not be asked to give  any pledge or undertaking because that is a matter for the  detainee and his conscience, and it is rejected. If a prisoner  signs an undertaking of submission, that would have no legal  value and would not be binding on the person signing it.  [passage omitted]    [Khashanah] There are about 20,000 weapons in Gaza, mostly  in the hands of ordinary citizens not organizations. How will  that issue be tackled?    [Abu-Middayn] The Palestinian police chief has announced  that there will be no objection to people keeping their licensed  arms, provided they apply for them according to the law. There  are 3,500 settlers in the Gaza Strip and they possess arms. We  therefore do not request withdrawal of the arms from the hands  of the Palestinian citizens but request control of the hand that  holds the gun. In other words, it should be a clean and honest  hand with the sole aim of protection in the event of appearance  of crminal gangs in our society. Within days, Israel will be  handing over to us some 400 civilian prisoners held in  connection with criminal cases (murder and drug smuggling). We  do not want arms to fall into the hands of these people lest  they blackmail and rob people. So, at first we will ban the  possession of arms in the streets but we will not storm homes in  search of arms. Anyone who seeks a license and pays the fees  according to the law may do so, and each case will be considered  on merit. As regards organizations, if arms are necessary we  would perhaps consider having them assembled in certain places  by the organizations. That is an example. Some ideas are under  study and will be discussed with a view to reaching agreement  but everyone should know that the security of the Palestinian  people is more important than the security of the organizations,  and that the possession of arms should be subject to legal  procedures. These are just rules and are not directed at anyone  or meant to liquidate the existing organizations, for we are  against liquidating them. [passage omitted]</p>

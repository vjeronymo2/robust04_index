			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / Finance and the Family: Putting life back into your Pep - The best ways to change your plans If you are happy with your personal equity plan, read no further. But if you are unhappy with your choice - like one Weekend FT reader whose independent adviser (IFA) told him he needed a Pep, but that it did not matter what went in it - read on. Fortunately, investors who are disappointed with the performance of the funds or shares in their Peps are not locked into them. They can transfer to another plan manager without affecting their annual allowance of Pounds 6,000 in a general Pep and Pounds 3,000 in a single company Pep. These amounts may seem relatively small but, by now, a married couple could have invested Pounds 110,400 since Peps began in January 1987. Since all income and capital gains are tax-free, the sums involved are not inconsiderable. Why transfer? The Pep transfer market is growing rapidly. Independent adviser John Spiers, of Best Investment, explains: 'There is definitely more Pep transfer business than before; the fastest growing part of our business is people wanting advice on their existing Peps.' Matthew Orr, of stockbroker Killik, agrees: 'We are taking a lot of transfers. For each Pep going out, there are a dozen coming in.' Why are investors doing it? Some will have been disappointed with the performance of the Pep or find their investment needs have changed. Others, who have subscribed to a variety of different plan managers over the years, may now find the paperwork too much and yearn for a simplified system offered under the umbrella of a single plan manager, either a stockbroker or an IFA. Robert Noble Warren, of fee-based IFA Murray Noble, says: 'The major cause for Pep transfers appears to be dissatisfaction with the administration and a lack of personal service. The high street banks and one or two large life companies seem to have the worst of it.' Before doing it . . . A Pep transfer costs money and will take around four to six weeks to complete, so it is not a decision to be taken lightly or often. Spiers says that if your worry is performance, first check how the fund or shares have done compared with a relevant index such as the FT-SE-A All-Share (Money Management magazine publishes performance tables). If there is significant underperformance over a number of years, see if there is a pardonable reason. Recovery funds or UK smaller companies are cyclical stocks which will not do well in times of recession but should outperform when recovery is under way. Some fund management groups allow you to switch out of one sector and into another in their Pep. But if you are unhappy with the group itself, or want someone else's fund, this facility is of little use. How to do it Contact the new plan manager for transfer forms. According to Roz Barder, of Chase de Vere, the new manager should handle the transfer process for you. There may be three forms to fill in: one to notify the old manager that you are transferring out, another to the new manager saying you want to transfer, and possibly one telling the latter what you want in your new Pep. Do not on any account tell your existing manager that you want to close the Pep. He might cash your holdings - and you would lose the Pep status on the amount held, so wasting the allowances that allowed you to build it up. What you pay This depends on the type of holding you own. Some investment trusts and a few unit trusts charge a transfer fee, usually between Pounds 25 and Pounds 50. A few funds have withdrawal charges on their Peps for up to five years as a quid pro quo for a lower initial charge (these include Fidelity, Gartmore, Guinness Flight, Scottish Equitable &amp; M&amp;G's Income fund). If you hold individual shares, there will be dealing charges. If you are transferring from one unit trust to another, you face initial charges of up to 6 per cent (although some IFAs will be able to reduce this cost by passing on to you some or all of the commission built into this figure). Brokerage is the main cost if you are buying an investment trust Pep, but there are many execution-only or discount brokers which charge lower commission than the average 1.65 per cent. A more expensive option - but one that, ultimately, is administratively simpler - is to transfer all your Peps to one manager. Some brokers offer an umbrella service; others will suggest a self-select Pep but may advise you on what to put in it. Apart from the brokerage fee, there are lots of charges for which you should watch out. What is the charge for opening the plan and its annual fee? Is there a dividend collection charge? Is there a charge for selling unit trusts? (If there is, see if your existing manager will transfer cash rather than units to the new manager). For the unit trust devotee, Skandia Life's Multipep is an umbrella-type Pep for unit trusts. Investors can switch between about 30 funds at very low cost, but Skandia imposes an additional 0.5 per cent annual fee on top of the underlying fund and charges for collecting dividends.

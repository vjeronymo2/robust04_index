			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Treasury to endorse George for governorship of Bank MR EDDIE GEORGE, deputy governor of the Bank of England, is to be endorsed by the Treasury as a leading candidate for the governor's job when it becomes vacant next year. Mr George is expected to be high on a shortlist of contenders to be drawn up by Sir Terry Burns, permanent secretary to the Treasury. Others likely to be shortlisted include Sir David Scholey, chairman of the SG Warburg investment bank; Sir David Walker, departing chairman of the Securities and Investments Board; Sir Peter Middleton, chairman of Barclays Bank and former Treasury permanent secretary; and Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank. The decision will be taken this year by Mr John Major, the prime minister, after informal talks in Whitehall and the City. If Mr George takes the top job  - replacing Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, who retires in June 1993 after 10 years  - it would mark the first time since the 1960s that someone already at the Bank was appointed governor. Mr George has a good working relationship with the Treasury, which the Bank advises. This is even though he and Sir Terry have disagreed fundamentally on economic policy in recent years. Helping Mr George's candidacy is his deep understanding of financial markets and keenness to combat inflation. But his lack of experience outside the Bank and abrasive management style might count against him. Choosing an insider would avoid the furore when Mrs Margaret Thatcher appointed Mr Leigh-Pemberton, a former chairman of National Westminster and a Tory party stalwart. This was criticised on the grounds that Mr Leigh-Pemberton knew little about central banking. The last deputy governor to be promoted was Lord O'Brien, governor from 1966 to 1973.

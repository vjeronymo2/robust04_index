He is the Pacific 10 Conference's all-time leader in  blocked shots with 261. Other players on the first team are Sean Elliott of  Arizona, Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount, Pooh Richardson of UCLA and Stacey  Augmon of Nevada Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Second-team selections include UCLA forward Trevor Wilson, a junior from  Cleveland High, and Bruin freshman Don MacLean, from Simi Valley High.  </P> <P> Among those chosen for the Division II All-West team was Cal Lutheran guard  Steve deLaveaga, who made the second team. Three players from California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. teams made the first team: Maurice Pullum of UC  Riverside, Anthony Blackmon of Cal State Dominguez Hills and Troy Price of Cal  State Bakersfield.  </P> <P> John Keister of Occidental College was a second-team choice on the Division III  All-West squad.  </P> <P> Larnell Bush, a starting defensive back on the Moorpark College football team,  has pleaded innocent to charges of assault in the beating death of John Flores,  19, a Moorpark student, outside a party in Thousand Oaks on Jan. 20. Bush, 19,  from Gardena, entered his plea in Ventura Municipal Court on Monday and was  released on his promise to return to court March 20 for a preliminary hearing.  </P> <P> John Yurek, the brother of Moorpark football player Scott, was charged with  manslaughter, battery and assault in connection with the incident. Flores died  from a brain injury after a fight in the 2900 block of Avocado Court.  </P> <P> Moorpark Coach Jim Bittner said that Bush, a second-team All-Western State  Conference selection last season, had planned to transfer from Moorpark to  Allan Hancock College in Santa Maria.  </P> <P> Another Raider player, linebacker Ken Haefliger of Thousand Oaks, was arrested  along with Bush and Yurek but later released.  </P> <P> Bittner said that Haefliger would not be disciplined.

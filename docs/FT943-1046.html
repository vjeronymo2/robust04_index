			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Confidence in earnings less secure - London This week will not be an easy one for fund managers. It brings the end of the year's third quarter with the three-month gain already whittled away to not much more than 100 points; and 100 points is no gain at all in a stock market which has suffered losses of 40 points-plus on more than one session in the past fortnight. Also hanging over all fund trustees' meetings will be awareness that the FT-SE 100 Index has to move quickly in the final quarter to meet many year-end forecasts. Chartists see support around 2,960 to 2,970, with some moving the line to about 3,020. Such worries are tempered by the assurance from Derivative Securities, the futures market specialist, that 'we now have an extremely oversold situation'. Deeper concerns over interest rates and the pace of economic recovery lie beneath these technical considerations. Interest rate anxiety will be tested early this week at the meeting of the US Federal Open Markets Committee, while the Bundesbank stands by to provide further drama on Thursday. Interest rate worries are reflected in the role of bonds in undermining equities. European fund managers have been switching out of UK stocks and into British government bonds, even though the outlook for gilts remains questionable as long as further rises in base rates seem likely. BZW points out that the gilt/equity yield ratio is at 2.3 times, underlining the cheapness of gilts; but Strauss Turnbull notes that this ratio is close to its 10-year average. Given that UK bonds hold the key to genuine recovery in equities, and that many analysts believe that impending over-supply of bonds is the problem, markets will watch Wednesday's auction of Pounds 2bn 10-year gilts with care. If the interest rate side of the market argument is in doubt, the bull side  -based on growth in company profits and dividends - has also become less secure. 'Faith in strong earnings growth runs at least some risk of being misplaced,' says BZW. And Kleinwort Benson Securities has become the first UK house to bite the bullet and describe the market's median estimate of earnings growth of around 14 per cent next year as 'grossly overblown'. Cutting its 1995 earnings forecasts from 10 to 8 per cent, it says some analysts are suffering from 'money illusion' and need spectacles tinted a deep rosy pink. This week can probably be set aside for window dressing ahead of the end of the quarter and worrying about the FOMC. But the response to statements from British Aerospace and Guinness, not to mention hints of downgradings of Hanson, suggests confidence in earnings growth has been shaken. If both the interest and the earnings growth side of the UK market equation are under scrutiny, the year's final quarter could prove difficult.</p>

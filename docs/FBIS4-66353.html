			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by reporters Wang Zhengzhong [3769 2973 1813] and </F> Zhang Houhai [1728 0624 3189]: "Anhui's Local Power Industry Is  Growing by Leaps and Bounds"]    [Text] Anhui Province is raising capital at many levels and  through many channels in a major effort to develop its local  electric power industry and alleviate the entire province's  electricity shortages.    To reduce its energy resource shortages, the Anhui  Provincial  Government has approved the establishment of the Anhui Province  Electric Power Development Corporation to represent the  interests of the local electric power industry, assume special  responsibility for raising and managing capital for a  provincial-level electric power construction fund (including the  use of foreign investments) and for local energy resource  project development and construction. By the end of September,  1993, the corporation had raised a total of 2 billion yuan in  capital for power development. It has made independent  investments to build five 125MW generators at Hefei, Tongling,  Ma'anshan, and other cities and it is participating in joint  investments to establish the key state construction projects at  the Luohe and Pingyu power plants and the Huaibei and Wuhu power  plants for six generators with a total capacity of 1,400MW. The  corporation has also invested over 100 million yuan in joint  investments to complete the Huaibei Tongting Coal Mine with an  annual coal mining capacity of 450,000 tons.    Apparently, Anhui Province also recently decided to use the  Anhui Province Electric Power Development Corporation to  organize the "Anhui Energy Company, Ltd." to issue public stock  to raise an enormous amount of capital to accelerate  construction of its local electric power industry and increase  Anhui's total installed generating capacity to 10,000MW by the  year 2000.</p>

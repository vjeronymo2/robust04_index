			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Arts: Crime against Swan Lake - Ballet Given publicity which reads: 'They tried to ban it, they alleged risque sex scenes - next week you can see it', ballet audiences might suppose that they were being lured to a cross between Vampire Lesbians of Sodom and the Kama Sutra. But no] It is Northern Ballet Theatre's way of alerting us to the charms of their Swan Lake. And, for once, I can agree with the publicity: 'they' should try to ban it. Not for any risque sex scenes - the production has the erotic potential of a meringue - but for the sheer naughtiness of asserting that this night out with the boys has anything much to do with Swan Lake as a masterpiece of classical ballet. Igor Stravinsky declared that a crime against a work of art started with a crime against its text. NBT's staging, which I gather has wowed audiences in the regions, recasts the traditional narrative so that it involves a political coup, rejects all the accepted Ivanov/Petipa choreography, and re-orders and (more excusably, given NBT's restricted means) re-orchestrates Tchaikovsky's music. The resultant production - hectic in manner; desperate in step - is entirely consonant with the policy of Christopher Gable, NBT's director, to provide highly flavoured ballets for his largely regional public. My objections will be dismissed as those of a 'purist' - a term of opprobrium in matters such as this, which I take as the highest of compliments - who believes that Swan Lake, as shown by the Mariinsky or Royal Ballets, has a noble identity owed to sublime lyric and bravura choreography born of a superb dramatic score. But public appetite for ballet's sacred titles, if not for a ballet's choreography, means that managements know the truth of the dictum 'give them anything, but call it Swan Lake'. Hence NBT's need for those two four-letter words, and the necessity to turn the piece into the brawl that is on view at the Royalty Theatre this week. I sympathise with Gable's belief in dance drama, and in his wish to show audiences that ballet can be directly and vividly communicative. He wins his public with every staging. But I deplore the brutalisation of Swan Lake, its miserable choreographic text by Dennis Wayne, its roller-skating bear, its cohorts of swans who look like the deported drabs in Manon's third act, and its meretricious dramatics. Above all, I despair at its absolute denial of the power of classic academic dancing under the banner of one of classic dancing's greatest achievements. Northern Ballet Theatre is at the Royal Theatre this week with Swan Lake</p>

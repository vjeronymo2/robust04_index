			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Demand on arrears FOLLOWING abolition of the 'earnings rule', my wife applied for state retirement pension in May 1990 backdated to October 2, 1989. The application was accepted and the first payment made at the end of June 1990, including arrears from October 2, 1989. The Inland Revenue demanded payment of tax on the arrears assessing them as 1989/90 income, notwithstanding the fact that the pension was only applied for, and paid during the 1990/91 income tax year. Is this treatment correct? Yes, under section 41(2) of the Finance Act 1989: 'As regards any particular year of assessment, income tax shall be charged on the amount of the pension or other benefit accruing in respect of the year; and this shall apply irrespective of when any amount is actually paid in respect of the pension or other benefit.' No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

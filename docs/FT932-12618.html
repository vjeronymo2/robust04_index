			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Halifax seeks freedom to widen range of products HALIFAX, Britain's largest building society, says it wants to join the Personal Investment Authority, the proposed new self-regulatory body for retail financial services, and to distribute a wider variety of financial products. Mr Jim Birrell, Halifax's chief executive, told the Financial Times that he would like to see a relaxation of the polarisation rules that require financial services outlets either to sell one supplier's products exclusively or to offer the best product of each supplier. Polarisation was introduced under the Financial Services Act to limit some of the most abused sales practices. However, critics of the measure have argued that what is needed is not polarisation but better regulation. Mr Birrell said the PIA was showing signs of becoming an effective regulator. 'We feel encouraged with the way the PIA is shaping up and we thought we should say so,' he said. The future of the PIA has been cloudy because life insurance companies have said they will not join unless leading banks and building societies do, while banks and building societies are insisting that tough rules should be set for independent sales agents. Mr Birrell's remarks thus make the PIA's success more likely. Tied agents such as Halifax do not need to belong to any self-regulatory body. Instead they are regulated indirectly by Lautro, the self-regulatory body for life insurers, which oversees their insurance-company supplier. Participation in self-regulatory bodies should give banks and building societies the influence they deserve to help change the regulatory structure, Mr Birrell said. 'We would like a seat at the table and the ability to influence the discussion,' he added. He made clear that Halifax, which is 'tied' to the life insurer Standard Life, is hoping for regulatory changes that will allow it to offer a far wider range of products. 'If you take the Marks and Spencer analogy, you would deal with a limited number of suppliers for mainline products, but surely they deal with more than one.' Mr Birrell said Halifax had no plans to end its tied relationship with Standard Life. 'But we want to look at our long-term strategy in retail financial services.' Among other things, Halifax would like to see the de-polarisation of certain products, unit trusts in particular, whose pricing structure is more readily apparent to potential customers.</p>

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COCOA prices soared in London as heavy short covering was prompted by sterling's slump. The New York cocoa market was also well ahead by midday on sentiment that International Cocoa Organisation talks in London might result in Russia purchasing the ICCO's 235,000-tonne buffer stock. European bullion prices rose against the background of turmoil in the foreign exchanges. GOLD closed just over Dollars 3 higher at Dollars 349.40 a troy ounce in London. It has now risen almost Dollars 10 this week. With the foreign exchanges expected to remain uncertain and volatile until Sunday's French referendum on Maastricht, bullion's downside appears limited. On Comex the December gold contract had risen above key resistance at Dollars 351 an ounce for the third time by midday. The currency market turmoil led to thin trading on the LME and widely fluctuating base metal prices, dealers said. The currency factor was highlighted by the three-month COPPER price, which at the end of the afternoon kerb showed a Pounds 43 a tonne rise but a Dollars 13 fall from Tuesday. Dealers said the overall strength of the dollar was the main factor discouraging consumer interest. Compiled from Reuters</p>

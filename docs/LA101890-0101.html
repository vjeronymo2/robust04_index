			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCES AN OPINIONATED GUIDE  </P> <P> THURSDAY  </P> <P> Leo Downey (The Ketch, 514 State St., Santa Barbara, 564-3231) Tonight, Leo's  band will be a trio, and find out why he has more female fans than anyone.  </P> <P> Children's Day, Far Cry (The Pub, UCSB, Isla Vista) Is this what education is  all about -- new music at the bar on campus?  </P> <P> FRIDAY  </P> <P> Urban Dread (Charlie's, 362 California St., Ventura, 648-6688) Industrial  strength comes to the beach.  </P> <P> Paul Cotton, Leo Downey (Ventura Theatre, 26 S. Chesnut St., Ventura, 648-1888)  Cotton used to be in Poco; Downey is still from Santa Barbara.  </P> <P> Mojo (Ojai Art Center, 113 S. Montgomery St., 646-0117) This is going to be  some sort of rain dance. Who knows if that'll work, but the hardest-working  blues band from Thousand Oaks will create plenty of their own moisture-sweaty  dancers.  </P> <P> Spencer the Gardener (The Ketch) Santa Barbara pop rock at its finest -- also  the evening's best party. If you're a first-timer, chances are excellent you'll  buy both of Spencer's tapes.  </P> <P> SATURDAY  </P> <P> Leo Downey Band (The Ketch) Doesn't this guy ever stay home?  </P> <P> Modern English (The Pub) English pop rockers still milking their first hit "I  Melt With You." Nothing wrong with that.  </P> <P> SUNDAY  </P> <P> Urban Dread (Eric Ericcson's, Seward and the beach, Ventura, 643-4783) These  reggae rockers are taking their act south, a couple of miles down the beach.  </P> <P> MONDAY  </P> <P> Leo Downey Band (Charlie's) Yup, it's him again. Buy his two CDs -- give this  man a day off.  </P> <P> The Pontiax (Alexander's, 1050 Schooner Drive, Ventura, 658-2000) Perhaps the  best blues band on the West Coast provides the soundtrack for this Blue Monday  presentation.  </P> <P> TUESDAY  </P> <P> Plato's Cat (Charlie's) Feeling philosophical? Like cats? Never mind, it's more  Ventura pop rock.  </P> <P> Oingo Boingo (Santa Barbara County Bowl, 1122 N. Milpas St., 966-2727) Oingo  Boingo brings its quirky rhythms to the tree-lined bowl -- once again, no Tracy  Chapman covers, just plenty of maniacs dancing as if their shoes were on fire.  </P> <P> WEDNESDAY  </P> <P> Michael On Fire (Hungry Hunter, 487 N. Moorpark Road, Thousand Oaks, 497-3925)  Is it folk blues, folk rock or what?  </P> <P> Spencer the Gardener, Nothing (Hornblower's, 1559 Spinnaker Drive, Ventura,  658-2202) A new venue for local bands! Spencer and Brad Nack (the Something of  Nothing) used to be partners in the ultimate Santa Barbara power-pop rock band,  the Tan. So much for history lessons. BILL LOCEY  </P></p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / The European Market: New horizons await fund managers THE draft EC directive published last November on the freedom of management and investment of pension funds could eventually open up great opportunities for European investment fund managers, writes Barry Riley. The directive proposes moderating many of the national restrictions which have often required that funds must be invested in certain ways - for instance, with heavy weightings in government bonds, and with severe limits on foreign exposure. It will also make it possible for portfolio managers to seek pension fund clients freely throughout the EC. Investment firms are not yet notably excited about the prospect of deregulation. Fund managers are well aware that although the investment directive is inching its way through the bureaucratic machinery in Brussels, a more fundamental directive on cross-border membership of pension schemes failed to survive the preliminary negotiation process last year. The conflicts among pension systems in different EC member states have proved too great to handle in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, there are hopes for convergence and harmonisation in the longer term. Last month the French government, previously an ardent exponent of unfunded or pay-as-you-go occupational schemes, which are especially difficult to open up to international membership, unveiled new proposals to develop a more favourable framework for funded schemes in France. These would include both corporate and personal arrangements. Throughout the EC, but especially in France, Italy and Belgium, an impending demographic crisis is focusing minds. In Italy, for instance, the fertility rate is only 1.3 babies per woman, compared with the figure of 2.1 required to maintain the population. If the future working generation is going to be much smaller than the retired generation, the prospects for pay-as-you-go pensions - which effectively are recycled social security contributions - must be poor. So there are increasing pressures to encourage supplementary occupational pension funds - the so-called 'second pillar' of old age provision - and to allow these to be at least partly invested in still expanding economies overseas. Although there are already substantial pension funds in the EC, amounting to more than Ecu700bn (Pounds 500bn), some 86 per cent of the total is accounted for by the UK and the Netherlands. Funds are insignificant in France and Italy, although paradoxically, outside the EC, there are large pension funds in Switzerland. Germany has its own 'book reserve' method of self-investment backed by state guarantees against bankruptcy risks. It was developed because, in the distant past, more conventional funds in Germany were wiped out by inflation. The book reserve system served Germany well in the decades immediately after the war, but it does not allocate capital to where the return is highest in the way that pension funds can when invested through securities markets. On a small scale, Germany has some separately invested pension funds too. Liberalisation of capital movements is a well-established EC theme and is central to the new pension fund investment directive. At the same time, a new prudential code has been drawn up to ensure that pension fund assets are managed in an appropriate way. At present there is a variety of national restrictions. The big Dutch public sector fund ABP can only invest 5 per cent abroad, and German funds just 4 per cent - they are subject to life insurance regulations, with in addition a 20 per cent ceiling on equities. In contrast, in the UK, admittedly with a much more inflationary recent history, many pension funds have a commitment of 80 or 90 per cent to equities, and have achieved much better returns. Government restrictions on investment freedom may have something to do with prudence, but also with the desire to create a captive market for government debt. Similarly, limits on cross-border exposure have been justified by perceived higher risks, for instance of currency fluctuations; but the hidden agenda may be a simple desire to trap portfolio assets within the domestic economy, thus holding down the cost of capital. The EC has been successfully battling against such protectionism for investment by private individuals, but many institutional restrictions remain. For the moment the directive's prudential guidelines are fairly vague: assets shall be invested in a manner 'appropriate to the nature and the duration of the corresponding liabilities'. But funds will be able to hold a minimum of 20 per cent of their portfolios in foreign currency assets, and 40 per cent when their liabilities are linked to future salary levels. Few British pension funds have actually reached this 40 per cent level in practice, although since 1979 they have been free of official restrictions - 25 to 30 per cent is a more common range. Moreover, member states will not be able to stop their pension funds being invested without limit in Ecu-denominated assets because these will be deemed to match any EC currency. This could provide a boost for Ecu bond issues. There is also the possibility that European companies might decide to denominate their share capital in Ecus. But first they would have to be permitted by national legislation to draw up their accounts and pay their taxes in Ecus. Management of such diversified assets will require new skills, and London's global managers in particular will hope to gain from the directive's Article 3, which provides that any pension fund must be permitted to choose a manager established and duly authorised in another member state. But although City of London investment managers may dream of the days when they could be offered global mandates by streams of French, German and Italian pension funds, for a considerable time into the future these pickings will remain almost non-existent.</p>

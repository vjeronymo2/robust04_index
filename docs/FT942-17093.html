			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Turkish package fails to put doubts at rest Moody's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday reacted to Turkey's new austerity package by warning it might lower the country's debt rating further. It currently rates Turkey Ba1, considered a sub-investment grade or 'junk' rating. 'The package is positive,' said Mr Guillermo Estebanez, senior analyst at Moody's. 'The reason for the review is whether it is sufficient and whether it is implementable. It is not too late, but it is well into the crisis.' The decision by Moody's reflected a general uncertainty in international and Turkish markets yesterday over the ability of Mrs Tansu Ciller, the prime minister, to implement the tough package of economic reforms she outlined on Tuesday. While the interbank overnight interest rate, which has been as high as 1,000 per cent in recent weeks, dropped back to 70 per cent yesterday, dealers said they expected the fall to be shortlived. 'We think you will see overnight rates move straight back up to a range of 150 per cent to 170 per cent,' said one trader at a large US bank. The overnight rate ended the day at about 80 per cent. However, dealers were slightly more optimistic on the outlook for the currency, which ended the day at about TL40,000 to the dollar. At the start of the year it was trading at around TL15,000. 'The lira was looking overvalued, but at this level it may have overshot the mark,' said one currency trader. But investors in Turkey's Dollars 8.5bn of foreign bonds are more nervous about the country's ability to service its debt, since recent lira depreciation means Turkey's foreign currency debt has more than doubled. Dealers said Turkey would not be able to return to the international market in the foreseeable future. The austerity package comprises inflationary price rises, including those of petrol and sugar, and longer term structural reforms such as privatisation, much of which has already been announced. But the key to this package is Ms Ciller's commitment to a three-month fiscal target. 'No sensible government is going to commit itself to such a short-term programme if it is not serious. There would just be too much egg on its chin,' says Mr Emre Yigit, head of research at Global securities in Istanbul. Nevertheless, the costs will be impressive. The package calls for the closure of several state companies, including the Karabuk iron and steel works, and says that others, such as the coalmines at Zonguldak and the textile conglomerate Sumer Holding, will close if buyers cannot be found. The privatisation target of Dollars 3.5bn this year seems very ambitious, particularly as economic austerity will hit demand for the output of some companies, such as the Erdemir Iron and Steel works on the Black Sea. The government will struggle to close mines at Zonguldak. They employ 26,000 in a region with little alternative employment and a long history of union militancy. See Feature</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Fashion: Undercover revolutions - Lucia van der Post watches a new world of knickers taking shape SOMETHING strange has been happening to underwear. I knew something was up when it became hard to find a simple pair of white cotton knickers, and when choosing a pair of tights meant embracing a whole new vocabulary. Not that this has all happened overnight, you understand. Having thrown away our suspender belts and wired bras in the 1960s and taken up the new girdleless tights to make our mini-skirts look halfway decent, women at last knew what it felt like to walk about unconstrained. As the cheesecloth shirts and flowery skirts took over from the mini, breasts drooped and bottoms wobbled - but nobody seemed to mind. It was quite a while before any manufacturer dared again to suggest that the female figure in its natural form needed a helping hand. They started innocently enough - adding a little Lycra here and there, transforming tights into the fashion accessory of the age, making cling and fit the watchwords and leaving the wrinkle as obsolete as the horse-drawn carriage. Then along came the cling kings, the Azeddine Alaias and the Donna Karans, with their figure-hugging, curve-revealing, high fashion statements and the power suits adapted to flatter aerobics-honed limbs. What had once wobbled merrily under cheesecloth began to look uncontrolled and - dare one say it - just a little uncouth. Control crept back, clothed in glamour, modernised and lightened by Lycra and newer technology and masquerading under a new word: 'Contouring' - so much more 90s, so much less restricting. But the message was the same: bulges are bad, bulges must be banished. Which is why these days when you walk through Marks &amp; Spencer, or Harvey Nichols, or any other up-to-the-minute underwear or hosiery department, you are spoiled for choice. Simple decisions that used to seem taxing enough - like what colour matches and how sheer should you go - have gone forever. Today diversity is all. Body toners and Body shapers, Control Tights and Thigh Slimmers, Control Briefs and Body Slimmers . . . there isn't a bulge or a blemish that somebody has not catered for. No longer need you sweat and toil in the gym or cut down on calories. As Cathy Volker, vice-president at Hanes, which markets Donna Karan's Body Toner hosiery, puts it: 'It's just 60 seconds to firmer thighs.' First of the new breed was the 'body' - no, not the type associated with the mortician's trolley, but an all-in-one garment which fastens below the crotch, flattening out bulges, giving a smooth line from bust to waist and doing away with what in hosiery-land is called 'the panty line.' Bodies came in all shapes, sizes and colours, plain, matt and serviceable, as well as saucy as any Edwardian teddy. Even though many of us never wore them, they softened us up for the next step - the Slim Slip, brainchild of what was once the oldest, most fuddy-duddy of corsetieres, Rigby &amp; Peller. A combination of knickers, slip and girdle, all wrapped up in one garment that sold for Pounds 26.50, it was a wow - it cut out the fuss and trimmed the line. From then on it was no holds barred. Today, no hosiery department worth its Lycra could keep the tills ringing without a control and contouring selection. This new generation of bulge-beaters looks quite different from the old. Where once you had the girdle - stiff, restricting, boned - today you have what looks more like a pair of tights attached to some support knickers. The knickers come either standard shape (to control the stomach and bottom) or short-line (to control the top of the thigh as well) or long-line (to control further down the leg to mid-thigh). They come with cotton gussets, which means they can be worn without extra knickers, and cost just Pounds 2.99. At M &amp; S the tights part still tends towards the sheer but opaques will appear next autumn. Aristoc's Bodytoners at Pounds 3.99 work on much the same principle - there is a light contouring Lycra top (long-line or short-line, smoothing over stomach, hips and thighs) but the attached tights come sheer, semi-sheer or opaque in all the fashionable colours: plum, mocha, bottle green, as well, of course, as the essential black. Market research is a wonderful thing - how else would we know that London women buy Bodytoners to smooth away their bumps and bulges, while good, practical Yorkshire women buy them because it means they do not have to wear knickers as well? But the trend has only just begun - already a whole raft of new wheezes is in the pipeline. At Marks &amp; Spencer you could move seamlessly from hosiery to underwear and find 'Thighslimmers' - long-line controlling garments in satin and lacy Lycra (Pounds 9.99) as well as a satin boxer short number (Pounds 7.99), all promising to flatten the stomach and upper thigh. You could go for Bodyslimmers at Pounds 25 ('the body for people with less than perfect bodies'), all under-wired with medium-control corsetry fabric and fancy extras such as detachable suspenders and halter-neck bra straps and strapless support. For Pounds 6.99 you could get Second Skin, the M &amp; S version of an up-market, hot-selling light control brief with double front panels that holds the stomach in check (Pounds 6.99), while for Pounds 9.99 there is a sassy suspender belt which seems to perform miracles - it flattens the stomach, slims the hips and holds your stockings up for free. The choice, as you can see, is rich, intricate, bewildering. It's only if you are after a pair of plain white cotton knickers that you may have trouble.</p>

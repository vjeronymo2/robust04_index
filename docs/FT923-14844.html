			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Labour pains from working in a more equal world MR ROSS PEROT has struck a raw nerve. The benefits of free trade in general, and open borders with Mexico and Canada in particular, may have become an accepted part of the economic orthodoxy that both Mr George Bush and Mr Bill Clinton apparently share. But in the minds of many blue-collar Americans, the North American Free Trade Agreement spells lower wages and fewer jobs. Little wonder that Mr Perot's barely concealed protectionism finds a ready constituency. Few economists or policy-makers doubt that the free trade between Mexico and the US will generate more jobs and wealth for both countries. The Washington-based International Institute of Economics calculates that a net 130,000 new jobs will be created. But nor can they ingenuously deny that there will be winners and losers from removing trade barriers; and the losers are likely to be unskilled US workers in relatively low wage occupations. The institute also expects 112,000 US workers to be displaced as US manufacturers move production south of the border where wages are only a fifth of US levels. The experience of the last two decades suggests that the fears of low-wage, low-skill Americans are well-founded. Their opposition to Nafta may be more overt because Mexico is so close to home, but low cost competition from east Asia and Latin America has been eroding the relative wages and employment prospects of poorly educated Americans for years. Nor have these economic forces affected the US alone. Research by Mr Steven Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Business School, shows that wage inequality has grown across the industrialised world over the past two decades. The wages of young, inexperienced and poorly educated workers, particularly men, have fallen relative to better educated, high-skill workers whose jobs are not threatened by cheap, low technology imports. Not every developed country has experienced such a large rise in overall wage inequality. In France, for example, the wages of the bottom 10 per cent of workers have barely changed relative to average French wages. France has not escaped these economic forces, however, merely redirected their effects. The wages of the top 10 per cent of French workers have risen rapidly relative to the average. But the combination of a relatively high minimum wage and unemployment benefits has put a floor to wages at the bottom of the wage distribution. Instead, poorly educated French workers have been progressively priced out of work, leading to persistently high rates of unskilled, youth and female unemployment. Yet on a global scale the consequences of reducing trade barriers are more, not less, egalitarian. As the demand for low-skill labour shifts towards developing countries, so unskilled wages in these countries have been slowly catching up with those in developed countries. Meanwhile, within those developing countries, the effect of free trade has been to reduce wage inequality as the growing demand for manual labour raises the wages of the unskilled workers relative to those of the highly educated elite. The result is that over time, the degree of national wage inequality between developed and developing countries has converged towards a common standard, as the charts show. While this wage convergence is good for poorly paid Mexicans, it is painful for their American counterparts. Protectionist sentiments in Europe have been stifled by the fact that, in most of these countries, the real wages of the lowest paid have continued to rise. But not in America: US average wages have barely changed in real terms for two decades while the real wages of the poorest 10 per cent of US workers have fallen by over 30 per cent since 1970. Little wonder that Mr Perot sees votes to be won through protectionist, America-first rhetoric. 'Cross-Country Patterns of Change in Relative Wages', Macroeconomics Annual, 1992.

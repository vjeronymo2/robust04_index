			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by Hu Deqiao (5170 1795 1564): </F> "Breakthroughs in China's Reform of the Property Rights System"]    [Text] Editor's note: Property rights comprise a key  issue in an economic structure and reform of the property rights  system is a key to the reform of China's economic structure.  This reform covers a wide range of fields and has substantial  contents. Practice over the past 15 years has proved that the  structural reform of property rights. The remarkable results  attained in this reform have played a decisive role in China's  entire economic reform and development and are of a great  significance to China's establishment of a socialist market  economic structure by the end of this century and to bringing  about a sustained, stable, and well-coordinated economic  development. In view of this, we need to make careful studies  and bold explorations to constantly push forward the property  rights structural reform in a planned way and step by step.  Meanwhile, we should also further emancipate our minds,  introduce new concepts, accelerate reforms on both the  government and political structures, and pave the way for the  establishment of a modern property rights system with Chinese  characteristics in line with the market economy of our times.  [end editor's note]    During the past 15 years of reform and opening up, China has  firmly grasped the structural reform of property rights, a key  issue in the economic structural reform, and has boldly carried  out experiments and explorations, bringing significant changes  to the property rights relations. Over the past two years, in  particular, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's important  remarks made during his trip to southern China and the spirit of  both the 14th Party Congress and the Third Plenary Session of  the 14th CPC Central Committee, property rights relations are  entering a new historic phase featuring a brand-new system and  China has property rights reform.  <H5>  Fundamental Changes Have Taken Place in the Traditional </H5> Ownership Pattern and a New Ownership Structure Is Taking Shape  Which Mainly Relies on the Economy of Public Ownership and  Allows Common Development of Diversified Economic Elements    Judging by the proportionate structures of the country's  total industrial value and total retail sales volume, the  proportion occupied by the output value of state-owned  industrial enterprises in the country's total dropped from 77.6  percent in 1978 to 48.3 percent at the end of 1992; while the  proportion of collectively run industrial enterprises went up  from 22.4 to 38.2 percent. Growing out of nothing, other  industrial enterprises, including those which are  foreign-invested, individually run, and privately owned, are now  enjoying an industrial output value which accounts for 13.5  percent of the country's total. Of the total volume of retail  sales, the proportions of the state-owned and collective sectors  dropped from 54.6 and 43.3 percent respectively in 1978 to 41.3  and 27.9 percent in 1992, while the proportion of other economic  elements went up from 2.1 to 30.8 percent. This shows that the  unitary public ownership pattern has been replaced by a  multiownership structure which mainly relies on public  ownership, under which the proportion of public owned economy is  declining while that of the nonpublic owned economies is on a  gradual increase. What is more, the development of the  nonpublic owned economies has been constantly accelerated: In  1992, the added value of state-owned industries, collective  industries, township and town industries, and foreign invested  industries went up by 14.4, 28.5, 40, and 48.8 percent  respectively over the previous year, showing the fact that the  state owned economy is growing at a slower pace than the  collective and other economies. By the end of 1992, the total  number of nonpublic owned enterprises in Guangdong Province had  already reached 1.171 million with a total of 6.343 million  employees and a total registered capital of 264.68 billion yuan.  Nonpublic owned enterprises now account for 52.4 percent of the  total number of enterprises, higher than the total of state  owned and collectively run enterprises (31.2 and 16.4 percent),  resulting in a development trend featuring coexistence and the  common development of economies under diversified ownerships.    Enterprise Experiments With the Joint-Stock System  Are Undergoing Healthy Development    China has strived to create a sound social environment for  experiments with the joint-stock system and the past two years  have witnessed the biggest and fastest development of China's  joint-stock enterprises. As of the end of 1993, there were  already more than 13,000 enterprises in all sectors  experimenting with the joint-stock system, of which 9,440 were  joint-stock enterprises newly established in 1994, registering a  155-percent increase over the previous year. A total of 182  joint-stock companies from over 20 of the country's provinces  and regions have been listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock  exchanges, 106 in Shanghai and 76 in Shenzhen (up by 179 and 130  percent respectively over the previous year), with a total stock  value (A Share) of about 400 billion yuan. By the end of June  last year, China already had over 2,000 companies with specific  fundraising targets, 1,700 of which allowed their workers and  staff to become stockholders with a total share value amounting  to 23.5 billion yuan. The companies with specific fundraising  targets in the five provinces and cities of Guangdong, Liaoning,  Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, account for 36.7 percent of the  country's total, with a total share value of 19.2 percent of the  total. Last year, while actively issuing public shares and  continuing to act as experimental units for B Shares for  overseas investors, nine economically strong state-owned large  enterprises started to raise funds in foreign capital markets.  Of the nine, six have listed in Hong Kong's stock exchange  issuing H Shares, such as the Shanghai Petrochemical Works and  the Qingdao Brewery. Meanwhile, the growth of township and town  joint-stock cooperative enterprises is also gaining momentum.  There were already 100,000 such enterprises across the country  by the end of 1993. In Shanghai, the number of various kinds of  township and town joint-stock cooperative enterprises reached  2,993 at the end of 1993 with 115,000 employees. The total share  value of these enterprises stood at 1.46 billion yuan, of which  shares of united cooperatives totalled 232 million yuan; shares  of legal persons, 240 million yuan; and individual shares, 990  million yuan. Over the past two years, these joint-stock  enterprises have further standardized their activities to  gradually bring themselves in line with normal operation.  <H5>  Introduction of Foreign Funds and Capital Exports Are Under </H5> Expansion    Statistics show that of the 117 countries and regions around  the world which have made investment in China, Hong Kong  accounts for the largest proportion, followed by Taiwan and the  United States. The year 1993 witnessed the biggest amount of  funds China has ever attracted from outside the country. In  1993, the number of newly registered foreign-invested  enterprises stood at nearly 85,000, pushing the total number to  167,500 with a total registered capital of $245.63 billion. In  the same year, 83,265 new foreign-invested enterprises were set  up in China, entailing a total contracted foreign investment of  $110.852 billion and an actual foreign investment input of  $25.759 billion, up by 70.6, 90.7, and 134 percent respectively  over the previous year. By the end of 1993, the accumulated  total amount of newly approved foreign-invested enterprises  exceeded 173,975 with a total contract foreign investment of  $217.216 billion and a total amount of actually used foreign  funds of $56.912 billion. The five special economic zones of  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan have always been  regarded as hot spots for foreign investment. By the end of  1992, the number of foreign-invested projects in these five  zones totalled 15,300, with a total contracted foreign  investment of $22.5 billion and a total amount of actually used  foreign funds of $9.24 billion, accounting for one-sixth,  one-fifth, and one-fourth respectively of the country's total.  At present, China has 121 national-level development zones in  five categories. Of the total, 32 are economic and  technological development zones which have effectively developed  and utilized 145 square km of land to established over 7,000  foreign-invested enterprises, involving contracted foreign  investment of over $14 billion and actually used foreign  investment of over $5.5 billion. Projects which entail an  investment of $100 billion and above now exceed 100.    In the past two years, foreign-invested enterprises have  begun to extend from the coastal areas to inland provinces and  cities as well as the western part of China. Last year,  foreign-invested enterprises in five northwestern provinces and  regions totalled about 3,000, over 10 times as many as at the  beginning of the previous year, pushing up the proportion in the  country's total number of foreign-invested enterprises from 0.6  to 1.6 percent. The five northwestern provinces and regions are  also enjoying an increasingly large amount of contract foreign  investment, which already exceeds $5 billion. Qinghai Province  had only three foreign-invested enterprises in 1991; yet by the  end of last year, the province had over 60 foreign-invested  enterprises, with a total investment amount of more than $860  billion. Beijing also attained remarkable results in  introducing foreign investment last year with 3,752 new  foreign-invested enterprises being set up involving a total  contract investment of $10.39 billion, up by 170 and 430 percent  respectively over the previous year.    China's enterprise investment is directed at areas within  the country as well as other parts of the world. At present,  China is the largest recipient of direct foreign investment and  commercial loans on the one hand, and the largest investment  exporter among developing countries on the other. By the end of  last year, China had invested a total of $5.16 billion in 4,497  enterprises in over 120 countries and regions, of which 2,927  were trading enterprises and 1,570 nontrading enterprises.  Fujian Province has been actively engaged in transnational  cooperative operation. By the end of last year, the province  had set up more than 190 enterprises in over 30 countries and  regions, including North America, Europe, Hong Kong, Macao, and  Japan. Of the total investment of $675.43 billion in the  province, investment made by the Chinese side reached $356.224  billion, accounting for 52 percent of total investment. Last  year, the province received 80 applications for establishment of  enterprises in overseas areas and approval has already been  granted to 40 of them.  <H5>  Operational Patterns of "State-Owned and People-Run" or </H5> "Public- Owned and Private-Run" Enterprises Are Being Adopted By  State-Owned Small Enterprises in an Overall Way    In the past two years, experiments with new operational  patterns of "state-owned and people-run" or "public-owned and  private-run" enterprises, which mainly feature means of lease  and sales, have become a major reform item in state-owned  commercial sectors, supply and marketing cooperatives, and grain  administrations across the country. Enterprises which are  "owned by the state and run by people" occupy a considerable  proportion in provinces as well as prefectures, cities, and  counties in northeastern, northern, northwestern, eastern,  central, and southern parts of China. At present, many  provinces and municipalities have attained remarkable results in  the reform of "public-owned and private-run" enterprises,  including Beijing, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hubei,  Guangdong, and Fujian. Nanjing City has put into practice the  operational pattern of "public ownership and private management"  in 35 percent of its small stores which have an annual sales  volume of less than 2 million yuan; as a result, 80 percent of  them have made up deficits and increased profits and the profits  and taxes submitted by some of them are up by as much as 800  percent. Moreover, most of the staff in these stores have seen a  100 to 200 percent increase in their salaries. This shows that  we need to sum up good experiences, give correct guidance, and  continue to expand experiments in this field.  <H5>  Markets For Property Rights Exchanges Are Being Set Up In </H5> Turn and State-Owned Enterprises Have Taken an Important Step in  Putting "Transformed Enterprises [bian xing 6239 1840]" Up For  Auction and in "Grafting" State-Owned Enterprises Onto Their  Foreign-Invested Counterparts    At present, markets for property rights exchanges of  differing scales have been set up in over 20 cities and  prefectures in many 10 provinces, including Shanxi, Liaoning,  Jilin, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, Sichuan,  Jiangsu, Guangdong, Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian, Wuhan, Nanjing,  Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu, Nanning, Kunming, Wuxi, and  Lanzhou. Henan Province has established more than 20 markets  for property rights exchanges and readjustments of idle assets.  With more then 400 full- and part-time technical personnel  specializing in property rights exchanges, these markets are  enjoying increasingly brisker business and have produced a  positive impact on society. By the end of last October, Jilin  Province had put 436 enterprises up for auction and attracted 35  million yuan (including mergers) from outside the province  through property rights exchange markets. To date, Mudanjiang  City has sold by auction 10 enterprises to South Korea, Hong  Kong, and people from outside the country, retrieving a total of  57.52 million yuan. Last September, Hunan Province held a  property rights exchange fair at which 220 enterprises were put  up for public auction. In the end, 16 enterprises were sold for  a total of 63.7 million yuan, while five were leased for 2.901  million yuan. For example, a Hong Kong company purchased the  Yueyang Chemical Fiber Factory, which had long suffered  operational losses, for 2 million yuan while an individual  businessman purchased one floor of the Yiyang Building for 1.2  million yuan. Most of those who have bought or taken leases on  these enterprises are businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan as  well as domestic private entrepreneurs. Over recent years,  China has also conducted the reform of transforming state-owned  enterprises into collectives through mergers and other forms.  By the end of 1992, 34 collective enterprises in Sichuan  Province had merged 67 state-owned enterprises. Recently, the  Shanghai Hailian Lubrication Material Research Institute, a  small state-owned enterprise, was reorganized into a people-run  collective enterprise under the joint- stock cooperative system.    At the same time, fruitful efforts have also been made in  "grafting" enterprises with foreign investment. In Wuxi City,  more than half (170 enterprises) the large and medium  enterprises have recently "grafted" themselves using foreign  investment. Quanzhou City in Fujian "grafted" all its  state-owned enterprises (41 enterprises) with foreign investment  during the first quarter of last year, putting into practice a  cooperative system in these enterprises.    Growing At a Fast Pace, Individual and Private  Economies Have Become Active Forces in China's Economic  Development    At present, 28 provinces, autonomous regions,  municipalities,  and cities listed as independent units in the state plans have  drawn up policies and measures for the promotion of individual  and private economic development. Moreover, all localities have  gradually standardized their management over individual and  private enterprises, thus bringing about healthy development in  the individual and private economies. The present period is  marked by the fastest development of private enterprises since  registration and a new situation has been opened up wherein, for  the first time ever, no provinces are plagued by declining or  sluggish growth. Currently, the industrial output value, the  total volume of retail sales, and the industrial and commercial  taxes of privately run enterprises make up 4.1, 18.1, and 7.8  percent respectively of the country's total. The industrial  structure of the private economy tends to be more rational. The  proportion of privately run enterprises engaged in tertiary  industries has reached 57.4 percent, of which privately run  scientific and technological consultation enterprises are  enjoying the fastest development. At present, the number of  privately run scientific and technological consultation  enterprises has reached 3,871, registering a 220-percent  increase over the previous year, while the number of private  export-oriented enterprises which earn foreign exchange through  exports totalled 1,996, with a total amount of 1.58 billion yuan  equivalent in foreign exchange. Last year, 98,286 new private  enterprises were set up across the country and, by the end of  last year, the number of private enterprises across the country  had reached 23.18 million, with 3.726 million employees [figures  as published]. The total registered capital of these  enterprises stood at 68.05 billion yuan and the registered  capital per enterprise rose from 159,000 in 1992 to 286,000  yuan, a 79.9-percent increase. In 1993, taxes submitted by  privately run enterprises (including individual industrial and  commercial businesses) exceeded 29 billion yuan, an increase of  over 43 percent compared to the previous year. Guangzhou now  ranks first in the country regarding the number of privately run  enterprises, totaling 48,500 by 1993 since 1988. These  enterprises have a total of 642,000 employees and a total  registered capital of 18.29 billion yuan. Over 100 percent  growth has also been registered in other places, including  Beijing, Hainan, Anhui, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Hubei, Xinjiang,  and Jinagsu.    Individual industrial and commercial sectors have also  undergone rapid development. By the end of September 1993,  China had 17.67 million individual industrial and commercial  businesses, with a total registered capital of 85.48 billion  yuan and 29.39 million persons engaged. Meanwhile, China's  nongovernment-run scientific and technological enterprises have  also displayed their great vigor. According to incomplete  statistics, the number of nongovernmental scientific and  technological enterprises had exceeded 50,000 by the end of  1993, employing 800,000 people, and their total revenue from  technological transformation, industrial production, and trade  amounted to 25 billion yuan.  <H5>  Continued Progress Has Been Attained in Enterprise Merger </H5> and Bankruptcy and Both the Industrial and Organizational  Structures of Enterprises Further Rationalized    1. Benefiting from an early start, enterprise mergers are  enjoying a smooth progress. According to statistics for the  1980's, 6,226 enterprises absorbed through merger a total of  6,906 other enterprises in 25 provinces, municipalities,  autonomous regions as well as 13 independent cities in the state  plan; as a result, the transferred stock assets totalled 8.25  billion yuan and 4,095 loss- making enterprises were closed  down, thus avoiding a further loss of 522 million yuan. The  past two years have seen more noticeable results in enterprise  mergers. By the beginning of last year, as many as 10,000  enterprises had been merged, reducing the number of loss-making  enterprises by a large margin and activating a great amount of  tied-up capital. As of the first half of 1992, 2,288  enterprises had been merged in Sichuan Province, accounting for  1.4 [as published] of the country's total. According to a  survey conducted last April in 16 cities, including Beijing,  Tianjin, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and Shenzhen, over 2,900 enterprises  had been merged; as a result, the transferred stock assets  rights amounted to about 6 billion yuan and more than 400,000  workers and staff were resettled.    2. Enterprise groups and enterprises are undergoing  continued development. By the end of 1993, there were over 1  million groups and companies (centers) across the country,  552,000 more than the previous year, an increase of 113 percent.  Both the number of employees and the amount of registered  capital also went up by 42.6 and 92 percent respectively over  the previous year. Guangdong has the largest number of  companies, totalling 114,000; while Beijing, Shanghai, and  Zhejiang have seen the fastest growth in the number of  companies, which stood at 179, 170, and 168 percent  respectively. Of the 55 large enterprise groups selected as  experimental units by the state, 26 have been listed as  independent units in the state plan, 18 have set up subsidiary  financial companies, and 34 have been granted examination and  approval autonomy on foreign-related projects. Meanwhile,  readjustments have been made to the management structure and the  operational mechanism of over 1,600 enterprise groups, of which  431 have taken initial shape, thus optimizing the personnel,  assets, and organizational structures of these enterprises.    3. A number of enterprises have been eliminated through  market competition and have declared bankruptcy according to the  law. From the promulgation of the "Bankruptcy Law" in 1988 till  the first half of 1993, 356 enterprises went into liquidation  according to the law as a result of poor management and long-  standing financial losses, of which 88 were owned by the state  and 268 by collectives or other sectors. Shenyang was the first  city in the country to introduce bankruptcy. On 3 December  1986, the Shenyang City Government declared the bankruptcy of a  small crackproof materials factory in Shenyang, the first  bankrupt enterprise ever in mainland China. As of the end of  1992, 28 insolvent enterprises in Shenyang had gone broke (two  of which were enterprises under public ownership). Of the 8,591  workers and staff involved, 4,294 were given new jobs following  the transfer of enterprise assets and 121 lived on pension while  awaiting employment. Total external debts of 75.4 million yuan  were paid off, thus bringing life and economic efficiency back  to 11.1 million yuan worth of fixed assets as well as sites  covering a total area of over 12,000 square meters [figures as  published]. With 2,914 workers and staff, and 1,200 sets of  equipment of various kinds, the Chongqing Knitting Mill, which  covers a total ground area of over 11,000 square meters, has an  annual production capacity of 16 million knitted pieces and 8  million tonne of processed chemical fiber. However, due to its  poor management, long-standing debts, and insolvency, the  factory had no alternative but to submit an application for  bankruptcy to the court on 8 June 1992. On 3 November 1992, the  Chongqing City Intermediate Court handed down the ruling, upon  which the Chongqing Knitting Mill was declared bankrupt.  Because it is the first time a large state-owned industrial  enterprise has ever gone broke in the country, the event has  sent shock waves through the entire society and has become the  focus of attention of all sides. In the end, through the  technical work on all sides, proper arrangements were made on  the issue.  <H5>  Rural Enterprises Under the Joint-Stock Cooperative System </H5> Have Become Another Creation By the Masses of Peasants    Statistics show that the output value created by 112 million  workers and staff of township and town enterprises across the  country reached 2.9 trillion yuan, up by 60 percent over the  previous year and accounting for 45 percent of the country's  total purchase volume of export commodities produced by  foreign-invested businesses.    By the end of 1993, the number of rural joint-stock  cooperative enterprises had soared to 2.08 million, accounting  for 10 percent of China's total number of township and town  enterprises. Last year, leaders of over 20 provinces and  municipalities, including Beijing, Henan, Sichuan, and Anhui,  all stressed the need to regard the establishment of joint-stock  cooperative enterprises as a key issue in the future efforts to  deepen rural reform. They also urged all rural enterprises,  newly established or transformed, to try hard to turn themselves  into joint-stock cooperative enterprises. At present, Henan  Province has more than 15,000 newly established or transformed  joint-stock cooperative enterprises. In the rural areas of  Shandong Province, in order to expand their business scale and  enhance economic efficiency, some owners of individual and  private businesses have introduced the joint-stock cooperative  operation by converting factory buildings, capital,  technologies, and equipment into shares. As one of the  birthplaces of China's rural joint-stock cooperative economy,  Zhejiang Province has been enjoying a strong development  momentum for all these years. As of last August, there were as  many as over 60,000 rural joint-stock cooperative enterprises  across the province, of which 50,000 had evolved from individual  and private businesses, 800 transformed from rural collective  enterprises, and 10,000 engaged in other economic fields.    Wenzhou City, a well-known experimental field for China's  reforms, has seen an even faster growth of enterprises under the  joint-stock cooperative system. By the end of last September,  the number of joint-stock cooperative enterprises in the city  went up dramatically from 24,000 in the previous year to more  than 34,000, of which 21,000 were joint-stock industrial  enterprises with a total output value of 12 billion yuan and  accounting for 50 percent of the city's total industrial output  value. Taxes submitted by joint- stock cooperative enterprises  amounted to over 500 million yuan, making up 45 percent of the  city's total financial revenue. Today, the joint-stock  cooperative economy and individual and private economies account  for 70 percent of Wenzhou's national economy; therefore, they  are regarded as the foundation of Wenzhou's market economy.    At present, reforms on the housing and land use systems are  being carried out in depth and real estate management is being  gradually brought onto the right track. Remarkable results have  been registered in the appraisal of fixed assets and circulating  funds, aimed at serving the structural reform of property  rights. Experiments in reforms on the management system and  administrative structure of state-owned assets have attained  further progress and laws and regulations favorable to the  property rights structural reform are being constantly  reinforced.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Hyderabad, March 22 (UNI)--The National Executive of  the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday asked the Union  Government to treat Pakistan as a terrorist State and warned  that its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which was the "real  super-government of Pakistan," was now concentrating on south  India after having spread its tentacles to the North-East.    In its resolution on the "Threat to national security,"  released at the concluding day of its three-day session here,  the Executive cautioned that Hyderabad, Bangalore, Cochin,  Kozhikode, Bhatkal and Gulbarga in the south had currently  become major centres of ISI subversive activities.    Pointing out that six tonnes of the deadly RDX  [Cyclotrimethylene Trinitramine] explosive was seized in  Coimbatore, the Executive said "at this rate, Pakistan could  land a tonne even of fissionable material to let off a nuclear  explosion on our soil. It alleged that the ISI had a nexus with  the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Tamil Nadu, with  the small fishing village of Kyalapatinam serving as the `nerve  centre.' There were reports that mysterious STD [Subscriber  Trunk Dialing (telephone)] calls, whose bill came up to Rs one  lakh in the day, it said. Expressing concern at the increasing  subversive activities of the ISI in Kerala, the Executive  charged the Chief Minister, Mr K. Karunakaran, and the main  Opposition (CPI-M [Communist Party of India-Marxist]) with  soft-pedalling on the issue.    The Executive criticised the Union Government for its  `inaction' for protecting criminals and for its failure to  punish even one conspirator in the Bombay and Delhi bomb blasts  it also charged the ruling CPI-M Government in West Bengal with  protecting the man behind the Calcutta explosion and the main  Opposition Telugu Desam and the Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul Musleemeen  (MIM) in Andhra Pradesh with protecting anti-national elements  for electoral reasons.    In an overview of the security threat, the executive pointed  out that the ISI activities continued uninterrupted despite  changes in the government. They set Punjab on fire, but normalcy  was fast returning in the border State. However, it was not so  in Jammu and Kashmir, it bemoaned.    "Specifically, Pakistan is behaving like a terrorist State  and we should treat it as such, and not deal with it as if  everything is normal." The ISI, with its local agents and  foreign patrons, was today the principal subversive in India.  "What, however, is extremely disturbing is the wholly  condemnable inaction of the Union Government in the face of  ISI's deliberate and continued acts of subversions," it said.    Calling upon the Union Government to shed its weakness of  will, give up its defensive postures and take effective steps,  the meeting said the menacing threats to national security could  not be met with `kid gloves.' The Executive said 15 million  Bangladeshis had spread themselves far and wide in India and  lakhs of Pakistanis visiting India on tourist visas never went  back. The situation in Hyderabad was "explosive" with 20,000  Pakistanis living illegally in the city, it added.    Alleging that the Hizbul Mujahideen, a Pakistan-based  militant wing operating in Kashmir, was "thick as thieves" with  the MIM in Andhra Pradesh, the resolution said unemployed youths  were being recruited for training in subversion and sabotage.  Already, three Sangh Pariwar men had lost their lives at the  hands of these anti-national elements, it said.    The National Executive noted with "extreme concern" the  lists  of subversive acts in Kerala.    Mysterious land deals amounting to crores of rupees "even by  indigent persons," have been reported from Kozhikode and the  Kozhikode airport of Karipur, which is in Mallapuram district,  had become a "hot bed" of ISI activity. Even the government had  "admitted" sighting unidentified vessels off the Kerala coast  near Tirur in Mallapuram.    On the disappearance of Chekannur Moulvi who had raised his  voice against communalism and fundamentalism, the resolution  said he was abducted months ago and was presumed to be dead. But  the government did not hand over the case to the CBI [Central  Bureau of Investigation] inspite of Moulvi's wife's appeal.    The Executive expressed amazement at the Kerala Chief  Minister, Mr Karunakaran, contradicting the Union Home  Minister's statement the very next day after Mr Chavan had  admitted in Thiruvananthapuram in the first week of February  last that ISI was active in Kerala and the Union Government was  aware of it.    Mr Karunakaran, just to save his coalition with Muslim  League, came out with the statement and the CPI-M, the main  opposition party maintained a "guilty silence" on the matter  with "hopes of capturing the communal vote bank," it alleged.    On the Andhra Pradesh issue, the National Executive  suggested  constitution of a high-level body like the special investigation  team (SIT) with Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) assistance  to look into the anti-national and ISI operations in the State.  It suggested taking into custody of communal outfits having  interlinks with Pakistan and a careful watch on passengers from  Kashmir, Nepal and Bangladesh.</p>

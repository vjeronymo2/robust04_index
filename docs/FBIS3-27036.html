According to the principle of  being younger in average age, Jiang Zemin has continued to  establish his influence in the Army, while the influence of "the  Yangs" [Yang Shangkun, former President and formerly permanent  vice chairman and secretary general of the CPC Central Military  Commission; and his half-brother, Yang Baibing, former director  of the PLA General Political Department and former member of the  PRC Central Military Commission], and of those soldiers who rose  in the wake of the "4 June" incident has weakened further. The  most important cause lies in ensuring that the leading body,  with Jiang Zemin as the core, promptly obtains the military's  support after Deng Xiaoping. At the same time, the transfer of  military brass will be conducive to cooperation among various  military regions. This point finds obvious expression in the  transfers of personnel in the Nanjing and Guangzhou Military  Regions, which have been the main force aimed at Taiwan.    The journal ZHONGGUO JUSHI indicated that three wide-scale  transfers of military brass already have taken place since the  "4 June" incident in 1989. With the development of military  strength, and with China's superem leader Deng Xiaoping -- who  is nearly 90 -- having one foot in the grave, the hidden  political motive in these transfers of military brass is worth  studying. The current personnel reshuffle involves the Central  Military Commission organizations and all major military  regions. The outside world believes that compared with his  predecessors -- Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang -- Jiang Zemin has  less military background, but when Jiang Zemin acquired the  legally constituted authority of the Central Military  Commission, he stepped up the establishment and expandsion of  his influence, with the backing of Deng Xiaoping. Viewing the  present conditions, we find that his relations with the military  have gone far beyond the imagination of the outside world.    As for the three rounds of military brass transfers since  the  "4 June" incident, the first round was conducted exclusively by  Yang Shangkun and Yang Baibing, and Jiang Zemin basically had no  say in it. When the "14th party congress" was in session, "the  Yangs" were defeated by the joint forces of Jiang Zemin, Li  Peng, and other military brass. In the wake of the congress,  Jiang Zemin seized the opportunity to conduct the most  wide-ranging military reshuffle since the PRC's founding, with  focus on purging the forces of "the Yangs." In the latest round  of reshuffling, Jiang Zemin was playing the card of "being  younger in average age, and more professional," and a number of  the military brass who had solid and extensive personnel  networks were removed from office on the grounds of "exceeding  the retirement age." Included in this category were Song Keda,  political commissar of the Shenyang Military Region, and Wang  Chengbin, commander of the Beijing Military Region -- both of  whom were 66 years old; and Liu Anyuan, political commissar of  the Nanjing Military Region, and Li Lun, deputy director of the  General Logistics Department, both of whom were 67 years old.  However, they were invited to be advisers to their original  units, and their hidden influence should not be overlooked. At  the same time, a number of military brass who had been promoted  for suppressing the 1989 students' movement were demoted. This  category included Commander Wang Cheng, Deputy Commander Zou  Yuqi, and Political Commissar Zhang Gong -- all of the Beijing  Military Region. They all were the major military brass who  suppressed the 1989 students' movement. At that time, Wang  Chengbin was the deputy commander of the Nanjing Military Region  who led troops to Beijing to participate in the suppression, Zou  Yuqi was the chief of staff of the troops that enforced martial  law, Zhang Gong was director of the Beijing Military Region's  Political Department and the man of the day in the "4 June"  incident. Now one of them has retired, another has been  transferred to the border areas, and the whereabouts of the  third are unknown. In view of the fact that there is no end to  the talk that "the Yangs" could stage a comeback after Deng,  Jiang Zemin has spared no effort in completely uprooting the  Yangs' influence. At the same time, he has removed from  important posts all those people who were involved in the "4  June" incident, an act that should contribute to easing people's  grievances against the CPC.    The traditional view is that the aim of the CPC's  transferring the military brass lies in reducing their  influence, so as to make effective control over the military  possible. Some people believe that this transfer of the  military brass will bring about a situation in which "commanders  are unfamiliar with the troops, and vice versa." However,  ZHONGGUO JUSHI believes that a motive that has been neglected is  the promotion of cooperation among the military regions and  various service arms, so these transfers may be a means of  "killing two birds with one stone." The military brass promoted  during the current reshuffle included Li Laizhu, the newly  appointed commander of the Beijing Military Region. The rest  mostly were transferred from other military regions. There was a  high frequency of exchanging commanders between military  regions. For example, Lieutenant General Gu Hui, of the Nanjing  Military Region, served in the Guangzhou Military Region for  almost 40 years before his recent transfer. Both Liu Yuanan,  former political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region, and  Fang Zhuqi, the region's newly appointed political commissar,  used to serve in the Guangzhou Military Region. Lieutenant  General Qu Zhenmao, deputy commander of the Nanjing Military  Region and concurrently commander of the Donghai Fleet, used to  be deputy commander of the Nanhai Fleet under the Guangzhou  Military Region. Lieutenant General Shi Yuxiao, political  commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region, used to be political  commissar of the Nanjing Military Region.    It should be noted that newly appointed Beijing Garrison  Commander He Daoquan used to be commander of the the 23d Group  Army stationed in Heilongjiang; he was the first officer in the  field troops to set up an automation system and was trained at  the PLA's National Defense University. The Beijing Garrison is  in charge of defending the CPC central organizations. In  principle, its commander should be nominated directly by the PLA  chief of general staff; nevertheless, its commander has been  changed three times since the "4 June" incident.    Another new phenomenon to be explored and studied in the  recent transfer of military brass is that both Li Xinliang, the  newly appointed political commissar of the Shenyang Military  Region, and Zhang Zhijiang, political commissar of the Chengdu  Military Region have no background in political work, but are  professional soldiers. If this is no coincidence, it may mark  the beginning of a trend of depoliticization of the Army.</p>

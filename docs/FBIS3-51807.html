Support for the Cuban Revolution was expressed  by numerous representatives of national liberation movements,  union and cultural organizations, and participants in the Fourth  Latin American and Caribbean Meeting that begins tomorrow at the  Convention Center.    AALAPSO Secretary General Rene Anillo Capote gave the first  of the speeches at this ceremony for solidarity with Cuba, which  was presided over by Jaime Crombet, vice president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government. This open forum  for solidarity with Cuba denounced U.S. imperialism's unchanging  and systematically aggressive policy against our country, and  the criminal economic and financial blockade.</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Airtours expands by 66% - Scandinavian Leisure acquisition helps boost profits to Pounds 76m The acquisition of Scandinavian Leisure Group last April helped Airtours to boost profits by 66 per cent and sales by almost the same amount. The total dividend is being raised by 36 per cent. Airtours, which is turning itself into a vertically integrated holiday company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 75.8m on sales of Pounds 971.7m for the year to end September. This compares with a previous Pounds 45.5m, struck after a Pounds 9m charge for its abortive bid for Owners Abroad Group, on sales of Pounds 615.5m. 'We think they are superb results,' Mr David Crosland, chairman said, pointing out that the group had delivered uninterrupted growth in profits, earnings and dividends since coming to the stock market in 1987. The shares closed yesterday at 442p, down 2p. After a successful summer season SLG, bought for Pounds 80m, contributed Pounds 13.7m to pre-tax profits - well ahead of expectations. The acquisition, which also brought in Pounds 151.4m of turnover, serves markets using the same destinations as the UK operation. The group is putting together the offices of the Scandinavian and English tour operations in overseas resorts, reducing the overall number by about half to 50. Mr Crosland said the group would benefit from the increased buying power for transfers and excursions, for which it would have 3.5m coach passengers. While the tour operating business has a 21 per cent market share, its High Street chain, Going Places, has a market share of 14 per cent. Mr Crosland said he wanted to move the retail chain's market share closer to the tour operating level. On the downside, the group said that warm weather in the UK in August had cut demand for some holidays, while the emergence of some northern European countries from recession had put upward pressure on hotel bed prices. However, winter bookings were almost 27 per cent ahead, and 1995 early summer bookings were 13 per cent ahead. In addition the group has moved into the fly-cruise market, with a 94 per cent take-up for next year already on the first boat. Fully diluted earnings per share were 44.37p (27.29p). The board is proposing a final dividend of 10.9p (7.83p), taking the total for the year to 12p (8.81p). COMMENT The figures were up to best expectations, although flattered by the Scandinavian arm, which made the UK seem a shade disappointing. The group is clever at marketing, and runs its tour operations and retail outlets efficiently. It has grown at a terrific pace and has grasped the right opportunities. Estimated profits this year of just below Pounds 90m put it on a prospective multiple of 9. At first sight this looks grudging, especially if you believe the move to vertical integration in the holiday business will raise the cost of entry. However, investors will have at the back of their minds the recurrent upheavals in the industry. At the same time growth rate is likely to slow down.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Top chip makers in Europe discuss closer research link EUROPE'S three largest semiconductor makers - Siemens of Germany, Philips of the Netherlands and SGS-Thomson, the Italian/French group - are talking about closer collaboration, including the possible joint financing of a research centre in Grenoble. The talks follow a call earlier in the week by Mr Pasquale Pistorio, president of SGS-Thomson, for the creation of at least one world-scale producer out of the three major semiconductor makers, all of which make losses. European chip executives say a merger of the three has not yet been discussed in any depth. SGS-Thomson talked to Siemens last year about merging their semiconductor activities but the German company rejected the idea. The three companies are talking, however, about collaborative research which would go beyond the work being done by the Joint European Submicron Silicon (Jessi) initiative. Jessi, Europe's largest semiconductor programme, attempts to strengthen European chip-making skills rather than producing products. The three companies are discussing joint research which would result in new semiconductor products, either through a widening of Jessi's brief or by setting up a new programme. Among the ideas being looked at is the joint financing by the three of a common research centre in Grenoble. SGS-Thomson makes chips in Grenoble. Mr Pistorio said at a conference in Brussels last Tuesday that the Ecu3.8bn (Pounds 2.62bn) that Jessi planned to spend on semiconductor research in the 1990s was 'inadequate in size and spread over too many players'. Mr Pistorio said it would cost double this 'to build a viable European world challenger' by the end of the decade. Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the EC research commissioner, agreed with Mr Pistorio that 'the time has come to reach a critical mass' in European semiconductor production. Their comments follow a meeting last weekend in France between EC officials, including Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, and European electronics executives. The industrialists called for measures to assist the industry beyond a plan presented by Brussels last month to channel more research money into demand-creating infrastructure projects. The competition directorate of Sir Leon Brittan, who did not attend last weekend's meeting in France, has said it will scrutinise any plan by the semiconductor makers to develop their joint research beyond Jessi. A key factor in assessing the competitive impact of any European restructuring will be the openness of the EC market to imports from outside. At present, the EC charges 14 per cent import duties on imports of semiconductors, compared to 4.9 per cent on the finished products incorporating them.</p>

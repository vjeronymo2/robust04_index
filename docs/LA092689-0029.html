			<p><P> September 26, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: DANCE  </P> <P> The Paris Opera Ballet is limbering up for this year's season without artistic  director and sometime dancer, Rudolf Nureyev, who has refused to return from  the United States until a contract dispute is settled. A spokesman for the  company said Monday the 51-year-old Russian-born dancer's five-year contract as  the ballet's artistic director ended in August and attempts to sign him on for  a further three years had been fruitless. The dispute centers on a demand by  the French authorities that Nureyev spend at least six months a year working  for the Paris ballet.Claudia Puig  </P></p>

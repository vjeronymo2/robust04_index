			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A Minneapolis judge refused to move the wife of spy Jonathan Pollard from a  federal prison hospital where she says she is isolated and mistreated. U.S.  District Judge Harry MacLaughlin ordered that Anne Henderson Pollard, 28,  remain at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn., and he denied an  independent medical review. Anne Pollard had sued to be moved back to a federal  prison in Danbury, Conn. She said the hospital, where she was sent for a  gastrointestinal disorder and other conditions, was making her worse because  she is the only woman there, the staff hates her and she was put under 24-hour  surveillance. Jonathan Pollard, 34, was sentenced in 1987 to a life term for  supplying classified documents to Israeli agents. Anne Pollard was given a  five-year term on charges including being an accessory after the fact.  </P></p>

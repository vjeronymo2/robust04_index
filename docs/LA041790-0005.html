			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GASOLINE TAX  </P> <P> Everyone wants to tax gasoline, state and federal. What happened to the 5 cents  a gallon the Reagan Administration nailed on us?  </P> <P> In all my travels, I haven't seen any bridges being repaired and now they want  more. Where do all the registration fees go? California's is probably the  highest in the nation. There should be gold flakes on the highways.  </P> <P> People should elect some accountants instead of all lawyers, or one of these  days some foreign country will buy the United States in bankruptcy court.  </P> <P> CARL MULSON  </P> <P> Lake Isabella  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Moscow ITAR-TASS in English at 1845 GMT on 7 May transmits </F> a service message killing this item]    [Text] Moscow May 7 TASS -- Following is the full text of  Russian President Boris Yeltsin's address to the United Nations  organisation in connection with the 50th anniversary of the end  of the World War II.    "On 8-9 May, 1995 the whole mankind will celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the end of the World War II. The defeat of  fascism meant a great victory of good forces over evil forces.  But we paid a dear price for it. The war claimed over 50  million human lives. Hundreds of thousands of towns and villages  were razed to the ground. Hundreds of millions of people were  left without a shelter and means to live on.    "There is not one family in Russia which would not be  touched  by the fire of that war. Our pain and sorrow will never abate,  the grief of soldiers' widows will never be soothed. The  tragedy of war and the happiness of victory will live in  people's memory for ever.    "The importance of the great victory won by joint efforts of  the people of various countries cannot be tarnished even by  time. One of its main lessons -- in order to defend peace, all  peace-loving forces must act jointly, concertedly and actively.  It is important especially now because a possibility of armed  confrontation between countries still exists, blood continues to  flow in civil, inter-ethnic and local conflict and the danger of  the spread of weapons of mass destruction is growing.    "Russia believes it is in the interests of mankind to  actively help step up the role and increase the effectiveness of  the United Nations -- as a pivotal element of the system of  collective security -- in pursuing the lofty goal proclaimed in  its charter -- `to save the succeeding generations from the  scourge of war.'    "Our people who bore the main burden of the World War Two  and  sacrificed dozens of millions of their sons and daughters to the  alter of victory have been consistently opposing the settlement  of disputes by force. It is our conviction that there are no  such goals which could justify the unleashing of a war. The  preservation of peace is the supreme goal of our state.    "The Russian Federation calls on other countries -- members  of the United Nations organisation, their parliaments and  governments to do their best to stop the current armed conflicts  and prevent new ones.    "In memory of millions of people who perished in the fire of  the World War Two we propose to hold, under the aegis of the  United Nations organisation, broad and solemn celebrations of  the 50th anniversary of the victory over the Nazi and declare  1995 the `year of memory of the victims of the World War Two.'  We believe it expedient that the United Nations organisation  address all nations of the world, their parliaments and  governments with a call to declare 8-9 May, 1995 days without  shooting.    "Let the 50th anniversary of great victory give a new  powerful impetus to the preservation and safeguarding of peace.  Mankind must finish the 20th century and enter a new one with  confidence in the future."</p>

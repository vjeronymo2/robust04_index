He said that the partnership should be based on cooperation  within the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe  (CSCE), adding that the CSCE should become an efficient  political organization.    Under the partnership, Kozyrev said in the southern Polish  city of Krakow, Russia and its western partners will ensure the  security of central and Eastern European nations.    As to the application of the VISEGRAD group (Poland, the  Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia) to join the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), he noted that this could  result in new political demarcations if NATO accepts the four  countries, adding that this action could isolate Russia.</p>

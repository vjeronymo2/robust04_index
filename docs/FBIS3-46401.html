Should that remedy fail, the party  will support what is on offer.    Far from vacillating on the reform proposals, the party has  arrived at its definitive decision through consultation as its  members require of their leaders and as it is consistent with  our political creed.    To reiterate for emphasis, let me say, the Party is seeking  to separate the bill's provisions so that any reference to a one  seat, one vote arrangement is confined to all the elected  assemblies, other than the Legislative Council. This seems to  be the only hope of keeping the doors to British and Chinese  negotiations ajar.    Our members support lowering the voting age to 18 and  allowing National People's Congress delegates to contest local  elections.    Most of us have no quibbles with any specific point in the  partial bill which is supposed to cover the least contentious  aspects of the reform proposals as introduced by the Governor in  October 1992.    What we oppose is any attempt to divide the community, the  sabotage of British and Chinese cooperation, and turning our  backs on 10 years of confidence-building in Hong Kong.    I am not crying wolf when I say there are groups and  individuals in our midst who are agitating for confusion in Hong  Kong and for a showdown between Britain and China.    What the Liberal Party and its friends must guard against is  any attempt to undermine Hong Kong and its institutions.    Any reform must help our community through to 1997 and  beyond  rather than be an excuse for someone to usurp power, incite  trouble, and another to claim dubious glory. The changes also,  must serve a better end than the rewriting of electoral rules to  spite the future sovereign.    Many have praised the architect of the reforms for his  sincerity (just as many have done the opposite). But the world,  as most of us can see, is strewn with the rubble of noble  intentions.    Over the past year, since the reform proposals were  introduced, I have seen with dismay deliberate distortions of  words and meanings in a raging propaganda war in Hong Kong.    A Democrat nowadays urges the Governor to exercise his  autocratic powers by disbanding the legislature if it voted  against the reforms. Another equal rights advocate demands that  retired civil servants be banned from private employment. A  self-professed defender of Hong Kong interests is out and about  worsening the dispute between Britain and China that will  cost--and is costing-- Hong Kong. Tactics are now confused with  principles which are these days treated as a commodity.    I know many in our society are not apathetic but are wary of  politicians seen by them to be too suave and conniving. They  have reason for their suspicion for, whenever they analyse the  slogans and study the gestures, they find these statements empty  and the baby-kissing routine boring. The public cannot be  fooled all the time.    The Liberal Party could be posturing too and taking radical  positions which always attract an audience. Pleading for talks,  reconciliation and reason is never as easy to stumping for the  opposite.    When weighing the merits of issues on logic, the politician  has to become a statistician, an administrator, a doer and not  an actor. The price of prudence is reservation.    How much simpler it would be to react on impulse, to be  fanatical, self-righteous and be ready to blame someone else for  failures. Doing so, however, would for me be an abdication of  responsibility.    We must act carefully because the consequences of mistakes  are so serious.    Now that the reforms have been thrust upon Hong Kong, the  public has to treat the subject with calmness and a measure of  skepticism.    The passion the community feels and the Liberal Party shares  is for a better Hong Kong where the people can live in safety,  stability and harmony with the future sovereign.    I find it deeply ironic that 10 years ago, we of Hong Kong  were told by Britain to trust and work with the mainland  Chinese--when we had few reasons to do so. Now, with so much  contact, business in both directions, and travel also in both  directions, we are suddenly asked by Whitehall and the Governor  to resist and suspect people north of the Shenzhen River. How  is that for confusion, cynicism or callousness?</p>

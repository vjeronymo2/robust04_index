			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Palestinian negotiator Dr. Sa'ib </F> 'Urayqat by Sa'id Mu'addi on 31 March, place not given; from the  "With the Events" program; --recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, at last an agreement  on security arrangements in Hebron was signed in Cairo today.  Do you believe that these arrangements ensure the security of  the Palestinians in Hebron?    ['Urayqat] In fact, there are causes for the problem in  Hebron. The root of the problem is the existence of settlers in  the heart of the city of Hebron. I fear that without the  evacuation of the settlement hotbeds from the heart of Hebron,  the problem will remain and could explode despite any measures.    [Mu'addi] Will the arrival of international observers from  Norway, Belgium, and Italy ease friction between the settlers  and Arab residents in Hebron?    ['Urayqat] The question is not one of easing anyone's  worries. The question is one of finding a fundamental solution  to this issue. This would be achieved by tackling its roots.  First, the root of the problem is the presence of settlers.  Settlers must be evacuated from Hebron. Second, there are  questions that must be addressed, such as what authority these  international forces will come under, what their jurisdiction  will be, what their responsibilities will be, until when will  they submit their reports, and how will they implement their  measures and orders. In fact, we do not know the details of all  these matters. However, the problem will remain as long as the  settlement hotbeds exist in Hebron or anywhere else.    [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Urayqat, will signing the agreement on  arrangements in Hebron help complete the measures regarding the  Gaza-Jericho plan?    ['Urayqat] We have always emphasized that the negotiations  are not an end in themselves. After the Hebron massacre, unless  the settlement subject is placed at the top of the agenda, it is  unreasonable to expect any negotiations to lead to the hoped-for  just, comprehensive, durable peace, a peace based on Resolution  242. I fear that unless the main problem, represented by  settlement activity, is resolved, the arrangements that have  been agreed upon may lead to further future complications.    [Mu'addi] Dr. 'Urayqat, concerning the bilateral  negotiations, has the Palestinian side received an invitation to  go to Washington next month?    ['Urayqat] No. The Palestinian side has not received any  invitations. The negotiations which took place in Tunis and  Cairo dealt with providing protection for the Palestinian people  in accordance with Resolution 904. However, it seems that the  basic issue and the root of the problem, which is the settlement  existence, has not been tackled. This will have negative  consequences in the future.    [Mu'addi] Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, thank you very much.    ['Urayqat] Thank you.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (15): Doing without a compromise  -Docking stations and the alternatives Mobile computing usually involves compromise. Either you sacrifice some of the features of your desktop PC or you buy a large portable computer so heavy that you need a Sherpa to carry it. Such computers are euphemistically known as transportables - computer speak for hard to transport. Not surprisingly, the market for transportables is dwindling. Market researchers Dataquest say that in 1991 and 1992, 8,000 transportables were sold a year in Europe compared with about 6,000 in 1993. Mr Christopher Fell, associate director of Dataquest's European PC group, says that only a few suppliers still make transportables (including IBM and Compaq) and the machines are used mainly for very power-intensive scientific, technical or financial applications which involve number-crunching or high-resolution graphics. Docking stations. Most users do not need this level of power when they are on the move. But they do need extra features when they are in the office (such as large screens or links to printers and networks). One solution which involves very little compromise is to use a notebook computer in conjunction with a 'docking station'. This looks like a central processing unit for a standard desktop PC but contains a slot into which you insert your portable. Mr Lewis Schrock, PC group manager at Compaq UK, says: 'Using a docking station is as easy as slotting a videocassette into a VCR. Slide in the notebook and it works. There are no cables to connect.' The docking station is plugged into the office power supply and computer network, so the notebook becomes in effect a desktop PC. Docking stations are available from most major PC suppliers including Apple, IBM, Toshiba and Compaq. They have a number of advantages: Convenience. Files do not have to be copied from portable to desktop machine using disks (which may be of different sizes or densities) or communications cables. They are stored on the notebook computer's hard disk and can be accessed on the move or when the notebook is in the docking station. Similarly, applications software such as word processing does not have to be copied onto two PCs. Features. Large colour displays and full-size keyboards can be permanently attached to most docking stations (a few models restrict the user to the notebook's own keyboard and screen). Docking stations also have built-in expansion slots and extra ports to give easy access to the company network and to peripherals such as a CD-ROM drive and a printer. And they can provide extra storage. Ease of use. The docking station is an easy way of adding capabilities to a notebook PC when it is used in the office. Alternative methods often involve connecting lots of cables and reconfiguring system files every time you return from a business trip. But docking stations also have a major drawback: cost. A docking station from Compaq has a recommended retail price of Pounds 420, while full-size monitors and keyboards are extra. This means that you need to spend an extra Pounds 500 to Pounds 600 to turn your notebook into a fully-fledged desktop PC. Docking stations are usually designed to work with notebooks sold by the same supplier and the full kit (notebook plus docking station, keyboard etc.) could cost anything from Pounds 2,300 to Pounds 4,500. This may be more expensive than two desktop PCs (one for home, one for the office), but it can be cheaper than buying a notebook and a desktop for each mobile user. Mr Stanley Monger-Godfrey, information technology director at P&amp;O Properties, says the docking station approach will enable the company to equip far more of its staff with portable machines. Cheaper options. For those who find docking stations too expensive, there are several alternatives. For example, several users who are out of the office a lot can share a docking station when they need access to printers and network. It is also possible to buy slimmed-down docking stations. These are available from a number of suppliers including Olivetti, NEC, Compaq and Elonex, as part of a modular range of options for increasing the scope of notebooks. They are not as easy to use but can cost as little as Pounds 65 for a port duplicator - a bar containing extra ports which plugs into the back of a notebook PC and can be linked to office printers and peripherals. Ms Alessandra Bianchini, of Olivetti's product group, says introducing expansion options has removed the need for 'expensive and cumbersome' docking stations for its Philos line of notebooks. The options include: removable hard disks (which can be used with both office PC and notebook), a port duplicator, internal modem, and credit-card-sized expansion slot conforming to the PCMCIA standard. Despite the alternatives, the take-up of docking stations remains healthy if not spectacular. Compaq says 25 to 35 per cent of its high-end notebooks are sold with them. At Toshiba the figure is 30 to 40 per cent. IBM says it now sells docking stations with 50 per cent of its ThinkPad notebooks. Mr Schrock believes that the main brake on growth is lack of awareness. 'Very few people know how elegantly portable and desktop computing can be combined,' he says. Joia Shillingford is editor of the Financial Times newsletter Business Computing Brief</p>

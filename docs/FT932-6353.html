Turnover was higher at Pounds 31.1m (Pounds 29.1m). The pre-tax figure was struck after reorganisation costs of Pounds 2.06m (Pounds 1.06m) and net interest received of Pounds 399,000 (Pounds 1.15m). Earnings per share were 26.5p (31.7p) and a proposed final dividend of 5.75p makes a total of 10.5p (9.5p). Mr Jeremy Leigh Pemberton, chairman, said the company was still coping with the effects of the recession and drought. There were problems meeting expected demand while respecting the environment and the options were becoming more complex and getting a higher social and political profile.</p>

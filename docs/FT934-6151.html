			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Israeli troops wound 37 in Gaza violence: Protest at killing of Islamic fundamentalist military commander Violence flared in the occupied Gaza Strip yesterday as Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 37 Palestinians protesting at the Israeli killing of an Islamic fundamentalist military commander. Militants of Hamas, the Islamic movement opposed to peace with Israel, blocked roads with burning tyres, clashed with Israeli troops and ordered a three-day general strike to mourn the killing on Wednesday night of Mr Imad Aqel, northern Gaza commander of Hamas' military wing. In a military communique, Hamas, recalling the words of Mr Aqel, said: 'Killing Israeli soldiers is a worship by which we get close to God'. The eruption, the worst since the peace agreement between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation was signed in September, came as Mr Yassir Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO was defeated in student elections at Beir Zeit University in the occupied West Bank by a coalition of Hamas and left-wing PLO factions opposed to the peace accord. The Beir Zeit poll was the first electoral test of young Palestinians since the peace agreement was signed. It marked Palestinian discontent with the lack of results from the peace process and continued Israeli closure of the territories. However, Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said yesterday he and Mr Arafat were optimistic about the peace process and confident agreement would be reached on implementing the peace accord and beginning Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and the West Bank area of Jericho by December 13. Israel and the PLO said talks on implementing the agreement, to be enshrined in the December 13 protocol, had, over the past two days, reached broad agreement on the transfer of authority from the Israeli-run civil administration in Gaza and Jericho to Palestinian hands. Mr Hassan Asfour, a member of the PLO delegation meeting the Israeli side in the Egyptian resort town of El-Arish, said most matters had been resolved, including fisheries, religious affairs and identity cards. In Cairo, separate Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams were trying to reach agreement on issues including the size of the Jericho area, the release of 10,000 Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners and control over border crossings between Gaza and Egypt and between Jericho and Jordan. In talks in Paris, an Israeli official said Palestinian agricultural produce, previously barred from entering Israel, would be allowed in if both sides agreed on a customs union and free movement of goods and services.</p>

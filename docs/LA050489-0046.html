			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> NEW MUSLIM DEATH THREAT  </P> <P> Egyptian Nobel literary laureate Naguib Mahfouz said Islamic extremists have  vowed to kill him for blasphemy in a threat similar to that made by the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. "Police have offered me  protection after Muslim extremists announced their intention to kill me,"  Mahfouz told reporters. "I refused because police protection could disturb my  life and disrupt my day-to-day habits." Mahfouz, 77, sharply criticized  Khomeini, Iran's leader, when he urged Muslims to kill Rushdie, author of "The  Satanic Verses." Security sources said the order against Mahfouz was probably  issued by Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind theologian who some Egyptian Muslim  radicals in the outlawed Islamic Jihad group regard as their mentor.  </P></p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Lonrho sells Libya Pounds 177m stake in Metropole Hotels LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, has sold to Libya a one third stake in the group's Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177m, in spite of the continuing western outcry over Libya's alleged involvement in terrorism. Mr Rene Leclezio, chairman, told a noisy annual general meeting of Lonrho that the Libyan deal had been masterminded by Mr 'Tiny' Rowland, Lonrho's chief executive. But Lonrho refused to say whether the deal, flamboyant even by Mr Rowland's standards, was clinched in a personal meeting between Mr Rowland and Colonel Muammer Gadaffi, the Libyan leader. The sale has worried some of Lonrho's institutional investors. The deal between Lonrho and the Libyan Arab Investment Company was signed as Libya faces the growing possibility of economic sanctions and asset seizures over its alleged role in the bombing of the Pan American airliner in 1988. Mr Leclezio said: 'The deal was Mr Rowland's personal achievement. It was his deal. Not many people could have even followed Mr Rowland round while he did the deal.' He added that Mr Rowland's contacts with African leaders illustrated why he was irreplaceable in the group. Mr Leclezio criticised the press for subjecting Lonrho to a 'persistent and misleading campaign of hysteria'. He added: 'Let the jackals bark, the caravan carries on.' Lonrho share price fell 8p to 95p yesterday. While there are no immediate plans in the UN to press for a freeze on Libyan assets, the US has since 1986 barred American companies and individuals from dealing with Libyan owned or controlled institutions. The US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which enforces the ban, said it would be seeking further information on the Metropole deal before deciding whether the hotel chain would be included on the list of 60 proscribed Libyan businesses. Mr Paul Spicer, Lonrho's deputy chairman, said checks with certain organisations had been made before the deal was signed. He confirmed that the Pounds 177.5m from the Libyans had already been banked by Lonrho. Asked about the concern expressed by institutional shareholders, Mr Spicer replied: 'I refuse to debate ethics. This is a business deal. Not one single shareholder objected to it. Our institutional shareholders understand the deal because they are businessmen.' Arab bankers and businessmen in the City close to Libyan affairs claimed the Metropole share purchase was a purely commercial affair. But one Arab businessman said: 'The timing will puzzle everyone.' Libya's decision to purchase the Metropole stake appears the more baffling given that Tripoli has for the last few months been shifting up to Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) of its liquid overseas assets out of Britain and other European centres towards friendlier Middle Eastern institutions - apparently to protect the assets from a possible freeze. The state-run Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company, which has only three offices outside Tripoli - in Malta, Athens and Rome  - is Libya's main vehicle for its non-bank overseas assets. The bulk of Libya's other non-liquid European assets are oil-related, lying mainly in petroleum distribution networks in Italy and Switzerland. Libya has in the past few months also bought several hotels in Egypt and some office blocks in London. Lonrho's institutional shareholders yesterday expressed their 'uneasiness' about the timing of the deal, given the intense pressure on Libya. The sale values the Metropole Hotels at Pounds 531m, which is around Pounds 300m more than most analysts believed they were worth. Lonrho will continue to control the hotels, most of which are in Africa and the UK, by appointing six of the eight directors. Mr Leclezio said net debt has fallen from Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 850m. However, the debt had already fallen from disposals of other assets.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> UECKER BACK TO PITCH WISCONSIN  </P> <P> Sportsman and actor Bob Uecker will be the head pitchman in Wisconsin's annual  effort to attract spring and summer tourism.  </P> <P> The former Milwaukee Braves baseball player -- better known for his appearances  in commercials -- agreed to donate his services to the 1990 campaign, as he has  in the past, officials announced Thursday.  </P> <P> One of the advertising agencies involved in the project suggested dumping  Uecker this year, but the state Tourism Council, mindful of the success of  previous campaigns, decided to use him again.  </P> <P> "Record responses for Wisconsin tourism information came as the result of past  Uecker spots," said Richard Matty, administrator of the state Division of  Tourism Development.  </P> <P> Uecker broadcasts Milwaukee Brewers games.  </P></p>

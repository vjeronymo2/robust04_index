			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with IAEA Director General Hans Blix </F> by unidentified YOMIURI SHIMBUN reporter in Hiroshima on 13  April]    [Text] [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] What did the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) find in its inspections of nuclear  facilities in North Korea in March?    [Blix] What matters is that we failed to thoroughly check a  radiochemical laboratory. Thus, we are not sure whether the  laboratory has been used only for peaceful purposes. We need to  know what North Koreans are doing in the laboratory. Although  it is more important to check two undeclared nuclear facilities,  the DPRK has rejected our request for special inspections.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The U.S. paper THE WASHINGTON POST  reported that North Korea is constructing another nuclear  reprocessing line. Is it true?    [Blix] Yes, it is. IAEA inspectors confirmed a glove box in  the facility. They also knew from experience that the facility  was a nuclear reprocessing line when they checked the shapes of  other facilities.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How much plutonium will North Korea be  able to produce in a year when this facility is completed?    [Blix] It could double the nation's current capacity. I  cannot say the exact amount.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] How much plutonium do you think the DPRK  has extracted so far from the existing 5-megawatt reactor?    [Blix] North Korea asserted that it took out broken fuel  rods from the reactor and declared the removal of a certain  amount of material. However, our sampling analysis found that  they took out more fuel rods than they declared. The worst part  is that we do not know how many times North Korea engaged in  nuclear reprocessing and how much plutonium they extracted.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] The DPRK is also constructing a  50-megawatt reactor.    [Blix] The 50-megawatt reactor will soon go into operation.  They are also constructing a 200-megawatt reactor outside of  Yongbyon.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Do you think the DPRK should increase the  openness of its nuclear program, including its future plans for  use of nuclear energy?    [Blix] Of course. Currently, their nuclear program is  utterly unclear.    [YOMIURI SHIMBUN] Japan has started the operation of the  fast breeder reactor "Monju," thereby entering the era of  plutonium use. What do you think of Japan's use of plutonium  and its development of fast breeder reactors?    [Blix] From a long-term viewpoint, the development of fast  breeder reactors is a sound investment. However, it is not  economical, since uranium is now less expensive and safety  devices for fast breeder reactors are relatively expensive. I  hope that Japan, France, and Russia will actively promote  research on fast breeder reactors. The research is also  significant for the rest of the world.</p>

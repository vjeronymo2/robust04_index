			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Briefcase Q&amp;A: Pension payments I am self-employed and subscribe to a personal pension plan. I also claim capital allowance on my tax. Is the maximum contribution that I can pay to my pension plan based on my gross earnings before or after capital allowances? It is based on your earnings after deducting capital allowances (by virtue of sections 640(1) and 646(2)(d) of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988). Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR78 (Personal pensions: a guide for tax). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

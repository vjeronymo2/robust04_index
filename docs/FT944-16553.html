			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Japan set to reform rice law Japan's agricultural ministry yesterday submitted proposals to reform the country's food control law, which governs rice production, distribution and retailing. The legislation will replace the food control law when Japan partially opens its rice market at the start of next year under provisions of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade. Next year, the government will allow rice imports up to 4 per cent of the domestic rice market. The figure will be gradually increased to 8 per cent by the year 2000. Under the proposed rules, any company or organisation will be allowed to buy rice from farmers and sell it on the open market, just by notifying its plans to the government. Currently, a state licence is required to trade or sell rice. Consumers are unlikely to benefit fully from cheap imports, since the legislative proposal stipulates that profits from selling imports at around domestic prices are to be used for maintaining rice stock for emergency use. The new bill will be submitted to the cabinet for approval next week.</p>

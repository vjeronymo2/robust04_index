			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, May 12 (AFP) -- A team of inspectors from  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will head to North  Korea Saturday [14 May] to inspect nuclear sites, the Agency's  spokesman David Kyd said Thursday.    Kyd said the inspectors would travel as planned Saturday  unless the Agency learned by then that Pyongyang had gone ahead  with the replacement of fuel rods in a disputed reactor at  Yongbyon.    According to the South Korean [as received] news agency  YONHAP, Pyongyang agreed to an IAEA request to postpone the  replacement of the fuel rods until the arrival of the inspectors  but added that it could not delay the replacement any longer  than that date.    "We can't delay the replacement of the spent fuel rods  forever for security reasons," Kim Chong-su, the assistant to  the North Korean ambassador to the UN, told YONHAP. "We have to  replace the rods because we have reached the red mark which if  you're driving in a car means you're out of oil."    An IAEA team was denied access to the five megawatt reactor  at Yongbyon in March in order to collect samples of some of the  spent fuel to determine whether any of it was diverted for  military purposes.    Kyd said that the upcoming trip would last eight days  although it could be extended if deemed necessary.    He said that although the inspectors would not be allowed to  accomplish their full mission "they will be able to do most of  their work, which is satisfactory for us."    He added that there were no plans for the inspectors to do  any work on the five megawatt reactor at Yongbyon, a plant which  the United States suspects of being used to produce nuclear  weapons.    The IAEA has invited experts from North Korea to Vienna for  talks on narrowing differences over the controversial  replacement of the rods, but so far Pyongyang has not responded  to the offer, Kyd said.</p>

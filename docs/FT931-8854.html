			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / International Company News: Samancor turns in 27% fall at halfway SAMANCOR, the South African chrome and manganese ore and alloys producer, yesterday reported a 27 per cent fall in attributable net profits to R110.8m (Dollars 35.5m) for the six months to December. Earnings per share tumbled 31 per cent to 59 cents. The company is halving its dividend to 20 cents a share. Mr Hans Smith, managing director, said no ferrochrome producer was making money at current prices. Samancor's ferrochrome operations were running at about 40 per cent of installed capacity, he added. Although Mr Smith is keen to stress the success of the restructuring and the healthy state of Samancor's balance sheet - available cash resources stand at about R500m - the figures tell a grim story. Adjusted to take account of the Middelburg Steel acquisition, turnover declined by 11 per cent to R930.9m and pre-tax profits fell by 72 per cent to R71.4m, taking in a R42m one-off retrenchment charge The real trouble for Samancor came on the ferrochrome side, where large volumes of distress sales from the CIS and former eastern bloc countries played havoc with the market.</p>

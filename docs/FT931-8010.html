			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Constitutional struggle goes on in Moscow PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin and the speaker of the Russian parliament, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, will continue this week to search for a constitutional deal in a suicidal power struggle each side is determined to win. After the two men traded insults directly or through their spokesmen, a first round of negotiating between their emissaries on Saturday produced no progress. A 10-day deadline for an agreement expires at the end of the week. If none is found through the current mixture of behind-the-scenes negotiating and megaphone diplomacy, Mr Yeltsin has vowed to take the struggle to a referendum which would ask people whether parliament or the president should rule the country. Mr Yeltsin wants the parliament to stick to examining legislation, leaving the government strong executive powers to conduct economic reform and dispose of state assets. The alternatives to a deal are grim. A referendum would further destabilise the political situation at a time of deep economic crisis. Some independent-minded regions could refuse to hold the poll. Furthermore, it could be seen as a flop for failing to ask clear questions (parliament also has a say in setting them) and by producing a turnout too low to provide a clear answer.</p>

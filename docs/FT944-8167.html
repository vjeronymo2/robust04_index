			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (27): Poles and Czechs compete with the German worker - Manufacturers head for eastern Europe When the Polish economy finally finds a firm footing there may be room in the market for three industrial gas suppliers at most, according to Mr Gunnar Eggendorfer, a Linde group director. At present, while the economy is anything but stable, the key metal-working industry is going into reverse, the zloty is weakening almost continuously against the D-Mark, and inflation runs at more than 30 per cent, there are more than half a dozen, slugging it out in a market which generated just DM136m in sales last year. As a rule of thumb, Mr Eggendorfer reckons that annual sales of DM100m are necessary to keep a single industrial gas supplier occupied and profitable. It is not a situation designed to appeal to German companies, typically risk-averse and stability-obsessed, but it is one Linde - plus competitors Aga, British Oxygen, Liquid Carbonics, Messer Griesheim and a handful of management buy-outs - may usefully learn to live with. The lessons will come in useful when the time arrives to push further eastwards into the new markets and manufacturing bases in the former Soviet Union. But it is too soon for Mr Eggendorfer. 'Everything is still too uncertain over there,' he says. Although Mr Eggendorfer and his chairman Mr Hans Meinhardt make much of the hardships and uncertainties of pioneering in the Germany's eastern frontier lands, they are equally eager to point out that all Linde's gas interests in the region - all set up or bought in the last four years business - are profitable. Even in Poland, where on top of all the other problems sales per employee are only a third of those in the Czech Republic, Linde is making money from its core business of separating air into its component gases and packaging it for industrial users. Since 1990 the group, also known as a leading supplier of lift trucks and refrigeration plant, has invested DM950m in the former communist east, with a good half of the total spent in eastern Germany and DM250m in the Czech Republic. The balance has bought Linde varying volumes of market share in Hungary, Slovakia and Poland. Total 'eastern' sales of DM480m last year already account for about 20 per cent of group gas turnover. Difficult as conditions are in these markets, Linde, which decided to develop industrial gases into a core business five years ago, had no alternative to investment. While other companies making other products might be content to export into the new markets, the costs of transporting heavy gas bottles mean exports are not viable beyond a range of 80 to 100km. It is also characteristic of the gas market that the early entrants or indigenous producers tend to take dominant market shares, effectively locking out outside competitors. Air Liquide's 75 per cent of the French market, for example, is a good enough reason for Linde to limit its ambitions to the west of its homeland. Accordingly, analysts say, Air Liquide has kept away from the Czech market precisely because of Linde's early coup with the purchase of a majority stake - plus an option on the balance - in the state-controlled Technoplyn, based in Brno, Moravia, which has a market share of well over 50 per cent. Apart from four German technical specialists among 740 employees, the entire management and workforce is Czech. Apart from a few curio photographs of ancient compression gear and air separators, most of the old equipment has been replaced with Linde plant imported from Germany. 'But at its heart it is a purely Czech company,' insists Mr Meinhardt. In contrast to the experiences of some smaller, entrepreneurial foreign investors, larger groups such as Linde and Asea Brown Boveri which controls a boiler engineering plant on the other side of Brno, have slipped relatively easily into professional, co-operative relationships with their Czech colleagues. Although the ABB works has tough production and quality targets comparable with those in the Swiss-Swedish group's western works, they have been accepted just as readily by former Kombinat managers as the requirement that they should learn the group language, English. As for Linde, Mr Meinhardt claims to be surprised at the similarity between Czech and German attitudes to work and responsibility. There is no resentment against foreign takeovers and no traces of any historic antagonism between Czechs and Germans. 'Linde has profited well from the collapse of the old order in the east,' he says. 'But we knew it was important to come here on a business footing and not to try to play the role of the know-it-all. 'Here, especially, we are well on the way to making yields on our investments comparable with those at home.'</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: MONROVIA;  </P> <P> VOTE FOR FINISHED FREEWAY  </P> <P> The City Council has approved a resolution supporting the completion of the 710  Freeway to Long Beach.  </P> <P> There has been a gap in the freeway between Valley Boulevard in Alhambra and  the 210 Freeway since 1964. The City Council unanimously adopted the resolution  June 6 despite protests from South Pasadena officials opposing the  state-approved route through their city. The resolution does not specify which  of several routes under consideration should be used.  </P> <P> In a report recommending that the council approve the resolution, Monrovia  Director of Public Works Robert Sandwick said the city would benefit from  decreased east-west traffic in the west San Gabriel Valley if the link is  completed. Some motorists now take the 605 Freeway to avoid the gap, increasing  traffic on the 210 Freeway and Monrovia's surface streets, including Huntington  Drive, Duarte Road and Foothill Boulevard, he said.  </P></p>

Devoyno, Physiology Institute, Siberian Department, Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences, Novosibirsk; UDC  615.357:577.175.82].015.4:612.017.1].076.9]    [Abstract] Peptide modulation of immune responses was  studied in inbred CBA mice of both sexes (weight, 20 to 25 g  each). Peptides obtained from the Organic Synthesis Institute of  the Latvian Academy of Sciences in Riga were administered to the  rats in doses of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, and 20 mg/kg.  Talcin and its analogue rigin had the biggest immune-stimulating  effect at all doses tested. As the dose of the said peptides was  increased, the number of IgM antibody-forming and  rossette-forming cells [RFC] also increased. When the tripeptide  SKE was used, the maximum RFC formed at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, and  when vasopressin was injected, immune system stimulation only  occurred at the lowest dose (0.001 mg/kg). A vasopressin  analogue that did not contain the amino acid glycine in its  structure increased the number of RFC in the mice only when  administered at a dose of 1 mg/kg. An increase in number of RFC  (by a factor of 1.5) was also discovered in mice receiving  substance P and its analogue. Among those peptides with an  immune-suppressing function, the vasopressin analogue tripeptide  IOS [expansion not given] manifested the greatest  immunosuppressive effect. The specific effect of  arginyl-asparagine appeared in a narrower dose range. As the  dose in which it was administered was increased, the  oligopeptide SKD manifested a strong immunosuppressive effect  and proved capable of affecting the nervous and immune systems  simultaneously. The immunomodulating capabilities of the  aforesaid peptides were associated with the presence of amino  acids such as arginine, lysine, tyrosine, and glutamic acid in  their chemical structure.</p>

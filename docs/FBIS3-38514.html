			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Lawyers, Doctors, Bankers Netted in </F> Mafia Sweep"]    [Excerpts] Palermo, 2 Feb (ANSA) -- Three Palermo criminal  lawyers, four doctors and two savings bank officials were among  the 76 persons named in preventive detention custody warrants  served this morning in an anti-Mafia operation that smashed what  investigators called the "most important hit team of recent  years" and shed fresh light on how the mob bought or coerced the  services of local professionals.    The operation, codenamed Golden Market, was based on  testimony from leading Mafia turncoats including the recently  arrested "super-killer" Giovanni Drago, accused of taking part  in 36 homicides between 1986 and 1990. Many of those taken into  custody are his alleged accomplices. Magistrates pointed to  Drago's November 1989 slaying of three close female relatives of  super-grass Francesco Marino Mannoia -- then beginning to  collaborate with justice, in the utmost secrecy -- as evidence  of the presence of Mafia moles within the most heavily guarded  reaches of the investigative apparatus.    Of the 76 warrants, 34 were served on persons already in  jail  for Mafia offences, including all the incarcerated components of  the Mafia's supreme coordinating body, the Cupola (Dome): boss  of bosses Salvatore Riina, Francesco Madonia, Bernardo Brusco  and Giuseppe Calo'. 18 persons had gone underground, including  the doctor Goiacchino Pennino, and clan heads Pietro Aglieri,  Giovanni Brusca, and Mariano Tullio Troia. Two of the three  lawyers, Carmelo Cordaro and Marco Clementi, were taken into  custody while the third, Gaetano Zarcone, has been on the run  for two years, but sent magistrates a letter two months ago  claiming he was the victim of defamation.    According to informants including super-grasses Gaspare  Mutolo and Baldassare Di Maggio -- the same witnesses who  alleged Mafia links on the part of former premier Giulio  Andreotti -- Cordaro swore allegiance as "man of honour" for one  of the main Palermo crime families, the Porta Nuova clan.  Clementi is accused by the informants of acting as a go-between  for jailed bosses -- in particular, his clients in the Madonia  clan -- and their operatives on the outside. Among the  allegations against Zircone is that of introducing into  Palermo's Ucciardone prison the poison that killed boss Gerlando  Alberti 10 years ago.    The doctors named in the warrants, two of them military  medical officers, stand accused of issuing false medical  certificates to allow jailed Mafiosi out of prison. In  particular, one of the military doctors, Antonino Mattina, is  accused of accepting a 50 million lire bribe to have boss Pietro  Vernengo transferred to a hospital from which he escaped in 1991.    The exact charges against the two officials of the  Sicilcassa  savings bank are not known, but a statement from investigators  spoke of a "distorted exercise of their activities" on the part  of all 9 local professionals, who had been "either corrupted or  intimidated" by the mob.    This first involvement of criminal lawyers in an anti-Mafia  operation follows repeated assertions by leading informants that  they were used to exert influence on judges. One turncoat,  Antonino Calderone, recently told investigators that the Mafia  "asks a lawyer what a judge is like, and the lawyer will tell  you who knows the judge and can get close to him."  In recent testimony to the parliamentary anti-Mafia  commission, Mutolo spoke of "controlling" lawyers, many of them  "men of honour", who exert behind-the-scenes influence to swing  trials, as well as "corridor" lawyers who give tips on how  Mafiosi should handle their defence. He added that the Mafia  deliberately chose lawyers of the same political persuasion as  judges, usually achieving "more favourable" treatment. [passage  omitted]    The chairman of the Palermo criminal lawyers' association,  Giovanni Natoli, expressed "appreciation" for the colleagues  involved in the probe and confidence that they would be able to  defend themselves from the "groundless" accusations of Mafia  turncoats whom he described as "wholly untrustworthy persons".  He added that while no comment was possible on the accusations  they faced, the lawyers' association would take on the formal  defence of its members.</p>

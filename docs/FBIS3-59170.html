			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major General Fogh, Commander of the </F> Tactical Air Command, by Stefan Petersen: "All Six Bases Will  Be Retained"]    [Petersen] During the Cold War, Denmark, thanks to its  geostrategic location, served as NATO's goaltender for the exits  from the Baltic Sea. What are the missions of the Danish Air  Force today?    [Fogh] The primary mission continues to be national defense  within NATO, albeit with reduced forces. Even though no direct  threat is visible any longer, no one knows what the future will  bring. To be on the safe side, adequate defense resources must  be kept in readiness in the event of a renewed threat;  especially in the case of modern air forces, we cannot wait  until they are needed and then try to create them overnight. The  absorption of British and American reinforcement units in case  of war likewise continues to be planned.    Newly added is the mission of making resources available for  out-of-area operations by NATO crisis reaction forces and for UN  operations. Based on current plans, the Flyvevabnet will  probably participate in the rapid reaction forces with one F-16  squadron.    [Petersen] What practical effects have reductions had in the  Danish Air Force? Are there any serious problems?    [Fogh] No problems, but a lot of work to adapt the  organization of the Air Force to the new realities. With the two  Draken squadrons [formerly] in Karup, we lose two flying units,  but all six operational bases of the Flyvevabnet will be  retained. At least for the time being no base closures are  planned. As compensation [for the loss of the two Draken  squadrons], the Air Force flight school was moved to Karup in  February 1993. To safeguard as many jobs in that region as  possible, a civilian firm named Danish Aerotech is also being  established there, which will take over facilities and personnel  of the two deactivated squadrons. This firm will be charged with  carrying out maintenance work for the Danish Air Force in the  future. Additional savings are realized through the reduction in  the peacetime manning of the eight Hawk squadrons by one-third,  as well as by a reduction of the administration.    [Petersen] Following the deactivation of the Draken, the  Fighting Falcon is the only jet combat aircraft in the Danish  Air Force. What steps are planned to upgrade the combat  effectiveness of the Danish F-16?    [Fogh] The production phase of the multinational  midlife-update program begins in 1994 and includes a  higher-performance radar system, a Beyond-Visual-Range  capability, an improved self-defense capability, the  installation of a GPS [Global Positioning System] and a new  head-up display, as well as an improved cockpit layout. The  Fighting Falcon will be operational until the year 2010/2015;  its combat effectiveness is to be maintained in any case. In the  Flyvevabnet, we must place the main emphasis on the quality of  personnel and materiel, otherwise we will sink into a state of  insignificance. An air force as small as ours cannot impress  anybody by its number of aircraft alone.</p>

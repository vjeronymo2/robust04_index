			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Bundesbank changes repo rules The Bundesbank yesterday called for variable-rate tenders in this week's round of securities repurchase agreements, after more than three months of fixed-rate deals at 6 per cent, writes Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt. Although surprised, analysts ruled out any substantial changes in the so-called repo rate, at which the central bank supplies short-term liquidity to the markets. While observers agreed that the tender would probably result in lower rates, the extent of the decline would be marginal, and none expected any early change in the discount lending rate, reduced to 5.25 per cent in mid-February.</p>

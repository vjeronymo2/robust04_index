			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 3-D CAN'T SAVE FLAT, LONG-ON-THE-SHELF 'ROTTWEILER'  </P> <P> It's a good thing that the 1981 3-D "Rottweiler" (at the Vagabond) is as bad as  it is. If you couldn't laugh at it, it would really be a tedious business.  </P> <P> It is, of course, about Rottweilers, a dozen of them -- bred and trained to be  killer dogs -- that go AWOL from the Army en route to Ft. Bragg and terrorize a  mountain resort. That "Rottweiler" plays like an amateur parody of TV's "Twin  Peaks" helps you get through it, but this long-on-the-shelf item -- being shown  in a scratchy print -- lacks the necessary energy to make it even as a  so-bad-it's-good midnight movie.  </P> <P> "Rottweiler" producer Earl Owensby stars as the sheriff at Lake Lure, where the  main attraction is female mud wrestling and where most of the Rottweilers'  victims are scantily clad women. Performances, direction (by Worth Keeter) and  script (by Thom McIntyre) are uniformly lousy. The film is just as flat as if  it hadn't been shot in 3-D, of which little use has been made.  </P> <P> Reportedly, "Rottweiler" had a brief run in Chicago and in some small towns,  and it did cause a bit of a stir in late 1981 when the American Rottweiler Club  complained that the film gave the big, powerful German working dogs a bad  image. Since then, the breed has had an increasingly negative press for which  this forgettable movie, also known as "Dogs From Hell," cannot be blamed.  </P></p>

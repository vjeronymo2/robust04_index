			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / Survey of New Zealand (10): Cautious winner at Brierley - Profile of Paul Collins as much as anyone - wants to see a strong revival of the UK economy and its tourist industry. The man who spearheaded Brierley Investments' purchase of the British hotel group, Mount Charlotte, now faces pressure to prove to a somewhat sceptical New Zealand investment community that it was a good move. The purchase in 1991 represented Brierley Investment's single biggest investment, and was seen as a declaration that Mr Collins, not founding chairman Sir Ron Brierley, was now running the company with the support of Mr Bruce Hancox, the executive chairman. Mr Collins, who has been chief executive of Brierley Investments since 1983, was enthusiastic about Mount Charlotte and its management team led by Mr Robert Peel from the time BIL bought its initial stake in 1987. To address the balance-sheet strains, Brierley this year sold its other major British investment, Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, the car group, arguing it was now a mature investment. TKM was restructured over much of the previous decade by Mr Reg Heath, its chief executive, with full BIL financial backing and the support of Mr Hancox. Mr Collins, who visits Britain most months to study the Mount Charlotte investment, has become a walking encyclopedia on the British hotel and tourism industry. He has a remarkable ability to remember facts and figures about the company he heads, its investments and technicalities in its balance sheets and those of its subsidiaries. This seems to have been bred into him. Both his father and grandfather were New Zealand auditors general, and his uncle, Sir Bernard O'Connell, was a brewing magnate. Now 39, Mr Collins was a key player with Mr Hancox in the boardroom coup which led Sir Ron Brierley to step down as chairman in 1989. This followed the 1987 crash and differences of views on how the company should be run in a new investment climate. Sir Ron was reluctant to sell some major assets, and was keen to invest in others. Mr Collins' innate caution triumphed, and led to the sale of NZI, Winstones, New Zealand Newspapers and most contentious of all, IEL, the Australian investment vehicle that Sir Ron had developed over 20 years living in Sydney. Since the coup, Brierley Investments has been accused of lacking Sir Ron's vision. Confusingly, both Mr Collins and Mr Hancox argue they run the company on Sir Ron's guiding principles. Sir Ron still provides some input on the board and runs the Brierley subsidiary GPG, which has BIL backing. Mr Collins says that caution is among his personal weaknesses, along with perfectionism. He has imposed disciplines, especially on financial reporting, on the company, and as one of its largest individual shareholders, he is determined to see it succeed. He has a reputation for being single-minded. 'I make no apologies for being tough. There are no rewards for second prize, and every transaction must be done to the best extent you can,' he says.</p>

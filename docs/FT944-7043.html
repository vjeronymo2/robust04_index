			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Leading Article: Safety first, chancellor The UK Budget ought, in normal circumstances, to dwarf in significance any parliamentary event that occurs in the same week. This should be even truer now that plans for spending and revenue are announced in one burst of parliamentary fireworks. Yet next week's display will start not with the Budget, but with the Conservative party's flirtation with collective suicide on Monday. If the government were to lose the vote on UK contributions to the European budget, Mr Kenneth Clarke's day would become a damp squib. People's thoughts would turn at once to the Labour party's shadow budget for 'investment, jobs and fairness'. Yet Conservatives believe in self-interest. It seems implausible that this motivation will desert them altogether on Monday. Tuesday's Budget will probably still matter. Mr Clarke has a good story to tell and will tell it with gusto, for in every important respect economic performance has been better this year than the Treasury foresaw a year ago. Then gross domestic product was expected to grow by 2 1/2 per cent in 1994, but it grew 4.2 per cent in the year to the third quarter; then the retail price index (excluding mortgage interest) was forecast to rise 3 1/4 per cent in the year to the fourth quarter of 1994, but it has risen only 2 per cent in the year to October; and then the public sector borrowing requirement for 1994-95 was forecast to be Pounds 38bn, while the Institute for Fiscal Studies and Goldman Sachs now forecast it at a little over Pounds 30bn. It is a great story. But it also opens a deep trap. The better the economy is performing and the greater the government's unpopularity, the bigger the temptation to bribe the electorate with dollops of its own money. Once again, there would be large tax cuts at the peak of an expansion. Once again, the necessary tightening of monetary policy would either be postponed or be too little. Once again, a golden opportunity to sustain stable growth would be thrown away. Higher inflation From the gap between the yield on conventional and index-linked gilts, investors expect inflation to average 4 1/2 per cent in the medium term. For them, therefore, this is another post-recession honeymoon, with higher inflation to follow. Obtaining growth after a devaluation that followed a deep recession is no miracle. But sustaining growth over many years would be miraculous. The currently unsustainable rate of growth, far from justifying postponement of the tax increases due next financial year, makes them still more important. There is no reason to suppose that the underlying trend rate of economic growth is any faster than was thought a year ago. All that has happened is that the economy is returning to its (unavoidably uncertain) full-capacity level faster than was then expected. Correspondingly, the fiscal position is also improving more quickly than then imagined. Fiscal tightening There are three reasons why there should be no discretionary reversal of the planned fiscal tightening. The first is that on plausibly conservative assumptions about full capacity - the level of output at which inflation would remain stable - the public sector borrowing requirement would still be about 3 per cent of gross domestic product at that point. This is the most that would appear sustainable in the long term. If anything, the UK should run a tighter cyclically adjusted PSBR than that. Second, it cannot be sensible to approach full capacity at a growth rate of more than 4 per cent a year. Should the further fiscal tightening due next financial year prove too contractionary for the economy, offsetting reductions in interest rates (or, more probably, slower increases) can always be made. Such a further rebalancing would, in fact, be desirable. Finally, if there are to be the usual electioneering bribes in the 1995 and 1996 Budgets, they need to be made from a more than sustainable base. While there is no good economic reason to raise taxes one year only to lower them a year later, it may still be necessary to raise them if the subsequent lowering is politically pre-ordained. This is, admittedly, to treat voters as idiots, but maybe they deserve that treatment. So Mr Clarke should blow the government's trumpet, stick to his announced plans for tax increases and focus attention on imaginative ideas for fiscal reform. The treatment of savings is a mess. It would be good to wrap tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) together with personal equity plans (Peps). It would be wonderful if the incentives for the unskilled unemployed to work were to be improved. It would be still more remarkable if the chancellor were to avoid introducing more of the distorting gimmicks that all chancellors love. Such fireworks are optional. What is essential is for the chancellor to avoid falling into the trap of excessive stimulus that engulfed so many predecessors. He made the right decisions last time. He should stick to them this year.</p>

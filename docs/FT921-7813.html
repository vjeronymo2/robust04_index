			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / US sends IRA man Doherty back to UK THE US yesterday sent Mr Joseph Doherty back to the UK, ending a nine-year legal battle by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) member to escape deportation. Mr Doherty was convicted in 1981 of murdering a British army captain during an ambush in Northern Ireland, but escaped from prison in Belfast before being sentenced in his absence. He was arrested in 1983 in New York, but the Justice Department's attempt to extradite him to the UK as a convicted criminal failed when a federal judge ruled that his crime was a political offence. Mr Doherty, who entered the US under an assumed name in 1982, at first agreed to be deported to Ireland as an illegal alien. After the UK signed an extradition treaty with the Republic of Ireland in 1987, however, he asked to have his deportation case reopened and requested political asylum. This battle ended when the Supreme Court ruled in December that Mr Doherty was not entitled to a new asylum hearing. American supporters of the IRA have fought hard for Mr Doherty, whose case won the backing of more than 100 members of Congress, as well as Mayor David Dinkins and Cardinal John O'Connor of New York. Mr Doherty was flown to the UK by the US Air Force yesterday and was expected to reach his Belfast prison late last night.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] In Moscow today, approximately 100--mainly elderly--  people picketed near the statue of Karl Marx on Teatralnaya  Ploshchad in defense of the Lenin Museum and the Mausoleum.    Now for another rally held today:    [Correspondent Nikolay Ivanov] A rally by the so-called  Russian All-People's Union was held not far from the White House  near the stadium at Krasnaya Presnya. The assembled did not  exceed 2,000 in number. Although the rally was devoted  officially to the memory of those who died during the defense of  the White House in October last year, those gathered and the  speakers easily extended the limits of their speeches. These  ranged from expressions of dissatisfaction with the Russian  president and Government to displeasure at the forthcoming visit  by the U.S. President.    Mikhail Astafyev, the well-known opposition leader, pointed  toward the U.S. Embassy, saying that, according to anonymous  witnesses, in October the White House defenders were fired at  from the buildings of the Embassy. In addition, he called on  those assembled to remind people of the Russian All-People's  Union through gatherings outside the buildings of the Federation  Council and State Duma while they are in session.    The notorious Sazhi Umalatova and Viktor Alksnis also spoke,  attempting to draw a parallel between Bloody Sunday, 9 January  1905, and today. Given that the small number of militiamen did  not even try to influence those at the rally in any way, this  kind of association did not really seem relevant. Donations  were collected during the rally to help those wounded during the  events at the White House and to help those imprisoned in  Lefortovo.</p>

The reply follows the request from U.N. Secretary General  Butrus Butrus-Ghali in late February for Japan to send personnel  to monitor the March 20 presidential and parliamentary  elections, the officials said.    The 15-member Japanese team, comprising three from the  Foreign Ministry, one from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and  11 from the private sector, will join a 900-member U.N. unit  overseeing the polls in the Central American country.    A peace agreement, enabling the U.N. to deploy its peace  mission in El Salvador, was signed in January 1992 after a  decade-long "proxy war" between the U.S.-backed right-wing  government and leftist guerrillas, supported by the former  Soviet Union.    El Salvador will be the third country to which Japan has  sent  election observers in accordance with the U.N. Peacekeeping  Cooperation Law, after Angola and Cambodia.</p>

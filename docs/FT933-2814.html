			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow fluctuates with bonds to end higher Wall Street US SHARE prices ended a volatile trading session in positive territory yesterday. After tracking the bond market lower in the morning, stocks retraced their steps in the afternoon in the wake of a rally in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which at mid-morning had been down 30 points, finished a net 17.89 up at 3,633.65. Other indices moved in a similar fashion. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 added 1.70 at 461.60 and the Nasdaq composite gained 6.91 at 739.55. NYSE volume was 298m shares. For the second straight day, worries about inflation - sparked by an unexpectedly strong August consumer price index figure - prompted heavy early selling of Treasury bonds, which in turn sent stock prices lower. On Tuesday the 30-year bond fell 1 1/2 points and the Dow declined 18.45. Yesterday morning the 30-year bond dropped a further point, and the Dow quickly weakened 30 points, sending the index below 3,600 for only the second time in a month. Analysts said investors were selling stocks and bonds not just because they were worried about inflation, but also because the inflation data gave them an excuse to take some of the profits earned in this summer's rally, and to let out some of the pressure in stock and bond markets that have been looking overbought in recent weeks. By mid-afternoon, however, the selling pressure abated, and buyers returned to the market, encouraged by an impressive rally in the bond market which wiped out almost all of its early losses. The late recovery lifted the Dow more than 20 points in the final hour of trading. Walt Disney saw heavy trading and fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 39 in volume of 5.2m shares after Wall Street securities house Goldman Sachs cut its forecast for the entertainment group's 1993 fiscal year, warning that recent violent attacks on tourists visiting Florida could hurt attendance at Disneyworld. Federal Express forged ahead Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 58 3/4 on stronger than expected fiscal first-quarter profits of 60 cents a share. Auto shares, which suffered earlier in the week on news of disappointing weekly sales figures, rebounded. Ford rose Dollars 1 to Dollars 54 3/4 , General Motors Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/4 and Chrysler Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 45 3/8 . Schering-Plough climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 62 5/8 after investment bank SG Warburg raised its rating on the stock from 'add' to 'buy', noting that the company is in a better position relative to its competitors in terms of currency exposure and its reliance upon drugs for the elderly. On the Nasdaq market, the technology sector was firmer, Intel adding Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 64 7/8 and Microsoft Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 76 1/2 . Canada ANOTHER rally by gold shares helped the Toronto market pick up from earlier weakness, the TSE 300 index, down 20 points at one stage, losing only 4.2 on the day at 3,967.9. Falls led rises by 419 to 301 after volume of 74.4m shares. The golds index added 1.6 per cent as the New York bullion price rose USDollars 2.75 an ounce.</p>

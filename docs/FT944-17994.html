			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Shares rally but trading volume remains poor - Market Report An improvement in British government bond prices helped the UK stock market to struggle above the Footsie 3,000 mark again yesterday, but traders described the rally as unconvincing. Trading volume was poor after stripping out one large buy-back operation in the regional electricity stocks and the market closed off the top as Wall Street made a slow start to the new session. At the close the FT-SE 100-share Index was 18.3 ahead at 3,001.8, largely on the back of firm stock index future and gilt-edged sectors. With the Dow Industrial Average a shade off in London hours and other European bourses mixed, there was little spirit in the UK equity market in the second half of the session. One reason for the market's lack of enthusiasm came from the merchant banking sector, when Hambros followed SG Warburg by warning that profits for the first half of the year would show a heavy fall. It was the turn of the smaller merchant bank stocks to suffer yesterday. Warburg steadied from the savage losses of the previous day. Also weak were shares in the car component manufacturers after Ford UK disclosed that its two largest British factories are to go on short-time working as both home and export markets disappoint the company's hopes. The news outweighed any benefits from more favourable comments on trading by car manufacturers in continental Europe, including Volkswagen and Opel, General Motor's German operation. There was a setback across the privatised water stocks in the wake of warnings from the annual conference of Britain's opposition Labour party that if returned to power it would take a 'tough, rigorous' line on public control. The market received a tonic early in the session with a 21.6m-share buy-back from Midlands Electricity. The proceeds of around Pounds 154m were believed to have been put back, via the broking houses, to the other regional electricity stocks, lifting the sector and providing a boost to the market's confidence as well as to its liquidity. Without the boost from the Midlands deals, trading volume would have been nearly 6 per cent down - the day's total Seaq figure of 528.7m shares compared with 521.1m in the previous session. Monday's retail business was worth Pounds 1.14bn, still a profitable level for the larger securities firms but well below bull market levels. However, non-Footsie business remained low yesterday at about 55 per cent of the day's total. The dearth of activity in the smaller stocks restricted the performance to a 5.7 gain at 3,455.3 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which covers a wide range of Footsie and non-Footsie shares. Dwindling turnover, especially in the smaller-capitalisation stocks, which are often favoured by private investors, has begun to hurt some stockbroking firms. Analysts continued to see the UK stock market as being in a nervous mood as it waits for further evidence of the upward pressures on global interest rates. The disclosure of a 0.6 per cent rise in US leading economic indicators for August appeared to show that the US economy is continuing to recover fairly strongly, and turned attention again on to the prospects that the Federal Reserve may tighten policy soon. Such tensions will increase later this week as the London market waits for the latest payroll and unemployment statistics from the US, and braces itself for next week's list of important data on the domestic economy. There was little sign yesterday of the genuine recovery of confidence and trading volume needed if the UK market is to stage the advance in the final quarter of the year which has been predicted by many equity analysts.</p>

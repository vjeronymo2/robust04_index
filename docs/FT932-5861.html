			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Swedish state takes on property role: Government set to pursue bank rescues THE SWEDISH state is set to become one of Europe's biggest commercial property players because of the loan crisis that damaged the country's banking sector last year. Bank and government officials say the state may soon rank as high as Europe's 10th largest property company if it takes over banks' property loan portfolios worth up to SKr70bn (Pounds 6.2bn). 'The government is certainly going to play a role in the commercial property market for the next decade,' said Mr Stefan Ingves, director-general of the bank support authority, the body set up to handle the banking emergency. Lending to the property sector in the late 1980s, which later turned bad as property prices slumped especially in Sweden and the UK, was a prime cause of the crisis which saw Sweden's main commercial banks return unprecedented losses in 1992. As part of its still uncompleted rescue operation, which has to date cost SKr67.5bn in cash, loans and guarantees, the government now owns two of the five biggest banks, Nordbanken and Gotabank. To help launder their balance sheets and prepare them for eventual re-privatisation, the bank support authority is hiving off into legally separate 'bad banks' their problem assets, many of which are in property. Gotabank has not yet decided which of its non-performing assets will go into its 'bad bank', but property accounts for some SKr25bn of the bank's Skr40bn of problem loans and credits. The process is furthest advanced at Nordbanken, which has dumped assets totalling Skr67bn into Securum, a new state-run agency. These assets include 2,450 properties in Sweden and 550 overseas, which together represent Skr40-45bn in outstanding loans. The foreign properties include 158 in Britain, representing SKr5.2bn in credits, 80 in the Netherlands (SKr1.7bn), 60 in Germany (Skr3.4bn) and 50 in Belgium (Skr1.0bn). Securum officials say the agency is likely to end up directly owning properties worth around SKr20bn. Gotabank estimates it, or its 'bad bank', will end up owning property worth SKr8-10bn. In Sweden, the government intends to manage the former Nordbanken and Gotabank property assets separately and avoid 'firesale' disposals to try to stabilise the local property market. Subsidiary companies in the UK and Amsterdam will manage and dispose of the UK and continental European properties. A Securum spokesman pointed out that the agency's ultimate aim is to deal itself out of the market, and not become a long-term player. 'We are not going to become some sort of monster in the market. We are very large in terms of volume, but our real estate is spread very widely and it is not the best property around. If it was, we wouldn't have it in our hands.'</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] The following items on political and  economic developments in the Republic of Croatia are drawn from  periodicals published in the Republic.  <H5>  HSLS Leader in Slavonia on Bosnia, Croatian Policy </H5>   The founding assembly of the Croatian Social Liberal Party  [HSLS] municipal branch was held in Semeljci in the presence of  HSLS members from Djakovo, Trnava, Koritna, and Kesinci in  eastern Slavonia. The Osijek daily GLAS SLAVONIJE on 17 March  reports that the assembly was addressed by Ivica Sutalo, a  delegate in the Croatian Assembly and president of the Djakovo  HSLS branch, who expressed his "satisfaction" at the founding of  the first HSLS branch in the eastern part of the Djakovo region.  Speaking about the current political situation in Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Sutalo said that HSLS members welcome the  cease-fire in Bosnia between the Croats and the Muslims, but  that they are afraid of the rapid conclusion of the agreement on  confederation, even before Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina have  been freed from the "Serbian aggressor."    "Croats plunged twice, like geese, into the fog of the  Yugoslav union; a third plunge, after all the victims and  destruction, could be dangerous," Sutalo warned, adding that  Croatian official policy during the last four years had been  "consistent in its inconsistency." "This is why the HSLS, as the  first opposition party, has the historical duty to present its  views in a stronger and more precise way and to start examining  the question of responsibility for the events of the last four  years," Sutalo concluded according to the daily.  <H5>  Questions Surrounding Privatization of Brewery </H5>   The story of the privatization of the Karlovac Pivovara  [Brewery] and the sale of shares in it point to "irregularities"  in the work of the Croatian Privatization Fund, according to the  Zagreb weekly DANAS of 22 March. DANAS reports such  irregularities were even mentioned by President Franjo Tudjman  at a recent news conference when he announced some dismissals of  Fund personnel, "which provoked tumultuous applause from those  present." The weekly notes that Andronik Luksic, a resident of  Chile, "who is said to be one of the richest Croats in the  world," is the buyer of the Croatian Privatization Fund's shares  of the Karlovac brewery. Luksic, treated as a Croat citizen  "thanks to a special interpretation" by the Ministry of Finance,  received a discount of 30 percent of the brewery's valuation  instead of the 10 percent a noncitizen would have received, so  that instead of 15.1 million German marks he paid 10.7 million.  Initially, the Fund opened its meetings on the privatization of  the brewery to the public, DANAS notes, but after two meetings,  "precisely as the privatization story was entering its final  phase," the doors were closed. "It became obvious that some of  the things discussed were not meant to be heard by everyone, and  especially not by journalists," DANAS comments. Many things  about the privatization of the brewery remain unclear, DANAS  adds, concluding that what took place behind closed doors was  politically motivated.  <H5>  Light Metal Factory Privatization Scandal </H5>   "A big scandal" is about to break out over the privatization  of the Light Metals Factory [Tvornica Lakih Metala (TLM)] in  Sibenik, which before the war in Croatia was the largest  exporter in the Sibenik-Drnis zupanija [parish] and which still  accounts for almost all of the parish's industrial production.  The 18 March issue of Zagreb GLOBUS reports that the "warnings  and cries for help" arriving more and more frequently from the  Sibenik TLM indicate that the privatization of this enterprise  could become "Croatia's robbery of the century." After three  years of "agony," the former aluminum giant, with an annual  turnover of over $250 million and 5,000 employees, is threatened  with complete collapse. Officially, TLM's total debt amounts to  140 million German marks, while its assessed value is 119  million German marks.    Sibenik residents are especially worried about the funds in  the TLM's foreign trade office, Comal, established in Munich,  Germany, when all links with the former Yugoslav company, Genex,  that had conducted TLM's foreign trade, were broken as a result  of the war. Comal's basic task was to collect from Genex all  funds that belonged to TLM and to prevent the money from ending  up in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Between 5 and 7  million German marks just sit in Comal, outside Croatia, while  debts to business partners which supply raw materials are being  repaid slowly or not at all, GLOBUS notes, adding that Sibenik  residents ask: "Is someone trying to bring the factory to total  collapse, only to buy it then for next to nothing?" There is no  interest in the current Privatization Fund offer of 66 million  German marks, but a situation is being created in which TLM  could be bought from the state for a maximum of 10 million  German marks, GLOBUS concludes.  <H5>  Mate Boban's Life Out of Power </H5>   Today, when he is no longer president of Herceg-Bosna, when  documents about abolishing Herceg-Bosna are being signed, and  when he is no longer even mentioned on Croatian television, Mate  Boban--now merely the Zagreb Tobacco Factory representative for  southern Croatia--sits in a Zagreb apartment reading newspapers  and watching television. According to the 22 March issue of the  Zagreb weekly DANAS, as he drinks Turkish coffee and smokes  three packs of cigarettes daily, he cannot stop wondering about  the turnaround by the journalists who until recently supported  him, and by the politicians whom "he brought out of anonymity."  Not only is he no longer invited to luncheons in the  Presidential Office, but he is not being consulted on the  Herceg-Bosna negotiations and does not even hear from people who  constantly used to seek favors from him.    Boban is even more disappointed when he appears on the  street, DANAS says, citing his complaint to a friend: "I cannot  believe that acquaintances are turning their faces away from me  and that they are crossing to the other side of the street.  Everyone has abandoned me." DANAS says that his disappointment  probably stems from awareness that he is the only politician  whom Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has had to renounce.  Everyone else, less important figures, even those who publicly  opposed the president's views, remain on the team, DANAS notes,  nevertheless giving Boban credit for the fact that "Croats from  Bosnia-Herzegovina will not accept any kind of federation which  reduces the rights to which they are entitled as a sovereign  people." DANAS adds that it is a shame that Boban, through poor  organizational and personnel moves, tolerance of criminals, and  "useless" violation of the human rights of the Bosnian Muslims,  missed his chance to implement a concept of Herceg-Bosna  acceptable to the West. Neither he nor his generation can  correct this, but future generations will surely remember it,  the weekly concludes.</p>

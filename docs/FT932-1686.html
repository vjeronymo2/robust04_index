			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / International Company News: HSBC opens fifth China branch HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation has opened its fifth branch in China in a further sign of foreign banks extending their presence on the mainland to take advantage of booming trade and investment opportunities, writes Tony Walker in Beijing. HSBC's latest branch is located in Tianjin and will complement its branches in Shanghai and in southern China. Standard Chartered Bank and Banque National de Paris are among foreign banks in the north-eastern port city. The People Bank of China, the country's central bank, has also approved applications by Credit Lyonnais and Societe General to establish branches in Tianjin. China's strategy is to open coastal trading cities to foreign banks as a first step towards allowing greater foreign involvement in its banking sector.</p>

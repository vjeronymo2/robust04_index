			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / SA approves multiracial transitional executive SOUTH AFRICA yesterday took a further historic step to end exclusive white rule when parliament passed a bill to establish a multiracial Transitional Executive Council, a move which will trigger the lifting of all remaining non-military sanctions. Passage of the bill marks the symbolic end of white hegemony and economic isolation. The transitional executive, which will bring blacks a share of power for the first time, will boost black morale, while the removal of 30 years of economic sanctions will help the morale of most whites. However, right-wing whites have vowed to fight the transitional executive. Members of the ultra-right Conservative party walked out of the chamber yesterday after President F W de Klerk's ruling National party passed the bill by 211 votes to 36 in a parliament which excludes blacks. Parliament's assent followed an accord two weeks ago at the multi-party constitutional negotiating forum. The African National Congress had, however, said the passage of the bill through parliament was a condition for the lifting of non-military sanctions. Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC president, is expected to call for the removal of remaining sanctions - apart from the international arms em-bargo - when he addresses the UN today in New York. Passage of the transitional executive bill should permit Pretoria to re-establish normal relations with the International Monetary Fund, which is likely to provide some Dollars 800m (Pounds 526m) from its compensatory and contingency financing facility to compensate South Africa for losses incurred as a result of drought in 1992. Good relations with the IMF will improve South Africa's ability to borrow commercially overseas. The council, which will include one member from each of the 20-odd parties negotiating a new constitution, will take office only after agreement has been reached on a new constitution - a process which could take months.</p>

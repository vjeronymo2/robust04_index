			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Money Markets: The D-Mark wanes PROBLEMS stemming from German unification have changed sentiment surrounding the D-Mark. It is no longer such a restraining influence on monetary policy among the members of the European exchange rate mechanism, and by its own weakness against the dollar threatens to increase inflationary pressure in the ERM group as all currencies are dragged lower. The straitjacket placed on British interest rate policy, when the pound was at the bottom of the ERM, has been removed as funds have flowed out of the D-Mark and into the high yielding pound, pushing sterling to the second strongest in the system. UK rates were set to fall as inflation declined, but the malaise surrounding the D-Mark has made the task of cutting rates much easier, despite a tightening of German monetary policy. It is not clear whether last week's increase in the Bundesbank's fixed securities repurchase agreement rate will result in higher official rates at Thursday's central bank council meeting. Nevertheless, the rise was opportune. It came on the same day that Germany announced its second consecutive monthly current account deficit. Economists at London's National Westminster Bank expect Germany's current account surplus to shrink to Dollars 12bn from Dollars 44.1bn this year, and believe a deficit is possible, with the strains placed on the economy by the east meaning there is little realistic chance of recovery in the next couple of years. NatWest does not expect much further weakening of the D-Mark however, and it forecasts that the dollar will average DM1.72 in the fourth quarter, while sterling will have weakened to DM2.89 from the present level of almost DM3.00.</p>

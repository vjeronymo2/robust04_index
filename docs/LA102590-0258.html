			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> WAYLON FINALLY MAKES THE GRADE  </P> <P> lon Jennings has had fame and fortune as a country singer.  </P> <P> Now, with a high school equivalency diploma, he says he has the edge.  </P> <P> Jennings, who dropped out in the 10th grade, passed the exam in December.  </P> <P> "Going back to get your high school diploma isn't the answer to all your  problems by any means, but I'll tell you what it is: It's a psychological  advantage," he said.  </P> <P> "It gives you that little bitty edge. It'll make you go through a door that you  wouldn't have gone through if you didn't have it, because you knew that  somebody on the other side of the door was educated."  </P></p>

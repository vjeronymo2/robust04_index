			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YAROSLAVSKY APPEARS A SHOO-IN IN 5TH DISTRICT COUNCIL ELECTION  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the politically ambitious and  controversial lawmaker who has reigned over the 5th District for nearly 14  years, appears headed for another term as Tuesday's primary approaches.  </P> <P> Yaroslavsky, 40, has the support of a broad coalition of neighborhood leaders,  environmentalists and political activists. He has also raised more than  $215,000 for districtwide mailings, telephone banks, yard signs and other  get-out-the-vote efforts, the latest campaign finance reports show.  </P> <P> The councilman, who has stressed his experience, his support for more police  officers and his co-authorship of the city's landmark slow-growth initiative,  is happy with his campaign, said spokeswoman Karin Caves.  </P> <P> "We think things are going very well," Caves said. "Zev's very popular and  hard-working, and he has a good record of serving his constituents."  </P> <P> Throughout the campaign, Yaroslavsky's three foes have tried to weaken him by  charging that the 5th District is collapsing under the weight of commercial  development and traffic congestion. They also contend that the councilman  ignored the district for 18 months while exploring a possible mayoral bid.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prime Challenger  </P> <P> Environmental activist Laura M. Lake, seen as his most serious challenger,  contends that development interests have taken precedence in communities such  as Rancho Park, site of the Westside Pavilion mall, and Beverly-La Cienega,  where Ma Maison Sofitel and the Beverly Center mall are. She has pledged to  devote herself to improving the quality of peoples' lives.  </P> <P> Lake is spending the final week of the campaign touring the district -- which  includes Westwood, Century City, the Beverly-Fairfax area, West Los Angeles and  parts of Sherman Oaks, Studio City and North Hollywood -- with a billboard on  wheels that cites all the problems facing the district.  </P> <P> Lake and her supporters have also spent the past weeks canvassing and  telephoning voters. Campaign manager Marcela Howell said Lake, a longtime  activist who heads Friends of Westwood and Not Yet New York and who has been  endorsed by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and such organizations as the  Communications Workers of America and the Westside and Sherman Oaks Democratic  clubs, is concentrating her attention on rallying her troops.  </P> <P> "Our whole focus this week is turning out voters," Howell said. "It's a  volatile race, and what we're hearing is that it's not a shoo-in for Zev."  </P> <P> Lake's latest campaign report shows that she has raised about $100,000, far  less than she had hoped for. But, Howell said, the campaign is receiving strong  volunteer support. Fifty people are walking door-to-door on Lake's behalf, and  another 25 are making telephone calls during the final days of the campaign,  Howell said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Targeted Mailings  </P> <P> The campaign is also doing some targeted mailings. "We had absolutely no  intention of trying to match Zev dollar-for-dollar in fund raising, mail or  anything," Howell said. "But we are getting Laura's message out."  </P> <P> Ryan Snyder, a 34-year-old transportation consultant with almost no money who  has been campaigning door-to-door since August, has narrowed his focus in  recent weeks to issues involving tenants and San Fernando Valley residents.  </P> <P> Snyder favors stronger rent-control protections for senior citizens. He has  called for an end to unlimited rent increases on vacated apartments and  advocates the replacement of affordable rental units that are demolished.  </P> <P> On the Valley side of the district, Snyder is telling voters that he is  squarely opposed to the construction of any kind of rail system. Snyder  contends that ride-sharing, upgraded bus service, upgraded taxi service and  other public transportation improvements would be more cost-effective.  </P> <P> Snyder and about 15 volunteers are also walking door-to-door, passing out  copies of his detailed position paper on issues facing the district. In recent  forums, Snyder has impressed many observers with his detailed knowledge of  transportation and his ideas for improving it. He says his support is strong.  </P> <P> "I've gained a lot of name recognition, and a lot of people have respect for  me," Snyder said. "I may not be considered the front-runner, but I am helping  to set the agenda. People will be surprised at how well I do."  </P> <P> Jack McGrath, 43, the often irreverent write-in candidate who used to work as  Yaroslavsky's campaign manager and chief deputy, has tried to present a more  serious message during the final weeks of the council campaign.  </P> <P> McGrath, the only Valley resident in the race, has keyed his message to other  Valley residents who may be worried about gridlock and commercial growth.  McGrath says he would prevent the level of development that has occurred in  communities such as Westwood and the Beverly-La Cienega area. McGrath has also  promised to provide more parking in commercial zones.  </P> <P> He is spending $4,000 on cable television commercials airing during the final  week of the campaign and is distributing 5,000 pencils that say "Write In  McGrath." He also has an active volunteer network, he says.  </P> <P> "Our campaign is a street operation, and now it's being reinforced visually  through the commercials," McGrath said. "I'm also organizing students to work  for me on Election Day."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Ministry of Finance Formulates Three New Polices </F> on Contracting for Responsibility by Enterprises"]    [Text] The main contents include: 1) Correctly fixing  the base for contracting. Enterprises which have realized a  steady increase in profits in the previous three years should  increase tax and profit payments by 8-15 percent; enterprises  which have experienced falling profits in the previous two years  should take the amount of taxes and profits they handed over  last year as a base for contracting, which will remain unchanged  for three years, and when an enterprise has surplus income, a  portion of it should be retained by the enterprise and a portion  of it should he handed over to the state; enterprises which have  experienced both increasing and decreasing profits in the  previous three years, should fix their base for contracting  according to the amount of taxes and profits handed over in  those three year. 2) Establish an enterprise risk fund. From  profits retained by enterprises, 10 percent should be earmarked  to reserve contracting in case enterprises earn no profits. 3)  Upgrade the appreciation rate of assets as a main target when  considering enterprises' contracting activities.</p>

			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Construction loss leaves Shanks &amp; McEwan at Pounds 10m SHANKS &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, yesterday reported a 62 per cent fall in profits, as forewarned four weeks ago, after heavy losses in its construction division. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March fell from Pounds 27.1m to Pounds 10.2m on turnover down 10 per cent at Pounds 131m. Sales in the construction division fell Pounds 17m as a result of provisions for late payment of contracts and payments it could not be sure of collecting. Mr Gordon Waddell, chairman, said the disappointing results masked a strong performance in the core businesses. He recognised he would need to restore the group's credibility which had been dented by the construction problems. Earnings per share fell from 9.9p to 4.1p but the group is to recommend a final dividend of 3.44p, holding the total at 5.68p. The core waste management division increased turnover by 10 per cent to Pounds 106.7m. Before exceptional items, pre-tax profits from waste management activities increased from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 26.3m. Mr Waddell said the recession had lasted longer than anticipated and there was no evidence of an upturn in the group's business. Pre-tax profits from waste were unlikely to differ materially from last year's level and the construction side was likely to incur losses in the order of Pounds 3m. Most of this represents the interest charge to fund contracts completed but under dispute or not yet paid. Shanks warned earlier this month it would be setting up a Pounds 19.3m provision in the 1993 accounts to cover reorganisation of its construction division encompassing late payments and sums relating to variations in contracts that it is not certain it will collect. Mr Waddell also said the group was 'disappointingly' still awaiting implementation of waste management licensing under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. COMMENT Shanks and McEwan has well and truly bitten the bullet on its construction side, possibly even over-providing against non-payment of completed contracts. Yesterday's figures threw up no new problem contracts but the group will have a continuing, though reducing, interest charge as long as payment is not made. Aside from this construction blot, Shanks has performed commendably during a tough recession. The real question is when recovery is going to creep beyond the consumer sector and into heavy industry and the chemicals sector, on which it is so heavily dependent. The company is also having to contend with an Environment Department apparently soft pedalling on implementation of some of the legislation Shanks has been investing to meet. It is not a happy time for waste companies. This year the company is likely to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 26m, or earnings of 9.7p, giving a prospective multiple of about 18.</p>

His Recruitment and Long-Time Work May  Undoubtedly Be Recognized as Domestic Intelligence Service's  Success"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The press bureau of the  Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] would not give  official comments on the arrest of Aldrich Hazen Ames. A  "no-comment" response in such cases means an indirect  recognition of an uncovered agent's cooperation with one secret  service or another. An informed intelligence expert, who asked  not to be identified, answering your NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA  correspondent's question whether this incident is the FIS' worst  setback recently, said: "I would look at the incident from a  different side and I would say as follows: The fact that our  intelligence service has had such an agent for such a long time  is undoubtedly a great success. Undoubtedly, he was worth the  great amount of money that was paid to him. The situation  should not be dramatized and the scandals should not be blown  out of proportion. No one has yet canceled intelligence  activity after all. Our agents do in the United States just  what theirs do here, nothing more. As a matter of fact, when we  catch their spies we do not demand that their diplomats be  expelled. It would be most unwelcome if this episode causes  tension in Russian-American relations. The United States needs  us just as we need them."</p>

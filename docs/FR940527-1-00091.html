			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Extraordinary Circumstances Exceptions Payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;412.348(e))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, &sect;412.348(e) provides that a hospital may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request an additional payment during the capital transition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period if the hospital incurs an unanticipated capital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditure in excess of $5 million (net of insurance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proceeds) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not limited to a flood, fire, or earthquake. A hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must apply to the HCFA regional office, for a determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the HCFA Administrator, within 180 days of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary circumstance that caused the unexpected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expenditures in order to qualify for exceptions payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We propose to revise &sect;412.348 to clarify our policy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reconcile conflicts between the regulation text and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language and intent of the preamble to the August 30, 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule that implemented prospective payment system for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital-related costs (56 FR 43411).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to current &sect;412.348(e)(1), we intend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarify that the minimum expenditure criteria that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital must meet in order to qualify for payments is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> net amount of proceeds expected to be recovered by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital in connection with the event from any other source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including, but not limited to, insurance, litigation, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other government relief funding. In the August 30, 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule, in response to a comment concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions process, we indicated that we intended to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for an additional payment when a hospital has extraordinary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances that result in unanticipated capital spending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of at least $5 million. We then stated that in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether this threshold was met, we would take into account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any insurance proceeds received by the hospital in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with the extraordinary circumstances. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we inadvertently failed to list other sources that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the unanticipated capital-related expense to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital. Later in that response we noted that HCFA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision will be contingent on a final determination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated costs for the unanticipated circumstance and we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided an example of how the extraordinary circumstance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception policy would be applied. In that example we noted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the hospital must provide evidence of the extent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the loss will be covered by insurance proceeds or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other sources. In the regulations text, we reflected our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intention to establish the threshold net of insurance but  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> did not include the other comparable sources, such as court  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> awards for damages, or other governmental relief funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of establishing this exception was to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protect hospitals during the transition period from out-of-pocket expenditures at a level that could put severe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial strain on them. Thus, we clearly did not intend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to replace or supplement other payment sources that have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligation to pay or provide special authorization for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funding in these same circumstances. As a result, we intend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to revise current &sect;412.348(e)(1) to conform with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example provided in the August 30, 1991 final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning application of the extraordinary circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception policy and, specifically, documentation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence of the extent of net loss.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also propose to correct the provision in current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.348(e)(2) regarding the level at which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of a hospital's eligibility for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extraordinary circumstance exception payment is made.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the determination authority was reserved to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFA Administrator, we believe that the appropriate official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make this decision is the Director of the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Payment Policy, Bureau of Policy Development, Health Care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Financing Administration. This change is warranted because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it is inappropriate that the HCFA Administrator make a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision that he or she may be called on to review if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital requests an administrative appeal of an adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision on its exceptions application. As the director of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HCFA component that determines policy on hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payment in general and exceptions payment policy in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, the Director of the Office of Payment Policy is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ideally suited to make the determination on an exceptions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request. The determination is subject to the appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures of subpart R of 42 CFR part 405 when the provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receives the NPR for the cost reporting period for which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider is seeking additional payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Funding of Depreciation (&sect;&sect;413.134 and 413.153)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act gives the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> broad latitude to prescribe regulations concerning Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> payments to providers on a reasonable cost basis. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this authority, &sect;413.134(e) provides that, although we do  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not require the funding of depreciation, we strongly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommend it as a means of conserving funds for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement of depreciable assets.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Offset of Investment Income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To encourage the funding of depreciation, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified at &sect;&sect;413.134(e)(1) and 413.153(b)(2)(iii) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investment income earned on funded depreciation will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to reduce allowable interest expense. Further,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;413.134(e) stipulates that additions to the funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation account must remain in the account for at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6 months to be considered valid funding transactions and be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligible for the benefits of a funded depreciation account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Virgin territory for Thorn FT-SE Index: 2,533.1 (-5.2) The music business has singed a few fingers in its time, as mid-1980s investors in Thorn EMI, publicly quoted Virgin, and Chrysalis pre-takeover will no doubt testify. Yesterday, though, all that seemed to belong to a different era as the stock market responded to Thorn's acquisition of Virgin music and accompanying Pounds 516m rights issue by marking the bidder's shares 3 per cent higher. It is certainly hard to fault any of the financial engineering. Thorn could hardly have paid with borrowed money, given Virgin's negligible net assets and the size of the necessary goodwill write off. The two-stage structure on the new stock, moreover, looks attractive, given that payment of the promised final dividend of perhaps 21.5p will likely coincide with the second instalment in October. Regulators being what they are, it would not be worth betting on the deal being cleared before late summer. Even so, shareholders have to take a lot on trust to believe Thorn's claim of quadrupled Virgin profits and earnings enhancement in year two. EMI, admittedly, has managed to double margins since 1987. It deserves credit for the strong position it has established in the US, and no doubt has a pretty shrewd idea of the cost savings from bringing manufacturing in house and trimming the artist list. Integrating Virgin into its extensive distribution network will boost volume. Against this, what price a longer than anticipated climb back from recession on both sides of the Atlantic? It is easy to get carried away, too, by the valuations which Wall Street in particular places on the music business. Applying the relatively sober 1.6 times sales which Thorn has paid for Virgin to Thorn's own music business may suggest that UK investors are a bit grudging. But without any takeover potential, or an imminent float, it is surely wiser to concentrate on an earnings stream.</p>

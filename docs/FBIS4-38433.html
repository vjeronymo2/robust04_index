			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Natalya Gorodetskaya report from the "Innovations" column: </F> "Sergey Filatov: The Government Is Moving From Lobbying to  Comprehension. It Is Proposed To Share Out the Burden of  Economic Crisis Equally Among Everybody"]    [Text] Presidential Chief of Staff Sergey Filatov spent  the past weekend with Nikolay Medvedev, head of the Directorate  for Liaison with the Territories, in Penza where they inspected  a cantonment and met with district administration chiefs and  deputies of the oblast legislative assembly. In the established  tradition of first acquainting the Russian heartland with  pending changes in economic policy, Sergey Filatov told those  present that in June 1994 the annual credit rate in Russia will  be reduced to 180 percent. According to him, "the process of  reducing the credit rate will continue also in the future," and  in the end the notion of easy credits will be excluded from  Russian economics while the banking system "will enter a  civilized path."    Today, Mr. Filatov said, more material assets, especially  foreign exchange, are being taken out of Russian than brought  into it from abroad. Whereas the Russian economy needs $10-12  billion to "revive," we have only $2-2.5 billion, Mr. Filatov  stated, and therefore the country's leadership is drafting  measures to ensure that the hard currency returns to Russia. In  his opinion, the Russian tax system is ineffective: An increase  in tax collection by a mere 20 percent will make it possible to  cut the planned budget deficit by 73 billion rubles. Mr.  Filatov described the process of closing down loss-making state  enterprises as "normal and natural." He identified two lines for  reforming the state sector in industry: "reorganization of the  state enterprise management system which will make it possible  to put things in order and create a barrier to abuses by the  body of directors using enterprise funds for their own personal  aims, and also provision of state assistance to enterprises  which have found a niche in the market economy." In the near  future, Mr. Filatov said, offering a revealing glimpse of  government, industrial enterprises will be exempted from the  requirement to maintain social programs. In time, social  amenities will be transferred to the jurisdiction of local  self-government and will be financed from budget funds.    According to the presidential chief of staff, it is  necessary  to share out "the burden of the present economic crisis" equally  among all strata of Russian society. "Last year the gap between  the rich and the poor was three- to four-fold but now it has  grown to 14- fold," he said. At the same time in developed  countries this indicator does not exceed five. "The social  differentiation currently observed in Russia," Sergey Filatov  stressed, "is fraught with instability because our people are  particularly sensitive to injustice." He did not however  specify how it is planned to apportion this burden "in equal  shares."    According to Mr. Filatov, the Russian leadership is moving  from the policy of lobbying to the policy of comprehensive  economic reforms. One such measure will be cutting sectoral  subsidies and privileges because such investments are becoming  "a drug just for one day." "In the future," Mr. Filatov  stressed, "investments will be made in promising projects and  efficient enterprises." The presidential apparatus is drafting  a package of state targeted programs: In the very near future  the following programs will be submitted to the president:  Russia's Natural Resources (on mineral deposits); National  Information Networks; Russia's Health (on supplying the  country's population with medicines); Development of Power  Engineering and Alternative Energy Sources; Energy Saving  Resources; Public Telephone (this program envisions a  substantial increase in telephone networks for the public);  Protein and the Food Industry; Ecology; and Cadres and Education  of the Future.    Sergey Filatov is already thinking about future cadres,  especially those who will be taking part in the 1996 election  campaign. "We intend to rename the Russian Management Academy  the Russian Academy of Civil Service and educate there new  politicians from among provincial political leaders,  entrepreneurs, and other categories of Russian citizens," he  said. Furthermore, education of future cadres, according to the  presidential chief of staff, will be facilitated by the pending  law on civil service.    Talking about the state anticrime program, Mr. Filatov  estimated it at 4 billion rubles. Until this program has begun  to work at full capacity, Filatov called for support for the  Moscow mayor's initiative, and "everywhere, where it is possible  and where there are sufficient funds and the will exists, create  workers' volunteer groups to maintain order in residential  districts."</p>

			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Decline in rate of US industrial growth US industrial growth slowed last month, with output rising only 0.2 per cent compared with a 0.5 per cent gain in February, the Federal Reserve reported yesterday. The figure, although broadly in line with analysts' forecasts, follows other recent evidence of a sluggish economy, including a fall in retail sales and flat employment last month. In the first quarter, production declined at an annual rate of 4.1 per cent from the previous quarter. This was mainly because of a sharp fall in output in January. It is the second successive quarter of industrial contraction. On an annual comparison, however, industrial production was up 2.1 per cent in the twelve months to March, reflecting a recovery in output last summer. The Fed remains anxious about the pace of recovery. Last week it surprised financial markets by signalling a quarter-point cut in short-term interest rates to 3.75 per cent, the first reduction since December. Many analysts anticipate a further modest easing of monetary policy if the economy fails to gather momentum. Most economists are projecting modest growth of industrial output in coming months. This reflects relatively strong growth in demand in consumer spending in the first quarter and a projected rebuilding of corporate inventories after liquidation of stocks in recent months. Figures published yesterday showed the ratio of business inventories to sales continued to fall in February, reflecting stronger than expected demand. Most industrial sectors were sluggish in March. Manufacturing output edged up 0.1 per cent but capacity utilisation at factories fell 0.1 per cent to 77 per cent. Output of construction supplies fell 0.2 per cent. Output of non-durable consumer goods rose 0.4 per cent, but this mainly reflected a sharp 2.1 per cent rise in the output of utilities, a reaction after declines due to unseasonably warm weather. The strongest sector was durable consumer goods, which rose 0.5 per cent despite a decline in car production.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by President Yoweri Museveni on the 13th </F> anniversary of the National Resistance Army formation at Lubiri  parade grounds in Kampala on 6 February--live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The National Resistance Army  [NRA] must always be conscious that they are now the principal  weapon of the people of Uganda. Therefore, when they are given  an assignment, they should ensure that they do it well and  retain the respect of the population.    And that brings me to corruption within the Army. There has  been corruption in parts of the Army, quite widespread  corruption. You remember the other time I had to abolish the  giving of food because it had become a source of corruption for  those who were handling food and I had to order the giving of  money directly to the soldier so the soldier can buy his own  food instead of having food centrally bought. When I wrested  the food money out of the hands of those who were misusing it  then they looked for new ways of how to steal -- fuel, I don't  know what, tires, even these salaries, they resurrect dead  soldiers, put them on the pay sheet and so on. The Army  leadership has been directed by the Army Council and by myself  to fight corruption, to continue to fight corruption.    And you, the ordinary soldiers, should always expose  corruption in your meetings; in battalion meetings, you should  expose corruption. Don't fear, there is nothing the thieves can  do to you, especially if you shout loudly and you are heard. We  are here to defend you. But if you keep quiet, then they steal  things there, we won't know. We shall not know. But of course  the leadership of the Army must also be active in inspection.  They must inspect regionally so that we catch those who are  stealing. So there must be a double movement. Inspections from  the top and exposure from below.    The exercise of reduction in force has gone ahead well. Last  year we reduced the force by 23,000 men. We are now going to  reduce another 10,000. Now, this will leave, as the army  commander was saying, a smaller army, but better equipped. An  army is not human beings alone. In modern warfare if you send  human beings only in war, they will be [words indistinct]. They  need equipment, full equipment. We don't want ultra-modern  equipment. We can't afford it. But, fortunately, the likely  enemies we have in Africa also don't have ultra-modern  equipment. But we need modest equipment to guard our frontiers  and I am pleased to say that since the reduction in the force,  we have liberated money, we have saved money which we have used  to upgrade the equipment of the Army. The Army now is better  equipped than it was last year and we shall continue to upgrade  the equipment. [passage omitted]</p>

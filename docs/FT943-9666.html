			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Modest recovery seen in land deals A 'modest recovery' in conveyancing and secured credit activity in England and Wales in the year to the end of March was highlighted in the annual report of the Land Registry published yesterday. Mr John Manthorpe, chief land registrar and chief executive, said it offered the prospect of some stability in the property and secured lending markets. By meeting all the financial targets set in the Registry's first year as a trading fund it had been possible to recommend reductions in the statutory scale fees to come into effect later this year. Mr Manthorpe said computerisation of the land register could lead to the further simplification of conveyancing. Income was Pounds 232m, against Pounds 205m the previous year, and a dividend of Pounds 3.3m was payable to the Treasury. Land Registry report and accounts 1993-94. HMSO. Pounds 12.90.</p>

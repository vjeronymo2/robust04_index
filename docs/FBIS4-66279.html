			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Jiekang (7357 0094 1660), Cao Guangfu (2580 </F> 0342 4395), Wang Xuefei (3769 7185 7236), Xu Sihua (1776 1835  5478), and Gu Xinhua (7357 2450 5478) from the Research Office  of Jiangsu Provincial Committee: "Reflections on the Issue of  Carrying Out the Rural Enterprise Stock System in Jiangsu"]    [Text] Recently, we conducted a systematic investigation  on carrying out the stock system in the rural enterprises of  Jiangsu Province. We visited the five cities of Suzhou,  Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Yancheng, Xuzhou, and 10 counties and  districts. According to relevant information, by the end of  August 1993 Jiangsu had 8,801 township enterprises (bodies)  under various stock systems (excluding Huaiyin City). Total  capital stock was 7.569 billion yuan, of which 2.088 billion  yuan was newly increased capital stock. Viewed from regional  distribution, more than 60 percent of them were located in the  three cities of Nantong, Yancheng, and Yangzhou. Viewed from the  proportion of stock system enterprises in township enterprises,  7.45 percent was the average figure for the whole province, and  the above-mentioned three cities made up respectively 27.56  percent, 12.98 percent, and 6.92 percent, whereas the three  cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou only made up 1.74 percent,  3.64 percent, and 5.59 percent. There are five types of stock  systems now being carried out in various places: increase the  number of shares, discount the number of existing shares,  joining shares by legal persons, joint partnership shares, and  collective shares by individuals. Most were transformed from  original collective enterprises. Altogether, there were 5,676,  accounting for 64.5 percent of the existing stock-sharing  enterprises. Trends show that southern Jiangsu primarily focused  on collective enterprises and northern Jiangsu mainly targeted  individual and private economies to implement stock systems. We  can see from the above data that Jiangsu had an uneven  development in carrying out the township enterprise stock  system. However, the general trend is that it is unfolding from  pilot programs to large areas, and in some cities and counties  the practice is gradually gaining momentum.  <H5>  Evaluation of Carrying Out the Stock System at Present </H5>   In general, in recent years various localities carried out  the stock system by pilot programs, promoted it only after  gaining experience, and development has been healthy. Practice  shows that carrying out the township enterprise stock system is  another great creation of the Chinese farmer. It is also another  new breakthrough in continuing rural reform at present. Viewed  from achievements made in various localities, the role of this  move stands out in the following five areas: It is conducive to  (1) clarifying the relationships of property rights in  enterprises; (2) strengthening the sense of masters and risk on  the part of the cadres and staff of enterprises; (3) increasing  new channels for raising capital; (4) adjusting the  organizational structure and product mix, and strengthening the  competitiveness of enterprises; and (5) establishing and  perfecting constraining mechanisms, and standardizing collective  economic organizations of communities and the managerial  behavior toward enterprises by the government.    At present, current problems in carrying out the stock  system are mainly: One, some cadres and masses have so far not  unified their thinking. They still have quite a few "mistakes"  and doubts in understanding. Second, some localities over  emphasized the fund-raising function of stocks and neglected the  transformation of management mechanism of enterprises. Thus, the  stock system became a mere formality. Three, there was a lack of  standardization in demarcating property rights and establishing  stock rights. Particularly, controversy grew intense and  practices varied over two issues, namely, the establishment of  enterprise stocks and the change of collective stocks to  individuals. Four, the proportion of individual stock  partnership was low, only about 10 to 15 percent throughout most  parts of the province. In practice, it is difficult to increase  the staff's concern over the performance of enterprise  management by this proportion. It is also very difficult to  bring into play the superiority of the stock system. Five,  relevant policies do not match. Particularly, the nature of  enterprises under stock systems, registration, and credit  policies are not clear yet. This has affected the enthusiasm and  initiative of enterprises.  <H5>  The Issue of Linking the Stock System to the Contract </H5> Management Responsibility System    Some comrades believe that practicing the stock system  means the replacement of the contract management responsibility  system. This is a misunderstanding. There is no exclusionary  relationship between the stock system and the contract  management responsibility system. What the stock system solves  is the property rights of enterprises, that is, the ownership of  assets. What the contract management responsibility system  solves is the management mechanism of enterprises. Some people  simply put this kind of relationship into "property rights are  shared in the form of stocks and management is revealed in  contracts." This statement is reasonable. For township  enterprises to establish modern enterprise systems, there should  be a good combination of the stock system and the contract  management responsibility system. Mutually complementary, these  two systems will bring their roles into full play.    In terms of linking the stock system to the contract  management responsibility system, Zhenjiang's experience is  worth noting. Their practice is "two changes and two  nonchanges." That is, "the form of distribution changes but  contractors normally do not change; plans for management and  development change in accordance with actual circumstances, but  the contract quota system normally does not change." "Stocks"  and "contracting" will combine to achieve a stable link. Board  of directors, board of supervisors, and stock holders meetings  must actually exercise their functions and powers. Township  governments must reduce their administrative interference in  enterprises. The form of entrusting stock holder representation  can be employed to ensure the appreciation of collective assets  of enterprises under the stock system. Experiences of grassroots  organizations show that the relationship between township  governments and enterprises practicing stock systems should  include four areas: planning, coordination, supervision, and  service. At the same time, attention should be paid to training  a contingent of township entrepreneurs who have vision, clear  thoughts, know how to manage businesses, and are knowledgeable  of modern commodity economy. Only by so doing can we truly  establish a highly efficient enterprise management mechanism in  which property rights are clear, two powers are separated, and  shareholders participate in democratic management and democratic  supervision.  <H5>  The Issue of the Distribution of Benefits </H5>   The distribution of benefits is a critical link in  carrying out the stock system. Whether this can be handled well  has an important impact on mobilizing the enthusiasm of the  collective, enterprises, and individuals so as to let the stock  systems develop in a healthy way. Two principles should be  adhered to in distributing benefits: One is the principle of  rational accumulation to accumulate reserve strength for the  development of enterprises. Earnings resulting from tax  reduction or remittance on other preferential policies can be  retained in enterprises as "state support funds" to be used for  developing production, but not for profit distribution. These  funds belong to all stockholders. Two is the combination of the  principle of distribution according to work and distributing  profits according to stock shares. In terms of distribution  according to work, enterprises can determine the form of  distribution within the scope of ratified wages. In the  implementation of distributing profits according to stock  shares, the principles that should be carried out are  "effectiveness determines distribution," and "hand in first, put  aside reserves, and then distribute." After taxes are turned in,  the accumulation funds, public welfare funds, and bonus funds  can be withdrawn. Then, profit funds can be withdrawn. In  principle, profit distribution has no maximum or minimum  limitations. What is actually implemented is that both benefits  and risks are shared. In enterprises under the stock system, in  practice profit distribution after taxes are turned in is done  in various localities by adopting "50-50 distribution." That is,  50 percent will serve as enterprise development funds, and the  other 50 percent as profits and staff welfare funds and bonus  funds. Within a certain period of time, the distribution of the  "50-50" proportion is feasible, provided that enterprises have  retained adequate production development funds. This form of  distribution is conducive to gradually training stockholders in  a sense of risk and reducing difficulties in setting up the  stock system.    In various localities the distribution of benefits from  individual shares takes three forms, namely, drawing extra  dividends while retaining interest, drawing extra dividends  while taking interest, and drawing extra dividends while  excluding interest. For the stock system to become standardized  as much as possible, the practice of drawing extra dividends  while taking interest should be gradually transferred to drawing  extra dividends while excluding interest. Drawing extra  dividends while retaining interest should not be advocated.  Stock system enterprises that have implemented the practice of  drawing extra dividends while retaining interest should change  within one or two years (normally the limit is within one cycle  of profits distribution) into drawing extra dividends while  excluding interest. Only drawing extra dividends while excluding  interest can actually strengthen the staff's sense of risk,  enhance the staff's concern over the business performance of  enterprises, and thus form a management mechanism of sharing  both benefits and risks.    In the perfection of a stimulus mechanism for benefit  distribution, we can imagine some measures as follows:    1. Increase the volume of individual shares. Enterprises  that  have conditions can gradually increase the proportion of  individual shares in the total capital of enterprises as much as  30 percent, or greater. At the same time, they should encourage  management decision makers to invest more shares, invest large  shares, and gradually form enterprise stock controlling circles.    2. To mobilize enthusiasm of the staff, 10 percent to 20  percent of the collective stocks can be taken out as the basis  for drawing extra dividends but the ownership will not be  transferred. A change of such a share should be accompanied by  one or two cash matching shares from the staff.    3. After implementing the stock system, profits that were  originally turned in to the township after taxes can be  substituted by drawing extra dividends according to shares. Any  dividends above 20 percent can be retained in enterprises for  the expansion of collective shares.  <H5>  The Issue of Matching Policies </H5>   Many policy issues are involved in the system change of  stocks. Viewed from general areas, attention should be given to  work in four areas. One, the departments concerned in the  province should work out relevant policies and regulations as  soon as possible. Two, establish and perfect rural cooperative  economic organizations to exercise the management function of  collective assets. Three, establish rural cooperative economic  accounting offices and auditing offices as soon as possible.  Four, establish share rights circulation service organizations,  and guide the rational flow of property rights in stock system  enterprises within a certain scope. We suggest that policies in  the following areas be clarified in the near future:    1. The nature of enterprises should be clarified. Various  types of enterprises under the stock system should normally be  treated as a new type socialist economic nature and supported  vigorously.    2. When business changes and registrations take place, we  should follow the principle of "seeking truth from facts, and  simplifying formalities." Business administration departments  should examine and approve based on enterprise charters and have  them registered as their first priority. When old enterprises  transform their systems, fees should be charged only as  registration change.    3. In the areas of credit, township enterprises that had  stock system changes should still be treated as the nature of  their original enterprise. Appropriate support should be given  to stock system enterprises with individual stock pooling.  Individually pooled shares, which are also an important aspect  of consumption funds being changed into production development  funds, should be encouraged.</p>

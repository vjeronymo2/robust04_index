			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: More Pratt &amp; Whitney cuts THE PARLOUS state of the US commercial aviation industry was underscored yesterday by Pratt &amp; Whitney's decision to expand and accelerate its planned job cuts to 7,500 by the middle of next year from 5,000 by 1995. Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aero-engine manufacturing division of United Technologies, said it was responding to pressures from declining new commercial engine deliveries next year. Aircraft manufacturers have slashed their combined 1993 production plans to 632 aircraft from 801. Largely as a result, Pratt &amp; Whitney said its manufacturing volume for all engine models would be 21 per cent below 1992 levels. In spite of the increase in job cuts, the company does not expect to incur additional charges. Earlier this year, United Technologies took charges of Dollars 1.5bn to cover restructuring moves and environmental costs. A company spokesman said some flexibility had been built into the earlier restructuring plans. In addition, many of the new job cuts are expected to come from hourly workers, who are less costly to lay off than salaried employees. Shares in United Technologies barely moved on the news yesterday morning. In a letter to employees, Mr James O'Connor, Pratt &amp; Whitney's president said the reductions 'reflect drastically weakening industry conditions'. Mr O'Connor declared: 'Bankrupt airlines, too much capacity and the resulting fare wars are dragging down airline profits. These conditions are forcing airlines to reschedule their large commercial airplane and engine orders.' The company's spares business was also under pressure, Mr O'Connor said, with volumes about 25 per cent below 1990 levels. In addition, Pratt &amp; Whitney's military fighter engine business has plunged to about 100 engines in 1993 from about 700 engines a year in the early 1980s.</p>

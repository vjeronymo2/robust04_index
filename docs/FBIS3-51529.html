			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] (DYN-NA) -- President Carlos Menem and several of  his ministers united in an effort to dispel public uneasiness  over the possibility of popular uprisings such as those that  broke out recently in Santiago del Estero and Chiapas, Mexico.    "Poverty has diminished by truly unheard-of proportions,"  President Menem told reporters at Jorge Newberry Metropolitan  Airport shortly before departing for Mar del Plata. "Thus the  possibility of any kind of social unrest can be dismissed."    Turning to what critics have pegged as one cause of the  riots  in Santiago del Estero last month, when unpaid workers torched  the provincial Government House, Menem denied that his  administration's economic policies and cost cutting would lead  to further rebellions.    There is no austerity programme here," said Menem, "what  there is is a process of change and transformation that has made  possible this stability and this growth."    The head of state also defended his convening of a  sub-Cabinet one week ago Wednesday to address the need to  monitor and prevent potential revolts.    The public is asking for security," he said. "You yourselves  are constantly saying through the media that it is necessary to  implement measures that insure security, the defence of life,  property and the freedom of the individual."    Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf seconded Menem's attempt to  end speculation over new measures the government may take to  avert potential violence.    The government is not "proposing a witch hunt, nor do we  want  to instill any policy of fear in the public," Ruckauf told Radio  del Plata.    Instead, he explained, the administration is seeking to  boost  co- ordination among federal and provincial police and the  Border Guards.    Ruckauf defended the government's plan to provide new  equipment to police officers and criticized those who call for  better protection but complain about the cost.    The minister sought to downplay the likelihood that an  occurrence similar to the New Year's Day uprising by the  Zapatista National Liberation Army in Chiapas, Mexico could  happen in Argentina.    "In no way do we compare Chiapas with the episode in  Santiago," said Ruckauf. "We never said in any words that  pockets of guerrilla activity exist here."    Regarding the situation in Santiago Ruckauf pointed out that  local officials have been charged with corruption and the  national government "is hoping too to find those responsible for  the collective damage perpetrated upon residents" there.    In addition, the Joint Chiefs-of-Staff denied that Army head  Lieutenant General Martin Balza had requested a study of the  legal framework under which the military may participate in  subduing domestic disputes.    "The Army does not condition its intervention but rather it  is limited to the strict orders and directions that proceed from  the constitutional authority to which it is subordinate," said  Joint Chiefs-of-Staff spokesman Colonel Eduardo Alfonso in a  press release.    Earlier yesterday Foreign Minister Guido di Tella said told  the daily EL CRONISTA that a Chiapas-style revolt was improbable  in Argentina because this country lacks a network of guerrillas  or drug traffickers.    While Di Tella conceded that "it would be foolish to say we  are certain that no senderista defeated in Peru is hiding in  Argentina" he added that the government does not foresee any  threat to stability.    The foreign minister further rejected the possibility that  the government's economic policies could prompt rebellion,  claiming that in fact "poverty has diminished in Argentina  thanks to the cutbacks."</p>

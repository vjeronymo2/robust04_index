			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Advance checked as the profit-takers appear - Market Report The six-day bull run on the London stock market met its expected check yesterday, but not until it had scaled new trading peaks early in the session as it continued its positive response to this week's Budget speech from the UK chancellor of the exchequer. With government bonds in retreat and pressures from stock index futures reduced somewhat, profit-taking in the stock market was no great surprise. But trading volume remained high and the tone positive. The FT-SE 100 Index was 25.1 points up at a new intraday peak of 3,258.3 within the first half-hour of official trading. Although the December futures contract maintained a good premium over the cash market, it exercised less pressure because a severe squeeze on futures positions came to an end. The Bundesbank's decision to leave its chief lending rates unchanged, although it cut its repo rate, was no surprise, but London traders took the welcome opportunity to mark share prices down in an attempt to attract stock and replenish trading books which have been depleted over the past week. As the City's optimistic reception for the Budget was consolidated in the stock market, attention turned back to the company news front. Trading results from Hanson, Racal, and MEPC brought a heavy reaction from the respective share prices. However, the banking sector blossomed after Royal Bank of Scotland increased its dividend payment. The battle weariness of the London market prevented it from sharing in the continued advance across other European bourses, and a weak opening on Wall Street gave no help. After drifting steadily down through the second half of the session, the FT-SE 100 finished a net 9.3 off at the day's low point of 3,223.9. The weight of profit-taking was indicated by another heavy volume of shares through the Seaq electronic trading system; the total of 1.0484bn shares remained among this year's highest, closely trailing Wednesday's 1.2533bn. On Wednesday, when the market was making its considered response to the chancellor's measures, retail, or customer, business in equities jumped to Pounds 2.8bn, a daily total not seen since sterling's unexpected departure from the European exchange rate mechanism in September 1992; the next comparisons would be with the heady days of the market crash of October 1987. Demand for the second line issues, which are slower to feel the effects of a change of direction in the market, remained good and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, although off the top at the close, was 0.3 up at a new peak of 3,565.9. Confidence that UK base rates will be reduced again early in the new year remained unshaken, although it was left to the bank stocks to shine among the interest rate-related issues. The international blue chips had a relatively calm session, with investors content to take profits here and there. There was little activity in oil shares as the market continued to show caution towards weak crude oil prices. However, some US interest in oil issues was reported late in the London session. Equity strategists remained bullish in their assessment of prospects for the post-Budget stock market. The Footsie has gained more than 6 per cent since investors turned bullish just a few days before the Budget speech, and investors now appear well satisfied with the measures announced by the chancellor.</p>

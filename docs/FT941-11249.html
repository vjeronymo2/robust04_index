			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Brussels moves to boost fish prices: Balladur announces new aid measures after fishermen battle police in Rennes The European Commission and the French government yesterday took steps to prop up the prices of fish and fishermen's revenues, in the wake of a series of violent protests in France. After meeting protest leaders in the Breton capital of Rennes, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur announced his second set of aid measures to fishermen in two days. The latest package includes a temporary halving of fishermen's social security payments and a revenue guarantee thereafter, as well as a doubling of the money promised on Wednesday to takesurplus fish off the market. In Brussels, the European Commission reinstated a minimum import price threshold for seven species of fish, but said the measures would run only until March 15. Brussels warned that the collapse in white fish prices, although 'undeniably linked to an import surge at abnormally lowprices', was nevertheless caused by deeper structural problems such as fallingdemand and oversupply from within the EU. Minimum import prices are the reference prices the EU uses to monitor the market and will apply to cod, haddock, hake, angler-fish, coley, Alaskan pollack and salmon. The Brussels move is almost identical to measures taken this time last year, when the Breton fleet lastdramatised the collapse in the fish market. 'The French market requiresserious analysis, which requires a combination of solutions going beyond the introduction of these safeguard clauses,' said Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, environment and fisheries commissioner, before emphasising that yesterday's measures weretemporary. Members of the Dutch parliament demanded that Dutch fishermen should get similar support from their government and expressed concern thataid to the French fishermen would otherwise distort competition inside Europe. In addition to financial aid, Mr Jean Puech, the French agriculture minister, has set up an inquiry into the efficiency of France's fish distribution network. Much of the current problem seems to stem from the fact that fishmongers, the traditional purveyors of Breton-caught fresh fish to the shops, are being squeezed out by the tendency of the big supermarkets to buy direct from large foreign suppliers. Even before imports are taken into account, the EU regimeof quotas intended to restrict over-fishing creates surges in supply. This is especially true in February, because quotas are exhausted towards the end of the preceding year, and bad weather usually keeps fishermen in port during January. Fish then flood onto the market in February as fleets rush to build up cash-flow. Cheap imports from Russia, Iceland, Poland and - especially in the case of salmon - Norway greatly add to market instability, leading in France's case to government buying in to intervention stocks at well above permitted EU levels. Fishermen's leaders expressed some satisfaction at the measures takenby Brussels and the French government. But Mr Dominique Lapart, head of the fishermen's 'survival committee' which had organised much of this week's violent protests in Paris and in Breton and Channel ports, said: 'What we still most lack is import quotas. The problem of extra-Community imports still remains.' Yesterday's clashes in Rennes saw fishermen and riot police throwing missiles and tear gas at each other and some 23 people reported hurt. Mr Balladur called for order in the town, saying that 'violence has never made anything better'.</p>

Razuvayev, doctor of political science: </F> "Ukraine: Three Scenarios on the Eve of Elections Neither One of  Which Augurs Well for Russia"]    [Text] The independence of Ukraine constituted a  challenge to Moscow, a challenge not so much to Russian national  interests, as to the wisdom and intellectual capacity of the new  ruling elite of the Russian Federation. After the disintegration  of the USSR Moscow chose to play up to Ukrainian leadership,  which is tactically interested in intensifying tensions between  the two new independent states. Problems with the Black Sea  Fleet, Crimea, and ownership of nuclear weapons deployed on  Ukrainian territory grew practically out of nothing. Problems,  in our opinion, of a tactical nature and undoubtedly of  secondary importance by comparison with the principal task.    Russian strategic interests consist not of depriving  Kiev of the right to own nuclear weapons located on Ukrainian  territory or of taking possession of the Black Sea Fleet. The  principal foreign policy task of Moscow consists of establishing  relations based on partnership, friendship, and alliance with  its Slavic neighbor. In that light problems of such apparent  urgency today concerning the fleet, nuclear weapons, and Crimea  are undoubtedly diminished.    The forthcoming parliamentary and then the June presidential  elections in Ukraine theoretically create the possibility for a  partial replacement of the ruling elite and a warming in  Russo-Ukrainian relations. At the same time Moscow is presently  confronting a crisis which was not even thought of by Russian  presidential and government analysts at the end of 1991: the  principal threats to the security of Russia emanate from  Ukraine. They are mainly of a social character and cannot be  avoided through diplomatic maneuvering or intergovernmental  agreements.    The threats we are speaking of certainly do not stem from  the  hostility of Ukrainians toward "Moskali" nor are they of a  military nature. The real problem for Moscow consists not of the  number of nuclear missiles located on Ukrainian territory, but  of the fact that the situation in Ukraine is gradually becoming  more aggravated. The government has lost control of the economy.  National currency was devaluated. There has been a significant  rise in social unrest, particularly in the eastern and southern  regions of the country. The possibility arises of the coming to  power in Kiev of a "strong individual," with whom the central  bureaucracy can hope to restore control over the country.    The social base of the regime is practically non-existent.  That caused a certain slackening of the recently highly acute  struggle between the executive and legislative powers.  Nevertheless a truce between the president and parliament in the  next several months, is practically impossible, even with  consideration of the forthcoming parliamentary elections, which  lessens the chances of the central authorities to achieve a  certain restoration of control over the situation within the  country.    Economic disintegration sharply diminished the significance  of central power in its dialogue-contest with the regions. A  number of oblasts are clearly gravitating toward separation from  central authority. That process cannot be halted given the  current conditions even with the declaration of a state of  emergency. Discipline and combat readiness of the Ukrainian army  are at a low level and personnel are demoralized.    The situation in Ukraine in effect precludes the possibility  for a substantive improvement during 1994. The ruling elite has  indicated that it is incapable of effectively managing the  government. The social position of the population deteriorated  so much that the use of shock therapy methods is impossible. It  is most likely that after the elections at the end of March  parliament shall preserve its current ambivalent character and  probably will be unable to carry out an effective reorganization  of the state and economic system.    The following scenarios are most likely in 1994 in the  development of Ukraine.    Civil war and social disturbances. That scenario is based on  the assumption that living standards of the population and the  social situation will continue deteriorating on the whole  leading to the occurrence of social unrest in individual regions  of the country. It is possible that the initial clashes actually  will be provoked by the actions of extremist nationalist  organizations of a paramilitary type. Recent measures by  Ukrainian authorities to limit their activities proved  ineffective.    It is most probable that the centers of the disturbances  will  be local while flare-ups of social protest themselves will be  episodic. At the same time the possibility exists that political  forces will be found in the country which will lead the social  disturbances. The latter will thereby gain an opportunity to  extend beyond the local framework, particularly if they are  "fed" with provocations by the extremist organizations. At  present the sole political force in Ukraine, which, at any rate  theoretically, could lead social demonstrations, consists of  local structures of the communist ilk. The competition in this  scenario is actually between Ukrainian nationalists of the  extremist type and the communists.    The principal danger for Russia in the immediate future in  this case will, in part, be posed by:    A massive influx of refugees into the border regions and  their subsequent dispersal throughout the territory of the  Russian Federation depending on familial and other ties of the  refugees;    The possibility of a sharp weakening in the control  exercised  by authorities over nuclear weapons located on the territory of  Ukraine;    Highly problematic prospects for an effective dialogue  between the current Russian authorities and the opposing forces;    An extremely high probability of participation of Russian  volunteers and representatives of Russia communist and  nationalist organizations in armed clashes or in a civil war in  Ukraine and inevitability of a resulting Russian involvement in  the Ukrainian crisis;    Possibility of the spreading of armed conflicts and  political  and social disturbances to Russian territory;    An illegal influx of weapons into Russian territory from  Ukraine;    A sharp rise in the possibility of ecological catastrophes  in  Ukraine;    Practically total liquidation of communication with Europe  through the territory of Ukraine, impossibility of utilizing gas  pipelines, oil pipelines, and ports located on the territory of  Ukraine.    It is quite evident that political and financial losses for  Russia in this scenario exceed the boundaries of the permissible.    The break-up of Ukraine into several parts. The given  scenario proceeds from the assumption that the social, economic,  and political crisis in Ukraine will lead to a change in the  relative equilibrium of forces between central authorities and  the regional elite in favor of the latter. In this case the  local political elite will favor disintegration of the country  in order to halt the break-up of the state even if at the  regional level. The given variant presupposes a relatively  peaceful break-up of Ukraine. The initial opposition will be  between regional authorities and the center, and subsequently it  will divide the semi-independent state formations themselves.    Some Kiev analysts believe that there is a very strong  possibility that in the next few months a Donetsk-Krivorozhsk  republic will be created in the eastern part of the country. In  the face of the insularity of the east and south (Crimea)  similar measures may be initiated by Galichina especially since  representatives of specifically that region were the initiators  of separatist tendencies in present-day Ukraine. After  differentiation of these three regions the process of a further  break-up of the republic will become inevitable. The next stage  will consist of a gradual rise in tension between the given  state formations, a rise which will be restrained only by  territorial demarcations.    The immediate principal danger to Russia in a peaceful  break-up of Ukraine will consist, in part, of the following:    Impossibility of predicting the situation with nuclear  weapons in Ukraine, impossibility of ensuring total control over  nuclear weapons by the new authorities, a need for difficult  and, in certain cases, almost completely fruitless dialogue with  new "owners" of nuclear weapons;    Significant increase in difficulties connected with trade  contacts between Russia and Europe through the territory of  Ukraine;    Certain growth in the possibility of ecological catastrophes  in Ukraine;    A gradual rise in the volume of drugs smuggled from Ukraine;    Semilegal and illegal export of Ukrainian weapons, including  the newest models, to regions of conflict located within the  boundaries of the post-Soviet space.    It is highly probable, however, that the break-up of Ukraine  will become possible as a result of social disturbances or civil  war. The winning regional elite in that case will be identifying  itself with the liberators of the population from consequences  of terrorism and military actions. The appearance of  dictatorships and partialdictatorships, including those of a  pro-communist type, is highly likely. Principal political  opposition in Ukraine in that case will again take place between  regional regimes. In this case the danger to Russia will on the  whole corresponding to that which characterizes the scenario  involving civil war and social disturbances.    The political damage to Russia in the short term caused by  realization of the scenario involving break-up of Ukraine under  certain circumstances may prove to be within the realm of the  permissible. At the same time the direct and indirect financial  damage, in part as a result of the interruption in the  continuous export of gas to Western Europe, will apparently be  excessively high.    The progressive degradation of state and society in Ukraine.  That scenario, in my opinion, is the most likely of the three  listed. It is based on the assumption that the current crisis in  the country will not lead to social cataclysms, but the regional  elite will find themselves insufficiently strong in order to  assume full responsibility for the political and economic space  partly controlled by it at the present time. The gradual  break-up of political, economic, and social ties in the country  will continue, the transportation system and the informational  space will be subjected to further disintegration, the migration  of the population to relatively developed neighboring countries  and especially to Russia will acquire a massive character, and  there will be a gradual rise in the possibility of a  dictatorship of the nationalist or communist type coming to  power.    The scenario with gradual degradation of the state and  society in Ukraine poses, in part, the following dangers for  Russia:    Gradual increase in the migration of able-bodied population  to Russia, and, as a consequence, the aggravation of a number of  well- known social problems here, particularly unemployment;    A sharp increase in smuggling in Russia, particularly of  narcotics; Decomposition of the Ukrainian army will create the  probability of the sale of Ukrainian weapons to Russian criminal  elements and extremist political organizations, as well as  illegal sale of Ukrainian armament, including, possibly that of  the newest type, in "hot spots" of the post-Soviet space;    Impossibility of conducting an effective dialogue with  Ukrainian authorities, as well as loss of their significance by  a number of previous agreements due to the inability of the  Ukrainian side to fulfill them;    A rise in the possibility of ecological catastrophes in  Ukraine;    A weakening of control by central authorities of nuclear  weapons deployed on the territory of Ukraine.    The political losses of Russia in the short range in case  this scenario comes about, at first glance, appear to be  indirect rather than direct.    The financial damage on the whole will apparently be  tolerable, although there is a stable prospect of its sharp  increase in 1995. The social consequences of a mass-scale labor  migration and smuggling will possibly become the main negative  consequence for Russia resulting from the gradual degradation of  the state and society in Ukraine in 1994.    In principle all three scenarios indicate that for the  immediate future Russia is a hostage to the situation in  Ukraine. In one way or another Russian citizens will feel, if  only by the state of their pocketbook, the dimensions of the  socioeconomic crisis in the neighboring independent state.  Forthcoming parliamentary elections in Ukraine therefore acquire  special significance for the population of not only Ukraine but  of Russia as well. Appearance of prospects for a resolution of  the crisis requires the preliminary replacement of a significant  part of the ruling elite. It is quite clear that renovation of  the legislative corps is only part of what is required. A change  in the composition of executive power is possible only after the  presidential elections. Regardless of the decision made by  Ukrainian voters on 27 March 1994, the appearance of that most  long awaited prospect for something better is objectively  postponed at least until the end of June.</p>

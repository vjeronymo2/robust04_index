			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Probe of 'gifts' to Espy Ms Janet Reno, the US attorney-general, last night sought, as expected, the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate charges that Mr Mike Espy, secretary of agriculture, had accepted gifts from agri-business interests, Jurek Martin reports from Washington. She did so under the terms of the independent counsel act by which, last Friday, Mr Kenneth Starr replaced Mr Robert Fiske as head of the Whitewater investigations into business ventures of President Bill Clinton and his wife. It is now up to a special judicial panel to pick someone to head the Espy probe. Ms Reno said the justice department had unearthed no evidence that Mr Espy 'accepted the gifts as a reward for, or in expectation of, his performance of official acts.' But she added that lack of that evidence was not enough for her to advise against naming a special counsel. The department has ascertained that the secretary had twice accepted free air travel, entertainment and sports tickets from Tyson Foods, an Arkansas-based poultry producer with close former ties to Mr Clinton. Inquiries into other possible favours had not been concluded. Accepting any gift is a technical violation of the meat inspection act of 1907. Ms Reno noted that 'non-trivial gifts' such as those apparently provided by Tyson were within its purview. Investigation of the ethics of a cabinet member does not help an administration already under the Whitewater gun. However, the White House has re-stated its confidence in Mr Espy and he has denied all wrongdoing.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Fuel system deal for Wales POWER MAKERS, a tiny North Wales-based company set up last summer, has won a contract worth at least Pounds 147m over the next three years to supply its patented fuel catalyst systems to Pakistan, writes Andrew Baxter. The contract, with a big Pakistan importing company, is the first export deal for Power Makers. It started selling its all-British fuel catalyst systems in July after a 2 1/2 -year research and development programme.</p>

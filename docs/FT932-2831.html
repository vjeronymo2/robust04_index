			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Vodafone move fuels price war THE DEVELOPING mobile phone price war was further fuelled yesterday when Vodafone, the largest mobile operator, published tariffs for new and existing services. Vodafone's new local digital service, to be launched in October, will feature a 20p a minute peak-rate tariff for calls in local call zones that have the service, including the '071' London zone. A London tariff of 33p a minute applies under its existing 'analogue' network, which will operate in parallel with the new digital networks. That tariff, in turn, is to be cut to 25p - in line with the present provincial tariff. The tariffs are partly a response to the imminent launch of a PCN service by Mercury One-2-One, a joint venture between Cable &amp; Wireless and US West. One-2-One is testing its service, which will be launched within the M25 area later this summer at a peak-rate tariff of less than 20p a minute. Vodafone is launching two advanced digital networks this autumn. The local network, called MetroDigital and to be launched on October 1, will cover the zone within the M25 and other parts of the south-east. By the end of 1994 MetroDigital will cover all British centres with populations of more than 4,000. In September a pan-European digital network, called EuroDigital, will come into service. Built to the pan-European digital standard - known as GSM - it will allow subscribers to make or receive calls on the same digital handset in all the main European Community and Scandinavian countries. Taken together with moves made or expected by other operators, yesterday's announcement marks the biggest shake-up in the UK mobile market since the start of cellular services in 1985. Mr Chris Gent, Vodafone's managing director, described the new tariffs as 'appropriately competitive'. However, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 322.5m last year, representing a remarkable 46 per cent of sales income, analysts believe Vodafone could be forced to reduce prices further if the competitive pressure intensifies. Handsets for the new digital networks will retail for about Pounds 400, double the cost of those for the existing analogue network. Monthly charges for access to the Vodafone network are unchanged at Pounds 25 for standard-rate customers, and Pounds 15 for low-user customers who pay higher call charges. MetroDigital will charge a Pounds 20-a-month access fee, EuroDigital Pounds 27.50. The new digital network will have capacity for 175,000 subscribers at its launch, rising to 2m by 2000. The existing network has 838,000 subscribers, which Vodafone expects to rise to over 1m later this year.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on Russian Minister of Transportation V. Yefimov's </F> press conference by Yu. Vereshchagin: "Problems of the  Transportation Complex"]    [Text] Russian Minister of Transportation V. Yefimov  held a press conference in Government House on the subject  "Transport: the People, the Work, and the Problems," in which he  provided details on the current situation in the country's  transportation and highway complex.    In the minister's words, Russia's transportation system is  entering the market with more and more confidence day after day.  Many enterprises have been converted to share holding and  privatized. The state sector (including the Ministry of  Railways) accounts for 37 percent of the transportation complex  today.    Following the economic recession in 1991 and 1992, it began  a  slow recovery. Currency receipts from this sector of the economy  are increasing. Air transport, as an example, provided 40  percent more foreign exchange for the treasury than in the  preceding year; river transport increased its currency  contribution by 25 percent, and the throughput capacity of river  ports was increased by 1.5 times as much...    Now, V. Yefimov said, under the aegis of the Ministry of  Transportation, a program is being developed to prevent idle  time in Russia's transportation production line and establish  inspection systems. Licensing of the right to operate all means  of transportation in the complex is being vigorously introduced.    Beginning on 1 July, the ministry is starting a new  activity--certification of personnel involved in transportation  safety. This means that a specialist who is certificated will be  able to prove his right to inspect means of transportation.    Then V. Yefimov dwelled on the features of the different  transportation sectors. Despite the economic difficulties, a  gradual updating of the technical equipment, as well as the  enterprises and complexes, is taking place gradually in the  maritime and river fleets, in the airlines, in facilities for  motor vehicle drivers, and in the Federal Highway Service.    Aviation enterprises, for example, acquired 54 new  current-generation aircraft last year: the Il-96, Tu-204,  An-124, and other aircraft. Federal programs are being worked  out in civil aviation subunits today to improve the unified  system for air traffic organization and aviation safety. A state  program is being established to develop civil aviation up to the  year 2000. Last year, 17 new air routes were opened.    The situation in maritime transport continues to be  complicated because of changes in the transportation market for  services and nonpayments. The number of obsolete vessels written  off in 1993 (59) exceeded the number added (15). Nevertheless,  the Russian fleet continues to stand its difficult watch.  Overall profit from its activity last year amounted to 600  billion rubles [R].    For the first time this year, Russia's shipping companies  ordered about 80 vessels, most of which will be built in  domestic shipyards, with their own funds and the funds of  Russian and foreign investors. Construction and renovation of  several major ports are under way. Russia should continue to be  a great sea power, the minister said.    As V. Yefimov noted, preparation of the river fleet and  ports  for the current navigation season has been conducted under  difficult financial conditions. Russia's river transportation  facilities include about 100,000 kilometers of shipping  channels, 4,700 shipping companies and ship owners, 120 river  ports, and over 100 ship repair yards. The process of changing  enterprises to share holding is being completed in this sector  now. A little over 25 percent of the stock remains with the  state in this case.    But the chief concern, in the minister's opinion, is the  fact  that shipping and the ports have turned out to be in an  extremely critical financial situation without payment in  advance, inasmuch as many clients still have not settled  accounts for the work performed last year. As a result, the  river transportation workers do not have anything to pay for  ship fuel and electricity, and, finally, to pay their  specialists' wages. A paradoxical situation is taking shape: the  fleet is prepared to work and shippers have the commodities and  the need to ship them by water routes, but the consumer does not  have the funds to pay for the products and the transportation  tariffs.    The river transportation workers who supply regions in the  far north are in an even worse situation. Practically no cargo  has accumulated yet at the transshipment ports, and petroleum  products are not being purchased, although they are available in  sufficient amounts at the petroleum bulk plants for  transshipment.    In addition, there are numerous problems in keeping the  locks, canals, and other water route facilities in working order.    About 100 million passengers are transported every day by  motor vehicle and suburban electrical transportation service.  They account for 87 percent of the passenger service provided by  all modes of transportation.    In most regions, V. Yefimov noted, the problems of subsidies  for unprofitable passenger vehicle enterprises still have not  been resolved. The Department of Automotive Transport has worked  out a special program to get out of this difficult situation. In  particular, it provides for a system of steady financial support  for suburban passenger transport services, production  organization, and the purchase of rolling stock and spare parts.    The program stipulates that about 3,000 buses be  manufactured  at the sector's enterprises and that new capacities be  established to turn out trolley buses in Bryansk and streetcars  in Yekaterinburg. It takes into account the standards regulating  passenger services in large cities and the countryside.    Thanks to a special system for financing and managing the  country's roads in the economic crisis, the Federal Road  Department managed to save the country's dilapidated road  network from destruction in 1993, to put a stop to the  disintegration of repair enterprises, and to retain their  personnel.    In the minister's words, the process of bringing the highway  network up to date has begun, the Ministry of Transportation has  begun to implement a road traffic safety program, and  general-use roads, which had no financing in the recent past,  are being included in the republic network...    Over the past 2 years, the length of the highway network has  increased by 40,000 kilometers. Main routes such the ones  between Moscow and Voronezh, Omsk and Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk  and Irkutsk, and Chita and Khabarovsk are being renovated.  Several large bridges are being built. In a word, Russia is  crawling out of the quagmire of impassable roads little by  little. And, as a whole, the transportation and highway  complex--the TDK--is moving out of a state of confusion and  apathy. A great deal of work lies ahead.</p>

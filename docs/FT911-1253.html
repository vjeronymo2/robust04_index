			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Leading Article: Stopping the rot at Lloyd's LIVING with the past is an uncomfortable business for Lloyd's of London. Just as the big private insurance market confronts a dramatic collapse in profitability, the press headlines continue to reflect regulatory failures that pre-date the 1982 Lloyd's Act but which are only now surfacing in the courts. Memories of the 19th century-style buccaneering business ethic that once prevailed at Lloyd's thus die hard. And the decline in underwriting profitability now threatens many of those who back the market with their private resources - the so-called Names - with a positively Dickensian fall from grace. Because membership of Lloyd's entails unlimited liability, several thousand are said to face personal bankruptcy. Just to compound the problem, an institution which used to be pretty much a law unto itself seems today to be fair game for the lawyers. Those Names who face financial ruin are naturally tempted to demand compensation from Lloyd's itself for alleged supervisory failings. The record at Lloyd's is not one that commands much sympathy. But it has to be acknowledged that finding an escape route from this painful time-warp would be a formidable task for any management that found itself in charge of a troubled City club whose pedigree goes back more than 300 years. Regulatory problems The regulatory problems of Lloyd's, though far from insignificant, are no longer as pressing a problem as the commercial threat. Lloyd's is generally expected to record an overall loss for 1988 - the latest year in its three-year accounting system - of Pounds 150m. Some expect the loss to rise to Pounds 1bn in 1989 and for 1990 to be another poor year. In part, that reflects a run of catastrophes, such as the Piper Alpha disaster, the Exxon Valdez pollution saga and a high incidence of hurricanes; in part, the continuing horror story in US liability insurance. The problem has been further compounded by the weakness of the dollar, which affects a high proportion of premium income at Lloyd's, and by competition. The balance of risk and reward in the market has, then, been singularly unfavourable over the past decade for the Names, which will be reflected shortly in the first overall loss at Lloyd's since 1967. That earlier collapse in underwriting profitability precipitated the Cromer report, whose unpublished recommendations included both regulatory reform and the introduction of more outside capital. Non-professional influx Yet ironically, it was the introduction of increasing numbers of non-professionals into the market that paved the way for many of the malpractices of the 1970s, in which the professionals preyed on the non-professionals within a self-regulatory framework. And by permitting an erosion in the level of real personal wealth that outside individuals were required to show in order to become Names, the ruling council of Lloyd's ended up addressing a capital shortage by bringing in people with inadequate capital to absorb the losses that are now emerging. To its credit, Lloyd's has now raised the entry threshold from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000. It should raise it further. The council has also responded to recent criticism arising from heavy losses at Feltrim and other agencies with proposals to review circumstances surrounding large losses, conciliation and arbitration procedures to keep disputes out of court and a rule requiring disclosure of underwriters' salaries, which are often bloated in relation to underlying profitability. This, too, is welcome as far as it goes. But a more direct attack on the problems of unlimited liability and the recent difficulty that Names have experienced in obtaining stop-loss policies to cap their liability is called for. That is the job of a high-powered task force that is now said to be thinking the unthinkable on this and other contentious issues at Lloyd's. It will need to take a radically disrespectful view of the past if the institution is not to become a residual sink for the worst risks in the global insurance system, thereby incurring further irremediable damage to its competitive edge.</p>

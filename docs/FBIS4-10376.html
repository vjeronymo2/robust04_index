			<p>BFN     [Text] Guyanese President Cheddi Jagan said yesterday that  the OAS, under the leadership of Cesar Gaviria, will have a  greater vigor and dynamics and will recover its role as an  inter-American democratic forum.    Jagan, who arrived in the country yesterday to initiate a  three-day official visit, said his country is pleased to have  contributed to the election of his Colombian colleague as new  OAS secretary general. "Even though we recognize the job done  by the OAS during all these years, we hope the presence of  President Gaviria will add a greater dynamics and leadership to  OAS actions," the distinguished visitor said during a dialogue  with journalists, who waited for him at the Military  Transportation Air Command. Jagan, who arrived in Santa Fe de  Bogota in a Fokker jet belonging to the Colombian Presidency,  was received by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio.    The Guyanese president said he believes his visit will go  beyond protocol and will yield fruitful results in the field of  integration. He also said he hopes the visit will serve to  "expand relations between the two countries." Jagan also had  words of praise for the Colombian foreign minister and said he  is convinced that her personality and her work helped President  Gaviria win the votes he needed to be elected to the OAS.    Jagan was accompanied by various cabinet ministers, a group  of specialists in technical cooperation, and a team of private  sector businessmen. The official schedule includes tours to the  cities of Cartagena and Cali to visit the Cementos del Caribe  processing plant and sugar mills, respectively.    Following their meeting with President Gaviria, each one of  the groups that accompany the Guyanese president will meet with  their counterparts to discuss topics of bilateral interest,  including trade and cooperation in the areas of health,  agriculture, education, electric energy, and tourism.  <H5>  A Good Associate </H5>   Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin said she hopes to  consolidate excellent relations with Guyana, a country called  upon to become one of Colombia's best associates. "It has a  been a country with which we have been building very strong  relations. It has been wonderful for me to have found, in my  latest visits, a country so full of opportunities with which we  can truly integrate," she said.    The foreign minister talked about other topics and said  there  is no reason why Colombia should apologize to the Cuban  Government over the recent episode regarding the alleged  guerrilla summit in that country. On this topic, she noted that  the Foreign Ministry abided by the reports provided by the  Prosecutor General's Office, adding that she always said there  were "indications," but no definitive conclusions over the  topic. She said she was pleased to see that Bishop Nel Beltran  had come out unscathed in this incident, "because the Foreign  Ministry always trusted him."</p>

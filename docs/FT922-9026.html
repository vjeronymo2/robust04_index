			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Germany braced for private sector strikes: Minister says he was 'stabbed in back' by employers over pay deal GERMANY is bracing itself for more strikes next week as bitter recriminations soured the air of relief yesterday over the end of the country's worst public sector strike since the war. In an extraordinary outburst, the federal minister in charge of negotiations said he had been 'stabbed in the back' by state employers who negotiated the end of the 11-day national strike among the country's 3m public sector workers. Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, who led the the employers negotiating team, claimed the Social Democrat employers had undermined his position as he entered the crucial closing round of pay talks on Thursday which led to a 5.4 per cent offer. 'I find it hard to accept this award and have agreed with a heavy heart.' He was furious about last-minute interventions by SPD leaders who had called publicly for payment of the full arbitration award. His comments came as engineering employers in the private sector were bracing themselves for official strikes among their 4m workers. 'I think it will come to a strike,' said Mr Gerhard Cromme, chairman of the Krupp steel and engineering group. While claiming that private sector employers were increasingly prepared for stoppages, he seemed uncertain about the extent to which they could hold down wages. As Mr Cromme warned of falling sales and profits, and 'pruning' in his company, about 120,000 metalworkers continued 'warning strikes'. Their union, IG Metall, is due to hold a board meeting on Tuesday to plan the next stages of its campaign for a 9.5 per cent pay rise. The employers have so far refused to improve their 3.3 per cent offer. The headline figure of 5.4 per cent for public services is now widely viewed as the starting point for a settlement, although many public service union members, ordered back to work overnight, described their award - a mixture of one-off payments and a 5.4 per cent increase in basic pay - as a 'sell-out'. Mr Seiters said the overall award amounted to 5.12 per cent. The total extra cost of DM16bn (Pounds 5.4bn) - DM2.3bn from the federal budget, DM4.6bn payable by local councils and the balance shared between state governments, post and railway authorities - was DM480m less than the price of the 5.4 per cent award proposed by arbitrators. The oTV union claimed the deal was worth 5.7 per cent. Overture to main event, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 6 Tough choices, Page 6 Krupp forecasts decline, Page 10 Lex, Page 22</p>

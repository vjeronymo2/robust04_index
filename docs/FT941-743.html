			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Manager aims to kick a deal into touch: Peter Marsh meets a customer who feels the OFT does not go far enough on photocopier leasing Mr Frank Wright, purchasing manager of the Rugby Football Union, spent yesterday trying to kick into touch a photocopier leasing deal which will cost Pounds 68,000 over the next five years unless he cancels the agreement at the cost of Pounds 23,000. Mr Wright criticised yesterday's report by the Office of Fair Trading for not going far enough to regulate the photocopier supply industry, in spite of its criticisms of malpractices in offering contracts. Four years ago the union - which regulates the affairs of about 3,000 rugby clubs in England and is based in Twickenham, west London - signed an agreement with Southern Business Group, a big photocopier supplier, to lease a machine over nine years. Mr Wright said the original agreement would have meant the union paying Pounds 198,000 over nine years, with a penalty payment of Pounds 60,000 for opting out. Southern has since agreed to modify the terms, involving a 30 per cent cut in the monthly leasing charge. Mr Wright still feels aggrieved about the amount the union is paying. He said the original contract, agreed before he joined the union, was signed by another officer 'without a great deal of thought'. The agreement, based on the union paying 2.5p per month for every paper copied, with leasing charges on top, seemed good at the time. But, Mr Wright said, the union had not fully worked out how much it would cost over the time of the contract. 'Once we signed up, we were hooked,' he said. Mr Wright would have liked the OFT paper to go further in forcing the industry to be more open about the costs of contracts, with greater protection for consumers who feel they get a raw deal. Mr David McErlain, chairman of Southern, said: 'The union's legal position is hopeless, but we have listened constructively to what Mr Wright has to say. 'We want to maintain a commercial relationship with the bloke. We are now down to honest-to-goodness bartering, proving that we can be flexible.' He said that many of the high leasing charges in the industry in the early 1990s stemmed from the high interest rates at that time. As borrowing costs had come down, the industry had been able to pass on these reductions to customers. The fall in interest rates had been reflected in Southern's offer to reduce the cost to the union of opting out of the supply contract from Pounds 60,000 to Pounds 28,000. As to the 'malpractices and excesses' which the OFT had identified in some sections of the industry, he conceded that 'some companies have been slow to react to criticism'. In Southern's case, however, the company was always willing to listen to its customers.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRINTING MONEY: HOW THE COSTS OF LEASING PHOTOCOPIERS STACK UP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Long-term contracts were condemned by the Office of Fair Trading as prone to unscrupulous selling practices. Costs facing three companies on a base case of:  -Mid-range monochrome copier, list price pounds 5,000  -Lease based on payments of pounds 530 per quarter: Pounds 106 per   quarter for each pounds 1,000 to be financed  -Cost - excluding paper - of 1p per copy  -Monthly volume of 15,000 copies  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Over three years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 10,300  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CUSTOMER A has a three-year lease. He has managed to negotiate 25% off list price and has kept service price escalation* down to 2% per annum. After three years he has paid pounds 10,300 and his contract has been completed  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Over five years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 19,900  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CUSTOMER B has a five-year lease and has accepted 15% per annum service price escalation. After three years he has paid about pounds 10,800 and is committed to pay a further pounds 9,100 over the remaining two years of his contract.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Over nine years  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pounds 52,800  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CUSTOMER C has been attracted by the low cost-per-copy on longer contracts. He has taken out a nine-year contract with 15% per annum service price escalation. He also has lease charges 25% higher than the base case. After three-years he has paid pounds 11,800 and is committed to pay another pounds 41,000 over the remaining six years.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 'After three years, many machines could start needing a lot of servicing and perform with irritating breakdowns. They may also be technologically obsolescent,' says the OFT report  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Service price escalation: service charges are not constant  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Office of Fair Trading  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL FINDS NO PROOF OF BOUNTIES ON COWBOYS  </P> <P> The NFL said today it has no proof that bounties were placed on Dallas Cowboy  players by the Philadelphia Eagles and has no evidence there was intent to  cause deliberate injuries.  </P> <P> The league issued a two-paragraph statement saying its findings were based on  an investigation by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue following charges that surfaced  after the Eagles played the Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day.  </P> <P> "Under no circumstances does the league condone placing 'bounties' on an  opposing player," the league said. "Nor does the league condone any deliberate  action taken to injure another player. If any such conduct is proven by either  direct or indirect evidence, the sanctions will be severe."  </P> <P> The Dallas Cowboys had no immediate comment today.  </P> <P> Coach Jimmy Johnson had predicted earlier in the week, however, that the NFL  office would not do anything about the charges because it would be too  difficult to prove it was a deliberate act.  </P> <P> The controversy has simmered since Johnson charged that Coach Buddy Ryan  offered bounties to some Eagles players to knock Dallas kicker Luis Zendejas  and quarterback Troy Aikman out of the Nov. 23 game, which Philadelphia won  27-0.  </P> <P> Ryan called the charges ridiculous.  </P> <P> Bounty wars heated up again in recent days when Zendejas, cut earlier this  season by the Eagles, said he has a tape recording of Eagles' special teams  Coach Al Roberts pleading with him not to tell the NFL that he warned Zendejas  that there would be attempts to knock him out of the game.  </P> <P> The Eagles and the Cowboys play again Sunday, this time in Philadelphia.  </P></p>

			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / How to Spend It: For healthy bodies - and healthier minds ONE OF the curious things about the health and beauty business is that most people - four out of five, according to Allied Dunbar's annual report on the physical state of the nation - believe that some form of exercise is good for them, but only half of them do anything about it. In other words, most take the classic advice when overcome with the urge to deal with flab - they sit down until they feel better. But slowly, more of us are realising that fitness is not only good for us, it can also be fun. It can be about enjoying yourself, meeting friends and colleagues in warm, congenial clubs, and about feeling better, too. As David Giampaolo, who founded the Espree clubs and now distributes fitness equipment, puts it: 'These days the emphasis is much more on health than fitness. It's about exercising in a way that is physically, psychologically AND spiritually rewarding. The idea nowadays is to be energised, not exhausted.' The days of the Jane Fonda mantra, No Pain, No Gain, are gone. High-impact aerobics, exercising till you drop, are out of vogue. In have come low-impact aerobics, stretch and step, yoga, flotation, inline skating, Tai Chi, dance - the key is to find something you actually enjoy - then there is a chance that you might stick with it. Fitness is also big business. The health, youth and fitness business is predicted to be one of the five fastest growing commercial sectors in the next decade - but as in all successful businesses, it needs sharp footwork to keep ahead of the game. With the emphasis on fun and (sign of the times) stress relief the fashionable way to hone limbs and tone up cardiovascular function is with such new age concepts as Step Training, Inline Skating, The Slide Trainer, water aerobics and personal trainers. Crucial, too, are the ancillary servies - aromatherapy, reflexology, massage, the holistic approach that all the best, most advanced clubs now offer. David Giampaolo was probably the first, with Espree, to see that most 1980s-style British clubs lacked allure. They were spartan and functional; people came, worked out and went home. With Espree he made sure that a club was a nice place to be - comfortable, inviting, warm, with a restaurant serving decent food. Nowadays many clubs are selling the new age message: that you need not suffer to be beautiful and well. The Riverside Club, some of the David Lloyd ones, the medium-market Metropolitan Clubs and lots of small health clubs up and down the UK are all now more inviting to visit than the spartan clubs of yesteryear. The new Harbour Club at Watermead Lane, London SW6 (tel: 071-371-7700) is not due to open until March 22 but so far is making all the right noises. It describes itself as a multi-sports club with 14 tennis courts (10 indoors), a 4,000 sq ft gymnasium, a 25 metre pool, a creche, good parking and every sort of class from stretch and step, yoga and dance to flotation tank and a proper restaurant with a serious chef (ex-Halcyon Hotel). There is a resaleable membership fee of Pounds 1,695 and the monthly full membership charge is Pounds 88. This lets you use all the facilities free except the indoor tennis courts at peak time for which there is a Pounds 10 an hour charge. There will also be off-peak membership of Pounds 55 per month and a joining fee of Pounds 430 for those who only use the club Monday to Friday from 6.30am to 6pm. Some 900 people have already signed up. For those for whom those kind of sums are out of the question it is worth mentioning Jamie Addicoat's Fatbusters - wonderful name - classes. When I last looked at the fitness business Addicoat's Fatbusters was running some of the cheapest classes around, at Covent Garden's Jubilee Hall for Pounds 2.50 a class. Today prices have risen to just Pounds 4 a time. For that reasonable sum you get Jamie himself, shouting, strutting, urging you on to that (attainable) goal - the lean and trim body. Hours are for serious workaoholics - 7.30 am on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays, 7.15 pm on Tuesdays and 1 pm on Sundays. Classes are held at the Jubilee Hall, 30, The Piazza, Covent Garden, London WC2. Tel: 071-836-4007 for details. The ultimate luxury (or necessity, depending on your point of view), is the personal trainer. Puritanical Britons tend to feel this is the decadent way to fitness but in New York, where personal trainers are nearly as ubiquitous as personal analysts, they are seen as just another sensible use of hard-pressed time. Trainers come in every discipline and though Pounds 35 an hour (the average rate at which they come in London) may sound a lot, if you get two or three friends to join it is good value. My personal preference at the moment is for yoga: muscle toning, increased suppleness and flexibility, not to mention a sense of renewed energy, are just some of the benefits that yoga addicts notice. As evidence of my devotion to my readers I proffer the name of my own much-valued yoga teacher, Lisbeth Russell, tel: 071-431-2668, for those in the London area who think yoga may be the thing for them. Otherwise the British Wheel of Yoga Central Office (tel: 0529-306851) has a list of trained teachers in the UK. For other personal trainers - whether in low-impact aerobics, stretch and step, body-sculpting - ring Melanie Reigber at Lifeworks (tel: 081-520-7344) and she will put you in touch with teachers and classes in your area. If you like keeping your physical inadequacies to yourself and just want to work out in privacy at home there is now a vast range of in-home equipment and supporting videos. The Step is currently much in vogue (see caption top right) but the hot coming thing (according to David Giampaolo) is The Slide Trainer, which should be in most sports shops in mid-March for Pounds 79. Whereas most exercises work the front and back of the legs the Slide Trainer promises (ah, delicious prospect) to stretch and tone the abductors (the outside thigh muscles) and adductors (the inner ones). It also tones the medial and lateral muscles on the inside and outside of the knee. So there you have it - thinner thighs, stronger knees could be yours. One last thought. The inescapable fact is that the toned body, the lithe shape, the inner tranquillity does not come from the odd hour in the gym or the couple of hours on the tennis court. It depends upon a whole way of life. It reflects what you eat, how you move, how you feel and how you exercise. Nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems . . .</p>

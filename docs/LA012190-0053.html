			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WANING CLOUT IN CONGRESS WORRIES TEXAS  </P> <P> Texans strode into Washington last January confident that the Lone Star was in  ascendancy -- laying claim to the White House, the House speakership and a  passel of Cabinet posts and congressional committee chairmanships.  </P> <P> They begin 1990 with their influence on the Bush Administration undiminished,  but their clout in Congress has been reduced by death, illness, a retirement  and the resignation of their most powerful member.  </P> <P> Rep. Michael A. Andrews, a Houston Democrat, says that Texas is coming off a  "wind-shift year."  </P> <P> Some Texans fear that their legendary clout -- which, at the start of 1989,  they had predicted would increase -- has waned so much that the state is now at  a disadvantage in fighting for the federal largess that has traditionally come  their way.  </P> <P> Early on, the Senate refused to confirm President Bush's choice of John Tower  as secretary of defense after exploring allegations of womanizing and excessive  drinking by the former Texas senator.  </P> <P> Three months later, in June, House Speaker Jim Wright abandoned a 34-year  career in the House and resigned from the most influential position in Congress  amid an ethics investigation of his personal finances.  </P> <P> In August, Democratic Rep. Mickey Leland of Houston was killed when his bush  plane slammed into a remote mountain in Ethiopia on its way to a refugee camp.  </P> <P> In October, after suffering abdominal pains, Democratic Rep. Jack Brooks, dean  of the Texas congressional delegation, was hospitalized for six weeks for  treatment of an inflamed pancreas.  </P> <P> And, on Dec. 1, Rep. Marvin Leath, an influential Democrat on the House Budget  and Armed Services committees, announced that he would not seek a seventh term  in 1990.  </P> <P> Despite the setbacks, the Texas delegation still landed $225 million to begin  building the superconducting super collider, a giant particle accelerator that  scientists hope will help them understand the origins of the universe, and  fended off a potential attempt to cut $100 million in Pentagon funding for  Sematech, a national semiconductor research consortium in Austin.  </P> <P> In addition, the Pentagon chose Dyess Air Force Base as a site for rail-based  MX missiles -- a project that supporters say guarantees the Abilene  installation a mission into the next century even as budget cutters slash  military spending.  </P> <P> But Texans still face a tough fight to maintain research and development funds  for another military project -- the V-22 Osprey aircraft -- and they failed to  obtain tax breaks for the state's troubled oil and gas industry.  </P> <P> Rep. John Bryant, a Dallas Democrat, said he is afraid that the delegation's  weakened presence in Washington leaves it vulnerable to new attacks this year  by other members of Congress who believe Texas has long gotten more than its  share from the federal government.  </P> <P> Bryant, who in April announced that he was a candidate for state attorney  general, decided in December to pull out of that race and stay in Washington,  where he can influence next year's spending as a member of the House Budget  Committee.  </P> <P> He said that the super collider, Sematech and the space station, being built in  Houston, all may be under siege in 1990.  </P> <P> When Congress reconvenes this week, he said, it will do so "for the first time  in modern history without a Texas member in a key position to protect our  state's interests in the budget process."  </P> <P> Still, Texas is hardly without well-positioned members of Congress.  </P> <P> Its senior senator, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen, is chairman of the Finance  Committee. In the House, Brooks heads the Judiciary Committee, Rep. Henry B.  Gonzalez is chairman of the Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee and  Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza is chairman of the Agriculture Committee.  </P> <P> "We still have a lot of power there," said Bentsen, the 1988 Democratic vice  presidential candidate and a potential presidential candidate in 1992.  </P> <P> Bentsen's fellow senator from Texas, Republican Phil Gramm, put it this way:  </P> <P> "Before all this happened, Texas had the greatest degree of influence in  Washington of any state in the union. Texas still has the most influence of any  state in the union."  </P></p>

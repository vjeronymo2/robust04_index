			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Natural rubber producers to prepare for life after Inra OFFICIALS OF the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries are to meet here next week to work out a programme of action if the present International Natural Rubber Agreement is abandoned. The agreement expires at the end of this year. Producer countries want it to be renegotiated but consumers say the present pact is adequate. Furthermore consumers accuse producers of breaking the terms of the agreement by refusing a downward revision of natural rubber prices earlier this year. The ANRPC groups Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, India, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, which together account for more than 80 per cent of the world's natural rubber output. Mr Sucharit Promdej, the association's secretary general, has warned that producers will bring in their own supply curbs and pricing mechanisms if there is no renegotiation of the agreement. However, producers face a dilemma in that if Inra is abandoned then nearly 200,000 tonnes of natural rubber stockpiled by the International Natural Rubber Organisation's buffer stock manager will start being sold on the open market. This would put further downward pressure on world natural rubber prices. Inro groups both producers and consumers. An Inro meeting here next month is expected to make a last ditch effort to maintain the agreement.</p>

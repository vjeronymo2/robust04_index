			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: Poland's reigning queen - Hanna Suchocka, prime minister of Poland, talks to Anthony Robinson and Christopher Bobinski Hanna Suchocka, Poland's first woman prime minister, who begins a three-day official visit to Britain tomorrow, is not the first politician to detect the hidden hand of providence behind an unexpected rise to power. But she is hard-pressed to find another explanation behind the telephone call she received last July which led to her appointment to the second most powerful political office in Poland. Poland was in crisis: the then prime minister designate, Waldemar Pawlak, was unable to form a cabinet and the country's political matchmakers were worried by growing public discontent. Poland's foreign partners were concerned about the outlook for political stability, economic reform and foreign investment. Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Democratic Union party, Solidarity veteran and close adviser to President Lech Walesa, and one of the most influential strategists in Polish politics, recognised that Poland needed a new leader, untainted by the endless compromises and intrigue of Polish politics. He remembered Hanna Suchocka, the competent, no-nonsense woman with a brisk but friendly manner with whom he had worked on drawing up the post-communist constitution. Geremek's telephone call to President Walesa, proposing Suchocka for the prime minister's job, produced a positive response. Another call followed to Suchocka in London, where she was attending a legal conference - and Poland had its first female leader since the Angevin Queen Jadwiga in the 14th century. Speaking in her newly furnished office in Warsaw's Council of Ministers building, with reproduction Austrian Biedermeir furniture and vases of freesias and chrysanthemums, Suchocka recalled that her first reaction to Geremek's offer was 'sheer panic'. When she asked whether there were other candidates, she was told that all alternatives had been excluded. 'I never had any ambition to become prime minister; at most I thought of a career in an international organisation,' she says. 'Maybe it was providence. I certainly don't see myself as a saviour or anything like that. But it happened and somehow a sort of consensus has grown up around me.' After seven tough months as the prime minister of 'a very difficult country by tradition and national character', she enjoys a 76 per cent approval rating in opinion polls. Such support helps provide the moral authority needed to preside effectively over a disparate seven-party ruling coalition which does not enjoy a guaranteed majority in the 460-seat Sejm, the lower house of parliament. Public support also helped to stiffen her resolve through a wave of strikes in the car plants and coalmines just after taking power last summer and a second wave in the Silesian coal mines early this year. She has also survived months of gruelling parliamentary debate as opposition and government MPs alike tried to tack extra spending provisions on to a 1993 budget which the government had to keep within tight limits to gain a Dollars 660m stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund, due to be approved soon. Last month the government finally managed to garner enough votes from outside the coalition to gain parliamentary approval for the budget as originally proposed. What clinched the outcome was a threat by Suchocka to resign if the vote went against her and a warning from President Walesa that he would dissolve parliament and hold new elections if the vote led to the government's defeat. The prime minister and president gambled successfully on their hunch that MPs would not have the stomach for fresh elections, which could have led to the downfall of an increasingly popular prime minister. The upshot is that Suchocka comes to London, where she will address a Polish-UK business conference organised by the Confederation of British Industry as well as meeting John Major, prime minister, with the budget crisis safely behind her. This has opened the way to a new IMF agreement which in turn is linked to future loans from the World Bank and is expected to make Poland more attractive to foreign investors. Suchocka, who is 46, has not only emerged as one of central Europe's most successful politicians, she is also presiding over growing signs of an economic recovery after three years of recession. Last year the economy stabilised; this year it is expected to grow by between 2 and 3 per cent. She has established a close working relationship with both former academics such as Jerzy Osiatynski, finance minister, and Jacek Kuron, labour minister, once feared by the communist regime for his close rapport with Poland's militant workers. Suchocka and Kuron, in particular, make an unlikely team. The fast-talking Kuron, with his jeans and cigarette-and-whisky-tainted voice, relishes his rapport with the rather prim prime minister in twinsets and pearls. They co-operate closely in trying to sell the government's 'enterprise pact', which offers wage restraint by workers in exchange for more union say in management and the privatisation process. Fellow politicians say one of Suchocka's strongest points is her ability to address the public in simple, everyday language. 'I never use the language of hatred. But that does not mean that I don't sometimes feel the urge to lay into somebody,' she says, giving a hint of the underlying tensions in the government. Andrzej Olechowski, a former finance minister and now an economic adviser to the president, says the prime minister's main qualities are those of a good chairman. She is not a forceful, self-opinionated leader like Lady Thatcher, but a good listener able to reach a consensus and enforce it. In this she resembles her close friend, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chosen as chairman of the Polish central bank by President Walesa 18 months ago. The fact that women head both the government and the most important financial institution in post-communist Poland is without precedent. Thus far both appointments have turned out well. Thanks to her management skills, Suchocka has managed to keep together a coalition of unlikely political bedfellows: free-market liberals to dyed-in-the-wool Polish nationalists and Catholic fundamentalists. Where she has strong views, Suchocka manages to express them without causing offence. As a practising Catholic, for example, she holds forceful anti-abortion opinions but managed to distance the government from this divisive issue by insisting that parliament voted freely. As a result, Poland now has a highly restrictive abortion law, but one which stops short of the virtually total ban demanded by the powerful Catholic church. Her ability to steer the government past potential hazards is helped by the unwillingness of the coalition partners to push their differences to breaking point. Suchocka herself may be popular, but the political parties and the government itself are not. Ultimately, the secret of her success seems to lie in the way her personality and background as the daughter of a small town pharmacist from Pleszew, western Poland, appear to make her the personification of the desire of millions of Poles to live in a reasonably prosperous, stable and above all 'normal' society. After 60 traumatic years of war, invasion and communist domination, Poles now have the opportunity to forge good relations with their powerful neighbours, Germany and Russia, and return to the mainstream of European culture and trade to which they have always felt they belonged. Strengthening ties with Britain, with its large Anglo-Polish community and wartime alliance, is part of this process. It is also part of rebuilding Poland as what Suchocka herself defines as 'a normal country'. This may sound an excessively modest goal in the west, but not to Poles and the citizens of other countries in east and central Europe now spreading their wings after decades of captivity.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PERSONAL FILE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1946    Born Pleszew.

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOVANOVICH STEPS ASIDE, EX-ENERGY SECY. NAMED  </P> <P> Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. said today Chairman William Jovanovich has  resigned and former U.S. Energy Secretary John S. Herrington has been elected  to replace him.  </P> <P> The 70-year-old Jovanovich had guided the development of the Orlando, Fla.  </P> <P> -based publishing company during a career that spanned more than 43 years and  saw the company's revenue grow to $1.3 billion from $8 million in the 1950s.  </P> <P> He engineered a costly recapitalization of Harcourt in 1987 that enabled the  company to avoid a takeover by British media baron Robert Maxwell.  </P> <P> But the resulting heavy debt prompted the company to sell its theme park  business a year ago for $1.1 billion, which was below what some analysts had  thought it could get for the business.  </P> <P> The company recently acknowledged it was in talks to sell unspecified  additional assets. It announced May 9 that those talks had been terminated.  </P> <P> In addition to its publishing operations, Harcourt has interests in the  insurance business.  </P> <P> The company said in a statement that Jovanovich also had submitted his  resignation as chairman of the company's executive committee.  </P> <P> He will be replaced in that position by his son, Peter Jovanovich, who became  chief executive and president of the company last December.  </P> <P> Herrington has served as a member of the Harcourt board since May, 1989, and  has served on its executive and finance committees.  </P> <P> In a statement, Jovanovich was quoted as saying, "Forty-three years is enough,  especially since I now can devote my time to editing books and writing them."  </P> <P> Herrington called Jovanovich "an American publishing legend, a pioneer in  educational technology and an industry giant who built the best independent  publishing house in America."  </P> <P> "While I cannot replace this Renaissance man, I intend to work to build upon  HBJ's outstanding successes," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: AVCs; a guide to investment performance - Philip Coggan crunches the numbers on an annual survey of pension arrangements BACON &amp; WOODROW, the actuarial group, has published its annual survey of additional voluntary contribution (AVC) pension arrangements. The survey compares the actual returns offered by various contracts of the with profits, unit-linked and building society varieties. The results are designed to be useful to those in company pension schemes who are paying into AVCs which operate on a money purchase basis - where the final pension depends on the investment return. The figures shown are for a person with a normal retirement date of January 1 1993 and use actual interest and bonus rates and expenses. Contributions have been assumed at Pounds 600 per annum, payable monthly. Returns for with profits contracts are shown both with and without the terminal bonus, which can be highly volatile. (The aim of a with profits policy is to smooth returns. Annual bonuses are added each year and cannot be withdrawn; terminal bonuses, however, are more dependent on investment conditions at maturity.) As the tables show, if terminal bonuses are ignored, only a very few insurance companies are able to match building society returns. Reductions in bonuses mean that the returns on with profits contracts have generally been lower than last year. Returns on unit-linked contracts have increased, however, to reflect good investment performance. However, Bacon &amp; Woodrow does not believe that its five year embargo on with profits personal pensions, should also be used in this area. Members of company pension schemes may well value the security on offer from the with profits policy; investment return may be a less important factor. Two further factors should be noted on with profits plans. Some companies offer special terms (ignoring commissions) which can enhance the returns shown in the table. On the other hand, some with profits contracts impose early retirement penalties, resulting in less competitive returns if the policy proceeds are taken before the retirement date specified in the contract. Bacon &amp; Woodrow adds: 'It is clear that insurance companies are continuing to move away from conventional with profits contracts. Several have replaced their conventional contract with a unitised with profits arrangement and an increasing number of companies are also offering funds which are directly linked to the underlying investments.' Few unit-linked plans have been in existence for 10 years, so Bacon &amp; Woodrow has not produced figures for that duration. However, it does have unit-linked figures for seven years; over that period, they lag behind with profits returns. The leading unit-linked fund outperforms only three of the with profits funds over that period. Bacon &amp; Woodrow cites the Prudential as the company with the best with profits record which is still marketing an AVC policy in that form. Among the unit-linked funds, Gartmore was the leading provider over three years and National Mutual over five years. Among building societies, Northern Rock and the Nationwide respectively led over five and ten years. The actuarial group concludes: 'We advise trustees and employers to review their AVC scheme regularly, looking not only at past performance but also at the standards of service received, and the provider's financial position and prospects.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BUILDING SOCIETY SCHEMES Contributions paid over 10 years to January 1 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Cash       Equivalent annual                          Accumulation          rate of return                                Pounds             % per annum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Nationwide                     11,305                    12.4 Coventry                       11,303                    12.4 Northern Rock                  11,288                    12.3 Bristol &amp; West                 11,273                    12.3 Woolwich                       11,255                    12.3 Abbey National                 11,212                    12.2 Halifax                        11,186                    12.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WITH PROFITS INSURANCE SCHEMES Contributions paid over a 10 year period to January 1 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LAUTRO Terms                          Excluding terminal bonus                               Cash          Equivalent annual                       Accumulation             rate of return                             Pounds                % per annum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS                         11,371                       12.5 Norwich Union               11,041                       11.9 Prudential                   9,970                       10.0 Standard Life               10,323                       10.6 Sun Alliance                10,924                       11.7 Eagle Star                  13,445                       15.6 National Mutual Life        10,291                       10.6 Equitable Life               9,731                        9.5 Friends Provident           10,043                       10.1 Scottish Equitable           9,829                        9.7 Britannia Life              10,960                       11.8 London Life                 10,418                       10.8 Legal &amp; General             11,786                       13.1 Scottish Mutual             11,619                       12.9 Scottish Widows              9,799                        9.6  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          LAUTRO Terms                          Including terminal bonus                               Cash          Equivalent annual                       Accumulation             rate of return                             Pounds                % per annum  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- CIS                         16,498                       19.5 Norwich Union               14,977                       17.7 Prudential                  14,371                       16.9 Standard Life               13,473                       15.7 Sun Alliance                13,551                       15.8 Eagle Star                  13,445                       15.6 National Mutual Life        13,790                       16.1 Equitable Life              13,772                       16.1 Friends Provident           13,110                       15.2 Scottish Equitable          12,877                       14.8 Britannia Life              12,648                       14.5 London Life                 12,915                       14.9 Legal &amp; General             12,748                       14.6 Scottish Mutual             12,302                       14.0 Scottish Widows             11,824                       13.2  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Gnassingbe Eyadema on appointment of </F> prime minister in Lome on 22 April -- recorded]    [Excerpts] Togolese people, with the holding of the  legislative elections, we have ended the transitional phase  provided by the Constitution. The establishment of major  institutions of the Fourth Republic marks the end of the  activities of the transition government. I want to pay tribute  to all Togolese people for the courage and high sense of duty  demonstrated during this transition period and, in particular,  during the legislative elections. Let me congratulate the  outgoing prime minister and his ministers as well as all  political leaders and administrative officials who have had the  arduous task of running our country's government at this  difficult time. [Words indistinct] to seek hours of compromise  which enabled us to conclude the transition. When the nation  was faced with a serious threat of being torn apart, each one of  you made it a point to demonstrate a sense of responsibility and  love for our country by placing national interests above  personal interests or that of one's party. To you, my dear  countrymen, parliamentarians whom the people have freely and in  a sovereign manner elected to represent them and to defend their  interests at the National Assembly, I express my warm  congratulations. [passage omitted]    I promised you, even before the holding of the legislative  elections, that I will ensure a broad-based government is set  up. The legislative elections reflected the desire of the  people. The results of these elections have demonstrated your  wish for a renewal and your desire for continuity. They also  demonstrated your concern for level-headedness because, after  these elections, none of the parties that contested them was in  a position to claim parliamentary majority. We must see this  situation in a positive manner. It must encourage each one of  us to be moderate and to adopt dialogue, taking into account the  situation as well as the (?needs) and aspirations of the people.  You know the country's (?situation) and needs. Your  aspirations are clear. Do you want to live in a truly  independent and free country? Are you tired of experiencing the  consequences of these political rivalries? This is why  immediately after the legislative elections, as I pledged to do  even before being elected as president, I started consultations  to appoint a new prime minister. I acted so because I took into  account your desire for change and renewal. I have paved the  way for the formation of a national union government.    The naming of the government must be in conformity with the  provisions of Article 66 of our Constitution. The article says  the president names the prime minister from within the  parliamentary majority group. The Constitution confers on the  head of state the sole responsibility of choosing a prime  minister. I made it a point of consulting with leaders of the  political parties to know their preferences and their  aspirations. In the aftermath of the legislative elections, an  alliance was formed between two parties, the Action Committee  for Renewal and Togolese Union for Democracy, to form a  parliamentary majority. I held several working sessions with the  chairmen of these two parties. I asked them to suggest to me  several names from which I could choose a prime minister.  Indeed, it is necessary to respect the constitutional  prerogative of the president of the Republic. It is also  necessary to take into account the aptitude of the person chosen  to assume that post and to restore confidence and national  harmony. Up till today, I had not received any proposal. The  legislative elections were completed several weeks ago. The  country can wait no longer.    As the guarantor of the Constitution, it is my duty to  encourage everyone to uphold his responsibilities. This is why  I have decided to choose a personality from the parliamentary  majority to form a new government, in conformity with Article 66  of our Constitution. I am appealing to the sense of  responsibility in all of you. The time has come for us to come  together instead of being divided. The time has come to work  for the construction of the country instead of destroying it. I  have confidence in the political maturity of the Togolese people  [words indistinct] division. The head of government will be  charged with the task of working towards national unity and  general interest. He will be charged with managing the  country's affairs thoroughly and efficiently during this  delicate phase of national reconstruction. [passage omitted]    I wish the prime minister and his future cabinet good luck.  Long live the Republic! Long live democracy! Long live Togo!</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by People's Deputy Vladimir Novik: "What Is </F> Waiting for Us After Unification of Belarusian and Russian  Monetary Systems?"]    [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Currently, virtually no one in  Belarus is arguing with the V. Kebich team on the absurdity of  his intentions to implement the so-called unification of  monetary systems of Belarus and Russia. This is useless. Even  the Constitution, which was adopted by the Supreme Soviet,  cannot stop him. A bankrupt, procommunist Belarusian  Government, due to its inability to manage an independent state,  is making attempts to remain in power by undertaking unusual  methods -- abolishing the state itself. Comrade Kebich has  recently stated that he is being nominated as a candidate for  president only because he is taking into account the wishes of  those who bet on him. It is not difficult to guess who had bet  on him. Most likely, they are the people who are scared of  "sorting things out" if new, principally honest people, who are  able to pull the Republic out of the crisis, come to power.    When the Belarusian statehood is mentioned, the current  Belarusian Government -- represented by former  bolsheviks-Leninists -- has rather a complex of state  inferiority than a feeling of national pride and responsibility  for the destiny of the governed state. At the same time, the  Russian Government is working out its strategy for incorporating  a sovereign state without the use of force (for example, through  the so-called monetary merger) aimed at further widening this  experiment to other CIS states and not only them. In addition,  it does not conceal its imperialist intentions to restore the  Russian empire and does it professionally and with a great deal  of responsibility. However, hardly anyone from the parties, who  is interested in this experiment, can predict the developments  in these states. At the same time, these developments cannot be  so harmless.    At the same time, the adversaries of the so-called money  merger -- we have to note that there are many of them both in  Belarus and Russia -- begin to analyze the economic and  political consequences of this unification. Let us, esteemed  readers, discuss one of the proposed prospects for the  development of the economic situation in Belarus over the  postunification period, if the unification is really carried out.    Saying nothing about the controversial clauses of the  monetary merger agreement, which -- it has been repeatedly  written and spoken about -- contradicts the new Belarusian  Constitution, adopted on 15 March, in many details, we can  assume that the unification of monetary systems will be  implemented on "x-day" and, according to the agreement between  the Russian and Belarusian Governments, Belarus will receive a  certain sum of Russian rubles in cash and a recalculation of  noncash Belarusian rubles to Russian ones on the basis of the  agreed course be carried out. As a matter of fact, the money  received should be sufficient to provide for a turnover of goods  on the domestic market. So, what will happen after the "x-day"?    Most likely, after a certain amount of money is allocated,  the flow of goods from other CIS states, first and foremost from  Russia, will go to Belarus because Belarusian prices and wages  will be higher over a certain period of time. Money from  Belarus will flow away, goods will "be eaten away," and the  deficit of payment means will grow. Belarus will require a new  portion of money to provide for the domestic turnover of goods,  and purchases of goods and raw materials in Russia.    To settle old debts and obtain new Russian credits, the  Belarusian Government will have to sell for a song or  hypothecate a controlling interest in such highly profitable and  costly enterprises like "Beltranshaz" (what it has already  done), the Belarusian metallurgical factory or the biggest oil  and chemistry enterprises which had already attracted the  attention of the Russian financial oligarchy and their lobby in  the Russian Government circles.    To create economic obstacles, Russia will want to  financially  isolate Belarus in the so-called ruble zone of a new type.  There are many mechanisms for doing this. For example, Russia  can complicate the transfer of payments from Belarus to Russia;  it can establish a situation whereby Belarusian noncash money  has no status and is not recognized by other states, primarily,  by CIS partners. This will virtually repeat the 1992 scheme,  when the Central Bank of Russia, according to Yeltsin's edict  from 21 June 1992 "On Measures To Protect Russian Monetary  System," effective 1 July 1992, began to keep accounts with  Belarus through a single corresponding account of the Belarusian  National Bank and the Central Bank of Russia.    The experience of 1992-93 showed that such measures could  bring about a situation whereby Belarusian enterprises will not  be able to independently buy raw materials and many essentials  for its industry products and resources abroad, first and  foremost, in Russia, and will be forced to exchange them for  Belarusian products sold abroad on a barter basis for  convertible currency or Russian rubles. Due to this, the state  budget will suffer greatly and inflation will grow. To service  the domestic goods turnover and protect the consumer market,  Belarus will be forced to introduce -- parallel with the Russian  rubles -- new, or, maybe, old Belarusian "hares."    Then Russia could "slightly" liberalize its domestic prices  and wages and forget to simultaneously satisfy Belarusian needs  in cash and noncash money. This, in turn, will exacerbate the  problem of a lack of cash and noncash money in the accounts of  Belarusian enterprises. In this case, Belarus will have to  trade its products to every swindler coming from Russia for cash  to be able to pay wages to its workers.    Further, Russia can introduce such effective measures as  economic pressure on Belarus, including customs duties,  licenses, quotas, and other mechanisms, which will be imposed by  Russia without any agreement with Belarus. The main goal of  such measures is to enhance economic difficulties, lower the  competitiveness of Belarusian goods, primarily on the Russian  market with which Belarus is closely connected -- and Russia  does not want to leave Belarus out of its scope of interests.  Of course, all these measures will enhance the economic  dependence of Belarus on Russia, in which Russia is strongly  interested.    Thereby, this is a vicious cycle. As a result of the  so-called unification of monetary systems, Belarus will find  itself in complete financial isolation and will be forever  connected with Russia. After that, Russian governmental  strategists, rich financial corporations, industrial groups and  organisms will begin dividing the national wealth of Belarus.  This process will be carried out according to the following  scheme.    The debts of Belarusian enterprises will be bought by big  Russian banks or financial companies which control the  deliveries of strategic goods and energy resources to Belarus.  The Russian Government, through a specially set up network of  economic difficulties (pricing, customs, export and import  mechanisms), will set up tough conditions, owing to which all  monetary and material resources will be withdrawn from Belarus.  To survive, Belarus will make attempts to find foreign  creditors but will be refused because virtually all foreign  loans will be directed at the repayment of Russian debts and  Belarus will not be able to persuade anyone that it will be able  to repay its debts. Russia will also block these attempts  because it does not need Belarus burdened with huge foreign  debts.    After that, Russia will toughly demand that Belarus begin  urgently repaying its debts. Since that there will be nothing  to pay with, controlling interests of Belarusian enterprises  will be handed over to the Russian state or Russian financial  corporations.    The issuing of vouchers in Russia will be over by 30 June  1994, and effective 1 July, privatization for money will begin.  As for Belarus, the distribution of vouchers will begin only on  1 July 1994. Is this being done by chance or not? In my  opinion, this is a well-planned action by the Russian special  services which are actively working within the Belarusian  Government and the legislature. It is more profitable for  Russia to acquire Belarusian enterprises for a song when they  are still state property. This will require only Kebich's  signature while after privatization they will require the  shareholders' consent which will not be easy to obtain.    Thereby, after the unification of Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems, Belarus will lose its highly profitable  enterprises, its unprofitable enterprises will go bankrupt, and  the standard of life of the population will sharply decrease. A  complete loss of economic independence will be the consequence  of the monetary merger. After this, political annexation will  follow. All the Belarusian population will hardly agree to  this. A new stage of the fight for the restoration of  independence of Belarus will be launched. So, is it necessary  to first lose freedom to assess its value later?    The last point. Why is the Belarusian Government so  stubbornly pushing Belarus to the so-called monetary merger?  There are many speculations on this issue. In my opinion, the  key reason is a chance to remove the responsibility for economic  collapse and keep power in their hands. They count on the  presidential elections because a president will receive  unprecedented powers to form executive bodies. It is no  accident that Russian Prime Minister Chernomyrdin was so slow  with signing the monetary merger agreement. He waited for the  establishment of the date of the presidential elections in  Belarus. Presidential elections should be held at the moment  when Russian money -- acting hypnotically on Belarusian voters  -- is transferred to the Belarusian economy. Russia requires a  puppet president in Belarus who will dance to the Russian tune.  Comrade Kebich suits Russia. If Judas betrayed Jesus Christ for  silver, Kebich would sell Belarus for banknotes with the Kremlin  printed on them. As I have already mentioned, Belarusian voters  will sober up soon. But the power will be in the hands of those  familiar to us -- people for whom personal interests are more  important than the interests of their state and people. It is  high time that the Belarusian Government stop carrying out its  experiments with setting up an independent state without its own  currency because this will not lead to anything good.    To whom is the lack of Belarusian money and credit policy  profitable? Let us recall how last February the Presidium of  the Supreme Soviet exceeded its constitutional powers and issued  trillions [currency not specified] in credit line to the  agricultural-industrial complex under the Cabinet of Ministers'  pressure. The National Bank took this money out of the air and  earmarked it to the Cabinet of Ministers. But does anyone  control the purposeful use of this uncovered money? If there is  no control, this money could be quickly poured into trusted  commercial companies. For example, these companies could be  issued short-term credit lines from these purposeful funds.  These companies could buy convertible currency, sell it  immediately after the total fall in the exchange rate of the  Belarusian "hare," and profit from the difference of the  exchange rate. After that, the issued loan, which is uncovered  and devalued, could be granted to the agricultural sector. Do  people who deal with this kind of business need a rigid  independent money and credit policy? The answer is unequivocal.  No! The analysis of the roll-call vote on the issue of the  Belarusian money and credit policy in the Belarusian legislature  demonstrates that the deputies, who occupy the top positions in  the state administration, do not want the order installed in the  money and credit sphere. First and foremost, these are Prime  Minister V. Kebich, Supreme Soviet Chairman M. Hryb, his  deputies, chairmen of oblast executive committees, and their  followers.    I would like to address my colleagues in the legislature,  who  are not indifferent to the destiny of the Belarusian state, to  weigh and sort out all the consequences of the so-called  monetary Russian-Belarusian merger before ratifying this  agreement and introducing changes to the new Constitution.  There are many mechanisms, which could provide for financial  integration with the CIS on equal terms, without being swallowed  by another state. My colleagues from other states-partners and  we should look for and introduce these measures in legislative  acts. The government should observe the legislative acts,  especially that of the Constitution adopted by the Supreme  Soviet. Otherwise, it should drop its office.</p>

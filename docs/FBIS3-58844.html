			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "sp": "Antifascists Criticize Police"] </F>   [Text] Hannover, 18 January -- The Goettingen "Autonome  Antifa" group has accused the police of attempting to obstruct  its antifascist activities. The Lower Saxon Land Office of  Criminal Investigations [LKA] has been investigating the group  for more than two years on the grounds that some of its members  are suspected of belonging to a terrorist group.    The "Autonome Antifa" on Tuesday [18 January] described the  effects of the police investigations on the group. The members  of the group are exposed to permanent harassment, including  regular observation of their meetings and even their private  apartments. Telephones have been bugged. Their publications  and press releases are picked up at the receivers and the papers  are then examined for fingerprints by the LKA. Whenever the  group rents halls for meetings, LKA officers have questioned the  owners of the premises and even showed them files with  photographs. For one rally, the group rented a loudspeaker van;  the officers later confiscated the files of the car rental place  and even questioned employees. Over the weekend, the Greens  party of Goettingen stated that representatives of their party,  the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD], and the Federation  of German Trade Unions [DGB] received summons from the LKA.  They were asked to testify in the preliminary procedures  against members of the "Autonome Antifa." Last March, this  group assumed the initiative for a demonstration against  neo-Nazi activist Hans-Michael Fiedler and his training center  in Adelebsen (Goettingen district). Some 2,000 demonstrators  participated in the nonviolent protest march after the appeal  was also backed by members of the Greens, the SPD, and the DGB.    The "Autonome Antifa" has concluded from the LKA actions  that  "efficient, broadly based antifascist work is to be prevented."  Neo-Nazi activists such as Fiedler, however, are able to enhance  their activities under the eyes of the state prosecutor and the  LKA, it was said. When asked about this by FRANKFURTER  RUNDSCHAU, a spokesman for the Lower Saxon Interior Ministry  said the LKA was conducting its investigations on the  instructions of the chief state prosecutor of Celle.</p>

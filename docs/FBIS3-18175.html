			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin has said that Turkey  insists that the siege in Bosnia-Herzegovina be lifted and the  six security areas expanded. Cetin also indicated that  initiatives regarding this issue are under way at the UN  Security Council. Concluding his two-day official visit to the  Netherlands, Cetin returned to the country tonight.    In a statement he issued at Ankara's Esenboga Airport, Cetin  said that various issues were discussed and assessed with the  Dutch officials, adding that he believes this visit will  contribute to further relations between the two countries.    Expressing the concern that unless necessary measures are  taken against the terrorism perpetrated by the PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] organization, terrorism could spread to  other areas in Europe, Cetin stated that the Dutch authorities  indicated that they are undertaking great efforts regarding both  terrorism and xenophobia.    Noting that in the course of the meetings he pointed out to  Turkey's determination to join the Customs Union, Cetin noted  that for a long time now, the EC had not undertaken any  financial contributions in that direction. Cetin further  explained that assessments and discussions were conducted with  the Dutch authorities on alternate ways and means of obtaining  financial support for Turkey on its joining the Customs Union,  since the lack of financial assistance on the part of the EC  meant that the European Unity was not fulfilling its  requirements toward Turkey.    Cetin also pointed out that during the meetings they  stressed  the advantages of the integration of Turks into the Netherlands  community while retaining their cultural identity.</p>

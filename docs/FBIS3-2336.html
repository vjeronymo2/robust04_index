In order to strengthen  and improve army management in the new period, it is necessary  to devote much effort to regular operation.    Regular management is the long-term, fundamental task for  army building. Massive, concrete, and extensive regular  management can be seen everywhere and every day. It is carried  out according to existing rules, regulations, ordinances, and  systems, to meet the needs of the army regarding daily war  preparations, military training, army operation, the soldiers'  daily life, and all other duties. So long as a good job is done  in this regard, we will be able to implement all rules,  ordinances, and regulations down to every unit, every member of  the army, and every specific task, thus ensuring the successful  completion of all tasks with military training as the core.    Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly  handling the relationship between shock operations and regular  jobs. It is necessary to carry out intensive rectification of  discipline and work style to cope with some specific prominent  problems in respect of troop management during a certain period.  However, such intensive operations cannot replace regular  management. For instance, the cultivation of discipline and  work style of the army, the fostering of servicemen's fine  qualities, and establishment of regular order in work and  everyday life cannot be achieved overnight or through a couple  of shock operations. Even if some longstanding, knotty problems  can be resolved through shock operations, regular efforts are  still necessary to ensure that such problems will not arise  again. By the way, many problems regarding army management may  not be very serious at the outset, and they can be readily  resolved at this initial stage by moderate or precautionary  measures. However, if such problems are left unattended at  first, and shock operations are only launched just before  accumulative effects are about to cause a catastrophe, then the  development of the army will have been more seriously impaired.    Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly  handling the relationship between management and education, and  persistently carrying out regular management and ideological  education. The nature and goal of our army determine that  strict management must be based on persuasion, education,  enlightenment, and initiative. This is one of our army's fine  traditions and one of our basic principles for army management.  To uphold this principle, we must, as far as management is  concerned, start from ideological education, making our officers  and fighters not only understand what they should do but also  why they should do it that way, thus enhancing their sense of  obedience to management. To uphold this principle, officers who  are in command must be aware of what fighters are thinking  about, and strengthen management to cope with specific problems  to fulfill the objective of strict management. Practice has  proved that extensively launching the drive of "four knowing's  and one catching up with" [si ge zhi dao yi ge gen shang 0934  0020 4249 6670 0001 0020 6418 0006] and that of "four reports  and one reliance" [si ge bao gao yi ge yi kao 0934 0020 1032  0707 0001 0020 0181 7237] could be an effective approach to  ensuring the perfect integration and sure implementation of  regular management and ideological work. Our leading people and  organs at all levels must give better guidance to ensure that  these drives will be carried out in a deep-going and  down-to-earth manner within all the army.    Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly  handling the relationship between specific duties and  management. Our army's regular management can by no means be  separated from its various missions with military training as  the core. Without effective management, the army can hardly  complete any tasks; but without the tasks the army is  undertaking, management will become meaningless. Regular  management must apply to every specific task, and all kinds of  military officers at all levels must do a good job in management  with a view to accomplishing all the tasks. Only in this way  will we be able to give full play to the role of management work  in safeguarding the smooth operation of the army and the  completion of all tasks. Only by applying management to all  specific tasks will we be able to do away with, once for all,  inconsistency in management performance, and thus ensure that  fighters will perform equally well on and off the drill ground,  both in the presence and absence of leading officers, and both  during and after inspection periods. So we will be able to  constantly improve the overall management efficiency.    Massive, concrete, and extensive management operations are  the most prominent characteristics of regular management. This  determines that our officers in command must keep an  industrious, meticulous, and down-to-earth work style. Being  industrious means to be industrious in thinking, in going around  to keep in touch with and talk with the fighters, to inspect  work frequently, and to be ready to discover and solve problems  at any time. Being meticulous means to always keep general  interests in mind when organizing and carrying out management  work and doing a meticulous job when dealing with specific  tasks. Working in a down-to-earth manner means taking an honest  attitude and doing practical work with regard to management,  doing a solid job in ensuring implementation of orders,  preventing formalism, and opposing trickery and deception. In  this way, we will be able to keep up our good, efficient job in  regular management of the army.</p>

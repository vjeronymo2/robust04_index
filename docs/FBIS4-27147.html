			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 31 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean  Government welcomes the U.N. Security Council [UNSC] president's  statement on North Korea Tuesday with a warning to Pyongyang  that it is headed toward confrontation with the entire  international community.    "The government of the Republic of Korea wholeheartedly  supports (the statement) as an appropriate action," Foreign  Ministry spokesman Chang Ki-ho said in a statement.    The 15-member Security Council issued a presidential  statement urging North Korea to comply with International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) requirements in discharging fuel rods from  its nuclear reactor.    "The adoption of this Security Council presidential  statement  is a declaration of the firm and unified will of the  international community on the North Korean nuclear problem,"  the spokesman said. "We warn that North Korea must realize the  unfortunate reality that it is inviting confrontation with the  entire international community and that it not turn the matter  into a more serious situation by immediately accepting the  demands of the international community."    The government is once again pressing North Korea to halt  the  rod unloading process and accept the required IAEA safeguards,  the spokesman said.</p>

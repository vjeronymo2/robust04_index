			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / FT Review of Business Books (15): Map through the minefield  -The book is based on the author's extensive experience with a string of British companies / Managing change 'SUCCEEDING WITH CHANGE: IMPLEMENTING ACTION-DRIVEN STRATEGIES' by Tony Eccles McGraw-Hill, Pounds 19.95, 256 pages If there is a single Holy Grail in business today, it is how to manage organisational change and transformation - or, put more realistically, how to unleash change processes and then steer them so that they are neither derailed nor run into the sand. Managers all over the world would give their eye teeth - or even more - for a reliable map through that minefield. So it is not surprising that the publishing industry has spewed out a flood of books on 'change' over the past few years, not only from the explosives expert of the genre, Tom Peters, but also from less bombastic authors. The trouble is that most of the books mislead most readers. There are four reasons for this. First, some books are far too simplistic to do justice to this multifaceted subject. Second, it is so peppered with subtleties that, in their introductory and closing chapters, most provide a simplistic or overstated view of their message. In the very likely event that most people read only part of the book, they get only half the message - or, worse, a damagingly half-baked view of such key issues as the relative roles of top-down change programmes and 'empowered' front-line workers. This was an occupational hazard, for instance, with The Critical Path to Corporate Renewal, an influential Harvard-published book in 1991. Only the most skilful writers have managed to avoid this pitfall. The third problem is that few books have provided much systematic, practical guidance for the individual leader or manager on what to do when, and to (or with) whom. Fourthly, almost all the books are American, and tend towards the evangelistic. In Succeeding With Change, Tony Eccles, who is an academic of unusually practical bent and has a long-standing delight in contrariness, escapes the fourth count by virtue of his Britishness. He also sets out to avoid the other three. On the first and third count, he does so with a vengeance. The book is far from simplistic, yet a very practical guide for the manager; based on Eccles' extensive experience with a string of British companies, it provides both a framework for understanding change, and a set of principles for how to execute it. As Charles Handy rightly declares in his back cover endorsement: 'managers will love it.' The trouble is that some may do so because they merely skim it, and so succumb to Eccles' failure to avoid the second drawback of this genre: initial overstatement. If they read just his first few chapters, they will get the impression that he rehabilitates old-fashioned macho management, in which the brain of the organisation is located purely at the top, while lesser ranks dutifully follow orders. Specifically, three of Eccles' messages will strike them: that complex change can be accomplished far more quickly than most other writers have advocated; that this can be done by using 'concentrated power' to force or drive change through; and that empowerment of middle managers and front-line employees is over-rated as a tool for achieving change successfully. As with equivalent - although very different - overstatements at the start of the Harvard volume, Eccles adds several layers of caveat to each of these statements as the book progresses. He concedes, for instance, that 'forced drive' only really works in considerable crises and that, for change to last, it must be followed by the 'natural drive' which emerges when people lower down the organisation realise the need to change, and develop consensus, commitment, teamwork and enthusiasm. In the last third of the book, he also clarifies his view on empowerment He sees it as 'delegation revisited', and attacks American claims for it as hyperbolic. Yet, in his almost throwaway fashion, he eventually comes out as quite an enthusiast for it. He says that, for organisations to compete effectively in today's fast-moving, service-orientated economy, the freedom 'to use discretion in making speedy judgments' must be extended not only to highly qualified knowledge workers, but also to 'menial' employees - just so long as the company is not facing a crisis, that is. The core of the book consists of two useful sets of frameworks. One advises senior managers how to behave in six different political 'contexts' of change. Four of them presuppose strong top-down power: change by takeover; the injection of outside top management; succession by insiders; and 'renovation change,' when the existing managers decide the organisation needs changing. The latter - the most important because it is a very difficult context in which to impose change - is dealt with disappointingly, in four sparse pages. As Eccles admits, concentrated power works far less well in the fifth context: when the organisation is a professional service firm. The sixth context, catalytic change through consultants, is an adjunct to the other five. Eccles' second framework is what he calls 14 'factors of change' which are common to the different political contexts. Some factors, such as the need for clarity of purpose, are self-evident. Others, such as the (unfashionable) importance of structure, and the dilemma over how open to be with one's colleagues and staff, are far from obvious. In spite of his richly commonsense reading of the realities of corporate power, one is left with the impression that Eccles has been overinfluenced by his main study companies, conglomerates such as GEC and Grant Metropolitan, run by tartars such as Lord Weinstock and Lord (Allen) Sheppard. He might have formed a rather more catholic view if he had included in his sample more consultative transformational leaders such as Sir Christopher Hogg of Courtaulds and Reuters, Donald Petersen of Ford, and successive bosses of Motorola. The successes of all three - and also that of the more muscular regime at British Airways - underline that deep-set, lasting change is a very extended affair indeed. Except in rare cases, it is only structural and procedural change that can be accomplished quickly.</p>

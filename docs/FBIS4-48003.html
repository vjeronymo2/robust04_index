			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Human Rights Commission on 9 May; </F> place not given]    [Text] As South Africa's first democratically elected  Parliament sits for the first time today, a new era in South  Africa's history is ushered in. The interim constitution has  both a bill of rights and makes provision for a statutory human  rights commission. In this light, HRC [Human Rights Commission]  is changing its name to Human Rights Committee of South Africa  so as to avoid any confusion. The Human Rights Committee will  continue the work done by the commission but will also examine  how human rights issues can best be monitored and reported on in  the new political environment. HRC is also pleased to announce  the appointment of Patrick Kelly as national director of the  organisation. He replaces Safoora Sadek who resigned to take up  a seat in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  provincial legislature.</p>

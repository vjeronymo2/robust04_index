			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Railtrack It is not strictly true that Railtrack's privatisation depends on the strike-ridden company making big productivity gains - much as that is what the government's highly paid financial advisers are telling it. Even less so is privatisation contingent on personal contracts being imposed on the signalling staff. In fact, prospective shareholders would be rather disappointed if the bulk of the efficiency improvements Railtrack is able to deliver came before privatisation. In other privatisations, the main staff cuts and changes in working practices have occurred after companies have been freed from state control. Not only are such changes easier to bring about once unions know they cannot hope to involve politicians in an industrial dispute. It is precisely the post-privatisation drive for efficiency that has proved so profitable for investors in the energy, water and telecommunications sectors. That said, investors would clearly need to be confident that Railtrack's management was not so broken by the current strike that it was incapable of taking firm action after a share sale. If Mr Jimmy Knapp, the rail union leader, was able to claim a famous victory in the dispute, shareholders would indeed be unnerved. This point is not lost on Railtrack directors and helps explain the company's tough line. Ministers too have an interest in hanging tough. Privatisation receipts of around Pounds 3bn would make that pre-election tax cut just that much easier.</p>

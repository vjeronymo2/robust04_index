			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Venezuela opens its oil sector to private capital: Exploration tenders sought for first time since nationalisation in 1976 Venezuela's national oil company has developed a programme to open its exploration and production sectors to private capital for the first time since the oil industry was nationalised in 1976. Petroleos de Venezuela, PDVSA, plans to seek tenders on profit-sharing contracts, under which private companies will be allowed to explore about 10 geographical areas onshore and offshore. Successful companies must finance all exploration themselves. If commercial quantities of crude oil or natural gas are discovered, the private investor will then set up a joint venture with one of PDVSA's operating subsidiaries  -Corpoven, Lagoven or Maraven - to develop the new fields and market the oil internationally. If no oil or gas is found in commercial quantities, the private party bears the loss. The PDVSA plan must still be approved by the cabinet of President Rafael Caldera and by a joint session of the Venezuelan Congress. PDVSA officials expect no big problems. PDVSA, one of the world's largest oil companies, has extensive proven reserves of heavy crude oil and bitumen, but wants to boost its reserves of higher-value light and medium crudes to stay competitive internationally. At end-1993, PDVSA's proven reserves of crude oil stood at 64.5bn barrels, the largest in the western hemisphere. Executives at PDVSA say geological and seismic studies indicate that the country still has large, undiscovered deposits of light and medium crude oils. Exploration of the most promising areas by PDVSA on its own would require capital investments of Dollars 6bn-8bn, taking more than 25 years. However, PDVSA expects that if private investors join the effort to find oil, exploration of these same areas could be completed in 10 years, with all exploration investment paid for by private companies. The areas to be put up for tender could hold between 7bn and 23bn barrels of light/medium crudes, plus 10,000bn cubic feet of gas, according to estimates made by PDVSA after a British Petroleum survey. Winning bidders will be chosen on the basis of how much of their future after-tax profits they are willing to hand over to the state if they find oil and gas. PDVSA says that according to risk contacts offered in other countries, the state keeps between 71 and 88 per cent of after-tax earnings, with the remainder going to private investors. In developing its proposals, PDVSA has been mindful of the failure of this year's round of oil and gas tenders in neighbouring Colombia. But while international oil companies such as Exxon, Shell, BP, Amoco and others have shown considerable interest in the Venezuelan plan, they have some reservations. For example, some would prefer a transparent mechanism that would reduce their payments to the state to encourage them to develop profitably any smaller, more remote fields. The government is working on a plan which would offer possible post facto reductions in royalty payments in such cases. Companies have also expressed concern about government policy, including strict controls on foreign exchange transactions and the suspension of constitutional rights to private property. PDVSA and the government are working on possible solutions. PDVSA managers point out, for example, that when investors are ready to repatriate profits, probably in several years, exchange controls should have been lifted or softened. 'Venezuela is without doubt one of the most attractive countries for risk investment in exploration,' said the local representative of a US oil company. 'If PDVSA can work out the kinks, they should receive a strong response from bidders, and could obtain several billion dollars in exploration and development capital over the next decade.' Venezuela has been slowly opening up its nationalised oil industry for the last few years. Under the previous government, private oil companies were allowed to produce crude and natural gas under operating contracts in so-called marginal (relatively small) oil fields. But in these cases, the operator is paid on a per-barrel basis by PDVSA; the oil does not belong to the private investor and must be turned over to PDVSA. Several important joint ventures between PDVSA units and foreign companies have been established in producing natural gas and upgrading heavy oil, but none has begun to operate. Until now, exploration for and production of crude oil (for eventual sale) had been off limits to private investors.</p>

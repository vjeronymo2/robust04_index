			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Climax in Kanemaru political saga near THE public tug-of-war between Mr Shin Kanemaru, so-called kingmaker of Japanese politics, and prosecutors investigating his receipt of Y500m (Pounds 2.36m) from a trucking company linked to organised crime appeared to be nearing its climax yesterday, writes Charles Leadbeater. His lawyers, who have been negotiating with the Tokyo prosecutor's office in the past few days, are reported to have delivered a written statement in which he admitted receiving the money from Mr Hiroyasu Watanabe, the president of Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Mr Kanemaru's lawyers have wanted to avoid him appearing in court to face formal charges that the donations violated political funding laws. If the prosecutors are satisfied the statement acknowledges his guilt, it is expected Mr Kanemaru will be summarily indicted and fined Y200,000 without having to appear in court. That would lessen the public humiliation of the case, which could yet mark the nadir of his political influence and spark what could be a destabilising power struggle within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The case forced Mr Kanemaru's resignation as LDP president on August 27, but he still wields enormous power in the party through his influence at the head of its largest faction. The prosecutors allege that Mr Kanemaru asked Mr Watanabe to give him the money just before the election of February 1990. It was then distributed among 60 candidates of the LDP's Takeshita faction, say the prosecutors. Mr Kanemaru admitted his office received the Y500m, but said it was simply 'goodwill money' and not in breach of the Political Funds Control Law, which stipulates that a company can donate no more than Y100m to one party.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 24 April, Komeito Secretary General Yuichi  Ichikawa commented on the possibility of Japan's logistical  support for U.S. and other foreign forces if the United Nations  imposes economic sanctions against the DPRK (North Korea) and a  naval blockade is enforced in connection with North Korea's  suspected nuclear weapons development. He stated: "If the  United Nations makes the decision, Japan for its part intends to  provide as much as cooperation as possible. If it is necessary  for Japan to join in logistical support activities, Japan has no  choice but to do so." Ichikawa made the remarks in a TV Asahi  program. His remarks are believed to have virtually approved  Japan's logistical support for U.S. forces.    Discussing the connection between the exercise of the right  of collective self-defense, which the Constitution bans, and  logistical support, Ichikawa said: "For example, oil supplies  to U.S. forces has been banned because it is believed to be  included in collective self-defense under the conventional  interpretation of the Constitution by the Cabinet Legislation  Bureau. However, because (the North Korea issue) is an  important issue concerning Japan's security, oil supplies to  U.S. forces are also deemed to come within the category of  individual self-defense." He added: "If it is necessary to  take legislative measures, we have to do that."</p>

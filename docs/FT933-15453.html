			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Lack of incentive locks up Mongolia's gold - Restrictive investment laws that are discouraging mine developers MR SAMBUUGIN Gereltuya, director of Mongolia's mineral processing technological centre, has a problem. His organisation owns a commercially-viable gold mine, but because of his impoverished country's restrictive gold acquisition policy, there is no incentive to develop the mine. As in neighbouring China, the Mongolian central bank is empowered to acquire all gold produced at a price well below that prevailing internationally, with the result that gold mining is not commercially viable. The recent heavy depreciation of the local currency, the tugrik, after it was floated has exacerbated the problem. 'No official has said anything about changing the price. If the old price doesn't change, we cannot develop the mine,' says Mr Gereltuya ruefully. The exploitation of mineral resources, particularly gold and platinum, would seem to offer Mongolia, which is believed to be rich in such resources, the best prospect for improving its disastrous foreign exchange position. The country's new foreign investment law also acts as a disincentive to much-needed foreign participation in the capital-intensive gold mining sector. The law, passed in May, obliges foreign companies to pay the full tax rate from the outset on profits gleaned from the production of precious metals. There is no provision for tax holidays or other incentives. Tough laws relating to gold production stand in marked contrast to the relatively favourable terms being offered for the exploitation of most minerals and oil and gas, under which companies are being offered a five-year tax holiday, to be followed by a further five years at 50 per cent of the full tax rate. Mongolia's stumbling approach to providing incentives for development of its gold sector is typical of this landlocked country's uncertain progress towards the international mainstream after being almost totally dependent on Moscow for the past 70 years. When the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991 Mongolia lost the life-line that had provided everything from food, clothing, oil and electricity to chewing gum, teapots and light bulbs. After the collapse, Mongolia's GNP shrank by 10 per cent, foreign trade volume fell by 60 per cent and national income fell 13 per cent to USDollars 10bn. Foreign debt has reached Dollars 12bn and aid last year totalled Dollars 220m. Adding to the disastrous situation were the losses incurred by officials of Mongolia's Central Bank, who squandered about Dollars 80m, virtually the whole of the country's foreign exchange reserves, in ill-advised currency speculation. Mr Wilhelm Nahr, resident representative in Ulan Bator, the Mongolian capital, for the International Monetary Fund, which last year negotiated a reform package with the government, says simply: 'They are faced with a complete lack of foreign resources'. Commitments entered into under a typical IMF assistance programme included undertakings to move the local currency towards convertibility, controls on the deficit and liberalisation of trade policies. Mongolia's trade is at present almost exclusively in copper barter deals. Last year's production of about 250,000 tonnes was, as usual, swapped with Russia for spare parts, oil and consumer goods. Among the areas where Mongolia is in desperate need of assistance is infrastructure. The country's phone system is appalling, many of its roads are impassable for much of the year and its rail links are extremely limited. Mr Lawrence Lien, a consultant to the United Nations Development Programme, believes that Mongolia needs to do much more to encourage foreign investment in both the resources area, where prospects are good, and in infrastructure. 'You need to have an arrangement for the recovery of investment quickly,' he says. 'Mongolia must, if it want foreign partners for infrastructure development, create a situation that allows for faster return.' Among the steps that he suggests should be adopted immediately to encourage infrastructure development are more generous tax laws and a provision that a foreign partner gets paid before the local partner. 'All these things look like exploitation,' he admits, 'but in reality these are incentives for foreigners to come and take substantial risks for substantial return.'</p>

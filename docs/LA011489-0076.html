			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE BOARD OKS NEW SCIENCE TEACHING POLICY  </P> <P> Despite objections from Christian fundamentalists, a new science teaching  policy designed to strengthen classroom instruction about evolution and other  controversial topics was approved Friday by the state Board of Education.  </P> <P> The new policy, approved by unanimous voice vote at a board meeting in  Sacramento, defines and distinguishes between the teaching of scientific  theory, such as evolution, and teaching about beliefs, such as Bible-based  views that man was created in his present form.  </P> <P> Only science, including tested theories that explain natural phenomena and are  based on evidence, should be taught in science classrooms, the new policy says.  Discussions of competing beliefs, which are partly matters of faith and not  subject to scientific testing, should be encouraged in social science courses,  it adds.  </P> <P> Supporters of the new policy, including experts in the state Department of  Education and panels of scientists and educators, say it is part of a larger  effort to rebuild the quality of science teaching at a time when studies show  U.S. students are deficient in their understanding of basic scientific  principles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Anti-Dogmatism' Policy  </P> <P> Part of the problem in California, many argued, was the state board's  16-year-old "anti-dogmatism" policy on science teaching, adopted as a  compromise after an earlier battle between fundamentalists and scientists. That  policy, which is replaced by the statement adopted Friday, called for  "conditional" statements to be used in discussing the origins of life and the  Earth.  </P> <P> Critics say it led textbook publishers and teachers to neglect or to be  ambiguous in teaching widely accepted scientific theories about prehistoric  times and human development. In addition, some teachers were using the policy  as a rationale for introducing into classrooms creationist views, which are not  endorsed by any major scientific organization.  </P> <P> Francie Alexander, the state's associate superintendent of curriculum and  instruction, said the new policy is a "reversal of the 'dumbing down' " trend  of recent years. Previously, she said, when a topic was as tough or  controversial, "the implicit policy (was), 'When in doubt, throw it out.' "  </P> <P> "We have to do a better job if we want a more scientifically literate  population," Alexander said. "This is one piece of a whole strategy."  </P> <P> But the Rev. Lou Sheldon, president of the Orange County-based Traditional  Values Coalition, criticized the new policy. "We see a very good anti-dogmatism  statement being somewhat watered down," he said. He said state education  officials are attempting to teach evolution as a fact and are "putting  themselves in a further adversarial role to family values."  </P> <P> Sheldon, whose church-based group lobbied board members to reject the policy,  said the battle is not over. He and state education officials note that the new  policy statement is only the first step toward adoption of new, detailed  science teaching guidelines. Those guidelines will shape the content of the  next generation of state-funded science textbooks used in the 1990s in  classrooms throughout California.  </P> <P> In addition to fighting for their view to be reflected in science teaching  guidelines and new textbooks, the creationists will put pressure on local  school boards not to support the state board's new policy, Sheldon said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> 'AUNT JULIA' FAVORITE AT FESTIVAL  </P> <P> Spectators at Deauville's annual American film festival picked "Aunt Julia and  the Scriptwriter," a comedy starring Peter Falk, as their favorite American  film of the year.  </P> <P> The film, directed by Jon Amiel and based on a novel by Peruvian novelist Mario  Vargas Llosa, has yet to open in commercial theaters. It is set in the 1950s,  with Falk playing a writer of radio scripts.  </P> <P> Most of the films at the festival have opened in the United States. Among those  making premieres in Deauville were "Cadence," the first movie directed by actor  Martin Sheen, and "Convicts," directed by Peter Masterson and starring Robert  Duvall.  </P> <P> There is no celebrity jury at Deauville's festival. All voting is by  spectators.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sergey Yakovlev, chief designer of the OKB </F> [Experimental Design Bureau] imeni A.S. Yakovlev: "The New  Yak-77 Model"]    [Text] The economic reforms and privatization under way in  the country and the appearance of numerous nonstate enterprises  and organizations resulting from these processes require new  approaches to air transport problems. Our traditional system of  air transport does not fully meet the specific demand for air  service that is emerging. The inflexible scheduling and  insufficient frequency of flights and the fairly low level of  service create considerable inconvenience. This has a particular  effect on businessmen from other countries because it forces  them to look for alternative routes for trips or to ship cargoes.    Lately we have observed the emergence of numerous airlines  which do not make regular, but occasional (charter) flights.  However, the opportunities to select the most suitable aircraft  for such flights are extremely limited: there are no aircraft of  the appropriate class in the country today. The Yak-40 is  utilized most often in the business version at present. There is  no question that the aircraft is reliable and quite comfortable  in versions with a "cabin" configuration. But strictly speaking,  the Yak-40 is an aircraft intended for an entirely different  purpose. And the main features it lacks for business flights are  speed and range.    Taking this into account, work has been under way at the OKB  imeni A.S. Yakovlev to study the potential market for  business-class aircraft. As a result of research, we have  determined the appearance of a prospective aircraft which has  been given the designation Yak-77. The basic characteristic of  the new aircraft which determines practically all its remaining  parameters is its range of nonstop flight. A somewhat unusual  path was taken in selecting the latter. Study of the typical  routes within Russia and abroad--to the CIS countries, Europe,  and Asia--showed that an aircraft for this purpose should have a  range of no less than 5,000 to 6,000 kilometers with six  passengers on board.    We know that domestic industry is not producing engines  suitable for the aircraft planned. Although work on such an  engine with a thrust of 4,000 to 5,000 metric tons has already  been begun at the "Soyuz" Design Bureau under the supervision of  V.K. Kobchenko. However, new domestic engines will not be making  their appearance soon. We had to turn our eyes to the West. They  have units of the dimensions and thrust needed here. Only we  must pay for them with dollars. Will we find many here who are  willing and able to pay for them? How do we proceed? We settled  on what in our view is the best possible alternative: develop  and sell the aircraft with imported engines installed in it in  other countries to start with. And utilize the foreign exchange  acquired in this way to purchase additional foreign engines. And  install them in the aircraft offered to Russian consumers at  acceptable prices.    It is no secret that it is very hard to sell a  business-class  aircraft abroad. First of all, the market for this kind of  aircraft is quite limited and it was divided up among producers  a long time ago. Secondly, it must be confessed that the  reputation of our aviation industry is far from good. First of  all because of its inability to reliably supply spare parts and  other technical service for the aircraft it turns out. For this  reason, entering the market to sell something similar to  aircraft which have already proved themselves, such as the  "Gulfstream" or the "Falcon," is an undertaking with hardly any  prospects. We needed to find something which potential  competitors are not in a position to offer at present. In our  case, we counted on development of a business aircraft with a  range of 10,000 kilometers or more. From Moscow to Los Angeles,  for example. There is nothing like it in the world yet.    Afterward everything was relatively simple: the payload of  six passengers and the range were determined by the takeoff  weight and the required thrust of the engines. Calculations  showed that a flight of 10,000 kilometers at a cruising speed of  800 kilometers per hour would take over 12 hours. Such a lengthy  flight requires very careful study to provide comfortable  conditions for the passengers and crew.    As apparent from the configuration diagram of the Yak-77,  its  passenger cabin is quite large. It has "a great deal of air."  The height of the ceiling makes it possible for even the tallest  passengers to stretch their legs and walk about the cabin. There  is a compartment with a sofa for the crew (three pilots,  incidentally) to rest.    The specific nature of a long-range business aircraft also  determines the approaches to selection of the on-board equipment  complex. The important factor here is the high degree of  automation; navigation support when flying over extensive  unpopulated areas (water or ice); advanced radio communications;  and redundancy of the main systems of vital importance. It is  planned to determine the composition and types of on-board  systems more specifically with participation by the aircraft's  buyers. The OKB is prepared to provide the aircraft with  domestic as well as foreign equipment.    It is planned to complete work on development of the Yak-77  and its testing and to obtain an airworthiness certificate no  later than 1997. Our venerable competitors intend to have their  new aircraft ready by this time. I am referring to the three  most prestigious manufacturers of business-class aircraft: the  Gulfstream firm (United States) with the "Gulfstream-U,"  Dassault (France) with the "Falcon-9000," and Bombardier  (Canada) with the "Global Express."    It is very hard to compete with such "opponents." Our  advantages may be only the shorter production periods and  comparatively lower price. But in order to lower the price of  the Yak-77, we must produce it in a large series in addition to  everything else.    We have a unique opportunity in this respect. Because as  already pointed out, the dimensions of the Yak-77 fuselage are  unusually large for a business-class aircraft. It makes it  possible to install 32 standard seats in the cabin when  necessary. And then it will not be necessary to reeinforce the  construction or change the engines, inasmuch as the takeoff  weight will be unchanged. We know that a higher payload means a  reduction of the amount of fuel in the aircraft. But even under  these circumstances the Yak-77's range with 32 passengers will  be more than 5,000 kilometers. In this version it becomes a  regional passenger aircraft for scheduled airline routes,  according to European standards. Consequently, there may be  considerable demand for different configuration arrangements in  the Yak-77. Especially as our OKB intends to offer customers two  more versions of this aircraft--to seat 50 and 70. With a  lengthened fuselage, of course, but with engines of a single  type.    These are the studies conducted by the OKB A.S. Yakovlev and  the Saratov Aircraft Plant on the Yak-77. It remains to be added  that its price for foreign customers will be no more than $20  million. This is significantly lower than the price suggested  for competitive aircraft. It will be less expensive for Russian  customers, and paid for in rubles as well.    Before the Yak-77 comes out, which as I noted will be no  earlier than 1997, the OKB imeni A.S. Yakovlev is offering an  extensive "set" of modifications for the Yak-40 aircraft. Owners  of the "forties" will be able to significantly extend their  capabilities, including in business-class versions. By  increasing the fuel up to 6 metric tons, the Yak-40's range will  be increased to 2,000 kilometers. The Smolensk Aircraft Plant is  prepared to modify the wings for the increased fuel tank  capacity.    Another very promising modification, in our view, is  provided  by replacement of the Yak-40's power plant. The OKB plans to  install two LF-507 engines made by the American Textron-Lycoming  firm to replace the three AI-25 engines. The aerodynamics of the  aircraft are improved and relative fuel consumption is reduced  at the same time. It is sufficient to say that the cruising  speed of the Yak-40TL [the designation with Textron-Lycoming  engines] will be increased by 10 percent and the range with the  same fuel will be increased by 25 percent. Operating expenses to  maintain the twin-engine version of the Yak-40 are 15 to 20  percent lower than the original version. But if a wing with fuel  tanks for 6 metric tons is installed on the aircraft, the  Yak-40TL will have a nonstop range of 2,500 kilometers with a  payload of 1 metric ton.    The on-board equipment may be replaced altogether or  individually by more advanced equipment--in any variation at the  request of the buyer; the passenger cabin arrangement may be  changed in accordance with individual requirements; and imported  materials are used in its finishing. In addition, the OKB is  prepared to extend the service life of the Yak-40 based on an  individual approach in each specific case.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Basic Specifications of the Yak-77                                           |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cabin configuration      |business                 |regional                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Takeoff weight, in kilog-|25,200                                             |  |rams                     |                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Payload mass, in kg      |880                      |3,500                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Engine takeoff thrust, i-|4,500 each engine                                  |  |n kg                     |                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum cruising speed,  |850                                                |  |in kilometers per hour   |                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Economy cruising speed,  |800                                                |  |in kmh                   |                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cruising altitude, in me-|12,000                                             |  |ters                     |                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Range at maximum speed,  |9,000                    |4,500                    |  |in km                    |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Maximum range, in km     |10,000                   |5,000                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H8>  * * * </H8>   Address for all questions: Russia, 125315, Moscow, Liza  Chaykina Street.

			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Belize to seek UK military support MR Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of Belize, is to ask Britain for further assurances of military support if the Central American country is threatened by neighbouring Guatemala. Mr Esquivel, who will visit Britain between Sunday and Wednesday of next week for discussions with government officials, said he was increasingly concerned at continued instability in Guatemala, where the congress and the supreme court have rejected a demand from President Ramon de Leon Carpio that they resign. 'All this could provide an opportunity for those elements in Guatemala which always want to raise the issue of Guatemalan claims to Belize,' Mr Esquivel said. 'All this concerns us as it could result in the overturning of former President Jorge Serrano's recognition of Belize.' Guatemala's 130-year-old territorial claim to Belize was ended last year by a pact between the then-president Serrano and Mr George Price, the former premier of Belize, in which Guatemala recognised Belize as an independent nation. Worries that the Guatemalan military might invade Belize in pursuit of the territorial claim led to the stationing of a 1,500-strong UK garrison in Belize. Earlier this year the British government said it intended to withdraw the garrison, but would use the facilities for military training. The garrison has contributed significantly to the economy of Belize. Mr Esquivel said a new budget next month would take account of the impending loss of income, as well as under-estimated expenditure and overstated revenue in the previous budget.</p>

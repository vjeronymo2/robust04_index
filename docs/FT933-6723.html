			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Public services rapped: Citizen's Charter appears to be bringing little improvement THE CITIZEN'S Charter appears to be doing little to raise the standard of services - more than two years after it was launched by Mr John Major, the prime minister. The results of an independent survey by ICM Research into what people think about the charter show that the performance of two-thirds of leading public services - both public and private-sector - is perceived to have deteriorated over the past year. Seven out of 10 people have heard of the charter, suggesting that the intensive promotional campaign that has accompanied Mr Major's Big Idea has been successful. There is also support for a range of charter-related policies, with large majorities in favour of the publication of league tables by public services and the linking of public-sector pay to performance. Since its launch in July 1991 the government's Citizen's Charter unit has spent Pounds 3.74m, with yesterday's research costing Pounds 75,000. Only eight of the 31 services included in the survey are thought to be doing a better job than a year ago, with some of the strongest performers - notably supermarkets - not covered by the charter or its multitude of sector-related spin-offs. Doctors and GP practices are thought to be performing markedly better than last year, in what ministers will interpret as a vote of confidence in the fundholder system. Local refuse collection has also improved significantly, in what could be claimed as a sign that the policy of allowing the private sector to compete for this business is paying dividends. There are contrasting messages for financial institutions, with building societies thought to be doing a better job than a year ago, while the banks are perceived to be doing much worse. Alongside banks at the foot of the table are local roads and British Rail. The performance of the law courts is also thought to have deteriorated markedly. With motorways, buses and London Underground also registering negative ratings, people appear to think the government's drive to improve the transport network is not working. The survey has a marginally more positive message when polling is restricted to users of a particular service. On this basis 11 of the 31 services are said to be doing better than a year ago. Schools fare better when statistics are based only on the views of service users. Awareness of the charter is higher among men than women at 77 per cent against 65 per cent. Only just over half of those at the foot of the social scale - who arguably are most dependent on public services being of good quality - have heard of the charter. NHS hospitals is the service people most want to see improved, although more than three-quarters of users think they are doing a very or fairly good job. Service users are also keen to see improvements in council housing, BR, secondary schools and local roads. The survey was conducted in March and April, with more than 3,000 adults being interviewed throughout mainland Britain.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> DOC Position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We agree with petitioner. In our deficiency questionnaire of December 14, 1993, the Department specifically asked the respondent to support its assertion regarding the ``exclusivity'' of the Master Agreement. Respondent, in its December 29, 1993, response, could neither demonstrate that the Master Agreement was ``exclusive,'' nor what quantity of the subject merchandise the respondent was agreeing to sell. Rather, Lafarge merely stated that the customer purchased all its requirements for certain cement products from it and that the ``volume commitment'' mentioned in the Master Agreement had been agreed to beforehand. Since we have no documentation demonstrating that a ``meeting of the minds'' regarding both quantity and price occurred before the POI, we cannot assume, based on respondent's word, that the Master Agreement is a requirements contract for purposes of establishing date of sale. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Crankshafts from the FRG and Gray Portland Cement from Mexico.) Accordingly, we have determined the appropriate date of sale for these particular sales to be the date of purchase order, and we have included them in our final dumping calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 3  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner argues that the Department should reverse its preliminary determination that CA cement and CA cement clinker constitute two such or similar categories. According to petitioner, the Department's determination was based on the incorrect premises that: (1) CA cement is not like CA cement clinker in the purposes for which used, and (2) in all past cases involving intermediate and finished products the Department has determined that there should be two such or similar categories. Petitioner contends that there is no question that CA cement and CA cement clinker constitute only one such or similar category pursuant to section 1677(16)(C) of the antidumping statute. According to petitioner, CA cement clinker is like the CA cement it is used to produce, and the difference-in-merchandise adjustment that would be required to make fair value comparisons between home market sales of CA cement and U.S. sales of clinker would be well below the Department's 20 percent difmer guideline. Petitioner further argues that because there is no data on the record for home market sales of CA cement to calculate FMV, the Department should use BIA to determine a margin for Lafarge's sales of both CA cement and CA cement clinker. Petitioner believes that, as BIA, the Department should use 41.23 percent, which is the lowest margin alleged in the petition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent does not believe that there is any reason for the Department to revisit its decision that CA cement and CA cement clinker are different such or similar categories at this late stage in the investigation. Respondent argues that it would be unfair for the Department to penalize it for failing to report information that the Department decided not to request. Furthermore, respondent contends that the statute does not allow the Department to use BIA when the information at issue was never requested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

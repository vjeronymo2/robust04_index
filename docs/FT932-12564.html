			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Oxford St store sold for Pounds 34.5m LEGAL &amp; GENERAL, the insurance company, has sold the DH Evans department store in Oxford Street for Pounds 34.5m to a private German investment company. The deal was struck at a relatively low yield - the ratio of income to capital value - of 7.2 per cent. The relatively high price reflects the possibility that the building might be partially converted into offices or smaller shop units at a later date. The building of 335,000 sq ft is let to House of Fraser Stores on a lease that has 90 years to run. The rent, which was settled in 1991, is Pounds 7.50 a sq ft.</p>

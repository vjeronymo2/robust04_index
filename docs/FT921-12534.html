			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Dollar falls against D-Mark The dollar lost ground against the D-Mark yesterday in trading dominated by speculation about possible accords on currency levels at the G7 meeting. The dollar in London closed at DM1.5875, down  3/4 pfennig on the day, and in New York at DM1.592, down nearly 1 1/2 pfennigs. One theory in the markets was that the US might try to push through an agreement to restrain the dollar's recent rise, to aid the US recovery by helping exporters. There was also the perception that Germany might want to put a floor under the D-Mark to damp domestic inflationary pressures. Currencies, Page 13</p>

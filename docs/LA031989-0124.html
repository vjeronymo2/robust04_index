			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BLACK FAMILY TRADITION;  </P> <P> VAL VERDE TO RESURRECT EASTER SUNRISE SERVICE  </P> <P> For half a century of Easters, hundreds of black families from all over Los  Angeles gathered on a hilltop in far-off Val Verde before dawn. There, seated  on benches before a giant white cross, they watched the sun rise, sang hymns  and celebrated the Resurrection of Christ.  </P> <P> After the service, they walked down a dirt trail to the town park where a  community breakfast awaited them. The aroma of pancakes and bacon filled the  air. The tiny Santa Clarita Valley town, long known as a vacation resort for  blacks, swelled with worshipers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Services Stopped  </P> <P> The services stopped in the late 1970s as people lost interest in the  tradition. But next Sunday, the Val Verde Civic Assn. is reviving the Easter  sunrise service to bolster civic pride and celebrate part of the rural town's  heritage.  </P> <P> "This program is pretty similar to what they had in the past," said Edwin  Brown, civic association president. The 6 a.m. service will be  nondenominational and will include music.  </P> <P> Worshipers will meet in Val Verde Park, about three miles north of California  126 and two miles west of Castaic Junction, and walk up a trail that was  cleared and refurbished for the event. A pancake breakfast will follow the  service.  </P> <P> Over the years, Val Verde's sunrise service attracted worshipers of many races.  But initially, the services symbolized the role the town played in Southern  California's black community.  </P> <P> "It goes back to the reason we came to Val Verde in the first place," said  Elijah Canty, 78. "During the 1940s, there weren't too many places where blacks  were welcome. In Val Verde, we always felt welcome because there was no  segregation here."  </P> <P> The services started in the 1920s, but Canty first watched the sunrise from the  Val Verde hilltop in the 1940s. Back then, he said, it took three or four hours  to drive the winding route from Los Angeles to Val Verde. "It was quite an  adventure," Canty said.  </P> <P> Most families arrived Friday or Saturday night and packed the few hotels in  town. Others stayed with friends.  </P> <P> "We felt free to be ourselves," Canty said.  </P> <P> The original event was organized by the park director and local ministers. It  had gone into decline after vandals desecrated the worship site.  </P> <P> "They came to Val Verde and went to the site of the service and dismantled all  the benches and threw them down the side of the mountain," Canty said. "That  was the beginning of the end. I don't remember what year it was."  </P> <P> Apathy also contributed to the demise of the service, Brown said. "It just  stopped because our community was old and a lot of people moved away. It became  something that people just forgot," he said.  </P> <P> Today, Val Verde is a multiracial community of about 2,300 people. The civic  association hopes that the service will attract a cross-section of the  community, as well as out-of-town visitors, Brown said.  </P> <P> Brown has lived in Val Verde since 1971, but next Sunday will mark his first  sunrise service. Even so, he said, he remembers well his first Easter in town.  He was awakened early that morning by a soft soprano voice that floated down  the hillside and into the valley. It was the day's soloist.  </P> <P> Brown got up and walked outside to hear the voice. "It was beautiful," he said.  </P></p>

But sooner or later the premier  is going to have to take action to resolve the case which has  stirred the nationalistic fervor of Cambodians and scared  foreign investors.    The dispute centers around Thai Bun Rung, a Hong Kong based-  company which has been portrayed as a-Thai concern and was  awarded a 15 year contract by the former Phnom Penh-based regime  to renovate the state owned Olympic Market. Vendors who used to  operate at the market for nominal fees have expressed outrage at  the company's demands for rents that run from $400 a year to  several thousand dollars. To press their demands, the vendors  have staged noisy demonstrations in the capital Phnom Penh and  have won varying levels of support from Finance Minister Sam  Rangsi and King Norodom Sihanouk.    The row also has far reaching political implications and  threatens to further strain relations between the two largest  coalition government partners, Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party and  the Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which has been a large  beneficiary of company owner Teng Bunma.    Ranariddh himself has also been touched by Teng Bunma's  largess and was the recipient of a $1.5 million airplane last  year. The gift has raised eyebrows and questions over  Ranariddh's motives in seeking to quell the protests.    But with the political temperature rising to dangerously  high  levels, action was needed to cool down tempers and restore the  confidence of both existing foreign investors or the potential  ones, who are vital to the development of this economic  backwater.    By attacking the Thai Bun Rung consortium and many other  existing foreign companies over dubious deals that were struck  with the CPP, and pressing for the revision to their contracts,  the Funcinpec side of the government is capitalizing on  nationalist sentiment to enhance its popularity. At least one  of three protests against Thai Bun Rung was believed to have  been engineered by a Funcinpec minister.    However, this political strategy which effectively sent the  party to victory against the rival CPP in the UN-supervised  elections last May will this time work against Funcinpec and  consequently the government's stability if it is allowed to  continue. There is good reason to believe that there is  something in the coup rumours which began circulating less than  a month after the coalition government assumed office in August.    It is true some of the foreign businessmen in Cambodia have  behaved like "cowboys" who came to unscrupulously exploit the  Farwest and need to be replaced by good investors as Finance  Minister Sam Rangsi recently advocated.    But sadly, they are also the only things holding together  Cambodia's fragile economy at this stage. In a worse case  scenario, what will happen if they all abruptly withdraw their  business from Cambodia? Funcinpec ministers are playing a  dangerous game by attacking foreign businessmen while the  country desperately needs investment in all the economic sectors.    Like it or not, Ranariddh was right when he said in a  television broadcast on Sunday to try to resolve the Thai Bun  Rung case:    "We can seek popularity after three or four years when the  next election comes but popularity is not the issue. The issue  is to help the people by providing medicine, food, and schools."    And whether or not Ranariddh was being pressured by the CPP  leaders who fear they may lose the ill-gotten gains they are  alleged to have amassed, it is the entire government's  responsibility to tackle this troublesome issue in a frank and  fair manner. Such talks are necessary to instill a habit of  working together and a test of their sincerity to the world and  the nation.    The trade dispute brought to the simmering conflicts between  members of the two coalition partners. Moreover, it  demonstrated there was also a level of conflict within Funcinpec  itself.    At this delicate stage, the government should be expanding  its energy on securing unity within and working together towards  establishing a conducive environment to attract "good investors".    Once economic development has been assured with strong and  sound investment, the selfish businessmen can be wiped out.</p>

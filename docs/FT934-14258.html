			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The meaning of independence Sir, Your Rome correspondent goes a long way ('Easier said than done', October 12) in trying to lend weight and dignity to grossly unfair criticisms which have been levied against the strategy of Prof Romano Prodi, head of Iri, for moving ahead with the Comit and Credit privatisations. I do not see any other alternative to Prof Prodi's strategy, do you? Let me add a comment to your correspondent's assertion that Mediobanca is independent. Independence should not imply being unaware of conflicts of interest. However, this is probably its interpretation of the word independence. Indeed, once upon a time its management (incidentally, still running the same company) was part of a young syndicate of Mediobanca shareholders whose existence was kept secret from other shareholders. Shameless exploitation of asymmetry of information is obviously completely different from independence, but I am not sure Mediobanca's management is of the same opinion, at least from what can be understood from its behaviour.

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / International Company News: Fiat textiles unit ahead 12.5% SNIA-BPD, the textiles, chemicals and munitions subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group, raised consolidated group profits by 12.5 per cent to L48.7bn (Dollars 39.30m) last year, despite a 6.7 per cent fall in sales to L2,317.8bn. The company announced a L192bn rights issue, on the basis of one new ordinary share for every three ordinary or savings shares held. The proceeds will be used to maintain the group's heavy investment strategy. Earlier this year, a SNIA-BPD subsidiary spent Dollars 230m to buy some of the cardiovascular activities of the US Pfizer group. SNIA-BPD has been restructuring recently, striking joint ventures with other producers in troubled area such as fibres, while pushing ahead, via acquisitions, in new sectors like bio-engineering The company blamed last year's fall in sales on slower world economic growth, which had affected its fibres, base chemicals and defence and space activities. By contrast, sales on the bio-engineering side rose by 14 per cent while materials climbed by 13.3 per cent. The same trend in turnover had continued so far this year, the company said. SNIA-BPD attributed the boost in group earnings to unspecified extraordinary elements. By contrast, net profits for the parent company almost halved to L22.2bn from L41.8bn in 1990 as a result of extraordinary burdens. Despite the drop, the company is dipping into reserves to pay an unchanged dividend of L65 for ordinary shares, L85 for convertible savings shares, and L95 for non-convertible savings stock.</p>

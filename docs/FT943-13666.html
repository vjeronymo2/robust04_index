			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Indonesia offers East Timor talks Indonesia yesterday marked the 18th anniversary of its annexation of East Timor by offering to negotiate with guerrillas opposing the takeover, but the authorities warned that they would come down hard on lawbreakers, Reuter reports from Dili. East Timor came under renewed international scrutiny after hundreds of mainly Catholic protesters were beaten back last Thursday by police. It was the most violent confrontation there since troops gunned down up to 200 demonstrators at a funeral in Dili in 1991.</p>

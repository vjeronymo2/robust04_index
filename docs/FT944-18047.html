			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Millgate warning Millgate, the USM-traded supplier of anti-theft devices for cars, has warned that pre-tax profits for the second half ending November 30 are unlikely to exceed those of the first. Pre-tax profits for the first half were Pounds 303,000, a fall of 33 per cent. The company said that although the shortage of supplies from Italy had now been rectified, sales since June had been slower to recover than anticipated.</p>

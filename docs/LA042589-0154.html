			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STATE;  </P> <P> BUSH DEFENDS CAPITAL GAINS TAX CUT  </P> <P> President Bush said today that critics "couldn't be more wrong" when they call  his proposed cut in capital gains taxes "a tax break for the rich."  </P> <P> Rather, he said, that proposal and other new investment incentives are needed  to help America compete in the global economy. Bush, in a speech to managers  and employees at Ford Aerospace's Space Systems Division here, took note of the  criticism of his proposal in Congress and elsewhere.  </P> <P> "Well, they couldn't be more wrong," he said. "Lower capital gains taxes will  create jobs for those who don't have jobs and help build a better America."  </P> <P> Capital gains taxes are levied on the profits that businesses and individuals  make on investments. Bush wants to cut the 33% maximum tax on capital gains to  15% and to exempt entirely the gains accrued by people with incomes under  $10,000 a year.  </P></p>

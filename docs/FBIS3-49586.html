			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article including statement by Antonia Haga, </F> National Assembly representative of the Alliance of Free  Democrats: "Osztojkan Leaves SZDSZ, to Antonia Haga's Regret"]    [Text] The leaders of 12 Romany organizations in Hungary  wrote a letter to Arpad Goncz, president of the Republic, asking  him not to sign the amended election law because it completely  precludes any possibility that the ethnic minorities will gain  parliamentary representation in their own right.    The National Assembly's decision is not concerned at all  with  the rights of minorites and is contrary to the Constitution, the  minority law, and the stance that the parties and the public  profess to take toward minorites, announced Bela Osztojkan,  president of the Phralipe Independent Gypsy Organization at the  years-end meeting of Romany organizations.    The Gypsy organizations do not have enough resources at  their  disposal today to get even one Gypsy representative elected to  the parliament on their own. They have started negotiations  with Peter Zwack's Civic Party concerning possible cooperation,  and the MDF [Hungarian Democratic Forum] will probably run two  Romany candidates--Jozsef Raguly of the Hundred-Member Gypsy  Orchestra and Florian Farkas of Lungo Drom--in the elections. At  the end of the meeting Bela Osztojkan said that the parliament  is completely insensitive to the problems of the minorities, and  for this reason he as an individual will not vote and will leave  the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ].    "I am sorry that Bela Osztojkan will leave the SZDSZ, but I  am even sorrier that neither he nor I can find a better solution  for the representation of the minorities in the present  parliamentary structure," said Antonia Haga, Romany  representative and member of the SZDSZ's parliamentary group.  The representative does not consider acceptable either the  present situation or the version of the election law that was  voted down, which would have put 13 representatives into the  National Assembly on the basis of minority lists. "This way,  once again only token Gypsies, token Croatians, and token  Swabians, who would not even be able to come to agreement on the  most important questions, would sit in the parliament."  According to Antonia Haga, appropriate minority representation  is imaginable only in a two-chamber parliament.    [According to Duna TV, on 7 January President Goncz told the  Minority Roundtable that he has not decided yet whether he will  sign the election law or submit it to the Constitutial Court for  a ruling on its constitutionality. He added that he has 13 days  to make a decision.]</p>

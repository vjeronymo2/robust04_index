			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: The pig-headed way to lose your money - Why do people hold on to failing investments Imagine buying Pounds 1,000 worth of shares on a Monday and discovering on the Friday they are worth only Pounds 600. Do you hold them or sell and move on? Unless there is real hope of recovery, the wisest decision is to cut your losses. Yet, many people prefer to continue with a failing investment, sometimes eventually losing everything as a result. What causes such irrational behaviour? Such irrational persistence is known as escalation and a prime cause is believed to be an investor's emotional attachment to his initial outlay. Instead of accepting the situation for what it has become, his attention is fixed upon restoring the initial Pounds 1,000. More than money could be at stake, though. Few people care to look foolish in the eyes of others, including their own stockbrokers and accountants. They will go to extraordinary lengths to avoid admitting failure by seeking out information which seems to support their preconceived views while ignoring anything that contradicts these. The most minuscule sign of improvement is interpreted as sure evidence of certain recovery. Further price falls are dismissed as temporary setbacks. Even when recovery never comes, people may in extreme cases even make further commitments to a failing investment in order to maintain appearances. Even if investors pay proper attention to financial reports and statistics, there is still the risk of a misjudgment. While decisions based upon thorough research tend to be more reliable than those based on inspired guesses and wishful thinking, copious intelligence can lead investors seriously astray. Quantity increases self-confidence while, simultaneously, impairing judgment  -a dangerous combination. The more information investors have, the greater their faith in their own judgment. Yet, since human capacity to digest and analyse data is extremely limited, even with the aid of sophisticated computers, significant pointers may be overlooked in the sheer mass of reports, commentaries and analyses. Irrational persistence may be aggravated if loss is accompanied by strong feelings of disappointment. This tends to be most acute where the investor's initial expectations were high. Advertisements create high hopes deliberately by promising 'pure growth' and the rewards of the stock market with none of the risks. Such propositions are not only alluring in themselves - their more subtle effect is to distract investors' attention from hard statistical data which might qualify the prospects trumpeted. The most hazardous advertisements are not the banner proclamations, however, but the soberly-presented textual statements. For instance: 'Investment for high rewards can never be risk-free and some of our recommendations don't work out . . . The impact of . . . disasters can be mitigated by operating a 20 per cent stop loss rule. We have found from long experience that when a share price drops by 20 per cent after we have profiled the company, they are best sold . . . If losses are confined to around 20 per cent while profits are unlimited, the odds on overall success are greatly improved.' The effect of such a relatively sophisticated approach is to make the reader feel sophisticated. Note how an atmosphere of candour is created by the admission that some investments fail. The aim of such a disarming statement is gain the reader's confidence. The next step is to imbue the prospective investor with a sense of control via the 'stop loss rule'. Note this facility is not expressed as a 'stop loss option', (which, basically, is what it is) but a 'rule'. The very word heightens the investor's feelings of power and ability to command. The advertisement then emphasises the company's expertise in order to present a possible 20 per cent loss as eminently reasonable and manageable while, simultaneously, dangling the possibility of glittering returns. Instead of making a crude appeal to greed, however, the whole thing is couched in professional-sounding and euphemistic language such as 'unlimited profits' and 'overall success'. The financial services industry is replete with people claiming expertise. Expert power succeeds because the investor believes the adviser is acting in his interests. So potent is this power that a person will believe an 'expert' despite being almost certain he is wrong. Professed expertise, therefore, can lead an investor seriously astray. Besides, even financial advisers of impeccable integrity are susceptible to escalation. So, seek advice by all means - but maintain vigilance and let your own judgment have the last word. Feelings of potency can be created easily by the unscrupulous. The signs of manipulation are easy to detect: they include flattering the investor's judgment and decisiveness and emphasising previous successes. The problem is that since such observations are highly flattering, they stand a good chance of being believed. Pride does indeed come before a fall.

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Donors to debate Kenya aid A meeting of Kenya's donors in Paris today is expected to restore a measure of financial assistance to President Daniel arap Moi's government despite continuing concern over corruption and tribal massacres. Diplomats in Nairobi say governments are torn between the wish to support the economic reforms of Mr Musalia Mudavadi, Kenya's progressive finance minister, and their alarm at Kenya's deteriorating political situation. Two years ago, the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and donor governments suspended balance of payments support to Kenya after a series of broken promises on political and economic reforms. The aid was worth Dollars 350m (Pounds 234.8m) a year. Its loss plunged the economy into recession and led to an accumulation of Dollars 700m in debt-servicing arrears. Most donors agree Kenya has made impressive economic strides in the past six months. However, progress has been overshadowed by the treatment of Kikuyu peasants, Kenya's largest ethnic group. More than 1,000 have been killed.</p>

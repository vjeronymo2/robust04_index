			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JURY FINDS LUCAS GUILTY IN THREE SLASHER SLAYINGS;  </P> <P> BUT PANEL DEADLOCKS ON TWO OTHER MURDER COUNTS AND FINDS HIM NOT GUILTY OF  STILL ANOTHER KILLING  </P> <P> After eight days of deliberations, a jury convicted carpet cleaner David Lucas  Wednesday in the throat-slash murders of three people and the attempted murder  of another. The panel deadlocked on two other murder charges.  </P> <P> The jury of six men and six women who convicted Lucas, 33, of Spring Valley  found that the multiple murders were committed with special circumstance, which  could result in a death sentence for Lucas, who has been in custody in San  Diego County Jail since December, 1984. The jurors will return next month to  deliberate on the sentence.  </P> <P> The jurors' decision follows a 56-day trial that began on Jan. 3, making it one  of the longest criminal trials in San Diego history. Prosecutors and defense  attorneys began jury selection last August.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Sign of Emotion  </P> <P> Lucas sat impassively while the verdicts were announced and showed no signs of  emotion. While waiting for the jury to enter, Lucas spent the time smiling and  talking to his attorneys. He never acknowledged his family, who sat in the  front row behind him.  </P> <P> Lucas was convicted of first-degree murder in the 1979 deaths of Suzanne  Jacobs, 31, her son, Colin, 3, and the 1984 death of Anne Catherine Swanke, 22.  Jacobs and her son were found in their Normal Heights home with their throats  slashed. Swanke, a San Diego State University student, also had her throat  slashed and her body was found on a remote hillside in Spring Valley.  </P> <P> The jury also convicted Lucas in the attempted murder of Jody Santiago  Robertson. Robertson, a Seattle woman, survived a June 9, 1984, attack by  Lucas, who choked her and slashed her throat. Lucas was also convicted of  kidnaping Robertson, who testified for the prosecution at the trial, and of  kidnaping Swanke.  </P> <P> In each of the kidnaping and attempted murder convictions, the jury found that  Lucas used a deadly weapon and inflicted great bodily injury. Theoretically,  the findings could lead to stiffer penalties for Lucas on the convictions.  </P> <P> Lucas was acquitted in the death of Gayle Roberta Garcia, a Pt. Loma realtor  who was found with her throat slashed in a vacant Spring Valley house on Dec.  8, 1981. Jurors were unable to convict Lucas for the deaths of Rhonda Strang,  24, and Amber Fisher, 3, both of Lakeside. Strang was baby-sitting the child  when their throats were slashed on Oct. 23, 1984. The jury foreman told  Superior Court Judge Laura Hammes that after taking four or five votes the jury  was deadlocked 11 to 1 for conviction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possibility of Gas Chamber  </P> <P> Lucas, who now faces the possibility of dying in California's gas chamber, had  already served a four-year sentence at the California Youth Authority for the  1973 rape of a young woman. The woman was abducted and taken to Cowles  Mountain, where Lucas raped her and used a knife to cut her hands and throat,  but she survived the attack.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Williams declined to comment after the verdicts were  announced. Defense attorneys Alex Landon and Steve Feldman also walked out of  the courtroom and brushed past reporters. "There's nothing we can say right  now," Feldman said brusquely.  </P> <P> John Swanke, father of Lucas' last victim, Anne Swanke, noted that Lucas'  convictions came almost four years and seven months after his daughter was  murdered.  </P> <P> "I am very, very pleased . . . It was the only verdict they could have come up  with," said Swanke. "I'm pleased that they got it through and we're now done  with the trial."  </P> <P> Lucas' family, which consisted of his mother, sister and others, walked out of  the courtroom without talking to the media. While John Swanke was facing  television cameras, one of Lucas' relatives stood at the far end of the long  hallway, dabbing at her eyes.  </P> <P> Because of the attorneys' refusal to comment, it was not known Wednesday if the  prosecution will choose to retry Lucas for the killings of Strang and Amber  Fisher.  </P> <P> There was some confusion when the clerk read the verdicts out loud. Some of the  counts were juxtaposed and the judge ordered him to read the verdicts again.  Defense attorneys asked that each juror be polled after the reading of each  count, but waived the polling on the not guilty finding in the death of Garcia.  </P> <P> Wednesday marked the beginning of the end for an era that saw three notorious  murderers incarcerated at the downtown County Jail at the same time. Lucas was  the last of the killers to be brought to trial. Kevin Cooper, whose trial was  moved here from San Bernardino in October, 1984, was convicted in 1985 in the  stabbing deaths of four people. Joselito Cinco was arrested in September, 1984,  and convicted in 1988 in the slayings of two San Diego Police officers and the  attempted murder of another.  </P> <P> Both Cooper and Cinco were already in the County Jail when Lucas was arrested  in December, 1984.  </P></p>

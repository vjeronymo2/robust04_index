They added that this bonus will not cover many expenditures,  and "we won't even by able to buy presents for Epiphany Day  because we won't have any money."    They primarily blamed Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia for  this situation because he has never strongly defended the  position of the younger officers, and added that they will  request his replacement "because he is no good for that job."    They added that the Armed Forces, as a whole, needs a  minister who will speak up and equally defend them all and not  somebody like Estigarribia, who only upholds the post of  military forces commander held by Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez  Petit and tries to justify General Lino Oviedo's participation  in politics by saying that soldiers cannot be deprived of  partisan ideals.    They also recalled that as soon as it was published that  Armed Forces members were annoyed about the elimination of food  rations, National Police officers reacted immediately and warned  the executive branch about the serious situation that might  occur within the force if their food rations were eliminated.    The consulted officers, in the form of a protest, answered:  "While the police complain, soldiers are afraid and are  incapable of even defending their interests. No high-ranking  officer has stood up for his NCO's or sergeants, who will be  affected most, because they have money."    They also explained that they have to pay for their uniforms  and transportation out of their meager salaries. They  reiterated that their superiors do not pay heed to their demands  and added that nobody dares speak up out of fear of possible  reprisals.    They wondered why the police are allowed to voice their  opinion while soldiers have precise orders not to speak publicly  on subjects related to their profession. The affected soldiers  said: "Neither Oviedo nor Gonzalez Petit gave us any  explanations; they only addressed Christmas and New Year's  messages as if that were enough."</p>

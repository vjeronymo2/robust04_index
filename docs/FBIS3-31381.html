			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, February 15 (BTA) -- Today the two main  political forces in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Socialist (formerly  Communist) Party (BSP) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS)  announced their stand on the possible airstrikes in Bosnia five  days before the expiry of NATO's ultimatum. Both the BSP and  the SDS are for a policy of non-involvement of the Balkan states  in the conflict.    BSP floor leader Nora Ananieva told BTA that the NATO  ultimatum is rather a preventive measure and it will hardly come  to actual air strikes. "We do hope that it will work... I  think that in reality it won't come to air strikes," she said.  When asked about the BSP's position in case it comes to air  strikes after all, Ms. Ananieva answered that she hoped "the  military had considered all possibilities." Today Ms. Ananieva  met with Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov to discuss the  Yugocrisis and other issues. She emphasized the unchanged stand  of the BSP against any sort of involvement, be it direct or  indirect, of the Balkan states in the conflict.    "SDS believes that the Balkan problems should be regarded as  European problems and it should not be left to the Balkan states  alone to find the way for their settlement, as they could be of  great international and geopolitical significance," Filip  Dimitrov told the press today. SDS is positive that the  international institutions, military ones included, need to  commit themselves to the settlement of Balkan problems. "We all  hope the problems will be solved in a peaceful way but if it  proves impossible, they are the ones to determine the most  effective means to put an end to the bloodshed and the expansion  of the conflict," he added. "In a situation like this Bulgaria  cannot dodge responsibility," he said, pointing out the SDS's  conviction that the Balkan states' direct involvement might have  grave consequences. "This is precisely the reason why we insist  on international institutions' intervention," said the leader of  the Union of Democratic Forces. He also criticized the  Bulgarian Government for lacking a clear stand on the impending  strikes in Bosnia.</p>

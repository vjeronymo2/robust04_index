			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Transported by zone bonds or rates (2) Sir, Your leader on transport in London points the route towards a more logical method of financing the capital's transport system. The proposed transport authority for London would be a more plausible organisation if its functions were extended to cover responsibility for financing any operating subsidiaries, as well as capital investment, and if it covered all commuter services into London as well as the transport services within London. The performance and charges of the commuter services probably have more influence than those of transport within London on the attractions of the city as a place of business. The amount that businesses need to pay their employees and the value of property in London will be linked to the level of fares and therefore of subsidies. The businesses and property owners are therefore the logical sources of any subsidy to the commuter services, as well as services in London, whether for operations or investment. So the transport authority would need the power to levy a 'transport rate' on London business property, which should be an addition to the standard business rate. It would also need the power to contract for services with the operators of British Rail's commuter services and with London Transport. Therefore, it would take over some of the functions now placed with the franchising director. Amendments to the recent legislation on BR would be needed in the act establishing a transport authority. Ministers might not be welcome such changes, but they should consider the benefits of shedding responsibility for transport in London. Local autonomy can have political as well as economic advantages. David Sawers, 'Crosby', 10 Seaview Avenue, Angmering-on-Sea, Littlehampton, West Sussex BN16 1PP</p>

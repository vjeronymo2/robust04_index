			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sell programs erase rise on good economic data Wall Street US STOCK markets ended little changed yesterday after late sell programs erased gains made earlier in the session on the back of positive economic news, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed just 0.23 up at 3,235.47. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended only 0.69 ahead at 403.69, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks gained 1.70 at 603.77. New York SE turnover was a modest 182.7m shares, but well above Monday's 134m. The late reversal was put down to computerised sell programs, although market analysts said it was too early to tell if the trading was attempts by big investors to cash in on profits at the end of the first quarter. Prices had been firmer for most of the day, with the Dow registering a 22-point rise only one hour before the close. The advance had been achieved in the wake of fresh evidence that economic activity is picking up, albeit slowly. That evidence consisted of a rise in the Conference Board's March consumer confidence index to 54.0 per cent from the previous month's 47.3 per cent; solid increases in purchasing managers' reports from Chicago and Detroit; and an 0.8 per cent rise in leading economic indicators. Corning put on Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 7/8 after reporting that first-quarter net income jumped to Dollars 78.1m from the Dollars 48.4m recorded in the same period a year ago. Earnings in both quarters, however, were affected by extraordinary gains. Corning stock has suffered in recent months because of controversy surrounding silicone breast implants produced by Dow Corning, a joint partnership between Corning and Dow Chemical. Orion Pictures, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December, enjoyed a rare gain early on, firming Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 2 7/8 as investors reacted positively to the triumph of the company's Silence of the Lambs motion picture, which swept the four top awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Best Actress) at the Oscar ceremonies on Monday night. The stock, however, got caught up in the late sell-off and ended unchanged at Dollars 2 5/8 . Dime Savings Bank dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 3 1/2 in active trading after announcing a fourth-quarter loss widened to Dollars 8.54 a share from a deficit of 55 cents a share a year earlier. Raychem slipped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 3/4 after the company said it expected fiscal third-quarter sales to be flat compared with those a year ago. Chicago &amp; North Western, one of the country's main railway companies, made its debut on the NYSE yesterday. The public offering of 8.75m in common stock was priced at Dollars 20.50 a share, and at the close they had firmed to Dollars 22 in turnover of 3m shares. TRC, the environmental consultancy and research group, dipped Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 13 1/2 after Kidder Peabody and Raymond James, two broking houses, downgraded the stock. Another stock hit by a downgrading was the specialty stores group TJX, which declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 18 5/8 after Mr Richard Baum, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, lowered his rating on TJX from 'outperform' to 'market perform' because he believed recent gains in the stock had taken it close to its fair valuation. Canada TORONTO finished mildly firmer after moderate volume, with the gold and silver sector regaining almost a full index point and the financial group slightly better. The composite index improved 5.4 to 3,412.1 and rises outscored falls by 325 to 273 after turnover of 28.5m shares worth CDollars 234.2m. Gulf Canada Resources, affiliate of the financially troubled Olympia &amp; York Developments, rallied CDollars  3/4 to CDollars 6 3/4 on volume of 305,745 shares.</p>

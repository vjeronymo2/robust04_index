			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / The Olympia &amp; York Insolvency: Canadian bond holders angered AMONG those most surprised and angered by Olympia &amp; York's move to protect itself from creditors are holders of bonds secured by First Canadian Place, Toronto's tallest office building. The bondholders, who include numerous European institutions, were hoping that O&amp;Y would pay them CDollars 17m in half-yearly interest yesterday. Convinced that they were protected by the single-purpose, non-recourse company used to finance the 72-storey building, the bondholders had threatened to seize rents and perhaps even the building itself if the payment was not met. Just a few days ago they were told by O&amp;Y officials that, in the words of one Toronto bond trader, 'something would be worked out'. Now the bondholders appear to be at the mercy not only of O&amp;Y, but also of its other creditors. The Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act, under which O&amp;Y filed for protection, probably prevents them from laying hands on their interest or on tenants' rent payments. The only bids for First Canadian Place bonds yesterday were at CDollars 45-CDollars 50 per CDollars 100 of face value. Holders of publicly-traded securities in O&amp;Y's US buildings, all of which fall outside the scope of the Chapter 11 filing, reacted with more equanimity. Mr Michael Barr, an analyst at H. Rivkin &amp; Co, a New York firm which specialises in distressed bonds, said yesterday that 'if anything, we're seeing more buying than selling interest'. Prices on O&amp;Y's US bonds were virtually unchanged, and the securities were still being traded with accrued interest - a sign that buyers expect that interest will continue to be paid. Most of the US buildings generate enough rent income to support debt-servicing payments. O&amp;Y paid monthly interest to a group of US floating-rate note holders last week. It did however, fail to make a USDollars 62m payment on a building at the World Financial Centre in early April, but claims this was because it was funnelling every scrap of cash it could to the hard-pressed Canadian parent.</p>

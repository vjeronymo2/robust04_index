			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Republic of Finland launches tightly-priced Pounds 500m issue THE Republic of Finland finally launched its long-rumoured Eurosterling issue yesterday, raising Pounds 500m worth of 10-year Eurobonds. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 8 per cent, were priced at 97.45 to yield 60 basis points over the 8 per cent UK government bond due 2003. The view in the market was that the pricing of Finland's issue was tight, and that the spread should have been at least 10 basis points wider in order to compensate for Standard &amp; Poor's decision last week to cut the country's credit rating by two notches, to AA-minus. Spreads on Finnish paper in the secondary market have widened since the S&amp;P down-grading. Syndicate managers said that existing Finnish paper yielded between 45 to 50 basis points above Libor, but that yesterday's issue yielded only 30 basis points above Libor. Other factors hampering the deal included Finland's frequent borrowings in the international bond market over the past year and the recent developments in the former Soviet Union. An official at the joint lead manager, SG Warburg, said that the Finland deal was slower to place than Abbey National's Pounds 650m 10-year Eurobond issue, which was launched last week. But he added that, so far, demand outside the UK for the bonds had been good. When the bonds were freed to trade, they were quoted at 97 1/2 bid to yield 65 basis points over the underlying gilt. Ms Inga-Maria Grohn, financial councillor at the Treasury Management Unit of Finland's finance ministry, said that yesterday's issue was part of the country's 1993 borrowing programme. The proceeds of the issue would be left in sterling, but a decision had not yet been taken on whether to swap the interest rate from fixed to floating, she said. She expected Finland to raise between Dollars 9bn to Dollars 10bn this year in the international market, slightly below last year's Dollars 11bn-Dollars 12bn, since the ministry had taken a decision to look more to the domestic market. 'Last year, about 60 per cent was raised abroad and 40 per cent domestically, but we would like to have more of a balance,' Ms Grohn said. Also in the Eurosterling sector, HSBC Holdings increased Wednesday's Pounds 200m issue of subordinated Eurobonds due 2018 by Pounds 50m to satisfy demand from overseas, especially from east Asia. The new portion was priced at 99.022 to yield 145 basis points above the 9 per cent UK gilt due 2012, compared with a price of 98.692 and a yield spread of 150 basis points on the original amount. An official at the lead manager, Samuel Montague, said the tighter pricing on the new portion was designed to show goodwill to UK institutions, which are concerned about long-dated issues being increased. Yesterday, the bonds were trading at 99.70 bid, giving a spread of 146 basis points over the underlying gilt. The Bundesbank's decision to cut its discount rate prompted a further wave of reverse floating rate notes in D-Marks and in French francs. Credit Local de France's FFr500m was almost entirely pre-placed with continental investors, who expect French interest rates to fall after the election, said an official at the joint lead manager, CCF. Elsewhere, good demand for short-dated paper in the Eurodollar sector enabled Landesbank Schleswig Holstein Girozentrale to increase its three-year Eurobond issue to Dollars 250m from an initial Dollars 200m. The bonds were priced to yield 28 basis points over comparable US Treasuries and, when they were freed to trade, the spread tightened slightly. Ontario Hydro plans to launch a global Canadian dollar bond with a five-year maturity early next week. The deal is expected to raise CDollars 1bn and will be arranged by Goldman Sachs, IBJ, RBC Dominion Securities and ScotiaMcLeod.</p>

			<p>Company   <F P=102>   40101005A Beijing CHINA DAILY [NATIONAL] in English 8 Mar 94  p 3 </F>  <F P=103> 40101005A </F> <F P=104>  Beijing CHINA DAILY [NATIONAL] </F> <F P=105>  English </F> CSO     [Text] Chemical wastes that have been parked in limbo for  the past five months in Jiangsu Province have all been sent  back, the Shanghai-based Wenhui Daily reported on Sunday.    The chemical wastes, imported under the guise of  ``industrial-use fuel,'' were believed to be harmful to the  environment.    While the wastes remained at the Shangyuanmen berth in  Jiangsu's capital, Nanjing, vigilant environmental monitoring  ensured that the water in that stretch of the Yangtze River and  the nearby Shangyuanmen Water Plant were not contaminated by the  chemicals, the newspaper reported.    The ``fuel'' was sold to the Shanghai Huafu Industrial and  Commercial Company for $27 per ton through a contract with a  South Korean company signed last August.    According to the contract, 200,000 tons industrial fuel were  to be imported between 1993 and 1995.    The first batch of ``fuel'' arrived at the Nanjing port last  September. But inspections showed that most of the 1,288-ton  shipment was harmful chemical wastes.    Customs officials at Nanjing Port sealed up the cargo  immediately and asked the importers to return the wastes. After  half a year's negotiation, the South Korean company eventually  agreed to take back the wastes.    But that was not the end of the story.    According to Saturday's China Environment News, a  representative from the company in South Korea declared that  they had sufficient evidence to show that it was their Chinese  counterpart who asked to buy chemical wastes from South Korea.  The Chinese side, however, said that it was the Korean company  who violated the contract.    A spokesman from the National Environmental Protection  Agency  (NEPA) reiterated that the event was a typical trans-national  waste-dumping incident.    He said that NEPA has taken actions against companies that  profit by importing and processing harmful waste from other  countries.    In March 1991, NEPA and the General Administration of  Customs  prohibited the import of industrial wastes harmful to the  environment. The regulations have been enforced in many parts of  the country and have played a big role in preserving the  environment.    As one example, Southeast China's Fujian Province has  several  times rejected attempts to import overseas rubbish into the  province.    (CD News)</p>

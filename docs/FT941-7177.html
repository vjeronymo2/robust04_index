			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Showa Shell plunges on forex losses Emiko Terazono in Tokyo Showa Shell Sekiyu, the Japanese oil refiner and distributor affiliated with Royal Dutch Shell, reported a 54.2 per cent fall in after-tax profits for the year to last December after writing off its losses on foreign exchange futures trading. The company lost Y115.3bn (Dollars 1.09bn) from Dollars 4.6bn worth of dollar futures contracts, part of which was used to pay for crude oil and other imports. After-tax profits totalled Y9bn as Showa Shell posted extraordinary losses of Y80.1bn, part of which it covered with extraordinary gains of Y65bn from stock and land sales. In spite of the profit fall, the company will maintain its annual dividend of Y8 per share. Pre-tax profits fell 3.6 per cent to Y36.6bn due to a rise in distribution costs. Sales fell 7.5 per cent to Y1,447.7bn, but operating profits rose 24.5 per cent to Y61.4bn thanks to strong sales of its high-margin petrol and a change in accounting methods for depreciation costs. For the current year to December, Showa Shell expects to write off Y43bn out of the remaining unrealised losses on its dollar futures holdings. The company is projecting a 6.7 per cent fall in sales to Y1,350bn and a 23.6 per cent plunge in pre-tax profits to Y28bn. After-tax profits are expected to rise 43.9 per cent to Y13bn.</p>

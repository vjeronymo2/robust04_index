			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["hjs." report: "Liberals Criticize Direct Research </F> Incentives"]    [Text] Bonn -- FRG Research Minister Paul Krueger  (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) has warned against incorrect  conclusions in research and technology politics because of the  stimulation of economic activity in the FRG. In the long run,  economic growth and new growth markets can only be created on  the basis of new technologies. Now the right course has to be  set for it.    On behalf of the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]  Group, Research Policy Spokesman Josef Vosen stated that, with  the understanding for research and technology policies expressed  in the FRG research report, economic, social, and ecological  challenges cannot be met. "The formerly flourishing research  landscape in Germany is drying up" Vosen said, and referred to  the research budget's share of the federal budget, which  decreased from 2.7 percent in the mid-eighties to 1.9 percent  now.    Vosen again criticized the above-average cuts in the 1994  research budget of 250 million German marks. On behalf of the  SPD, Vosen called for the reintroduction of a tax incentive for  research and the examination of all legal norms, to discover  whether and how many obstacles to research and development  activities are contained therein. A massive increase in the  research budget is necessary.    On behalf of the CDU Group, Research Policy Spokesman  Christian Lenzer stressed that the recession has shown where  structural and organizational problems are burdening research in  Germany and where entrenchment and lack of communication have  made research heavy-handed. This should be understood as a  "positive lesson" and the proper conclusions should be drawn.  Proposals for an improvement by the CDU/Christian Social Union  [CSU] Bundestag Group were already submitted a long time ago.  Now speedy action, not regret, is required, he said.    On behalf of the Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP],  Deputy Juergen Timm stated that the situation is becoming  dangerous for the FDP because the CDU/CSU and the SPD have  basically the same research policy ideas. Politicians and  officials in ministries overestimate their capacities if they  pretend to know which fields of research are promising, which  enterprises are competitive, or which markets exist for which  products. The FDP neither believes in the functioning of an  industrial policy, whatever it may be like, nor in the special  advantages of direct research incentives, as compared to  large-scale indirect incentive measures.</p>

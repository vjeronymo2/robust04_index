			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / International Company News: Pirelli sees improvement but will remain in the red PIRELLI. the Italian tyres and cables group, yesterday warned that its 1992 accounts, to be reported in May, would show an improvement on the L622bn (Dollars 402.3m) lost after minority interests in 1991. But its results would remain in the red owing to high interest charges and increased depreciation costs. Pirelli expects to report substantial extraordinary gains from sales of subsidiaries in its diversified products division. However, such earnings would be partly lowered by write-offs on the value of some operations still being divested. Earnings last year also suffered from deteriorating economic conditions, which had required additional restructuring measures to be taken. Some L50bn more had been spent than was allocated at the end of 1991, while a further L140bn had been put aside for restructuring costs expected this year, almost entirely on the cables side. The group reported a sharp fall in consolidated sales to about L8,300bn last year against L10,024bn in 1991. Adjusted for disposals, turnover rose by about 2 per cent. Gross operating earnings, before depreciation, interest charges and tax, rose by 30 per cent to about L770bn. Cash flow returned to the black from being negative in 1991, while Pirelli's debt-equity ratio improved to 0.85 from 1.4 in 1991.</p>

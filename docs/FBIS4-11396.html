			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Lima, 23 Apr (EFE) -- Peruvian President  Alberto Fujimori asserted that now that Congress has approved  the proposal that the National Elections Board (JNE) organize  the elections, nobody can suspect any fraud. [passage omitted]    Fujimori on 22 April told journalists in Arequipa, 1,000 km  south of Lima, that with this decision "now absolutely nobody  can question the clear and transparent development of the  electoral process."    He added that reports stating that "the government upheld  electoral fraud" have thus been dismissed, and said the  executive branch will not have any problem promulgating the law  approved by Congress.    Fujimori indirectly referred to the possible presidential  candidacy of former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar  by stating: "The road is clear and nobody can condition his  candidacy to the establishment of clear and clean rules."

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / Jobs outlook poor, says minister: Economic watch Forecast French economic growth of 1.4 per cent this year was 'not enough' to make an appreciable dent in unemployment, Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, said yesterday, but he believed the recovery 'could be more vigorous than foreseen'. Commenting on yesterday's price and trade figures, the minister said the 0.3 per cent rise in consumer prices in February showed France had little to fear from renewed inflation. The fall in the trade surplus to FFr2.7bn (Pounds 300m) in January was only a correction from an abnormally high surplus of FFr13.2bn in December. Exports rose at 4 per cent a year from October 1993 to January 1994, compared to a 3.6 per cent growth in imports. The German social security budget reached a record DM1,063bn (Pounds 413bn) in 1993, equivalent to a third of the total budget, although spending on social security in eastern Germany fell to 70 per cent of GNP from 73.1 in 1992. Russia's grain harvest is forecast to fall to 90m tonnes this year, from 99m tonnes last year, but the country will not need to import grain for at least the next two years. Hungary's current account saw a record deficit of Dollars 3.45bn, or 9 per cent of gross domestic product, in 1993. Exports fell 17 per cent while imports increased by 7 per cent.</p>

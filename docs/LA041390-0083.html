			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LONG BEACH HAD STATE'S LARGEST INCREASE IN SERIOUS CRIME IN '89  </P> <P> A state report says Long Beach had the largest increase in serious crimes of  any major California city last year, prompting police to demand that more  officers be hired and neighborhood activists to organize special citizen  patrols.  </P> <P> Major crimes shot up 25% in 1989 over the previous year, with the murder rate  increasing by 46% in the same period, according to the Bureau of Criminal  Statistics in the state Department of Justice.  </P> <P> Long Beach Police Chief Lawrence Binkley blamed much of problem on gangs moving  into Long Beach from nearby cities like Los Angeles. According to police  statistics, 31 of 97 murders last year were either drug-related or gang-related  -- compared to 15 of 63 in 1988.  </P> <P> Anti-gang sweeps in Los Angeles have aggravated the problem in Long Beach,  Binkley said.  </P> <P> "When (Police Chief Daryl F.) Gates puts 1,000 cops on the streets, he drives  them out here," Binkley said. "It doesn't take very long before gangs figure  that Long Beach is a better place to be."  </P> <P> Los Angeles police spokesman Fred Nixon said Thursday: "It's an unfortunate  fact that if the pressure is here, they'll go someplace else."  </P> <P> Though the percentage increases can be startling, Binkley noted that because  Long Beach has also experienced an influx of new residents, the overall picture  may not be as grim when the city's population is figured into the formula.  </P> <P> San Bernardino, for example, has 71.1 violent crimes per 1,000 residents,  compared to Long Beach's rate of 54.8 violent crimes per 1,000 people,  according to police statistics.  </P> <P> In the upscale, middle-class and working-class neighborhoods of Long Beach,  residents seem to be adopting a greater awareness of the need for crime  prevention measures.  </P> <P> "My wife and my son are locking the house for once," Binkley said.  </P> <P> In one northern Long Beach neighborhood, where mostly retirees and blue-collar  workers live, about 60 people take turns driving around to check for suspicious  activity from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. each day. Since the patrols started a month  ago, neighbors have helped police arrest at least five people seen breaking  into homes, said Jim Lemieux, a 45-year resident of the community near DeForest  Park.  </P> <P> In Naples, where gondolas are often seen gliding past million-dollar  residences, homeowners are considering taxing themselves to pay for additional  police to patrol their islands. In the Virginia Country Club area, home to some  of the city's most prominent residents, citizens are considering closing off  the neighborhood with gates and hiring security guards.  </P> <P> "This has always been a wonderful, safe neighborhood and now crime that we hear  about in other communities is tiptoeing here," said Barbara Shoag, a Virginia  Country Club resident and long-time community activist.  </P> <P> The crime increase last year in Long Beach was 2 1/2 times greater than it was  in the city of Los Angeles. Overall, major crimes increased 10% in Los Angeles,  where the number of homicides jumped 19.2% from 736 in 1988 to 877 last year,  according to the Bureau of Criminal Statistics. The bureau's report measured  crime rates in California cities with populations of 100,000 or greater.  </P> <P> Major crimes include murders, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries  and motor vehicle thefts. In the category of violent crimes -- defined by state  officials as murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults -- Long Beach  saw an increase from 5,153 in 1988 to 7,169 in 1989, a jump of 39%.  </P> <P> Long Beach police reported to the state bureau that 85 murders took place in  their city in 1989, but that figure did not include those considered  justifiable homicides -- which actually bring the number up to 97, police said  Thursday.  </P> <P> The Bureau of Criminal Statistics counts only "willful killings," not  justifiable homicides such as those involving officers or citizens who kill in  self-defense.  </P> <P> Armed with the new statistics, Binkley and city officials are asking voters to  support a property tax levy next June to raise money for an additional 75  officers.  </P> <P> If the trend holds up, officers would no longer be able to provide some  non-emergency services unless the department's staff of 643 is expanded,  Binkley said.  </P> <P> Last year, a series of internal memos in the Police Department signalled the  arrival of recommendations to reduce services to cope with inadequate staffing  and a higher incidence of crime.  </P> <P> In one memo, a police commander recommended that investigators begin ignoring,  among other things, petty thefts of less than $400 and battery cases in which  the victim requires no medical treatment -- with the exception of gang-related  investigations. Binkley said this week that those are among the cuts he is  considering.  </P> <P> Already, many residents complain that police are slow to respond. "Because we  have not been getting good police response, our neighborhood association  chapter decided to have our own volunteer civilian patrol," Lemieux said.  </P> <P> In yet another North Long Beach neighborhood, residents are talking about  taking strolls in groups each evening in search of people who may not belong in  the area.  </P> <P> The residents, City Councilman Jeff Kellogg said, would ask people they don't  recognize questions such as: "Can I ask you what business you have in this  neighborhood? Can I help you?" Kellogg said he plans to join the group on some  of its outings.  </P> <P> Some community leaders are highly critical of such citizen patrols because they  fear they will further polarize the community.  </P> <P> "This vigilante attitude doesn't help the problem," said Frank Berry, president  of the Long Beach chapter of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored  People. "Those kinds of things in a racially diverse community could be very  dangerous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CRIME IN LONG BEACH  </P> <P> Incidents of violent crime are on the rise in Long Beach. Calls for assistance  have increased by one-third, while the number of police officers has risen only  slightly.  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.99IN:1.89IN:1.89IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="4"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1984  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> 1989  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Increase  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Violent crimes  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 4,238  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 7,157  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 68.8%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Homicides*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 97  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 97.9%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Calls for service  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 437,069  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 583,387  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 33.4%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Population  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 376,034  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 419,819  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 11.6%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Police officers  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 621  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 643  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 3.5%  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> *Although police reported to the state's Bureau of Criminal Statistics that  Long Beach had 85 homicides in 1989, that figure does not include justifiable  homicides, which bring the number up to 97.  </P> <P> Source: Long Beach Police Department  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOMICIDE RATE  </P> <P> The number of homicides in Long Beach annually since 1984.  </P> <P> * 1984: 49  </P> <P> * 1985: 68  </P> <P> * 1986: 65  </P> <P> * 1987: 68  </P> <P> * 1988: 63  </P> <P> * 1989: 97  </P> <P> * 1990*: 34  </P> <P> *Through Thursday, April 12  </P></p>

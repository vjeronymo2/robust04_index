			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Rasmussen is quick to reward voters: The Danish government's rapid attempt to demonstrate benefit of EC membership THE VIOLENT riots which erupted in Copenhagen after Tuesday's vote in favour of the Maastricht treaty came as a profound shock to the government, which had hoped the result would allow political life to return to its normal calm. The shock was all the greater because such explosions are rare in Denmark, where the political culture is based on consensus and the distance between extremes is small. Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, prime minister and leader of the Social Democratic party, was yesterday at pains to emphasise that the rioters represented a tiny minority. Nevertheless, the riots reflect a society which has experienced an unusually divisive debate over the past 18 months, with the electorate being cajoled into reversing its June rejection of the treaty. This was acknowledged yesterday by Mr Rasmussen, who moved quickly to deliver tangible benefits to the people in the form of an economic policy programme for growth and employment which was presented as having been made possible by the Yes vote. Throughout the referendum campaign Mr Rasmussen recognised that a gap had grown up between politicians and electorate and said that Community membership had to be seen to deliver benefits to people in their daily lives. He described the economic measures as 'an offensive against unemployment', currently running at 12 per cent. The government predicted they would lower the level to about 11 per cent next year. 'We are going to break the curve of rising unemployment,' he said. The core of the programme is a reform of the income tax system, which will reduce marginal rates from next year to a band of 38-58 per cent, compared with 52-68 per cent at present. The reductions will be financed by 'green' taxes on petrol, electricity, heat and water consumption. The boost from tax cuts next year will be equal to about 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product, or about DKr5bn (Pounds 526m), and should produce growth in real private consumption next year of 4.3 per cent. An accompanying upgrade of training programmes is designed to improve workforce skills. Forecasts by the Finance Ministry point to a surge in the GDP growth rate from about 1 per cent this year to 3.1 per cent in 1994, with private consumption next year rising by 4.3 per cent in real terms. According to Mr Rasmussen, Denmark's large surplus on the current account of the balance of payments, low inflation rate and relatively strong government finances mean that the country can afford these measures. However, the Danish government, which currently holds the EC presidency, is calling for a co-ordinated pragmatic policy for economic recovery. It will be pushing hard for this at next month's Copenhagen summit. But when it comes to the Community's more ambitious long-term plans for economic and political union, enshrined in Maastricht, Denmark's approach will be severely constrained by the painful experience of the two referendums. Future government's will not be allowed to depart from the provisions of the Edinburgh opt-outs agreement, which exempted Denmark from participation in the common currency, defence co-operation, legal and police co-operation and common citizenship. Denmark's strong economy makes it a natural candidate for participating in the third and final stage of European monetary union, a move which is supported by the business community. But Mr Rasmussen said this week that the government would stick by the Edinburgh opt-out on the common currency: 'That is the position of this government,' he said. The right-wing Liberal party, led by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister for more than 10 years until last January, has already espoused the cause of dropping the Edinburgh opt-outs at a later date. Like all the other political parties, though, it has promised to submit any changes in the Edinburgh deal to further plebiscites. The provocative Mr Ellemann-Jensen's cause has found few supporters. After a long and divisive debate on the Maastricht issue, most politicians want to see a restoration of national consensus on the European issue. This may not be as difficult as might be imagined. Tuesday night's riots notwithstanding, the debate has generally been conducted in a friendly spirit. The riots, said Mr Niels Helveg Petersen, foreign minister, 'are in no way an expression of what the majority of No voters feel. We are not a deeply divided society. We have had a referendum and therefore there have been differences of opinion, but the differences will disappear again from today.'</p>

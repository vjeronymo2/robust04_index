			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Lima, 14 Mar (EFE) -- The Lima newspaper LA  REPUBLICA reported today that the Peruvian Army has denounced a  smear campaign using all "national and international media in an  improper exercise of freedom of the press."    According to a document sent to this newspaper entitled  "Disloyalty, Immorality, and Corruption Do Not Exist in the  Peruvian Army," the military said the institution is being  presented "as a systematic violator of human rights, in  collusion with drug trafficking gangs, and as an institution  with internal problems."    The military also says 1994 "will be a very difficult year  from a social and political point of view because it is a  pre-electoral year. We cannot rule out the possibility that the  propaganda campaign to smear the Army will intensify even more  starting in the second half of 1994," the document says.    The latest issue of the weekly magazine SI that hit the  stands today denounces that the political military command in  Northern Huallaga Valley in 1992 "ordered an operation to cover  up the activities of drug traffickers that resulted in the death  of eight civilians and a complicated trial in military courts."    The publication says that on 29 October 1992 a military  patrol intercepted eight individuals, two of them Colombians,  transporting 150 kg of cocaine paste. According to SI, the drug  traffickers offered $30,000 to pass. However, the next day the  eight individuals appeared dead while the drugs disappeared.    The magazine says the case was later presented as an  anti-subversive operation or a settling of accounts between drug  traffickers and terrorists. Military justice is looking into the  matter.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iv) Annual documentation of matching funds. The HA shall supply such documentation of its matching supportive services cost contribution with each annual budget review in such form as specified by HUD, and explain how any mismatches between the services committed and those needed by the participants have been corrected. HUD will review the infusion of matching funds annually, as part of the project/budget review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Insufficient matching funds. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet HUD requirements at any point after start-up of the Multifamily Project Demonstration, or at any time during the term of the demonstration, HUD may decrease its share of the supportive services cost in proportion to the amount by which matching funds drop below 50 percent of total supportive services cost. This adjustment will be done in the year subsequent to the year of the shortfall, so that the required ratio of HUD to non-HUD funds is maintained. The adjustment may be reconsidered and canceled by HUD at such time that the HA provides sufficient matching funds to eliminate any shortfall.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Supportive service fee payable by program participant. The HA must ensure that each program participant will pay at least 10 percent of the cost of the services received, up to a limit of 20 percent of adjusted gross income. This requirement may be waived by the HA in cases where a program participant does not have any adjusted gross income (income used to determine family share of rent under the rental certificate regulations). In cases where program participants are not required to pay a full 10 percent of the supportive service costs, 50 percent of the shortfall will be paid for from the supportive services grant funds. The balance will be paid for by the HA from other sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Supportive services budget. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The selected HA must submit a supportive services budget for the first year of supportive services delivery, beginning on the date of initial occupancy of the project, and annually thereafter, on Form SF&hyph;424A, Budget Information_Non-Construction Programs. Except when there is an unused portion of supportive services funds carried over from the previous year, the selected HA may not budget more than 20 percent of the supportive services grant amount for any year of the five-year demonstration. The budget for the first year normally will use less than 20 percent of the funds potentially available, due to start-up. If this occurs in the first year or in any subsequent year, the HA may exceed the 20 percent limit on the annual supportive services budget for the succeeding year only by that percentage which represents the amount of unused supportive services budgeted for the preceding year. The supportive services budget submission is in addition to the budget documents submitted in accordance with Section 8 rental assistance requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (10) Professional Assessment Committee (PAC) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Membership. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As provided in paragraph (b) of this section (10), a PAC is not required to be established by the HA. If established, the PAC shall be composed of from three-to-seven members appointed by the HA, at least one of which is a qualified medical professional (e.g., a physician or registered nurse). The service coordinator must be on the PAC. Other members also must be professionally qualified to appraise the functional abilities of frail elderly persons or near-frail elderly persons in relation to the performance of the normal activities of daily living. The HA (e.g., the service coordinator) may refer to the PAC those elderly applicants, in accordance with the HA's approved program participation selection process, who are interested in applying for the Multifamily Project Demonstration and have been screened for degree of frailty or near-frailty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alternative to formation of PAC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The selected HA may develop an agreement with community agencies to perform frailty and near-frailty assessments as an alternative to performing its own screening for frailty and near-frailty and setting up its own PAC. Such an agreement would include a letter of understanding between the HA and the assessment center stating the roles, responsibilities and relationship of each to each other. The letter must be signed by the executive officer(s) of both organizations. This letter must be included in the HA's application to HUD. Such local agencies may include, but are not limited to: Geriatric Assessment Centers, Public Health and Veterans Administration facilities, County Health Departments, or similar private agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Assessment of frailty and near-frailty. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The PAC (or a community agency with which the HA has a written agreement to perform assessments) will assess the degree of frailty and near-frailty of elderly persons applying for the Multifamily Project Demonstration, referred to the PAC (or community agency) by the HA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General operating procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A PAC must establish operating procedures and establish case files for each frail elderly person and near-frail elderly person. The PAC must operate according to the following guidelines:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Recommend to the service coordinator eligibility for entrance to, or transition out of, if applicable, the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Authorize or perform a medical evaluation, if necessary. This evaluation may be performed by a PAC medical professional, or the applicant to the Multifamily Project Demonstration may be referred to another agency in the community that will perform the evaluation without charge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Recommend, and update as necessary, a supportive services plan for each frail elderly person.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Be furnished with and retain information in files concerning program participants. The files should contain such information and be maintained in such form that HUD shall require.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Present written evaluations to the HA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (vi) Allow for program participants to appeal decisions related to entrance to, degree of participation needed, and transition out of the Multifamily Project Demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Specific operating procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In addition to the above described general operating procedures, the PAC must:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

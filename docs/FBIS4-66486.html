			<p>CSO     [Text] Denken Engineering has marketed a compact desktop  photoforming system, the ``Desk Modeler,'' (trade name) which  can create three-dimensional models of three-dimensional shapes  simply on an Apple Macintosh computer. The software was  developed by Systems Nakashima in collaboration withthe CRC  Research Institute. It is a ``three-dimensional copier  machine'', according to Hironao Kubo of Systems Nakashima,  because the low cost, compact system can produce plastic models  from three-dimansional shapes created on the monitor.    The system now is able to produce an actual model from  shapes  created on the Macintosh. Traditionally, only two-dimensional  forms could be produced through the use of CAD (computeraided  design).    The shapes can be easily created using free-form surface  modeling software, ``MACSURF.'' Shapes designed by ``MACSURF''  can be produced directly through the photoforming control  software, ``Model Bridge.'' Model Bridge was developed  especially for this system, and designed for transfer to the  ``SLP-4000'' compact photoforming system which produces plastic  three-dimensional models.    The SLP-4000 was developed by Denken Engineering as a  ``desktop size forming machine,'' according to the New Operation  Promotion Office Manager Shoji Hiura of Denken Engineering.  600mm[.sup]3[/], the machine is capable of forming objects  200mmxl50mmxl50mm in size. It costs &yen;4.98 million.    The entire system costs a total of &yen;7.68 million,  including the SLP-4000 (4.98 million yen), the software  MACSURF'(&yen;1 million), and the software that controls  forming (&yen;1.7 million). The cost of this system is below  1/10 that of a large conventional industrial photoforming system.</p>

			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early advance fades in later trading THE MOOD brightened in the UK stock market yesterday morning, but it was soon clear that this was little more than a technical response from an oversold equity sector. The lead, yet again, came from the stock index futures and from a handful of corporate results, but increased market turnover reflected activity in only a very few shares. London opened lower in the face of Wall Street's weakness overnight but was rescued by a firm opening in the June future on the FT-SE Index. An early loss of more than eight points in the Footsie was quickly converted into a gain of 11.6, with the Index only three points under the 2,650 testing level at mid-session. Sentiment was also helped by unexpectedly excellent figures from Racal Electronics, which traded very heavily after exceeding the forecasts given at the time of the defence against the bid from Williams Holdings. Traders stressed that much of the initial recovery reflected the heavily oversold positions detected in the previous session. Once these positions had been resolved, often by way of the stock index futures market, share prices struggled to hold their initial levels. The market lost heart in the second half of the day and was additionally discouraged by a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, which is still a cause for discomfort in London. At the close, the FT-SE Index was only 0.7 higher on the day at 2,636.1, with the 2,650 level still out of reach and the 2,600 mark uncomfortably close. Seaq-reported turnover remained high, although the day's total of 472.5m shares compared with 488.3m in the previous session. Political factors continued to loom over the UK stock market, with the dangers of further developments on the Maastricht front high on the list of causes for anxiety. Analysts remain relatively confident over the medium term outlook for equities in London but are nervous over the immediate future. Among banking stocks, Midland edged higher after the London market's success in pre-empting the overnight fall in shares of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking in far eastern securities markets. Lloyds Bank closed a shade easier as investors continued to assess the situation in the light of the bank's withdrawal from the battle for control of Midland. Other banking stocks lacked buyers, reflecting the reduction of bid tensions in the sector. With the pound still showing little recovery within the ERM range, and the dollar steady, the international blue chips turned in a mixed performance. Oil shares could make little progress against the backcloth of a weak US market, and the pharmaceuticals also lacked thrust. The London Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, following the quarterly review of components of the FT-SE 100 Share Index, Carlton Communications, Royal Insurance, and Granada Group will join the Footsie list, with effect from June 22, while Laporte, Eurotunnel and MEPC will will leave the Index list.</p>

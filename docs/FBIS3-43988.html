			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ouagadougou, 20 Jan (AFP) -- Five labor  organizations today called on their members to mobilize to  demand a substantial and immediate salary increase to replace  the 4-10 percent increase announced by the government for 1  April.    In a joint statement, the General Confederation of Labor,  one  of the country's six labor unions movements, and four  independent labor unions of civil servants have deemed  "ridiculous" this "timid increase" promised by the authorities  to cushion the effects of the devaluation of the CFA franc.  They described as "meaningless" the time period allowed for the  implementation of the increase, since most of the prices for  consumer goods did not wait until April to go up and since  particularly, they stated, price control is an "illusion."    They also stressed the contradiction existing between the  salary promises made by the government and the increases it  authorized for imported rice -- 23.5 percent -- or for fuels --  38.6 percent. "The government has left us with only one option  -- struggling to make our voices heard. It will assume full  responsibility for what happens," the signatories to the  statement said, calling on their members "mobilize to respond  properly to the situation."</p>

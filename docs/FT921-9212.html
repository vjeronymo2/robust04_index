			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: India enters the race for cable networks - Companies seek a toe-hold in a new industry A NEW business has hit India and it has incredible potential: electronic entertainment. So now some of the country's biggest business houses are trying frantically to acquire toe-holds in this field which has so far been dominated by small-time operators working on shoe-string budgets. Over the past few weeks, the powerful Hinduja group, as well as newspaper barons such as Mrs Shobhana Bhartia of the Hindustan Times group and Mr Samir Jain of the Times of India group, have been buying up small cable operations in almost every big city. Their strategy is to create unified cable networks across the country. The race for cable networks is hottest in Bombay. Currently, there are at least 6,000 cable operators in the city with 20 new ones starting up each day. A study by the Independent Operations Research group estimates that more than 90,000 people in Bombay watch cable television. The programmes these entrepreneurial operators broadcast are generally in English, and largely pirated. Despite periodic crackdowns by the police, the cable companies continue to flourish, providing stiff competition to Doordarshan, the government-controlled television. Ironically, the latest victim of this rampant piracy is Hong Kong-based Star TV which virtually created the electronic entertainment boom when it started beaming its five-channel satellite broadcasts to India last August. Indian cable operators, always starved of software, have been taping Star TV programmes and broadcasting them illegally. With big business moving into this field, however, there are bound to be sweeping changes. The government is already working on legislation to regulate cable networks. A new law is expected to be introduced in the up-coming budget session of parliament. Meanwhile, new software companies are mushrooming, hoping that when the big business houses have finished buying up the midget cable operators, there will be a big market for locally produced programmes in various Indian languages. At the same time, advertising companies are keeping a watchful eye on events. The government's new guidelines will enable the monitoring of accurate viewership patterns. In a city such as Bombay, with a 10m-strong population, cable companies offer the most cost-effective route to consumer advertising.</p>

			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Boardroom symptoms of a sectoral malaise: The pressure building up on the world's drugs groups THREE of the world's top six drugs companies have lost their president or chief executive since March. The boardroom bust-ups are a symptom of disarray in the pharmaceuticals industry over how to respond to the rapidly changing healthcare environment. The reasons for Mr Richard Markham's departure from Merck &amp; Co, the world's biggest drugs group, are still being debated. But the other two resignations, that of Mr Ernest Mario as chief executive of Glaxo, the world's second largest group, and Mr Vaughn Bryson as chief executive of Eli Lilly were clearly the result of differences within the board over the companies' future direction. The cause of the drugs groups' difficulties is a combination of healthcare reform in Europe and Japan, and changes in the customer base in the US, the world's largest market, where an increasing number of clients are demanding ever greater discounts. Mr Hans Joachim Langmann, chairman of E. Merck, the privately owned German group, has lamented: 'The world is falling apart' for drugs manufacturers. Reforms launched in Germany, the world's fourth largest market, led to an 11 per cent collapse in sales in the first four months of this year, according to IMS International, the market research group. Overall, growth in the European market has slowed to 1.4 per cent, compared with 8 per cent during 1992. In the US, the changes taking place among drugs companies' customers are probably more significant than the reforms being prepared by Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton and her healthcare taskforce. Employers and individuals are grouping together to buy their healthcare in bulk. The bulk providers, which include Medicare and Medicaid, the state programmes for the old and poor, health maintenance organisations (HMOs) and mail order companies, are much more cost-orientated than traditional insurers. Known as 'managed' organisations, they are less interested in the relative merits of drugs than their price and are able to play one drug manufacturer off against another, negotiating substantial discounts. Figures compiled by The Boston Consulting Group suggest the growth of the managed sector has been explosive, increasing from 20 per cent of the non-hospital drugs market in 1987 to 35 per cent last year. Merck reckons that by the end of the decade 90 per cent of its American pharmaceuticals sales will be to bulk buyers. At present the figure is about 60 per cent. More alarmingly for the drugs groups, the size of the discounts the managed groups can negotiate has increased from 10 per cent to 25 per cent in the past five years. Merck has been affected by discounting more than most. Its best selling products, heart drugs and antibiotics, all suffer from price competition. The net effect of the changes in the US and Europe has been tumbling volumes and prices. As a result, brokers Wertheim Schroder reckon the average profits growth rate in the industry will fall from 19 per cent in the late 1980s to about 8 per cent this year. Some companies will suffer a decline. Faced with such a rapidly changing environment, drugs company boards need to make some tricky decisions about how their organisations should adapt. It is these decisions that appear to be causing the friction in senior management. The implications of the deteriorating market are frightening. First, the groups must find alternative strategies to cope with the changing US customer base. Second, they must decide whether to remain pure pharmaceuticals groups, or use their scientific base to become healthcare companies. They would offer diagnostics and over-the-counter (OTC) medicines which are less profitable than prescription products, but generate more stable earnings. In the US, the adjustment to managed care will be painful. Many of the thousands of sales representatives, who used to convince doctors about a particular medicine's effectiveness, may be made redundant. Schering'Plough of the US reckons a third of its sales are though managed care schemes, but require only 60 salesmen. A further 1,600 sales staff are required for the other two-thirds. One analyst estimates there could be between 50,000 and 100,000 job losses in the industry over the next few years, saving the sector Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.3bn) a year. Meanwhile, the debate within the pharmaceuticals groups about alternative strategies continues. Merck has announced it will take the unprecedented step of manufacturing generic non-patented products once its medicines' patents expire. It has also formed an alliance with the consumer group Johnson &amp; Johnson to market OTC products. The irony is that many drugs groups spent the 1980s becoming pure prescription medicine companies, disposing of their OTC and consumer brands businesses. The sacking of Mr Mario at Glaxo may have been partly caused by the reluctance of the board to reverse the company's policy of exiting from OTC medicines. With no sign of the external pressures ameliorating, more boardroom ructions are undoubtedly in the pipeline.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GINGER BROWN'S FATHER, ACCUSED OF KIDNAPING, CALLS IT A 'RESCUE'  </P> <P> Testifying on his own behalf, Earle Brown told a Vista Superior Court jury  Tuesday that he and his wife, Dorothy, decided to "rescue" their daughter,  Ginger Brown, from the influence of the leader of a religious group in order  "to save her, to return her to a free state of mind."  </P> <P> "We wanted to restore Ginger to her free will and to get her to act responsibly  in society," Earle Brown, 58, said of the unsuccessful, five-day deprogramming  effort in May, 1988.  </P> <P> Brown said he and his wife decided to forcibly take their daughter after she  had been home in the fall of 1987 for a supposed reconciliation but was still  anti-social.  </P> <P> "Ninety percent of the time she was there, she wouldn't talk with us," he said.  "She took no meals with us, wouldn't watch TV with us, wouldn't go to shows  with us. I was confused.  </P> <P> "On Thanksgiving Day, she wouldn't eat with us. She left the house early that  morning and didn't come home until late at night."  </P> <P> The decision was made after that to try to remove her from the small religious  group known as Great Among the Nations, Brown said. But, on the fifth day of  the deprogramming effort, Brown said, he and his wife gave up and decided to  return Ginger Brown to her apartment in Carlsbad. Instead, he said, she tricked  them into taking her to the Sheriff's Department substation in Encinitas.  </P> <P> "We did a quick U-turn," he said. "I wanted to get her back safely to her  apartment. "She started banging her head -- bang! bang! -- on the motor cover  (of the van). I said, 'Dorothy, we've got to let her go.' I'd rather have her  off, out in the night, than hurting her head."  </P> <P> Brown said he pulled over and his daughter jumped out of the van. He and his  wife then returned to the sheriff's substation, where they asked for help in  finding her and were, in turn, arrested.  </P> <P> The Browns, another of their daughters, Holly, and two men -- Hank Erler, in  whose mother's Escondido home the deprogramming attempt was made, and Cliff  Daniels, the deprogrammer -- are standing trial for kidnaping, false  imprisonment and battery.  </P> <P> Attorneys believe the Browns are the first parents to stand trial in this  country on kidnaping charges stemming from a deprogramming attempt.  </P> <P> Earle Brown said that, although his daughter was kicking and swinging her arms  when she was taken from an Encinitas parking lot, efforts were made not to hurt  her. Contrary to his daughter's testimony that she was punched in the face and  lifed into the getaway van, Brown said, he and an accomplice simply lifted her  into the van, where a mattress had been placed on the floor so she wouldn't be  hurt.  </P> <P> Asked if he struck his daughter, Brown said: "She was biting into my shoulder.  I couldn't believe this was happening. I swiftly pushed her face away because  the pain was unbelievable."  </P> <P> Again contradicting his daughter's testimony, Brown said her head was never  rammed against the van's floor. "She'd go into these kicking attacks. I'd say,  'Please, be still, please be quiet, we want to talk. Calm down, calm down."  </P> <P> Brown conceded he told his daughter he might break her leg, but he said he was  joking out of nervous tension. "I said that in jest to her. I thought it would  elicit some joke or ha ha from her. I was in shock, and she was in shock."  </P> <P> While inside the home in Escondido, Brown said, his daughter at one time  "hammered her forearm against the wall real hard, as if to bruise it." Another  time, he said, Ginger Brown was "picking scabs" from an earlier wound.  </P> <P> "No one at any time attempted for Ginger to renounce her faith," he said.  Rather, the group was trying to get her to disavow her allegiance to Benjamin  Altschul, the leader of Great Among the Nations to which his daughter belonged.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Rempel said after Brown's testimony, "Nothing he said  hurt us, except that he's her father. But, as far as the law goes, he hasn't  said a thing that constitutes a defense to kidnaping."  </P> <P> During a break in Tuesday's proceedings, Rempel asked Judge David B. Moon Jr.  to admonish persons in the courtroom for supposedly applauding rulings that  went in the defense's favor and for crying in view of the jury to evoke  sympathy on behalf of the Brown parents.  </P> <P> Rempel's remarks were apparently in reference to television actress Maureen  McCormick ("The Brady Bunch") who, along with another trial watcher, television  character actor Bob Pierce, said she was present in support of the Browns.  </P> <P> Asked by Moon if he had seen applauding or crying, courtroom bailiff Elmer  Blaikie said, "I've seen a lot of people crying, but I haven't seen anybody  clapping, your honor."  </P> <P> Rempel's cross-examination of Earle Brown continues today. Holly and Dorothy  Brown are expected to testify on their own behalf Wednesday and Thursday, but  the case isn't expected to go to the jury for deliberations until the first  week of January.  </P></p>

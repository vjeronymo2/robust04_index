			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Markets: Talking telephone numbers - The Bottom Line THE US appetite for mobile communications seems limitless. Even before AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn plus takeover of McCaw, shares in the UK mobile operator Vodafone had shot up, thanks largely to US investors. The shares began May at 377p then enjoyed a rise in anticipation of encouraging year-end results. The market was pleased by the profits and outlook and the shares resumed their climb even before the McCaw deal. They closed last night at 579p, up more than 50 per cent in less than four months. Moreover, Vodafone has been one of the week's heaviest traded stocks on Wall Street where it has an ADR listing. More than a quarter of the company's shares are held in the US; a significant increase in a few months. What does Wall Street see in Vodafone? 'The size of the McCaw deal convinced US investors that other cellular operators are undervalued,' says Laurence Heyworth, telecommunications analyst at Robert Fleming. Vodafone is not the only beneficiary of the cellular gold rush. But as the world's largest dedicated mobile company it is the prime magnet for funds in search of a second McCaw. If they are after another takeover, investors are probably backing the wrong horse. Allowing for a typical premium, a purchaser would need to find about Pounds 7bn. The only telecommunications companies with that sort of spare cash are BT and AT&amp;T. But after their recent sprees, neither is in the market. Anyway, regulatory hurdles would prevent BT from making the acquisition and accounting considerations deter everyone. A buyer of Vodafone would have to take a gigantic goodwill write-off since its net assets are worth only about Pounds 600m. Investors banking instead on still larger returns from Vodafone's businesses in the UK and overseas can take some comfort. Europe's cellular operators enjoy a licence to print money. They are monopolists or duopolists in lightly regulated markets. Their customers regard the services as essential and pay little of the bill personally. Vodafone prints more than most. Last year its operating profit was 46 per cent of sales and its cash flow 58 per cent. With 115,000 net new connections to its existing analogue network since last December, 50,000 of them paying the standard business tariff, its margins are unlikely to fall significantly this year. Long term, Vodafone wants as large a population base abroad as at home, allowing for relative income differentials. Yet its overseas licences are mostly recent acquisitions, and significant foreign revenue is at least two years away. The UK markets will determine the company's medium term fortunes. It is astonishing that Vodafone and Cellnet have avoided price regulation for so long. A large part of the explanation is that competition has always been just around the corner. After repeated delays, it is finally coming, in the shape of Mercury One-2-One, a digital PCN network about to be launched in and around London. One-2-One is not going all-out for the existing operators on price. Its prospective tariffs have so far obliged Vodafone to do no more than cut the special premium on its business tariff in London, and price local calls on its new 'MetroDigital' network, coming on stream in October, more competitively. With capital costs falling fast, that is still compatible with 50 per cent margins provided One-2-One expands the market while only slowly bringing down prices. That may happen. It is what Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, has in mind when he says of One-2-One: 'We need you as competition, otherwise we will get regulated'. However, if it does happen it may not be the end of the matter. For if competition fails to bring down margins, the case for regulation will be unanswerable. On the other hand if 'softly softly' fails to get Mercury many customers, the very survival of One-2-One may push Mercury into a serious price war for the first time in the industry's history. Private consumer who do pay their own bills can only relish the prospect. But neither scenario would comfort Vodafone's new US investors.</p>

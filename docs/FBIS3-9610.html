			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Srbobran, 25 Mar (TANJUG) -- The command of the  Srpska republic army has vehemently denied UNPROFOR's [UN  Protection Forces] report, made public in Zagreb today,  according to which the mortar shell that landed this morning on  the base belonging to UNPROFOR's British battalion in Bugojno  had been fired from Serb positions. The command asserts that the  Srpska republic army did not respond when Muslim forces this  morning shelled Srbobran from positions in the direction of  Bugojno, which is 12 km away. In reaction to UNPROFOR's report  on the wounding of two British soldiers in Bugojno, Serb  military sources in Srbobran claim that this was a result of the  inter-Muslim fighting that has been going on in Bugojno over the  past few days.</p>

			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / US telephone company ruling Federal regulators in the US cannot apply more lenient regulatory requirements to smaller long-distance telephone companies, the Supreme Court ruled yesterday. The Federal Communications Commission had allowed smaller long-distance carriers, including MCI Communications and Sprint, to offer rates and services without having to specify them to the FCC. Because of the high cost of filing with the FCC, agency officials believed that relaxing regulations on smaller telephone companies would allow them to better compete against American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which controls 60 per cent of the long-distance market.</p>

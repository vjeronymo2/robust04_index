			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Implants settlement approved A US judge has approved a proposed Dollars 4.25bn (Pounds 2.76bn) settlement for women around the world who have suffered ill-health as a result of silicone breast implants, Richard Waters reports from New York. The decision, by Judge Sam Pointer in a federal court in Alabama, followed months of deliberation and brought one step closer the biggest US product liability settlement. However, the deal could still fail. Some 15,000 women have already chosen instead to retain their rights to sue the implant manufacturers in US courts. The manufacturers have warned they will abandon the global settlement if too many women opt out of it, though they have not indicated what level of acceptance is needed for the deal to stay. Under the terms of the deal, all women are automatically covered by the settlement - and lose their rights to sue - unless they explicitly opt out. The settlement is meant to cover women who have already experienced medical problems and those who develop problems in future, though opponents claim that the amount of money being made available is too small and will be quickly exhausted. In one amendment to the original plan made by Judge Pointer, Dollars 96.6m of the settlement will be made available to women outside the US, up from the original Dollars 81m, but critics still maintain that this is far too little.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Playing dirty to win the Senate prize in New York state THERE are few places in the US where political campaigns are more nasty and brutish than in New York state. This autumn, however, the mud is being slung with more than usual abandon in the race for the Senate seat held by Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a right-wing Republican from suburban Long Island who has survived a series of ethics investigations over the years. His challenger is Mr Robert Abrams, a traditional liberal Democrat who has done a respectable job for the last 13 years as state attorney-general. He is a decent man with little charisma and 26 years of public service. He won his party's nomination after a harrowing primary battle against Ms Geraldine Ferraro, vice-presidential candidate in 1984. The primary contest, with smears to the fore, was termed 'gutter politics' by Governor Mario Cuomo of New York. The battle between Mr Abrams and Mr D'Amato is in some ways even worse. The former recently became so rattled that he called Senator D'Amato a fascist, only to apologise later after alienating Italian-American voters. The investigations faced by Mr D'Amato, a two-term senator, include a Senate ethics committee probe that cleared him of 13 charges. However, it had insufficient or no evidence of three other accusations - that he was involved in a New York housing scandal, that he had channelled federal funds to campaign contributors, and that he had helped his brother to lobby the federal government for defence contracts. The brother has been indicted on 24 counts of mail fraud. It has also not helped Mr D'Amato's reputation in the present campaign that several of the 120 witnesses questioned in the ethics probe used the US constitution's fifth amendment, letting them refuse to answer questions on the grounds that they might incriminate themselves. The Senate investigation, although it did not find any charge proved, concluded that Mr D'Amato had 'conducted the business of his office in an improper and inappropriate manner'. In its endorsement of Mr Abrams last week, the New York Times noted that the senator had often had to defend his honesty - 'his explanations have often been unsatisfactory.' Mr D'Amato, though, is a great campaigner who takes much pride in conducting business that helps constituents to win federal funds. He has taken credit for so many public works projects in New York, including some which would have flowed to the state without his intervention, that he has earned the nickname of 'Senator Pothole'. The figure he cuts is both tough and street-wise - a staunch defender of the military and an early proponent of bombing Baghdad, he knows how to play on the fears of his constituents by calling for the death penalty and warning that Mr Abrams is out to cut defence jobs. Although Mr D'Amato has moved to distance himself from President George Bush  -a recent cartoon showed him racing off the Titanic with an army of rats - he has clung to some of the Bush campaign's more extreme anti-abortion, anti-homosexual and anti-civil rights positions. He has no qualms about being so strongly anti-abortion that, as well as running on the Republican ticket, he is also the Right to Life party's senatorial candidate. Mr Abrams, by contrast, is an old-fashioned New York Democrat, and is hopelessly outgunned by Mr D'Amato when it comes to funding for all-important television adverts. In the circumstances, Mr Abrams, an otherwise honourable man, seems to have decided he must conduct a negative campaign - on television and at rallies - just as low as that of Mr D'Amato. The impact of the incumbent's heavy spending on negative television commercials, plus the residual effects of Mr Abrams's unfortunate use of the word fascist, have toppled the Democrat from his lead in the polls. The latest New York Times survey showed the candidates running neck and neck yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRVIN RETURNS TO RAMS, SAYS HE'S READY TO GO  </P> <P> After his 30-day substance-abuse suspension was announced last Aug. 29, Ram  cornerback LeRoy Irvin took his two young sons and headed for Big Bear, hoping  there his problems would disappear into the thin mountain air.  </P> <P> They didn't.  </P> <P> "I was trying to hide," Irvin said Wednesday, his first day back at Rams Park  since his suspension was lifted. "But people would recognize me in Big Bear. I  figured there was nowhere I could hide, so I'd better go try and get help, so  that's what I did."  </P> <P> Irvin, a two-time Pro Bowl player, checked himself into a substance  rehabilitation center and began to face the problem he thought he never had.  </P> <P> "I was kind of shocked and upset," Irvin said of his suspension. "At the time I  didn't feel bad for myself, I felt bad for all the people that respected me,  the coaching staff, players, fans, especially the children out there who I  spend a lot of time with. I really felt bad for those people. Then, as the  suspension wore on, I started feeling bad for myself, because I had the  problem. They didn't have the problem."  </P> <P> Irvin's problem has never been clearly defined, although it is believed to be  associated with either alcohol or marijuana. Irvin tested positive for  marijuana use last summer and has been tested regularly since. He tested  positive again after a reported binge during training camp.  </P> <P> Again on Wednesday, Irvin would not reveal what substance he violated, saying  it wasn't relevant.  </P> <P> "The only thing I can say is, regardless of what the substance is, a person can  have a problem," he said. "A person can have a problem with marijuana, you can  have a problem with alcohol, you can have a problem with cocaine.  </P> <P> "The substance is put in the forefront a lot of the times. But it's not really  the substance, it's the problem. What are you trying to hide? What are you  trying to mask? It's not the substance, it's the person. I really don't want to  talk about any substances."  </P> <P> Irvin said he underwent serious personal reflection during his suspension, and  hopes a new spiritual acknowledgment will lead to changes in his life style and  behavior.  </P> <P> "There are many changes in my life," he said. "I no longer want to go in bars,  things like that. The main thing is that I'm back, I'm in shape and I'm ready  to go."  </P> <P> Irvin said he kept close watch on the Rams while he was away. Former teammate  Eric Dickerson called Irvin in the hospital and offered to videotape  Dickerson's return to Anaheim Stadium on Sept. 17. The game was blacked out  locally.  </P> <P> "Eric called me a few times," Irvin said. "I really respect him for calling me  when I was in the hospital. Doug Reed called me, too."  </P> <P> Irvin said he would do what he could to restore his image in Orange County,  where he was active in the community and a Little League coach.  </P> <P> "The kids look up to you as sort of an American hero," he said. "Now during  this time all the heroes are seemingly getting shot down. This is another blow  to them, but I think they all have to realize that we're all human and everyone  makes mistakes. And if they're going to try be like somebody, try to be like  Jesus Christ . . .  </P> <P> "I feel bad that it had to happened, it'll make me a better person and I think  it was the best thing to happen to me at the time."  </P> <P> Irvin returned to practice Wednesday and was worked in quickly at his right  cornerback position.  </P> <P> At the time of his suspension, Coach John Robinson said Irvin's loss would only  be a distraction if teams started throwing over his right cornerback.  </P> <P> Well, that's exactly what has happened to Cliff Hicks, Irvin's replacement, who  has been beaten on several long passes.  </P> <P> Robinson said Irvin would likely start Sunday's game against San Francisco at  Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> Of course, that means covering All-Pro receiver Jerry Rice.  </P> <P> "Man," Irvin said. "I have no comment on that."  </P> <P> Irvin said he's actually up to the challenge.  </P> <P> "I felt really ready to play until I covered Henry Ellard on a route," Irvin  said. "That told me this is how the receivers are in this league. I think Henry  is by far the best receiver in the league right now, he and Rice are without a  doubt the two best in the league. I told him if I work against him during the  week I'll be ready for anyone."  </P> <P> Irvin was glad to be back.  </P> <P> "It wasn't awkward," he said of facing teammates again. "Because everyone knew.  It was hard leaving. The first three days were the hardest. Coming back wasn't  hard at all, because now everything is in the open. There's no reason to hide,  or feel ashamed, because it's all behind me now."  </P> <P> Irvin was tired of being a fan anyway.  </P> <P> "I turned into quite a critic," he said. "Now I get a chance to be a player  again. I realize I had a problem, went and got help."  </P> <P> Ram Notes  </P> <P> The team released wide receiver Mike Williams off injured reserve. . . .  Receiver Aaron Cox bruised his shoulder in a practice collision with Jerry Gray  and is listed as day-to-day. . . . Tackle Irv Pankey (strained back) didn't  practice Wednesday, but he's probable for Sunday's game.  </P></p>

This week's ICM poll of teachers - his flock as education secretary - won't exactly boost his chances. The poll showed that after 18 months of bullying from Clarke, Tory support among Britain's 450,000 teachers has plummeted to 20 per cent - against 51 per cent for Labour. In the halcyon days of 1979, polls showed that 45 per cent of the nation's teachers were behind the Thatcher banner. 'They're voting for a quiet life,' was the characteristically robust response from the education secretary.</p>

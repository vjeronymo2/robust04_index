			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / The Markets: The big question is not where but when - Global Investor Four questions hang over the developed world's investment outlook for 1994. What will happen to US interest rates? Is Germany really on its way out of recession? Will Japan's deflation take the economy into a black hole? And what does the future hold for China? Answering these questions is easy. The tricky thing is estimating when the answers take effect. Thus, I can say with complete confidence that US interest rates have seen their lows, and will move higher. Germany will recover from recession, and when it does, its economy will look much healthier than now seems possible. Japan's deflation will end short of a melt-down of the financial system, and will give way to a period of sustained growth, thanks to wide-ranging economic and social restructuring. And China will become the world's industrial powerhouse. But when? America first The US story illustrates how hard it is to spot the end of a trend. Long-term US interest rates peaked at roughly 8 1/2 per cent in 1990, and fell steadily till they brushed the 6 per cent level last autumn. Since then they have risen slightly. Short-term rates, also down to historically low levels, have not yet shown any signs of moving upwards. At some point, the interest rate cycle will turn. European analysts generally think that, for long-term US rates, the turning point was last autumn. US analysts tend to think that the small run-up in yields since the autumn is a false signal, soon to be reversed. This phase of the interest rate cycle still has a good few quarters to run, they say. The pessimistic view would have you out of the US treasury market now, looking for bonds with a better chance of capital appreciation, such as Europe's high-yielders. The optimistic view would keep you in treasuries to profit from the reversal of the autumn's run-up in rates. The outlook for short rates is subject to equally conflicting views. The fourth quarter seems to have been a period of strong economic growth, though we will have to wait till Friday's payroll and unemployment numbers to be sure. Inflation is still quiescent, though, and Thursday's money supply data are unlikely to pose any immediate threat. Still, the Federal Reserve will probably start easing short-term rates higher by spring. By how much? If the Fed plans a speedy return to traditional real interest rates, US short-term money could soon be anything up to 2 1/2 percentage points dearer, with much of the rise occurring this year. That would trigger a wholesale rush by individual investors back into savings instruments, leaving this year's favourites, bond and equity funds, looking badly mauled. If rise in rates is largely symbolic, to show the Fed's determination to keep inflation down, short-term rates are likely to be no more than half a point higher by year-end. Individual investors will still find almost anywhere a better home for their savings than banks and money funds. And any fresh bond rally would be helped by the realisation that the Fed is keeping a watchful eye on inflation. The balance of probabilities suggests that long-term rates have seen their lows for the cycle, but that the rise in short-term rates will be slower than the pessimists fear. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, is a master of gradualism. US rates, at both ends of the yield curve, are likely to be higher in December than they are now - but only a little higher. Germany's challenge Just before Christmas, Germany's economy presented a similar clash of views. The optimists - mostly inside Germany - argued that the recession was, in statistical terms, already over. Growth, still faltering, would resume solidly from the middle of the year. The pessimists saw a further contraction in the first part of 1994, with little sign of recovery before year-end. Since then, a fierce confidence offensive by the optimists - especially by Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister - has swayed opinion their way. From the point of view of Germany's equity market, this debate is all rather academic. Mr Eckhard Frahm, of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, predicted a strong rally among German blue chips in 1993, on the back of lower interest rates expectations, high liquidity, completion of the Gatt talks and so on. He got it, in spades. The 47 per cent rise in the Dax index in 1993 understates the performance of some of the biggest companies: Mannesmann rose 86 per cent, Deutsche Babcock rose 83 per cent, Volkswagen, despite its legal wrangle with Opel, rose 82 per cent. Mr Frahm is still positive about 1994, but the challenge for Germany - political worries apart - is to manage the shift from a liquidity-driven market to an earnings-driven one. He thinks this shift will start in the autumn, round about the time he expects the economy to pick up. He does not necessarily expect the market to make the transition smoothly, predicting a hiccup for share prices before investors focus on the much happier profit outlook for 1995. That view, and the Dax's performance in recent months, both assume that the German economy is heading, sometime this year, into a normal cyclical recovery. If, instead, 1994 is as unhappy a year for the average citizen as 1993, then the voters will have every opportunity to show their distress: there are 20 national, European and regional elections this year. The timing of Germany's recovery is perhaps more critical than the stock market's insouciance suggests. Japan's new consensus Calling the bottom in the Japanese economic cycle is just as hard. Quite apart from the still-not-properly digested effects of the 1980s bubble, Japan faces a structural issue. If German output is threatened by the millions of eastern European workers starting to be unleashed on the market system, Japan's is threatened by the growth of south-east Asia as the workshop of the world. Like Germany, Japan has been over-reliant on manufacturing. Change is coming in both countries. Germany's private sector is responding faster than the public sector; in Japan, the reverse may be true. Large Japanese companies seem frozen by the crisis, unable to believe that manufacturing excellence alone is not enough. The new Japanese government, despite its inherent weakness, is making a bolder stab at facing up to the new realities. The governmental paralysis in Tokyo - a prime cause of the stock market's dreadful performance in late 1993 - may in fact be preparing the way for the emergence of a new political/bureaucratic consensus. That is only part of the precondition for another stock market boom; some sign that corporate Japan is also embracing a new era is also required. Optimists will be watching for the first indications of both in 1994; either would be better news than the market was able to count on in 1993. China's myths US investors were buying foreign equities at the rate of Dollars 2bn a week in the third quarter of last year, according to figures released yesterday by the Securities Industry Association. That's the equivalent, during the quarter, of all the shares available for purchase by foreigners in the Barings indices for Chile, Indonesia, Korea, the Philippines and Taiwan. Much of the money went into Asia's soaring equities, analysed in more detail by Alexander Nicoll later in this section. But investors are attracted to the region not just because of the rapid growth of the south-east Asian tigers. Arguably a more powerful attraction, not for the first time this century, is the lure of China. Its vast population enables anyone with a calculator that will handle billions to create fantasies of infinite growth. As the Lancashire textile barons said during their slump at the turn of the century: if every Chinaman added a foot to his shirt-length, there would be enough work to keep the mills of Oldham humming forever. (That, of course, was before the mills of Oldham were replaced by the mills of Guangdong.) Up till now, western investors have had to buy into this proposition by proxy. But the most significant development of the turn of the year was the announcement of China's new unified exchange rate for the yuan, an important step on the road towards conventional portfolio investment in China. As it gradually becomes possible to invest there directly, instead of through proxies, China will move out of the realms of myth and become a straightforward investment proposition. That will help it to become, as it surely will, the main force for economic growth sometime in the 21st century. Getting there won't be easy, however: there is every sign, for example, that the current growth rate will provoke another overheating crisis sometime in the next 18 months. Opening up China to real investment will expose investors directly to the risks, as well as the rewards, of a giant economy growing at breakneck speed. It will make investing in the rest of the Pacific Rim a bit more exciting, too. Shiny new ritual The City's army of monetary economists have always lacked the sense of occasion created by the regular meetings of the Fed's Open Market Committee and the Bundesbank Council. Until now. The new sort-of-semi-independent status of Bank of England means that, in theory, monetary policy will be settled at the monthly meetings of the governor and the chancellor of the exchequer. The Bank will then be free to implement any changes at a time of its choosing, but before the next meeting. The two next meet on January 12. Expect a flurry of excitement before each meeting, and an orgy of anticipation afterwards as the markets wait to see what, if anything, was decided. But what's to stop the chancellor picking up the telephone any day he chooses? The total return tables which usually appear on this page were unavailable yesterday. They will be published in the Companies and Markets section tomorrow.</p>

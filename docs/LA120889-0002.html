			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDFLY SPRAYING CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> We would like to protest the pesticide spraying of residential areas of Los  Angeles County. We would strongly like to protest the silence of our elected  officials.  </P> <P> We realize that this is a serious economic problem for the Department of  Agriculture, but the bottom line is which is more important -- people or fruit.  Right now, money and fruit are winning because our elected officials will not  protect their people. (How many of these officials live in the areas being  sprayed?)  </P> <P> We feel that with some creative thinking (and money) there are other ways of  handling the problem on the ground. (Why are peddlers freely allowed to sell  bags of fruit to drivers on our roads, year after year?)  </P> <P> Please remember that the same experts who are telling us that malathion (not  fully tested) is safe, are the same ones who assured us that DDT, asbestos,  dioxin, PCBs etc. were all safe.

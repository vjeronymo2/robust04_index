			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / International Company News: Posco senior management changed again Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's second largest steel company, has changed its senior management for the third time in 18 months. The unexpected appointment of Mr Kim Mahn-je, a former deputy prime minister for economic affairs, as Posco chairman at the company's annual meeting followed the sudden resignation of Mr Chung Myunk-sik as chairman and Mr Cho Mal-soo as president. They are reported to have resigned in protest over government interference in the management of the company, whose largest shareholder is the state with 35 per cent. Mr Kim is the first outsider to head the profitable steelmaker, which was established in 1967, and his appointment may provoke criticism from the company's trade union.</p>

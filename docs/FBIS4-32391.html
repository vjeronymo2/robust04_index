			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 23 (CTK) -- The right-orientated  Democratic Union (DEU), which held its constituent congress at  the weekend, wants to attract those Czechs who feel deceived or  disappointed by the political development, DEU Chairwoman Alena  Hromadkova told journalists today.    The ensuing reluctance to turn out at local and  parliamentary  elections is understandable, but it is incorrect and dangerous  if political parties underestimate and downplay the problem,  Hromadkova said.    As the DEU advocates the idea of constituting a law-abiding  state, it considers the current situation in the sphere of  Senate untenable, Milan Hulik, a DEU leader, said. If the  Constitution laid down the Senate, the Senators should be  elected, he added.    However, the Senate is substantiated only in the countries  where it has a long tradition, which is not the case of the  Czech Republic, Hulik said. "Although frequent changes in the  constitution imply casting doubt on the legal state, the change  in this case would mean a lesser evil," he added.    The bill ending restitution, which is being discussed now is  a nonsense and the process of restitution should continue until  its very end because it is the best and purest way of  privatization, he said, adding that the same strategy should be  applied in relation to the church property.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By A.R. Deo: "Pakistan's Double-Speak"] </F>   [Text] Pakistani authorities have often spoken with two  voices on their country's nuclear programme. Generally it is  described as a purely peaceful programme. But when it comes to  reacting to US pressures on non-proliferation Pakistan stoutly  defends it as being vital for its security typifying the  inherent dilemma before Pakistani thinkers on many national  issues. This, of course, does not surprise those who have  followed the general Pakistani discourse on defence or foreign  policy.    Nawaz Sharif also said during a National Assembly debate  that  the government will not be permitted to cap or to roll back the  nuclear programme which was a guarantee of Pakistan's freedom  and independence. In his winding-up remarks Foreign Minister  Sardar Assef Ahmad Ali said that he would continue to counter  all attempts at creating misunderstandings regarding Pakistan's  nuclear programme. He reaffirmed that a political decision had  been taken to use this capability for peaceful purposes only.    Shortly thereafter, Sadar Assef who was visiting Dhaka for  the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]  Foreign Ministers' meeting shocked his audience by declaring  that Pakistan would "continue with its nuclear programme as long  as threat of war with its traditional rival India exists....  Nuclear capability should not be an exclusive privilege of the  western world or India." At least one daily, THE MUSLIM, has  questioned the wisdom of Sardar Assef's utterances. The current  phase of debate on Pakistan's nuclear policy began with Benazir  Bhutto's statement that the programme had been capped in 1990.  Nawaz Sharif denounced any possibility of capping as an  anti-national act.    Gen Aslam Beg, a former Chief of Army Staff, has now come  out  with a signed article in THE NATION . He recalls that it was an  American, Richard Barlow, who had "unequivocally asserted" that  Pakistan had acquired nuclear capability in 1987. The US  Administration chose to ignore this report so long as Soviet  forces remained in Afghanistan but used the same (Barlow report)  to accuse Pakistan of having crossed the red light.    Gen Beg admitted openly that Pakistan "had embarked on all  the nuclear steps simultaneously". These were: uranium  enrichment up to 95 per cent and above; preparation of the  device by integrating all its elements; laboratory tests of all  the elements of the device; final test of the integrated system  either by detonation (hot test) or without it through a cold  test; developing the delivery system.    He also confirmed that Pakistan had developed this capacity  in 1987 and added that the process of freezing the first stage  of this programme had "actually started in January 1989, that is  after a deliberate and conscious decision taken in a conference  co-chaired by the then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and the then  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto." There was thus "no substance" to  Benazir's allegation that she was kept in the dark about  Pakistan's nuclear programme.    According to Gen Beg, phase one of the programme was frozen  at the 3 percent enrichment level. "Subsequently, phase two got  automatically frozen because of lack of the basic material i.e.  enriched weapon grade uranium. The process of freezing,  disclosed Gen Beg, "continued during Nawaz Sharif's tenure. The  United States is now intensifying the pressure on Pakistan to  roll back its programme and exterminate the capability which  Pakistan has acquired after years of toil and sacrifice."    Now Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, commonly considered as the father  of the Pakistani bomb, has surfaced with his own cryptic  observation that the programme was never capped or uncapped and  directed further enquiries to the Chief of Army Staff [COAS].  Reminding his audience that he was still a government servant,  he volunteered his opinion that no one can accept a thing  detrimental to the country's security or defence nor must he do  so. Dr Khan is mercifully silent on whether the COAS could agree  to freezing (or roll-back) if he thought that doing so would not  be detrimental to Pakistan's security or defence.    In the meantime Benazir has once again publicly reaffirmed  Pakistan's determination not to roll back the nuclear programme  since non-proliferation in South Asia was regional issue.  Pakistan, she reiterated, will not sign the Nuclear  non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT] unless India also signs it.    With all these statements it is quite evident that Pakistan  had acquired nuclear capability (crossed the red light) in 1987,  that Washington was fully aware of it but chose to ignore this  fact in providing the annual certification to the US Congress,  that Benazir was a party to the freezing decision taken in  January 1989 and her disclaimer in Washington that she was kept  in the dark about Pakistan's nuclear programme was disingenuous.    That Pakistan is in possession of one or more nuclear  devices  is indirectly confirmed by its acquisition of missiles from  China. Caretaker Prime Minister Moir Qureshi had said on August  26 that "the short range tactical missiles Pakistan received  were required to meet our legitimate self-defence  requirements... As a sovereign state Pakistan cannot and will  not sacrifice its right to take whatever step we deem necessary  for its security." Qureshi later justified the nuclear programme  as "inevitable for the defence of the country". Read in their  totality, all these statements suggest that Pakistan has nuclear  capability but probably of limited dimensions. It has also  loosely talked of an Islamic Bomb thus giving its nuclear  programme an extra-regional dimension.    Perhaps for its own reasons Washington is exaggerating the  extent of Pakistan's nuclear programme. By encouraging Pakistan  to harp on linking its signature on the NPT with India's,  Washington is trying to confuse the issue. India does not sign  the NPT for its iniquitous character, not for any regional  reasons. By now there is enough evidence that the five-nation  conference proposed by Nawaz Sharif in 1991 was in fact an  American cuckoo's egg deposited in the Pakistani crow's nest.  The proposal died an early death although efforts are repeatedly  made to revive it.    If Pakistan wants to consolidate its security, it should  engage in meaningful talks with India without laying the  precondition that the so-called core issue of Kashmir must be  tackled before any meaningful progress can be made in other  areas. Even in the nuclear area, bilateral talks could prove  more fruitful than the present tactics which in effect merely  serve the American policy of consolidating its stranglehold on  yet another field of technology. In fact, Pakistan should join  India in demanding a more equitable and just international  regime when the NPT Review Conference meets in 1995.</p>

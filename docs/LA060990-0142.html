			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GARDENERS: DON'T GIVE BUGS A BREAK  </P> <P> It took weeks to till all the soil and clear the dead leaves and other debris  from the patch of land that -- with any luck -- will deliver tasty vegetables  or a picturesque flower show.  </P> <P> But don't get lazy now. There are a few unwelcome visitors in the garden that  have to be taken care of.  </P> <P> That green thing hanging off the tomato plant is not a leaf. And those brown,  squishy things look like they're building a patio under the lettuce. Those  pesky garden pests that were not there when the planting began are ruining all  your work.  </P> <P> "The pests just make your plants and ornamentals a mess," says Micheal D.  Smith, managing editor of the gardening division of Ortho Books. "But there are  ways to counter them."  </P> <P> Thousands of insect and insect-family pests invade gardens at various times  each year. Most of the tiny terrors arrive by their sensory perception -- they  tell plants by color, texture and fragrance -- then decide if the particular  vegetation is something they want in their diet.  </P> <P> A few pests, such as the gypsy moth and various mites, reach a garden by  accident, perhaps hitching a ride under a car or truck or on a pant leg from  someone's favorite overalls.  </P> <P> Once in the garden, the pests can maul plants in a variety of ways -- some  munch away at stems, leafs and petals, others dig around plants, and some even  suck and sponge away nutrients needed to keep the vegetation healthy.  </P> <P> Different insects, whether they invaded your garden intentionally or by  accident, require different strategies to get rid of them, depending on the way  they feed.  </P> <P> Predators are friendly insects that devour the garden-gorging pests. The  beneficial insects, like the praying mantis, snail-eating ground beetle and  ladybug larvae, can be imported into the garden, where they police the area for  the leaf- and flower-munching pests.  </P> <P> Smith warns, however, that if chemicals are going to be used in a garden in  addition to the predators, extra care should be taken in reading and  understanding the potency of the pesticides.  </P> <P> "Of course, understanding the chemical pesticides is important no matter what,  but in particular, you don't want to kill off the pests' natural predators," he  says. "You have to take care in understanding chemical pesticides."  </P> <P> Other ways to combat pests include using sticky traps that catch pests as they  make their way into the garden or up a fruit tree.  </P> <P> Another alternative is building barriers to keep crawling bugs out, but this is  a time-consuming project that can involve digging trenches or wrapping aluminum  stripping around the border of the garden.  </P> <P> There has also been research into creating pathogenic diseases that fight off  and eliminate pests while not harming people, pets or wildlife. The disease  germs can be introduced into the garden in ways similar to spreading chemical  pesticides.  </P> <P> Smith says the best way to combat a specific pest is to first identify the  insect by appearance -- "a photo will do" -- then research what the particular  pest is known to eat. "From there, you can learn the best way to get rid of the  pests," he says.  </P> <P> But bear in mind that winning a battle against a pest doesn't necessarily mean  that the war is over.  </P> <P> "Pests return," Smith says. "You have to make sure the plants are healthy. You  don't want leaves with holes in them or browning."  </P></p>

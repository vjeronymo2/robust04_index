			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN HARRY MET IRVING . . . THE ROOMMATE ALTERNATIVE  </P> <P> "The nights bothered me. Not because I was afraid but because I felt depressed  and lonely. I looked around and no one was there," said Irving Tarnol, a  sprightly 87-year-old. "After I lost my wife of 54 years, what I missed the  most was companionship," he continued.  </P> <P> Tarnol thinks he found the best solution when Harry Roberts, 72, moved in a few  months ago to share his two-bedroom condo in Van Nuys. The two were matched  through Alternative Living for the Aging, a nonprofit agency that assists the  elderly with their housing needs.  </P> <P> "Harry and I are worlds apart," Tarnol said, "but I'm lucky to have him for a  roommate. He's a nice, quiet, gentle man. I had a couple of roommates before  him but they didn't work out. I even tried a lady roommate but she wanted to  reform me. I'm too independent."  </P> <P> Both agree that the things that set them apart, may well add up to a plus in  compatibility.  </P> <P> "Irving is outgoing and takes an interest in more things than I do. He plays  cards with friends. I don't dig that. We do our own thing," Roberts said.  </P> <P> "I like to read. I'm more introverted and shy. I take things as they come but  I'm no pussycat. I fight back when necessary," said the former musician.  </P> <P> Tarnol, who just had his driver's license renewed for another four years,  describes himself as a bit short-tempered and impatient. "Harry takes things as  they come. I like to do things too quickly. Sometimes I forget I'm 87 years. At  84, I was still working four hours a day for my grandson. But, since I now have  a pacemaker, I'm learning to slow down."  </P> <P> Irving is organized and methodical even when he cooks, Roberts said.  </P> <P> "No frozen meals for me. I cook a full meal in about 30 minutes because I  prepare everything ahead of time.  </P> <P> "And I'll eat anything Irving fixes," said an appreciative Roberts. "Irving's a  pretty good cook."  </P> <P> Twenty years ago, the roommates were at the peak of their respective  professions.  </P> <P> Tarnol -- who emigrated from his native Russia in 1920, raised six children and  now has 18 grandchildren and a second great-grandchild on the way -- was  running his own successful wholesale laundry and dry cleaning business in the  '70s.  </P> <P> "I had between 80 and 100 employees. I was always surrounded by activity,  family doings and with my wife's involvement with charitable organizations," he  said.  </P> <P> Roberts, a featured orchestra musician for most of his life -- with a talent  for a variety of reed instruments -- spent most of the 1970s aboard luxury  ocean liners entertaining passengers on Mediterranean and Middle-East cruises.  Previously, he had been a staff musician for radio stations in his native  Philadelphia.  </P> <P> Roberts, who has two children and a grandchild, eventually settled in  California, where his wife died in 1983.  </P> <P> "I used to travel back East each year on my vacation, and usually had a gig or  two booked there to cover my expenses. One day my brother, who was a booking  agent, said: 'Sorry, Harry, I can't get you any work. You're good but you look  too old.' Instead of getting angry at him. I laughed. He was right. I sold my  instruments."  </P> <P> On their 5Oth wedding anniversary, Irving and Lillian Tarnol received a  handsome gift from their six children.  </P> <P> "They all got together and gave us this condo. After my wife died, I told my  children I was too independent to live with any of them. I'd made up my mind  that as long as I could take care of myself, that's how I wanted to live -- in  my own home," he said.  </P> <P> Roberts and Tarnol have a simple living arrangement. Each has his own bedroom  and bath, at opposite ends of the living and dining areas, with light buttons  installed so that either one may alert the other in an emergency. Each has his  own TV set, although they sometimes watch a program together in the living  room.  </P> <P> Both manage well on their monthly Social Security check. Roberts, who says he  could not possibly afford an apartment on his own, pays $300 for his share of  housing; Tarnol pays for the utilities and both share the cost of the food and  a cleaning woman every two weeks.  </P> <P> Tarnol is an amiable host who keeps a full bar for friends who may drop by for  a drink. "And I never have to mark the bottles, 'cause Harry doesn't drink.  </P> <P> "All either one of us really needs is having another human being around,"  Tarnol said. "Someone who will laugh if you think of something funny to say or  who will occasionally share their feelings."  </P> <P> Roberts agreed. "Yes, it does chase away the loneliness."  </P></p>

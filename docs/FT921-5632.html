			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Brussels urged to be patient over IMF aid to CIS states EC foreign ministers yesterday told Brussels to be patient in letting the International Monetary Fund take the lead in organising macro-economic aid to former Soviet republics. But the ministers broadly endorsed the call by Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC external affairs commissioner, for the Community to extend EC ties to all members of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - in Asia as well as in Europe - and to relax conditions which have so far blocked the Ecus 1.25bn (Pounds 887m) food aid loan to the CIS. Mr Andriessen, fresh from touring four CIS republics last week, told ministers that the EC should show the world a lead in stabilising the longer-term economic future of the CIS. Specifically, the EC should widen the scope of the aid-to-CIS conference which it will chair in Lisbon in May to deal with structural, not just emergency, aid. Some Commission officials feel that the IMF will provide too little, too late to prevent further economic and political de-stabilisation in key CIS republics, and therefore it was up to Brussels to mobilise a wider aid effort of the kind that the US-sponsored Washington conference in January has so far failed to generate. But Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, said most ministers felt macro-economic aid should be left to the IMF, which is due to admit CIS republics as full members next month. 'The enemy here is confusion,' said Mr Hurd. 'In the CIS there are too few institutions, while we have too many,' he said. The EC should not get in the way of the IMF which was far advanced in its work with the leaders of, at least, Russia, he claimed. After visiting Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan as well as Belarus and Ukraine last week, Mr Andriessen told ministers that Central Asia and Kazakhstan 'are so inter-dependent with the other former Soviet republics that they will stand or fall together.' Thus, Brussels should not be seen to demote central Asian reublics to second place, behind European CIS republics, but should negotiate trade and co-operation deals with all. One possible way of tying central Asian states to secular Turkey, rather than fundamentalist Iran, Mr Andriessen suggested, was for the EC to lend them money to buy goods from Turkey, in the same sort of triangular trade operation that Brussels is conducting in Eastern Europe. Pleading for the EC not to let its food aid get caught up in red tape, Mr Andriessen said the Community should be ready to waive some of the guarantees it has been demanding for its Ecus 1.25bn food loan. The Commissioner suggested that if Ukraine and Russia could agree on a 20/80 per cent split of responsibility for repayment of past Soviet debt, the EC should accept this. The Commissioner got wide backing from foreign ministers. But any change in the loan terms will have to be agreed by their more stoney-hearted colleagues, the finance ministers, when they meet in two weeks' time.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Many more companies go bankrupt CORPORATE bankruptcies in Japan rose 46.9 per cent in January compared to a year ago, the Teikoku Data Bank said yesterday, as the decline in property and share prices continued to put pressure on businesses. It was the 16th consecutive month to register year-on-year increases in bankruptcies, with 949 cases. Although this was a decline from 1,204 bankruptcies registered in December, Teikoku said that adjusting for seasonal factors, levels were continuing to increase. The high level of business failures reflects the slowing of the economy and government policies aimed at curbing rampant asset price inflation of the last decade. The liabilities of bankrupt companies reached Y448.2bn, (Pounds 2bn) down from Y642.3bn a year ago. Although the Finance Ministry lifted restrictions on property-related lending in January, Teikoku said that continuing bank reluctance to lend to the sector had caused a number of companies to go under. The gradual decline in interest rates since the summer has also failed to bring relief to the sector. Property companies again headed the list of bankrupt companies, with 86 cases recorded. In spite of the continuing slowdown in the economy, inability to hire sufficient labour was cited as a cause of 46 bankruptcies.</p>

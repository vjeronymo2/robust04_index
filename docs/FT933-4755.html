			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / Money Markets: D-Mark is ignored GERMAN interest rate dealers continued to take the view that the Bundesbank would leave interest rates unchanged at this week's council meeting in spite of the D-Mark's powerful performance against the dollar, writes James Blitz. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank president-elect, said recently that a streng-thening D-Mark would be of concern to German exporters, given the already dilapidated state of the European economy. Worries about the D-Mark may have encouraged some dealers to take the view that interest rates would come down this week, and the September Euromark contract rose 2 basis points to 93.52. But at this level, dealers are still expecting three-month D-Marks to be at 6.48 per cent when the contract matures in around a week's time. And that is barely different from yesterday's D-Mark cash level of 6.53 per cent. Some analysts believe that this week's meeting will be the last opportunity for official rates to come down for six weeks. The meeting in 2 1/2 weeks' time will be Mr Helmut Schlesinger's last as Bundesbank president and the one after that will be Mr Tietmeyer's first. Mr Adrian James, an economist at NatWest Markets in London, said the central bank would probably not want to change rates at either session. In any case, none of the factors which could bring a cut are in place. Core inflation is unlikely to come below 4 per cent until next month. New agreements are still being negotiated on the German budget. And negotiations are about to get under way on the next wage round. Miss Alison Cottrell, an economist at Midland Global Markets, believes all these factors point to a cut of 50 basis points at either of the meetings on October 21 or November 4 at the very earliest. In London, the Bank of England again forecast a large daily shortage, this time of Pounds 1.35bn. On this occasion, Pounds 1.1bn of the shortage was removed in the early round of trading, bringing the overnight rate down to a low of 4 per cent. Sterling interest rate futures were depressed by another poor performance from the currency. The September short sterling contract declined 2 basis points to close at 94.08. The December contract fell 5 basis points to 94.44.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Norway wary of gas pipeline Norway is increasingly reluctant to participate in the construction of a gas pipeline, the interconnector, linking Britain to Belgium and creating a single market for European gas. Bids outlining equity requirements and space allocation are due for submission on November 28. Proposals covering ownership agreements and financing arrangements are expected to go out soon to companies interested in the project. An interconnector study group - comprising British Gas, British Petroleum, Conoco of the US, Distrigaz of Belgium, Elf Aquitaine of France and Norway's Norsk Hydro and Statoil - has been studying the feasibility of the proposed pipeline. But Norway's gas exporters are questioning the benefits of participating in the project because of tariffs on routing their gas through the UK grid to Europe. Norsk Hydro said in August that it was not interested in joining the project. When the Europipe trunkline to Germany comes on stream next year, four gas export systems will run from Norway; three to the continent and one to the UK. Once plans for two additional export lines are realised - to cover substantial additional gas exports to Germany and France - the length of Norway's gas transit highway will be 5,600km, the largest submarine system in the world. The Norwegians are also frustrated by the British government's unwillingness to allow reverse-flow through the interconnector from the continent to the UK. They also claim the British government is linking participation in the interconnector with UK imports of Norwegian gas under existing contracts with Britain's National Power and Scottish Power.</p>

			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / World Stock Markets: Australia depressed by inflation fears in US - Contradictions in the equity market There is one overriding issue in the Australian stock market at present. Should it mimic the trend set in US equities? Or can it decouple from the US market, at least in the short term, and reflect the smaller nation's own economic dynamics? So far, there has been little sign that the latter, arguably more rational course, is being taken. The Australian All-Ordinaries index, which peaked at 2,340.60 on February 3, fell steadily after the US Federal Reserve raised interest rates the following day. It stabilised in early March, but tumbled even more sharply after the Fed's second interest rate rise on March 22. At the beginning of April, when US shares rallied following their earlier sharp sell-off, Australian stocks followed suit. Finally, when US rates edged higher again on April 18, the Australian market suffered another setback. By the close of business yesterday, the All Ordinaries index stood at 2,042.5, some 150 points below the level seen at the beginning of March. In short, over the past three months, interest rate increases in the US and the domino effect on bond and equity prices could be blamed fairly for a near-13 per cent fall in the Australian stockmarket. True, there may have been a few subsidiary factors: this week, for example, uncertainty over the gold price, and problems with a number of Papua New Guinea mining projects led to a general weakness in gold shares. But for the most part, Australian analysts have no doubt that Wall Street is leading the way: 'Australian financial markets continue to be shaped by inflation fears generated within the US,' concluded economists at Challenge Bank this week, for example. In theory, this is perverse. While the Australian economy grew strongly in the fourth quarter of 1993, pushing the annual growth rate to 4 per cent, there is no sign of capacity constraints being reached. On the labour front, unemployment is stuck in double figures, and wage inflation, running at about 3 per cent, is not a serious concern. It is true that the weakness in business investment could pose problems in the long term, but for the immediate future, the manufacturing sector is thought to have plenty of spare capacity. As the Reserve Bank of Australia commented in its monthly bulletin published this week: 'Australia's underlying inflation remains around 2 per cent and the prospects for another year of low inflation during 1994 appear good at this stage.' Surplus capacity, the RBA added, 'was serving to dampen upward price and wage pressures and a stronger exchange rate winding back some of the earlier potential for prices to rise'. Comments by Mr Bernie Fraser, the RBA governor, have tended to support the notion that Australian interest rates do not need to rise in the short term. 'Developments which are fundamentally at odds with holding inflation at around 2-3 per cent over a run of years will bring forth an appropriate monetary policy response,' he remarked in a keynote speech at the end of March. Noting the 3 per cent rate of wage inflation, and trend productivity growth of about 2 per cent, he suggested that 'these figures do not pose a serious threat to inflation at this time'. So why the slavish adherence to Wall Street? Some analysts believe that the domestic markets are simply anticipating an inevitable feed-through effect from the US in the medium term, and know that interest rates are more likely to go up than down. 'I buy the Reserve Bank's argument,' says an economist at Bain &amp; Co in Sydney. 'But perhaps the easiest way to view it, is that Australia is about six to nine months behind the US. Markets are just very forward-looking.' The second answer is that a significant portion of the money which supports the Australian equity market emanates from overseas, and some traders detect different behaviour for foreign, as opposed to domestic, investors. 'Most of the local institutions have cash to spend,' says one equities dealer at ANZ McCaughan in Sydney. 'The selling pressure has mainly been from overseas redemptions. It's hard to tell where that comes from, but the majority is probably the US.' Either way, with all the transoceanic stock-watching, Australia's impending federal budget for the 1994/5 fiscal year has been largely overlooked. The package is due to be handed down on May 10. For the stockmarket, this may never be a major event. Although some analysts believe investors will pay more attention to the budget details in a few weeks' time, the government's repeated affirmation of its deficit reduction strategy, and the known strength of the economy should soothe most nerves. Meanwhile, the flow of new issues has eased: McIntosh Securities estimates that the market will be asked to absorb around ADollars 6bn-worth of new offerings in the six months to June compared with ADollars 9.6bn in the previous half-year. So the prevailing opinion among local analysts is for a fairly calm period ahead. There is a general conviction that the worst of the correction is over, although a few cautious pundits warn that the All Ordinaries index could reach the 1,900s.</p>

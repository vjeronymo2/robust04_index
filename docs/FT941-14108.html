			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft chief spells out survival strategy Mr Kajo Neukirchen, the new chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, warned yesterday of 'massive' job losses at the Frankfurt-based group and gave details of the company's future strategy. Mr Neukirchen, renowned as one of Germany's toughest company doctors, wrote in the Frankfurt-based group's in-house newspaper that the job cuts would be necessary to guarantee its survival. He did not quantify the scale of the reduction in the workforce but the tenor of the article suggested that job cuts will prove to be more than the 10,000 out of 58,000 he indicated after the group was rescued by bankers last weekend. Mr Neukirchen said the group would focus on three core operating areas - trading, chemicals and plant construction. Many of the group's 258 subsidiaries both in Germany and abroad would be sold. Significantly absent from the list of future core activities are the group's mining businesses - bundled together in the 50.1-per cent owned Canadian subsidiary Metall Mining Corporation (MMC) - or its metals smelting activities. Mr Neukirchen has already hinted that the continuing ownership of MMC will come under review. He has said that the smelters - highly efficient producers of metals such as zinc, copper and lead after huge investment in updated technology by Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Mr Neukirchen's predecessor - may be closed. Mr Neukirchen repeated his pledge to sell off the company's majority stake in Kolbenschmidt, a manufacturer of motor vehicle components such as steering-wheels and air-bags, together with two smaller investments. He warned that in the trading area he would close or sell non-core and capital-intensive businesses. He said that 'from today's perspective' there was no intention to sell the following companies, commonly deemed the jewels in the Metallgesellschaft crown: Buderus (heating equipment and other industrial products); Dynamit Nobel (explosives and specialty chemicals); Lurgi, Lentjes and Zimmer, three plant construction subsidiaries; and BUS Berzelius Umwelt-Service, a recycling company.</p>

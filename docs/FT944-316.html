			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie rallies but fails to conquer 3,100 barrier - Market Report A strong overnight push from the New York market helped London to maintain its recent rally and move smartly higher yesterday. However, London's early 26-point rise was achieved on slight volume and reflected technical factors rather than fundamental confidence. There was little in the way of solid news to latch on to, and profit-taking later in the day saw the FT-SE 100 index of leading stocks end the day only 12.4 up at 3,095.8 while the mid-250 index closed 18.8 higher at 3,506.1. Business was dominated by activity in the US. Wall Street had ended its Tuesday trading session 28 points higher making a gain of around 50 points since the London market last closed. That gave a lead to the UK equity futures dealers who raised the price for the FT-SE 100 contract expiring in March to 3,143, a jump of 160 points since the December contract expired a fortnight ago. It was only a matter of time before underlying equities followed suit and after opening 6 points higher, the FT-SE 100 moved forward to break through 3,100. There was an element of 'year end rally' in the rise but the bulk of the upturn was traced back to some relatively weak housing data in the US, which were interpreted as a sign that the recent rate rise there had taken effect. The figures gave a lift to US Treasuries and, subsequently, gilts notched up a quarter-point rise among longer dated maturities. Strength in the bond markets spilled over into equities and at its peak the FT-SE 100 was up at 3,109.7. There was broad confidence that yesterday's meeting between the chancellor and the governor of the Bank of England would not lead to an interest rate rise but fundamental support in the UK was, effectively, non-existent. The Treasury's latest monthly report showing that inflationary pressures were subdued contained no significant new information. And though the panel of independent forecasters had reduced forecasts of inflation in 1995 to 2.9 per cent from 3.2 per cent, the beneficial aspects of low inflationary expectations were countered by an Institute of Directors survey showing decreasing confidence among business leaders. A strong D-Mark made sterling look slightly more attractive but not enough to enthuse placid fund managers who had carried out most of their end-year adjustments by last week. Then, in the afternoon, the Dow was hit by profit-taking and the Footsie lost ground accordingly. In fact, post Christmas torpor was arguably the most significant element of the day and the gains were not reflected by a frenzy of activity. By mid morning only 70m shares had changed hands and the closing total was a paltry 269.6m with 153.4m of that figure accounting for non-Footsie issues. The figure compared with total turnover on Friday - the last trading day before Christmas and traditionally one of the quietest days of the year - of 577.4m shares. Then the value of genuine customer business was Pounds 754.1m which was around half that of recent levels. Mr Ian Harnett, economist with SGST said: 'If we had held the 26-point gain we might have seen some follow through buying but, as it is, I can't envisage much activity. People have already positioned themselves for the next long break.' Dealers said that despite some buying from the hedge funds in the futures market, retail business was virtually at a standstill. There was some interest in the financial sectors and Lloyds Bank shares were sold on nervousness over its involvement in Mexico. Elsewhere, Euro Disney regained some of its value after the group announced that attendances in the quarter to December had shown a big rise from a year earlier.</p>

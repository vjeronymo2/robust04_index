			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> CHRISTIAN SCHOOL MUST MOVE AGAIN;  </P> <P> CHURCH: THE SCHOOL IS DENIED A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT AT ITS NEW LOCATION AFTER  COMPLAINTS BY RESIDENTS.  </P> <P> Four months ago, students at Leffingwell Christian School left Norwalk and  moved to a church in Paramount because the school's lease expired. Tuesday  night, the Paramount City Council told them they will have to move again.  </P> <P> The council voted, 4-1, to deny the junior and senior high school a conditional  use permit needed for a private school to operate in a neighborhood of mostly  single-family homes.  </P> <P> The permit was denied and the school was ordered to move out because neighbors  complained about congestion and the potential for gang and drug problems.  </P> <P> The private, nondenominational school began classes in June at the First  Assembly of God Church on Orizaba Avenue and Monroe Street. Residents had no  problems when the school was just 50 students during the summer, Mayor Manuel  Guillen said.  </P> <P> After school opened in September and the enrollment grew to 200, the traffic  increased. Residents said they also saw more people in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> Guillen said the city confronted a similar issue a few years ago, when the  Emmanuel Reformed Church applied to open a preschool and junior high school in  the neighborhood. After discussing the issue with residents, the city allowed  only a preschool, with a maximum of 76 students.  </P> <P> Officials then told the neighborhood that no more private schools would be  allowed.  </P> <P> Now neighbors were faced with a "new school within 150 yards of Emmanuel  Reformed," Guillen said.  </P> <P> Neighbors were also apprehensive about the possibility of gang problems and  drugs, he said. But school officials said neither was a problem.  </P> <P> Students were unhappy with the council's decision.  </P> <P> Kimberly Reddick, 15, of Norwalk, was upset with the arguments raised against  the school. "The decision was very unjust," she said. "We had to move from the  area where we were before. We're not a rowdy bunch of students."  </P> <P> Kristal Poore, 15, of Norwalk, worried about what will happen to her and her  friends. "If we leave the school," she asked, "where are we going to go? There  are not many people who are going to go to public school. This is our family."  </P> <P> She added that Leffingwell, with tuition of $250 a month, is an inexpensive  private school.  </P> <P> School officials were determined to continue their fight. Principal John Clark  said of the council's decision: "Looks like we're going to have to close up. We  don't have any place to go. We're considering taking legal action. "  </P> <P> Ken Dobson, a pastor with the Assembly of God congregation, said his church is  also looking into getting a rehearing before the council. He said there was not  enough discussion at the Tuesday meeting.  </P> <P> Vice Mayor Allen Parker agreed and said he cast the only dissenting vote  because he did not have enough information. "I am really appalled," he said.  "Not by the decision. . . . I was appalled by the lack of information the  council was interested in getting and the misinformation they had."  </P> <P> In January, Dobson said he was told by the city Planning Department that a  permit would not be needed.  </P> <P> But there was an apparent misunderstanding between the planner and Dobson,  Deputy City Manager Patrick West said. The planner thought Dobson intended to  expand an existing school.  </P> <P> The City Council reversed an earlier decision by the Planning Commission  approving the permit for the school.  </P></p>

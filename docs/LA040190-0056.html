			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWPOINTS;  </P> <P> SHOULD WE PRIVATIZE THE POSTAL SERVICE?  </P> <P> The specter of another increase in the price of a postage stamp has again  raised calls for privatizing the Postal Service.  </P> <P>  Leading the campaign for privatization is James C. Miller, former head of the  federal Office of Management and Budget in the Reagan Administration. Miller  argues that if private companies were allowed to deliver the mail -- currently,  they may only deliver parcels, extremely urgent mail and some bulk mail --  prices would fall and the mail would travel more efficiently.  </P> <P>  Furiously defending the Postal Service as a government agency is Postmaster  General Anthony M. Frank, who frequently has found himself debating Miller on  the subject. Frank says the agency's proposal to increase the price of a  first-class stamp to 30 cents next year barely allows the agency to keep up  with inflation.  </P> <P>  For a debate on the issues, journalist Sharon Bernstein conducted separate  interviews of Frank and Miller, asking them the same questions and allowing  each to respond to the other's views.  </P> <P> Does the Postal Service need to be changed? If so, how?  </P> <P> Miller: The Postal Service needs to be changed in two specific dimensions. The  more important is to repeal the private-express statutes that presently grant  the Postal Service a monopoly on the delivery of addressed mail. The second  reform that needs to be made is to transfer the Postal Service from the public  sector to the private sector and give it the types of incentives competitive  firms have.  </P> <P> Frank: Jim Miller makes his living off of doing this. It was an avocation for  him (when he was with the Reagan Administration), and now it's become a  vocation. His ideas -- if you can call them ideas -- are not worth dignifying  with a discussion.  </P> <P> (As far as changes,) nothing stays the same in our country. In point of fact,  the Postal Service is going to go through more changes in the next five years  than it has in the history of the country. So of course it's changing. We're  automating more of our systems, and we're going to pay discounts to the big  bulk mailers for presorting their mail and putting their own bar codes on. That  will free our people up to do more customer service.  </P> <P> But its system of ownership will not change.  </P> <P> What is the basic argument in favor of privatizing the Postal Service?  </P> <P> Miller: There really are two different issues: postal privatization and removal  of the monopoly.  </P> <P> First, I'd like to talk about the monopoly. Our commercial system is based on  competition. Indeed, some believe the antitrust laws are the Magna Carta of our  marketplace. Yet the antitrust laws do not apply to the Postal Service. If they  did, you would get a more responsive, lower-priced operation.  </P> <P> As for privatization, government firms are notoriously inefficient because they  have no bottom line. All over the world, countries are privatizing their  government corporations, whether it's in the industrialized West or in the  Eastern Bloc. Yet we in America steadfastly cling to a dinosaur Postal Service.  </P> <P> Frank: First of all, there's not two issues, there's one. Jim Miller wants to  break up the Postal Service into little pieces and sell off the profitable  ones.  </P> <P> The Postal Service has two functions. One is to run as a business and one is to  run as a public service. You'd probably end up with a thousand private  carriers; some would go bankrupt in competing for what would be the higher  concentrations of population -- major cities -- where deliveries are less  expensive. The Post Office would be left with the most difficult and costly  deliveries, the ones private firms don't want. They'd want Manhattan but not  the Bronx and rural areas.  </P> <P> How is the Postal Service currently financed?  </P> <P> Frank: Most people don't know this, but the Postal Service does not take a dime  in taxes. We are completely self-contained. And since the Post Office was  changed to the Postal Service in 1971, the price of postage has kept pace with  inflation and nothing more.  </P> <P> If the Postal Service is sold to a private company, wouldn't consumers be at  the mercy of a profit-oriented company that, like an unregulated phone company,  could raise rates at will?  </P> <P> Miller: I don't think it would be like the telephone company. I would not  propose giving any postal company a monopoly on the delivery of mail. I would  much rather risk my welfare on competitive firms pursuing the profit motive.  </P> <P> Frank: And prices will go down just like airline travel went down so much since  deregulation. Now you get to fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $400  bucks when it used to cost you $12.50. I hope the sarcasm is coming across  here.  </P> <P> People who have been in the private mail business for a long time talk of  literally hiring carriers off the street. What kind of quality control would be  used if the Postal Service went private?  </P> <P> Frank: Yes, the old wino mail drop. The Postal Service employs 750,000 people,  and most of them are career employees.  </P> <P> Miller: People entrust many times the number of parcels to United Parcel  Service as they do to the Postal Service every day. The Postal Service is  practically out of the parcel business because they just can't stand the  competition.  </P> <P> And at the high end, people trust their express mail service to private  companies far more than to the Postal Service.  </P> <P> How would the jobs and work environment of postal employees be affected by  privatization?  </P> <P> Frank: When Jim Miller talks about privatization, he means union busting. The  Postal Service pays its people $15 an hour, plus another $5 in benefits. Miller  would pay them entry level wages of $4 to $6.  </P> <P> Miller: I don't think they would be adversely affected significantly, although  postal union leadership is adamantly opposed to it. The competitive postal  services pay their employees very well, but they work under more flexible work  rules that allow their employees to be more productive.  </P> <P> (The Postal Service says its) work rules protect the workers. Well, you can  have an operation that protects its workers to the point that they don't  service the consumer.  </P> <P> Do any other countries have a private postal system?  </P> <P> Miller: New Zealand took its postal service private three years ago, and it's  working very well. The government maintains some ownership, but it's  essentially private.  </P> <P> Frank: That country is about 600 miles long with 3 million people. As soon as  they went private they closed 70% of their post offices. The cost of a letter  went up an immediate 33% for three-day delivery and twice that for next-day  service.  </P> <P> How likely is the United States to take its postal system private?  </P> <P> Miller: It's more likely they'll reduce the monopoly power of the Postal  Service sooner than they will take it private. And I don't think either is  likely any time soon. The reason is the postal unions and the Postal Service  itself is very popular on Capitol Hill.  </P> <P> On the other hand, the power of the idea is not something to overlook; it's a  very strong one. And don't be surprised if 10 years from now it's accomplished.  </P> <P> Frank: If we do our job, the chances of that happening are nil.  </P> <P> (Miller) says, "Let's just try it as an experiment." Well, if it doesn't work,  how do you put Humpty Dumpty back together again? Do you just go out and say,  "I want to hire 750,000 people and train them?"  </P></p>

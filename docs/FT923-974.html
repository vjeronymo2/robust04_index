			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / Long battle is likely over disqualification THE GOVERNMENT'S applic-ation to have Mr Berry disqualified as a company director under the 1986 Company Directors Disqualification Act looks certain to lead to a protracted legal battle. In a written statement Mr Berry 'utterly rejected' the findings of the report by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors. He said their contention that he had acted in a way which made him unfit to be a director was 'unjustified, unfair and untrue'. Mr Berry is chairman of Business Technology Group, an office equipment company; non-executive vice-chairman of Tottenham Hotspur Football Club; and a non-executive director of Profitbuilder, a business expansion scheme. He is also vice-chairman-elect of Tottenham Hotspur plc. There is no appeal against the findings of DTI inspectors. Mr Berry could seek a judicial review of the report, but that would be expensive and is an option he has already rejected. Instead, he intends to use the DTI's application to have him disqualified to put his case against the findings. The case may never reach open court. Most disqualification cases are conducted by submission of written evidence with occasional hearings in the judge's chambers. The process can be long. For example, the application to disqualify Sir Edward Du Cann and six other former directors of Homes Assured, the collapsed financial services company, was made in August last year but has still not been resolved. Under the 1986 Act a director can be disqualified for general misconduct, persistent breaches of company legislation, fraud, wrongful trading or for unfitness generally. If the DTI's application is successful Mr Berry could face disqualification for up to 15 years, though such a severe penalty is unlikely. In cases dealt with by the courts since the act was passed, 88 per cent of disqualification orders have been for five years or less. There is a minimum disqualification period of two years. Penalties of between 10 years and 15 years are imposed only in particularly serious cases, for example where a director has been disqualified for a second time. The DTI says 2,162 directors have been disqualified following a company insolvency or a DTI inquiry since 1980 and more than 1,300 since the 1986 Act was passed. The rate of disqualifications has risen sharply during the recession as more companies go to the wall. At the end of June there were court proceedings in progress against 12 directors, stemming from 14 DTI investigations. Once a disqualification order has been made the person concerned is prevented from acting as a director of any company. In Mr Berry's case this would mean he would be prevented from taking any part in the management of the three companies in which he holds directorships. Observer, Page 17</p>

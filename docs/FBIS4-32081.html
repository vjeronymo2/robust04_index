			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "dz": "Czech Losses Resulting from the </F> Occupation of Kuwait"]    [Text] Prague--The Czech Republic estimates the level of  its losses caused by the military invasion and the subsequent  occupation of Kuwait by Iraq at $385 million and has submitted  the relevant documentation to the UN Commission for  Compensations. A total of 19 Czech organizations have filed  claims for $333 million. Most of the damage results from unpaid  deliveries and projects. The largest claim, for $108 million,  comes from Technoexport Prague a.s. Other claimants include,  for example, the Zetor Brno state enterprise and Strojexport  Prague, which claim $90 million each. The list of claims  submitted to the UN Commission also includes the Finance  Ministry's claim for $52 million. The Czech ministry (and its  federal predecessor) has paid this sum to Czech organizations in  order to alleviate their losses. Most of this sum was used to  pay interest on loans for claims "frozen" in Iraq, Miroslav  Havel, director of the State Budget Section at the Ministry of  Finance, told HOSPODARSKE NOVINY. Money for this purpose will  also be allocated from the state budget's contingency reserves  this year. Within the framework of the Czech Republic's overall  claims, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs demands compensation of  $11,000 for losses incurred by the former Federal Ministry of  Foreign Affairs during the evacuation of its staff or due to the  loss of some embassy property. In the opinion of M. Havel, the  compensation for damage by the UN will be a protracted affair  with an uncertain outcome.</p>

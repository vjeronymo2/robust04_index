			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Separate votes heighten uncertainty over treaty - Not once but twice MPs will tonight stream through the lobbies then crowd into the Commons chamber to hear the result of the social chapter vote. Though they will be voting on the same issue, the two separate votes mean that by the end of this evening the Commons could have reached any one of four decisions What is the first vote? MPs will vote first on Labour's amendment to the government motion. This would say that the government should not ratify the Maastricht treaty until it has committed itself to the social chapter. What happens if it is passed? MPs decide whether to approve the motion as amended. Normally this is a formality. But with Maastricht nothing is simple and the Euro-sceptics threaten to force a vote, even if the government reckons that one defeat is enough and abstains at this point. What happens if the motion as amended by Labour is passed? Labour insists it would force the government to accept the social chapter. Privately, ministers say that the government could press ahead to ratify the treaty as signed, perhaps after a further debate. Whatever its legal force a defeat would mean a motion of confidence in - or censure of - the government early next week. Although that debate too would be dominated by the social chapter, all sides expect the government would win the vote. What happens if Labour's amendment is defeated? Ministers breathe a sigh of relief. But there is still a second vote, on whether MPs approve the original motion, which merely notes the social chapter. But if the government defeats the opposition and the rebels on the first vote, surely it will do the same on the second? Not necessarily. Some Euro-sceptics see their best chance in frustrating ratification in the 'limbo' or 'stalemate' scenario, in which having rejected the amendment the Commons rejects the motion as well. The Maastricht Act requires both Commons and Lords to have come to resolutions on the social chapter before it comes into force. Since rejecting a motion is not coming to a resolution on the social chapter as the legislation requires, the act cannot take effect. Unless it does, the UK cannot ratify the treaty. Would that mean that the Maastricht treaty was dead because the UK could not ratify? No, but it would mean that a further debate, in which MPs did accept a motion - any motion - on the social chapter, would be needed before the UK could ratify. Hardened rebels say that another debate would simply be a repeat performance leading to a further government defeat. But it is difficult to believe that the government would not win a later debate, perhaps with help from the minor parties. Does that mean that if MPs approve the Labour amendment but vote down the motion as amended, then the same applies? Yes. For the stalemate scenario to work it does not matter whether it is the original or amended motion that MPs reject in the second vote. So the only way to be certain that this is the last parliamentary debate on Maastricht and the social chapter is for the government to win both votes tonight? Yes. It could be the government's most powerful argument.</p>

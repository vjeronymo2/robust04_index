			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Equity Markets: Other markets - Hong Kong Investors will be keeping a close watch on whether the benchmark Hang Seng index can remain above the 10,000 level, writes Louise Lucas. The psychological barrier was briefly pierced last Thursday in spite of China passing into law its decision to scrap the colony's democratic reforms on resuming control. However, there are few focal points to stimulate a renewed attack on the 10,000 level: corporate reporting this week comes mainly from second and third liners, although Hopewell Holdings, the property and infrastructure company, posts its finals today. Investors will start to focus on the Jardine companies, whose interim results kick off next week. It is expected that an announcement will be made then on the fate of the remaining companies in the group following the delisting of parent Jardine Matheson and Jardine Strategic Holdings. Many analysts expect directors will announce that Dairy Farm, Hongkong Land, Mandarin Oriental and Jardine International Motor will follow suit, leaving a substantial hole in the 33-company Hang Seng index.

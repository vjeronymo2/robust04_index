			<p>BFN     [Text] Caracas, 15 Apr (EFE) -- Venezuelan Defense Minister  General Rafael Montero Revette said today he does not think "the  installation of foreign military forces will be accepted" in his  country; he was referring to the possibility the United States  could install a military base in Venezuela.    Montero told journalists the topic was discussed during a  meeting he had yesterday with General Barry McCaffrey, commander  in chief of the U.S. Southern Command.    Montero refused to comment on whether Colombia will permit  the installation of U.S. military forces in its territory.    "We cannot speculate on that, and I do not know if Colombia  will accept it," Montero said. He said, however, the Venezuelan  Armed Forces' position is contrary to a foreign military  presence in the country.    Montero said during his meeting with McCaffrey they  discussed  relations between both countries' Armed Forces and the  drug-trafficking problem.    Regarding President Cesar Gaviria's proposal of creating an  OAS multilateral military force, he said: "Each country is  sovereign, and we are not going to have a regional intervention  force; we do not favor creating a multilateral force."    Regarding the internal political situation, Montero said:  "Venezuela knows it wants peace and to overcome the present  economic crisis." He ruled out a possible new military uprising  if the government does not overcome the present crisis, contrary  to what Lieutenant Colonel Hugo Chavez, head of the 4 February  1992 coup attempt, has said.</p>

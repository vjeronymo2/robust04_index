			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Austrians and Swiss back EEA LEGISLATURES in Austria and Switzerland have endorsed joining the European Economic Area (EEA), paving the way for eventual full membership of an enlarged European Community. Switzerland's upper house yesterday voted in principle by 37 votes to two, following the backing of the lower house a month ago. Membership must be ratified in a national referendum on December 6. The EEA treaty was signed in Oporto, Portugal, in May by the 12 EC nations and the European Free Trade Association (Efta) members - Austria, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. By extending the EC rules on free flows of people, goods, capital and services to the Efta states, the treaty creates a single European market of 380m people, accounting for 43 per cent of world trade. In the Austrian National Assembly on Tuesday night the treaty was adopted by deputies of the ruling Social Democrats and the conservative People's party, which control 140 seats in the 183-seat assembly. The treaty must still be passed by the upper house, or Federal Assembly, and then signed by President Thomas Klestil for full ratification.</p>

			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL  </P> <P> O! Deli Plans: If a San Francisco-based deli chain has its way, Orange County  office workers will soon have a new alternative to ho-hum, brown-bag lunches.  </P> <P> O! Deli Corp. has big plans to add 25 franchise deli restaurants by 1993 in the  county's commercial buildings, industrial parks and business districts, company  executives said.  </P> <P> The idea behind the eateries is to cater to office workers who have just 45  minutes for lunch each day, said Joe Sanfellipo, president of O! Deli. To speed  up service, the company has developed a "Fax Food" menu. Order forms are left  with office workers, who can fill them out and fax them into the local O! Deli.  Orders are then picked up or delivered, Sanfellipo said.  </P> <P> So far, O! Deli has 18 outlets in five states -- California, Colorado,  Massachusetts, Florida and Pennsylvania.  </P> <P> By expanding through franchisees, Sanfellipo said, the company hopes to have  six county sites up and running within a year. After that, "we think the Orange  County market will hold 40 to 50 locations, but realistically, we're probably  looking at 25" within three years, Sanfellipo said.  </P></p>

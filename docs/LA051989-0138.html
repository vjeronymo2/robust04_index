			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME NORTHROP WORKERS RESIGNED TO THE INEVITABILITY OF FIRM'S SALE  </P> <P> One day after the chairman of Northrop Corp. strongly suggested that the  company's Anaheim facility would be sold, some employees there seemed resigned  on Thursday to the idea that their jobs are in jeopardy.  </P> <P> "We've known it (a sale) has been in the works for the last year," said Mike  Girgis, an engineering support worker who lives in Irvine. "We just don't have  the final details of when and how."  </P> <P> Security guard Walt Rohling agreed. "There is no two ways about it," he said.  "The property is for sale."  </P> <P> While the potential sale was a subject of conversation among many workers,  others -- like a group of men outside Northrop's cafeteria -- said they were  continuing to focus on their work.  </P> <P> The 1,800 employees in Anaheim design and manufacture infrared and optical  sensors used by pilots and anti-aircraft missiles to shoot their targets. They  also manufacture equipment to test missiles.  </P> <P> In March, Northrop announced it would reduce its Anaheim work force by  transferring 400 engineers and their support staff to a sister facility in  Hawthorne. At the annual shareholders' meeting Wednesday in Los Angeles, Jones  said the company would trim its national work force by 2,500 to 3,000 people by  the end of the year. In response to a question, Jones said the company will  sell any properties that are not useful. "Certainly Anaheim is one of those,"  Jones said.  </P> <P> After Jones made his comments, a Northrop spokesman said no final decision had  been made on whether to sell the Orange County facility.  </P> <P> But some analysts believe that the company will sell the Anaheim facility soon.  </P> <P> Northrop has refused to comment on the extent of any layoffs that would  accompany a sale but has said any job losses would be included in the 2,500 to  3,000 planned job cuts. The company said it hoped to achieve most of the  planned cuts through normal attrition.  </P> <P> Several workers interviewed said they preferred to remain in Orange County  rather than transfer to another facility, such as Hawthorne.  </P> <P> "The drive between here and Hawthorne is very difficult," said Girgis.  </P> <P> The giant aerospace company is experiencing problems because of technical  complications that have caused delays and funding cutbacks that have lowered  production. The company has endured declining revenue and profits on many of  its projects.  </P> <P> Revenue in Northrop's electronics business -- which includes both the Anaheim  and Hawthorne plants -- has declined 13% from 1986 to 1988 to $1.1 billion;  operating profit plummeted 61% to $39 million.  </P></p>

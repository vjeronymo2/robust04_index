			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: French test The foreign exchange market always promised itself some sport around the French election. It seems reluctant to forgo the opportunity even though the result should not make a great deal of difference to policy. In opposition the right was committed to a strong franc. Only after the second round next week will the final shape of the new government be known and the real test of that conviction begin. In the meantime there is little chance of the outgoing administration giving way. To desert the ERM as one of its last actions in office would be to drink from the poisoned chalice. It would surely rather hand it on. Nonetheless it may now require a vicious squeeze on short-term rates to discourage speculators from selling the franc short. Its vulnerability is clear. The new government may want to establish its European credentials, but it also has to tackle unemployment - and that requires much lower interest rates. An agreement on closer monetary co-operation with Germany might help but it is difficult to conceive of one that will convince the markets without infringing national sovereignties. The guilder's special relationship with the D-Mark is purely voluntary. It works because the guilder is a small currency that can be easily manipulated and has a stronger track record than even the franc. If the new government proves its determination, short-term rates might fall quite quickly to the German level. But real rates would even then be positive by an unsustainable 6 per cent. French exchange rate policy would be much more plausible if the Bundesbank helped by cutting rates more quickly. So far it has been too grudging for comfort. The repurchase rate it sets this week will matter more to the future of the ERM than the poll result in France.</p>

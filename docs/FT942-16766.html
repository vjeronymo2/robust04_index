			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: British Rail costly by contrast Sir, Plus ca change. British Rail wants to make us pay 44p a minute for finding out when its trains run ('Inquiries about trains may move to premium phone rate', April 5). Amtrak, its US equivalent, offers customers a toll-free 1-800 number, which not only provides timetable information but also allows you to book tickets and reserve seats.

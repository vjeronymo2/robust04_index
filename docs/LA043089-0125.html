			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: DENTAL PLAN HALTED  </P> <P> Orange County "credit dentist" Dr. Robert F. Beauchamp has stopped plans to  lease most of Ventura Harbor's financially troubled retail area, saying the  price is too high.  </P> <P> Bank of America, the largest creditor of Ventura Harbor Village, says the  100-business center owes $10 million, which must be paid before another  operator can take over. The previous operators declared bankruptcy in 1987.  </P> <P> Beauchamp Enterprises and the Ventura Port District have estimated the debt of  the village at $6.5 million to $8 million. Beauchamp Enterprises, which  operates two commercial marinas with 560 slips at Ventura Harbor and has assets  estimated at $500 million, said it would reconsider if the bank lowered its  demands.  </P></p>

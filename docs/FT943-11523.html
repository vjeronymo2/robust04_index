			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Dow Chemical has best quarter for three years Dow Chemical turned in its best results for three years in the second quarter, despite a 3 per cent slide, on average, in the prices of its products. Mr Enrique Falla, executive vice-president, predicted that prices would rise for many of the company's basic and specialty chemicals and plastics, due to supply constraints in the industry. This, and improvements in productivity, would lead to further earnings growth this year, he said. Operating earnings of Dollars 602m were 17 per cent higher than a year before (excluding one-off items in the year-ago period). This was achieved on the back of sales of Dollars 4.9bn, up 2 per cent from the second quarter of 1993, despite the lower prices. The bulk of the earnings gain came in the company's plastics operations, which saw a 6 per cent increase in sales, to Dollars 1.8bn. Dow pointed to volume growth around the world, as well as higher polyolefin prices in North America and polystrene prices in Europe. Operating income from plastics more than doubled, to Dollars 247m. The chemicals segment, on the other hand, suffered from lower caustic soda prices, which pushed operating income down 12 per cent to Dollars 97m, on sales of Dollars 1bn. Dow said it expected 'significant improvements' in caustic soda prices by early next year. Underlying operating earnings also fell in the consumer specialities businesses, as the majority-owned drugs company Marion Merrell Dow saw a shift in sales to lower-margin products. Excluding a Dollars 180m charge in the 1993 quarter, operating income was down 16 per cent at Dollars 288m, on unchanged sales of Dollars 1.6bn. Net income for the period of Dollars 602m, or 91 cents a share, compared with Dollars 388m, or 54 cents (75 cents a share before one-off items), the year before For the half-year as a whole, net income was Dollars 421m, compared with Dollars 548m in the first six months of 1993, though the earlier period was buoyed by pre-tax gains on asset sales of Dollars 502m.</p>

While attempting to organize resistance to  the representative of power, Geliskhanov related, five of  Suleymenov's guards were disarmed along with him. And on that  same day, all six of them were taken to the Groznyy  investigative detention facility, where Suleymenov, representing  the republic procurator general, Sheripova, was accused of  "leading an illegal armed grouping on the territory of Chechnya."    A couple of days before his arrest, as we know from the  press  service representative under the Military Council of Field  Commanders of the Chechen Republic, Zambek Aliyev, Ibragim  Suleymenov had advanced a number of demands for the current  republic leaders, among which the first and most categorical was  for the retirement of President Dudayev and the application  against him of proceedings of the shariat or civil (the  accused's choice) court. Another condition of the former Chechen  parliamentarian was the return and distribution among the  republic's population of the monetary funds (about a billion  dollars) kept in foreign bank accounts and belonging, the  accused thinks, to the people of Chechnya.    Suleymenov is known to the authorities also from the events  of 16 December in Groznyy, when he, along with other field  commanders of the opposition armed forces, appeared in front of  the presidential palace and delivered an ultimatum, the edited  version of which differed considerably from the February  demands. During those days, official Groznyy gave the appearance  that it fully understood the patriotic feelings of the "youth"  (with whom the 45-year-old Suleymenov was included) who were  disturbed by the state of affairs in the republic. To a question  from a NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent to the chief of the  Department of the Press and Information of the Chechen Republic,  Movladi Udugov, as to why the accusation of "leadership of  illegal armed formations" was leveled against only one of the  so-called "field commanders" who were freely handling the armed  group (according to unofficial information, there are more than  a hundred of these "private" militarized formations in the  republic), the answer was that other such, for example, as  Shamil Basayev or Ruslan Gelayev, who fought at the Abkhazian  front in a special regiment under the president of Chechnya and  were "discovered" on 16 December in Suleymenov's company, have  quite legitimate grounds for being called commanders, since they  serve in the presidential regiment, which today the authorities  have put to work guarding facilities of the petroleum industry  complex.    A highly placed bureaucrat categorically denied the  information from the opposition press service regarding the  training maneuvers of the armed opposition begun in N rayon in  Chechnya on 4 February. It is Udugov's conviction that maneuvers  as such cannot take place, since the republic army and Ministry  of Internal Affairs are monitoring the situation, and  participation of combat helicopters in maneuvers, as the press  service under the Military Council of Field Commanders reported,  could not go unnoticed. At the same time, the Security Service  of Chechnya has almost no doubt that arms are being delivered to  Suleymenov and "his ilk" from the arsenals of Russia. The chief  of the Department of Press and Information of the Chechen  Republic, who is unfamiliar with the political situation of the  arrested commander, also denied the opposition's reproaches for  the organization by official Groznyy of a "slanderous campaign"  against Suleymenov which took place in republic mass media.  Suleymenov, the opposing side related in return, has nothing to  do with drug trafficking, which President Dudayev's supporters  are trying to pin on him, and he certainly is not known for  pro-Russian or pro-communist sympathies. The opposition, having  lost in Suleymenov one of the significant opponents to Dudayev's  regime, made a statement from which it can be clearly seen that  "twists" of the future fate of the president of Chechnya will be  determined by the measure of his prudence.    Moreover, on 10 February there began a census of the  population in the republic, whose purpose was to clarify "how  many Chechens live on earth" (Udugov). To do this, he said,  emissaries from Groznyy traveled to all continents of the globe.  But in the republic, M. Udugov noted, the census involves not  only Chechens but also citizens of other nationalities.  According to the observation of specialists of Chechnya, the  number of these people decreases by a factor of 1.5 to two with  each succeeding census, and the current authorities of Chechnya  intend to put an end to this vicious tendency.    To this end, Udugov explained, 23 February--the day of the  50th anniversary of the deportation of the Chechen people--will  be declared not a day of mourning but a nationwide celebration  of rebirth. The 23d will coincide with the opening in Groznyy of  a memorial complex composed of the tombstones defiled during the  years of Soviet power in Chechnya. On that same day there will  be a demonstration of the new military uniform of the Chechen  Army, and the possibility of a festive military parade cannot be  ruled out.    The unification of the Chechens and other peoples of the  Northern Caucasus was the subject of a conference in Istanbul  (Turkey) in which representatives of Chechnya participated as  well. Participants in the meeting, who were protected by the  Turkish authorities (among those present were the chairman of  the Supreme Soviet of Dagestan, the vice president of Kalmykia,  the heads of the Cherkess and Chechen community, and according  to certain information, a representative from Georgia also  visited Turkey as an observer) opened in Istanbul a "Caucasian  Mission" whose elected president is a citizen of the Chechen  Republic, the businessman Akhmet Khildekharoyev, who is the  official representative of Chechnya in Turkey. The purpose of  the meeting, in Udugov's words, was to strengthen the ties of  the Caucasian peoples of Russia and the republics of  Transcaucasia with Turkey.</p>

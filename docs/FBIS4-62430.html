			<p>BFN     [Text] Talking to newsmen in Simferopol, the chairman of  the Crimean Supreme Soviet Sergey [Serhiy] Tsekov refused to  believe that the Ukrainian parliament would kill Crimean  autonomy. Tsekov felt there were a sufficient number of  sober-minded individuals among the Ukrainian lawmakers and they  were knowledgeable about the Crimean problems. If, however, the  Ukrainian parliament moved to kill Crimean autonomy, Tsekov  said, the peninsula would break off all relations with Kiev.    And moves to sever relations were not likely to be peaceful,  he said.    According to Tsekov, Leonid Kravchuk could play up the  Crimean problem to win support in Ukraine's western provinces.    First of all, Tsekov said, the Crimean parliament must  concentrate efforts on independent statehood, and then -- on the  restoration of unity with Russia. That was what the lawmakers  called for before they were elected, Tsekov said, and they had  to meet their electoral pledges.    In Tsekov's view, the first thing the parliament must do,  was  to restore the Constitution of May 6, 1992 which said Crimea's  relations with Ukraine were limited to the treaty on bilateral  relations.    Next, Tsekov said, the peninsula's executive and legislative  branches would have to send a joint mission to Kiev. The  mission would try to convince the Ukrainian leaders of the need  to address the Crimean problem.    According to Tsekov, the Constitution of May 6, 1992 could  be  restored in a matter of two weeks, after a discussion by  parliament.    Tsekov said Crimea would first sign a treaty of economic  union with Moscow, and treaties on a political and military  union would soon follow one after the other.    A treaty on a military and political union could, however,  be  signed between Russia, on the one hand, and Crimea and Ukraine,  on the other. In Tsekov's view, Kiev would sooner or later come  to realize the necessity of building a union, if not a  confederation or federation, with Russia.    The territorial integrity of the Republic of Crimea must be  insured in the context of the Commonwealth's Collective Security  Treaty but, Tsekov said, Crimea must have its own Guards.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Water companies 'sold too cheaply' THE water privatisation, which raised Pounds 3.6bn in December 1989, short-changed the taxpayer mainly because it was carried out too quickly, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said yesterday. 'There is no question that the companies were sold far too cheaply,' said Mr Robert Sheldon, chairman of the PAC, the select committee which scrutinises use of taxpayers' money. 'The speed of the privatisation conveyor belt means they ended up being flogged like over-ripe oranges on a Saturday night.' The PAC report does not quantify the cost it judges the taxpayer suffered, but points out that the market value of the 10 water companies of England and Wales has steadily been higher than the flotation value of Pounds 5.2bn. Their combined value is now Pounds 9.3bn, a rise of 79 per cent. The solution it recommends is to sell tranches of a large company in phases, and small companies individually, not in a pack. The report, incorporating evidence and recommendations from a National Audit Office report in February, also criticises the level of fees paid to merchant banks and consultants by the Department of the Environment, which was in charge of the sale. Evidence given to the committee revealed that the final bill of Pounds 8.4m  -paid to Deloitte Haskin &amp; Sells, the accountants, and Binney and Partners, engineering consultants - had soared from an original estimate of Pounds 3m. The report adds: 'We are concerned that additional payments were made where there was not a clear obligation to do so.' In evidence to the committee, the environment department said its payments of a Pounds 2m completion fee to Schroders, the merchant bank, and a completion bonus of Pounds 200,000 to Dewe Rogerson, the public relations company, were justified by the success of the flotation. In future, the responsibility for selling companies and for regulating them should be split between different government departments, the PAC report concludes. The Treasury will publish a formal response to the report on behalf of all government departments in several months. Committee of Public Accounts. Seventh Report.

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar recovers against DM THE US dollar staged a come back from recent lows against the the D-Mark yesterday while the German currency was weaker in Europe as technical positions were adjusted, writes Peter John. The dollar's revival began in New York on Monday, continued in the Far East and endured through European trading hours yesterday. However, most dealers were at a loss to find any substance behind the move. There was a general acceptance that the dollar had reached a support level which prompted investors to take their profits and buy back the US currency. The correction began with the Japanese yen against which the dollar fell to around Y105 a fortnight ago. On Monday it moved back to the mid-Y107 level but was unable to break through Y107.50, seen as a significant chart level. It slipped to Y107.05 to the yen from Y107.45 yesterday as the rally shifted to Europe. It rose to DM1.6440 at best against the D-Mark, just below the top of a recent trading range which begins at DM1.5880. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency analyst at UBS, said: 'Once DM1.5940 was tested, the tenor of the market changed. There is a feeling that the gloom has been overdone. The fundamentals are pointing to a stronger dollar, particularly in the light of speculation of lower rates in Europe.' The dollar closed a pfennig higher in Europe against the German currency at DM1.6370. It was also stronger against sterling for much of the day hitting Dollars 1.4830 to the pound before rallying in the afternoon to close at Dollars 1.4920, still up from Dollars 1.4980 previously. Analysts will be scrutinising the UK retail sales figure for September this morning as the market becomes increasingly obsessed with signals that UK interest rates might soon fall. The D-Mark had benefited from hedging against lower interest rates in Belgium and France last week and slipped yesterday as dealers pocketed profits from the sharp shifts in the European currencies. The German Bundesbank will hold its weekly repurchase agreement today and there is a feeling that the central bank could allow its variable lending rate to slip by some 5 basis points to 6.65 per cent. While not significant in itself a lower repo might pave the way for a cut in key rates depending on M3 money supply data this week. The D-Mark slipped to BFr21.82 from BFr21.88 against the Belgian franc ahead of the release of details of Belgium's social pact on wages and jobs late yesterday. It was also weaker against the Italian lira. Dealers said that foreign investors had been buying Italian equities without hedging against further falls in the currency because the lira had reached a recent low and that had helped the currency's recovery. The D-Mark fell to L973.80 from L975.80. Against the French franc, the D-Mark slipped to FFr3.5320 from FFr3.5350.</p>

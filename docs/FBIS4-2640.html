			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Does China Want Advice or an Echo?"] </F>   [Text] Those with a taste for irony cannot help but notice  that China has given an official advisory role to a quarter of  the members of the Legislative Council [Legco]: A body it  publicly disdains.    Yesterday, China announced the names of another batch of  advisers on Hong Kong affairs, including a number of Legco  members. Also, as expected, Beijing has appointed a couple of  prominent liberals, in a significant gesture intended to enhance  the credibility of the new group and to help split the  pro-democracy camp.    We would like to believe China's motivation is less cynical  and more straightforward than the announcement suggests. In  other words, that the Chinese government was keen to appoint a  wider spectrum of members and therefore receive a broader range  of local opinion.    This view would be sustainable if China had enrolled  political leaders who secured the highest numbers of votes in  past elections. Instead, Beijing has opted for a clutch of  politicians who have never stood for office or have done so and  been rejected by the electorate.    There is one significant exception to this general rule of  Chinese appointments: Elsie Tu. Tu is undeniably a popular  politician, who made her reputation as a champion of the  underdog and as someone who was fearless in standing up to the  authorities.    Idealists may believe China is soliciting Tu's advice  because  the government in Beijing is keen to have an outspoken  campaigner hammering away from inside.    Realists are more likely to conclude that Tu has been  appointed as a reward for her unflinching opposition to Governor  Patten's democratic reform plans.    Here is the rub. China's appointments appear to have been  made on the basis of reward for services rendered. In this case  the service of opposing the reform proposals.    The appointment of Frederick Fung, the leader of the  Association for Democracy and People's Livelihood and Anthony  Cheung, a Meeting Point leader, appears to be even more  cynically motivated. China has rightly identified the weak  links in the democracy camp's chain and has employed a tactic  frequently used by the rulers of the British Empire at the  height of their powers.    The divide-and-rule tactic was a hallmark of British  colonial  policy. Chinese leaders seem to have been studying these  methods and concluded that one of the best ways of weakening the  democracy camp was to pick off those most likely to wobble when  pushed.    Having started with the appointment of advisers who were  either very rich, very loyal to China or very adept at changing  sides, the government in Beijing has grown wise and realised  appearances are important.    Thus, this third batch gives every appearance of creating  balance. The clutch of liberals are joined by a number of  establishment politicians and some respected professionals.    Yet, are there any signs the Chinese government really wants  to receive Hong Kong advice from a genuine cross-section of the  community? China stoutly refuses to contemplate talking to  members of the United Democrats, the territory's largest  political party. This is in sharp contrast to its willingness  for dialogue with the Kuomintang -- the Communist Party's bitter  rival in the civil war. Aside from the United Democrats, there  is a large pool of people who have become involved in politics  and shown their ability to understand the issues facing Hong  Kong. There also are a great many genuinely independent  personalities who would have much to offer an advisory body; not  the least because they would provide blunt advice, however  unpalatable.    China should know some of the best advice comes not from  friends, nor from sycophants who are anxious to please, but from  impartial sources or even enemies.    The latter have an uncanny knack of zeroing in on weaknesses  which more sympathetic parties might be inclined to overlook.    Interestingly, however, some of China's most outspoken  advice  has come from some of its oldest Hong Kong allies, who clearly  feel secure enough to speak bluntly on occasion. Some of these  long-term supporters of China are firmly entrenched in  grassroots organisations which provide a good sounding board for  popular sentiment.    Hopefully, some of the newer advisers, appointed yesterday,  will seize this opportunity to treat their new position not as a  Chinese version of the British honours system, but as a serious  opportunity to keep China informed of Hong Kong sentiment.    China would do itself a favour if it was prepared to cast  the  net wider in searching for advice but, as this is unlikely, a  heavy burden of responsibility lies on those chosen to act as a  bridge to the new regime.    If they dodge that responsibility by simply mouthing lines  they believe their new masters want to hear, they will have much  to answer for.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 15 KYODO -- The Japanese economy  appears to be recovering but further watch is needed to see if  it can pick up strongly, Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno  said Wednesday [15 June].    "Assessing the most recent statistics, possibility is strong  that the economy has moved one step forward toward a recovery  from my recent assessment that it is showing signs of bottoming  out," Mieno told a regular press meeting in repeating his  earlier comments.    "But we must carefully watch the sustainability and tempo of  the recovery," he noted, refusing to say the 37-month recession  has hit a bottom.    Indicating uncertainty over the strength of the recovery,  Mieno stressed that bottom implies a strong V-shaped pickup.    Pressed by reporters to comment on downside risks, Mieno  said  he could not ignore them, but "I feel the economy is moving in a  good direction."    "That's why I said at the Diet (earlier this week) that a  further careful watch is needed to judge whether the economy has  moved two or three steps forward," Mieno said.    In his comments on Monday at the House of Councilors Budget  Committee, the central bank chief described the economy with the  word "recovery" for the first time since Japan suffered a  double-dip recession just a year ago after showing signs of  recovery.    The rosier assessment came after his bank's quarterly  "Tankan" business report for May released Friday with  improvements on a broad front for the first time in five years.    As positive factors indicated by the Tankan, Mieno cited  improvements in personal consumption, recovery of exports, and  optimistic projections in industrial output and corporate  earnings.    These bright spots stemmed from progress in inventory  adjustments and corporate restructuring efforts, and the  spreading effects of the latest macroeconomic measures, Mieno  noted.    But negative factors also prevail, he said, pointing in  particular to uncertain currency rates, the still-tough labor  and capital investment conditions, and increased competition  with other Asian nations.    Mieno declined to comment directly on recent market views  that the central bank has changed its monetary stance from loose  to neutral stance in the short-term money market.    "Our stance to decide on monetary policy based on the state  of the economy remains unchanged...And it now is to check  carefully the tempo and sustainability of the recovery."    On the recent rise in long-term market rates, he said  fluctuations are natural for market rates, and they will return  to levels reflecting the economic state in the longer run.    Considering recent global moves to regulate financial  derivatives, Mieno said financial authorities should pave the  way for the private sector to set up its own rules and enhance  the use of such "effective" risk-hedging tools.    The measures include improving statistics and disclosure to  grasp transactions, he said.    Central bankers from major nations shared this view when  they  gathered in London last week.    Concerns led by the United States are increasing over  financial derivatives, such as options and swaps, that their  off-balance transactions may cause unnecessary volatility.    In Japan, however, tough regulations exist over such  advanced  products, and financial authorities are instead worried about  losing international position.</p>

			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOGEBOOM IS AT HOME, CARDINALS WIN ON ROAD  </P> <P> Gary Hogeboom has found a home and the Phoenix Cardinals have found a  quarterback to replace Neil Lomax.  </P> <P> Hogeboom passed for four touchdowns, three to Roy Green, and led the Cardinals  to a 34-24 victory over the Seattle Seahawks Sunday.  </P> <P> "I don't know what my statistics were but I'm happy with them because we won,"  said Hogeboom, who gave much of the credit for his big day to receivers Green  and J.T. Smith.  </P> <P> "I don't think people can cover these guys man on man. They're so smart they  know the coverages and know the openings."  </P> <P> Hogeboom, who spent six seasons in Dallas and three in Indianapolis, had  touchdown passes of 59, 51 and six yards to Green, and 25 yards to Smith. He  completed 18 of 24 passes for 298 yards.  </P> <P> While Hogeboom wanted to share the spotlight, Cardinal Coach Gene Stallings  wanted to give his quarterback much of the credit for the Cardinals'  season-opening road wins in Detroit and Seattle.  </P> <P> "Gary moved the team up and down the field," Stallings said. "He's a heads-up  player."  </P> <P> Hogeboom lost starting jobs in Dallas and Indianapolis, but there wasn't  anybody to lose to in Phoenix after Lomax was placed on injured reserve for the  season with an arthritic hip.  </P> <P> Timm Rosenbach, a highly regarded quarterback prospect from Washington State,  held out and missed most of training camp.  </P> <P> The Cardinals also rushed for 171 yards and finished with 469 yards in total  offense.  </P> <P> Seattle's Dave Krieg passed for three touchdowns and 279 yards. He had scoring  passes of 17 and three yards to Paul Skansi, and five yards to Brian Blades.  Norm Johnson kicked a 39-yard field goal for the Seahawks.  </P> <P> But the Seahawks' running game was nullified in the second half when Phoenix  scored on their first possession of the third quarter for a 20-7 lead.  </P> <P> The same thing happened in Seattle's 31-7 loss in Philadelphia last week.  </P> <P> "What we needed to do was get ahead of these guys so we could go back to our  game plan," Krieg said when asked why the Seahawks abandoned their running game  after the Cardinals built their lead.  </P></p>

			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Violence mars Belgian victory over Morocco Last night's celebrations after Belgium's 1-0 victory over Morocco turned nasty in Brussels and elsewhere. One person was shot and wounded in the southern Belgian town of Verviers when fighting broke out between several hundred Belgian and Moroccan fans. Police said the wounded person was not in a serious condition and the situation was under control. In Brussels, where some of the 200,000 Moroccans residing in Belgium live, police said fighting broke out between rival supporters on the city's historic Grand'Place. Cars were damaged and some shop windows smashed in the centre of the capital. There were also incidents in Antwerp, Belgium's second-largest city. Belgian television said police arrested members of a right-wing extremist party accused by local residents of being responsible for the shooting. In the match in Orlando, Belgium secured victory thanks to an 11th minute goal by Anderlecht's Marc Degryse, but Morocco hit the crossbar in both halves. Later, Norway overcame tough Mexican opposition with an 85th minute goal from substitute Kjetil Rekdal in a Group E clash at the RFK Memorial Stadium in Washington. Moments before the finish Norway had a narrow escape when a Mexican effort hit the post and the rebound was headed onto the bar.</p>

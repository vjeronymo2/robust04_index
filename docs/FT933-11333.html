			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Japanese opposition names its candidate for PM MR Morihiro Hosokawa, leader of the reformist Japan New Party, is set to become the country's next prime minister, after a coalition of opposition parties pledged to support him. The Liberal Democratic party, which lost its majority in the July 18 election, now faces a spell in opposition for the first time since 1955. The immediate reaction to Mr Hosokawa's likely appointment was a 3.2 per cent jump in Tokyo stock prices. But Japanese bureaucrats expressed concern that such an unwieldy coalition would be unable to cope with trade friction or a sudden international crisis. Seven parties, ranging from the left-wing Social Democratic party to the conservative Japan Renewal party, have agreed to appoint a joint cabinet. Negotiations began yesterday for ministerial posts, which will be finalised after a parliamentary vote for prime minister. The vote is expected next Thursday. The parties released their first detailed policy statement, which gives priority to political reform, including a ban on corporate donations. However, it maintains most of the present economic and foreign policies, although it does hint that defence outlays could be cut and social welfare spending increased if the coalition presides over next year's budget. Meanwhile, the LDP will choose its prime ministerial candidate today at a party meeting which will have the choice of Mr Michio Watanabe, ailing former foreign minister and old-style politician, and Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary, who has promised to reform the party if selected. Unless the LDP can convince one of the coalition members to defect in the next few days, the party's candidate will lose in next week's parliamentary session, as the coalition can count on at least 245 votes to the LDP's 225. Business leaders, accustomed to dealing with the LDP, yesterday welcomed the expected appointment of Mr Hosokawa, the grandson of a Japanese wartime leader and member of a family which ruled parts of southern Japan during the feudal era. Mr Takeshi Nagano, president of the Federation of Employers' Associations, said the coalition might cause confusion after taking office because of policy differences among members.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> To the extent [a pipeline] provides to a marketing affiliate information related to transportation of natural gas, or information related to gas sales or gas marketing on its system or the system of an affiliated pipeline, it must provide that information contemporaneously to all potential shippers, affiliated and nonaffiliated, on its system. Pipelines are not required to contemporaneously disclose: (1) Gas sales or gas marketing information that is available from public sources and (2) Information related to gas sales or gas marketing off a pipeline's system, but not involving the system of an affiliated pipeline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In a related matter, based upon the court's advice, the Commission stated that it will not retroactively apply the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of standard (f) to released gas information, that is, standard (f)'s application to released gas information would begin with the issuance of Order No. 497&hyph;A.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the issue of Order No. 497's applicability to Ozark, the Commission found that despite the fact that there is a unanimous approval provision in the Ozark partnership agreement, the two partners that have parent companies with marketing affiliates shipping on Ozark's line can still exercise ``control'' as defined by &sect;161.2 of the Commission's regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission found that even with a unanimous approval provision in the partnership agreement, Ozark Pipeline Company and Tennessee Ozark Gas Company, the two partners whose parent companies have marketing affiliates, can each act alone to direct or effect the management or policies of Ozark Gas Transmission System. The Commission stated that since there is a unanimous approval requirement, each partner has veto power over any decision by simply withholding its vote. The Commission stated that such power could be exercised in a manner that could unduly prefer the marketing affiliates related to Ozark's partners, for example, by either or both partners refusing to engage in an action that would benefit an independent marketer in competition with one of Ozark's partners' affiliates. The Commission stated that it believed that control can be exercised in a negative manner,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by withholding approval of a specific policy or transaction, as well as in an affirmative manner,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  by actually approving a decision that would unduly prefer a marketing affiliate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 CFR 161.2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Commission extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992, until December 31, 1993, because of the important role they will play in the regulatory structure created by Order No. 636. The Commission stated that although Order No. 636 does not change the requirements governing the relationship between pipelines and their marketing affiliates, the structural changes engendered by full compliance with the rule would remove the need to continue filing the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) with the Commission. The Commission stated that Order No. 636's Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) requirements ensure certain minimum standards for maintaining and communicating information about a pipeline's available capacity, current capacity release offers, and affiliate marketing-related information. The order stated that unless further case-specific action is taken by the Commission, 90 days after the Commission has determined that a pipeline is in full compliance with the requirements of Order No. 636, that pipeline will not be required to submit Form 592 to the Commission. The order further stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and to provide its affiliated transportation log information on its EBB. Finally, the order stated, in practice, this means that pipelines remain subject to the standards of conduct and will continue to maintain the information mandated by Order Nos. 497 and 636, but will not be required to file Form 592 with the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On January 4, 1993, requests for rehearing were filed by the Indicated Parties (consisting of Conoco, Inc., Anadarko Petroleum Corp., Chevron U.S.A., Inc., and Texaco Inc.), Hadson Gas Systems, Inc. (Hadson), National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel), the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America (INGAA), ANR Pipeline Company and Colorado Interstate Gas Company (ANR and CIG), the Joint Parties (consisting of Williams Gas Marketing Company, Consolidated Natural Gas Company, Midcon Marketing Corp., and Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.), CNG Transmission Corporation (CNG), Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest), and Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark). Their requests are discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

The Revised Contemporaneous Disclosure Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Requests for Rehearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of pipelines (National Fuel, INGAA, ANR, CIG, Tenneco, CNG, and Northwest) and the Joint Parties assert that the Commission should eliminate from &sect;161.3(f) the requirement that sales and marketing information given to a marketing affiliate must be contemporaneously disclosed to all potential shippers because it is inconsistent with the court's decision in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Tenneco. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The pipelines and the Joint Parties contend that the revised standard provides a limited exclusion for sales and marketing information that is available from public sources or is related to off-system sales or marketing transactions not involving the system of an affiliated pipeline but there is no explanation in Order No. 497&hyph;D as to how so limited an exclusion can be interpreted as responsive to the court's remand. The pipelines and Joint Parties argue that the Commission's assumption that pipelines obtain sales and marketing information in connection with or when combined with transportation is not responsive to the court's directive to provide an independent justification for barring the exchange of sales or marketing information that is wholly unrelated to transportation information. The pipelines and the Joint Parties submit that Order No. 497&hyph;D evidences neither the independent justification required by the court, nor a consideration of the action on remand which was suggested by the court. The pipelines and the Joint Parties assert that the Commission has not examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made. They argue that the result is an arbitrary and capricious order which is unsupported by substantial evidence.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (14): Message of the Prophet - Universities In 1990 an oil spillage off the Atlantic coast threatened to cause great damage. King Fahd of Saudia Arabia offered King Hassan of Morocco Dollars 50m to help contain it. In the event, strong winds averted a catastrophe, writes Francis Ghiles. However, King Hassan used the money to realise a dream, creating a university inspired by the Anglo-Saxon education system instead of the French one, which governs all the other universities in Morocco. Four years later, a new campus has risen on the outskirts of Ifrane, a mountain station south of the old imperial city of Fez in Northern Morocco. The first students out of a total which will rise to 3,500 started to attend classes in September 1994. They are all post-graduates in three faculties - business administration, humanities and social sciences, sciences and engineering. It is a private university, where all students pay fees. Donations have enabled scholarships to be offered, as the king does not want the university to draw its students exclusively from the wealthy Moroccan bourgeoisie. 'Al Khawayn' (the two brothers) is a revolutionary concept for Morocco. It aims to renew its cultural past and is part of the king's aim of tying the country to Europe while promoting links between Arab states, Palestinians and Israel. The campus is built around a mosque, but boasts a synagogue and a church. The Moroccans have been advised by the Texas International Education Consortium, which regrouped the 32 state universities of Texas, on the curriculum. The degrees will be recognised in the US. The university has three research centres devoted to Islamic culture and the arts, natural resources and strategic studies. Researchers, drawn from all over the world, will form part of the teaching staff. The 'Al Khawayn' aims to encourage serious debate on Islamic values and how they relate to the modern world. Its success would show that Islam can modernise the message of the Prophet and avoid the narrow interpretation of the Koran promoted by many fundamentalist movements today.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Brother 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, former secretary  general of the [Yemeni] Socialist Party [and former South Yemeni  President] addressed a cable to the brother Presidential Council  chairman. Following is the text:    Your Excellency Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih, Presidential Council chairman, may God keep you.  [passage omitted]    We strongly believe that there is still motivation for  unity,  that there will be no future without unity, and that defeat is  awaiting all those who antagonize it, represented in the  tendencies that are opposed to unity and democracy.    We are fully confident that the unified state is the only  way  to confront every crisis and failure in any field. It is also  the sole way to deal with both large and small mistakes. It can  contain all negative results of this war and fighting between  brothers. The values of unity, democracy, and life will triumph  forever.    Unity is the cause of life and destiny for our people in  Yemen. It is the cause of generations and the future, and it is  not linked to individuals, therefore, we are confident that our  people will not allow the reversal of unity and the return to  the stage before 22 May 1990. [Word indistinct] their strong  and unwavering faith in unity as a source of strength and  dignity that concerns their future and development.    Finally, we assure you and our people of our principled and  firm support for Yemeni unity, democracy, and the ambitions of  our Yemeni people to realize their happy unionist society.    We wish your excellency continued good health and happiness,  and accept our sincerest greetings.    [Signed] Your brother President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Sluggish recovery in US economy Moderate increases in industrial production and housing starts, and a decline in building permits, yesterday offered further evidence of a sluggish recovery of the US economy, AP-DJ reports from Washington. Broad-based gains pushed industrial production up a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent in November, following a revised 0.5 per cent increase in October, the Federal Reserve said. The Commerce Department reported that housing starts rose by 1.5 per cent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.242m units in November. Building permits fell by 1.5 per cent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 1.122m units.</p>

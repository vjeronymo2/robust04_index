			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors ahead to Pounds 1.13m Dagenham Motors, the Ford and Iveco dealer, lifted interim profits by 11 per cent 'despite extremely adverse trading conditions' according to Mr David Philip, chairman. Profits for the first half of 1992 totalled Pounds 1.13m pre-tax, up from a comparable Pounds 1.01m. Turnover improved from Pounds 61.2m to Pounds 75.6m with the new dealerships at Enfield and Stevenage contributing Pounds 13m of the rise. The two outlets were the main factor behind a 20 per cent increase in vehicle sales. They should cover their funding costs and make a contribution to profits in the second half, Mr Philip said. The interim dividend is held at 1.75p, payable from earnings ahead from 4p to 4.4p per share.</p>

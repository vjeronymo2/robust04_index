			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Vauxhall profits strongly ahead despite recession VAUXHALL, the UK subsidiary of General Motors of the US, is understood to have increased its pre-tax profits by more than 40 per cent this year to around Pounds 190m, helped by record output from its two UK assembly plants. The higher profits, achieved in spite of recession in the UK, contrast with the financial performance of Ford of Britain, the UK market leader, which has fallen into loss in the second half. Vauxhall said yesterday it had: increased production of cars and light vans at its two assembly plants at Luton, Bedfordshire, and at Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, by 15.3 per cent this year to 302,047; increased its UK new car registrations by 7 per cent to around 266,000 in a market which it expected to have declined marginally to 1.587m from 1.592m; increased its share of the UK new car market to a record 16.8 per cent from 15.6 per cent; and raised productivity by 8 per cent with a fall in its workforce to 10,871 from 11,248 in spite of opening an engine plant at Ellesmere Port. Mr William Ebbert, Vauxhall chairman, warned that '1993 would bring the industry its greatest challenge to date'. He forecast increasing competition in the UK market, which was 'unlikely to show any real evidence of an upturn until the middle of the year'. At the same time new car demand was expected to weaken in continental European markets, which would hit UK exports. Vauxhall has said its Luton plant will work a four-day week in January to cut output. The company has cushioned the impact of recession by boosting exports of Opel-badged vehicles for sale by GM in its continental European markets. Vauxhall's exports, which accounted for 37 per cent of its UK vehicle output this year, rose by 7.1 per cent in 1992 to 111,796. Vauxhall's market share in the UK peaked previously at 16.6 per cent in 1985, while its vehicle output reached its previous peak in 1990 at 276,031. Renault, the state-controlled French motor company, suffered a sharp deterioration in the final quarter, said Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. He said Renault, which forecast profits of FFr6bn (Pounds 720m) for 1992, made pre-tax profits of FFr7.5bn in the first three quarters.</p>

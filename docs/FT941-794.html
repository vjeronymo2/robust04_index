			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Swedish doctors call off strikes The Swedish Medical Association last night called off a series of strikes that had hit hospital services in many parts of the country over the past three weeks following an agreement with the local authorities which control the state health service. The settlement was based on a two-year pay deal giving the doctors a 3 per cent pay rise, but subtracting two days of holiday. Another parallel dispute over the introduction of a new system for administering family doctors has been sidelined by a row in parliament which may halt the reform. Opposition to joining the EU has strengthened in Sweden since it signed the accession accord with Brussels. A poll for the business newspaper Dagens Industri showed opposition growing by two percentage points since February to 54 per cent, while support for membership slipped by the same margin to 46 per cent.</p>

			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Observer: Lasting supper Guess who's coming to dinner? The Tory party hierarchy has stepped up its campaign to persuade Lady Thatcher to keep her vow of silence during this week's Blackpool conference. Sir Norman Fowler is hosting a very private dinner for her on Wednesday evening. It should help to keep her in good humour for her appearance on the platform during Kenneth Clarke's speech on the economy the following morning. So who these days gets invited to such exclusive gatherings? Observer can reveal that Charles Hambro, Maurice Saatchi, John and Penny Gummer and Lady Wakeham have all accepted. But there are still one or two places going spare. Any suggestions?</p>

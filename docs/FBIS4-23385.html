			<p>BFN     [Text] Accra, June 3 (AFP) -- Ghana Friday [3 June] called  on the international community to help end the "carnage" in  Rwanda by putting pressure on the warring factions there, a  Foreign Ministry communique said here.    Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed Ibn Chambas told parliament  that the belligerents must accept "the full implementation of UN  resolutions" calling for a ceasefire in the two-month civil war.    Ghana along with Ethiopia, Nigeria, Senegal and Zimbabwe is  ready to send more peacekeeping troops to Rwanda, he said but  did not give an exact figure.    Ghana has already sent 321 troops to Rwanda as part of the  UN  Assistance Mission there.    Up to 500,000 people have died in the Rwandan civil war  since  April 6.</p>

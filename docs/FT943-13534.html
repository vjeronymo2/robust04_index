			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / UK Company News: OIS shares fall 18p on warning A profits warning by OIS International Inspection, which provides technical inspection services to the construction, petrochemical and power generation industries, knocked a third off the share price yesterday. Shares in OIS, which came to the market at the end of 1992 at 50p, closed 18p down at 36p. Mr James Mayne, chairman, said reduced margins and the loss of a number of contracts meant the company expected 'no better than a break-even position' on turnover of Pounds 19m when it reports interim results in September. Mr Mayne said the company had already acted to reduce overheads and achieve annual cost savings of more than Pounds 1m. He said the directors believed the steps being taken would 'result in a return to profitability in the second half of the year'. However, results for the 1994 year were likely to be significantly lower than last time when pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 2.21m on turnover of Pounds 46.7m. For the six months to June 30 1993 pre-tax profits were Pounds 1.44m on turnover of Pounds 24.2m. Mr Mayne said most of the company's operations had suffered from deferred contracts but that the losses had been most keenly felt in the Aberdeen and African locations. Shell, BP, British Gas and Nuclear Electric are among OIS's customers, while its overseas operations are concentrated in the Middle East, east Asia and Africa.</p>

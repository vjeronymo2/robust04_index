Technical information about the ammunition items, explosives, and weapon systems shall be considered so that the required safety measures may be engineered into the test plans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.176 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Operating precautions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Special safety precautions to be considered during SOP development: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Protection for percussion elements, i.e., primers, caps, etc., shall be provided in the design of equipment, transportation, and operations to protect them from accidental initiation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Cartridges and projectiles larger than 60mm, when hand carried, shall be handled one at a time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Fuzed projectiles shall not be handled by the fuzes alone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Powder charges shall be transported in closed containers to prevent accidental ignition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Only trained personnel shall perform operations on explosives-loaded ammunition components. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) No work, adjustment, or observation should be permitted on a weapon system that is loaded and ready for firing, except to check and adjust azimuth and elevation. In no case shall a lanyard be attached until the piece is ready to be fired. No one shall step over the lanyard once it is attached. On weapons equipped with safety locks, the lock may be released after the lanyard has been attached. In the case of small arms, the bolt shall be kept open at all times except where actually firing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Ammunition and explosives material, except inert components, shall not be delivered to machine shops or other locations not specifically designated for this work or modification without the approval by responsible contractor authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The premature or improper mixing of fuels and oxidizers, as associated with liquid propellants, shall be avoided. This applies particularly at test stands and test facilities when transferring liquid propellants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Remote control of mechanical devices shall replace manual activation whenever possible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j) Guns operated by remote control shall be equipped with cease fire devices for halting operations when a hazardous condition occurs. These devices shall be independent of the regular controls so operations can be stopped if the regular controls should fail. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.177 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Test hazards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Inert-loaded or minimum-charged ammunition should be used in lieu of explosives-loaded items when the test objectives are not affected. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) When temperature-conditioning rooms or boxes are utilized, the following shall apply: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Firings from temperature-controlled facilities shall be on an azimuth approved by the contractor's responsible representative. No weapon shall be fired in an enclosed area unless the muzzle is located outside the port opening. Destruction tests, excess pressure tests, and tests of classes of guns known to be unsafe (where the possibility of breech failures exists) shall be conducted with portable shields or equivalents placed on each side of the breech and with a protective plate to the rear of the mount, forming a barrier. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All equipment used in the temperature conditioning of explosives shall comply with Q/D requirements, unless in explosives buildings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Hot temperature conditioning equipment shall have dual, independent, automatic controls to prevent the desired testing temperature from being exceeded. Controls shall be designed to fail in the off position. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) No firing shall be permitted unless people in the area are under adequate cover. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;184.178 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Test clearance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

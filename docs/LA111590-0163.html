			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAYORS CALL FOR HALT TO BONELLI PARK PLANS  </P> <P> Mayors of four cities in the San Gabriel Valley on Wednesday called for the  county to scrap plans for more development at Frank G. Bonelli Regional Park.  </P> <P> The plan to further develop the 1,994-acre park calls for a 150-room lodge, an  80-unit cabin complex, and a restaurant in a hillside area west of Puddingstone  Reservoir. Raging Waters Inc., a private firm that leases property for its  theme park, plans to add 119 acres for more attractions and a parking  structure.  </P> <P> The plan is a scaled-down version of a development proposal offered by the  county in 1988, but the surrounding cities have complained that they were not  included in the planning effort.  </P> <P> "We're tired of fighting," San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple said at a news  conference in front of the Raging Waters entrance. "We've been fighting with  (County Supervisor Pete) Schabarum since this thing started. We want them to  scrap the (environmental impact) report and plans, and sit down with us."  Schabarum's district includes the San Gabriel Valley.  </P> <P> Mayors from Glendora, Covina and Pomona joined in seeking to maintain the  undeveloped part of the park in its natural setting.  </P> <P> "San Dimas already has three hotels," Dipple said. "We are not looking for an  economical benefit for the park. The almost 2,000 acres is the last remaining  natural area in Los Angeles County."  </P> <P> Concern about increased traffic has prompted Pomona to adopt several  resolutions opposing development in the park, said Mayor Donna Smith. Smith  said the county was "shoveling (the plans) down our throats, and we're tired of  it. We'd like to tell Pete (Schabarum), hell no." Smith said that "each time  the county needs a buck, it takes it from the cities, we're tired of being  bucked to death."  </P> <P> A forum on the park development expansion will be held tonight at 7 p.m. in the  San Dimas Community Building.  </P></p>

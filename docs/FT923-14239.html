			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / OECD forecasts French economy will grow 2% THE French economy has performed better than most of the world's leading industrial countries, but will only gradually return to a faster rate of growth, according to the latest annual report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). After last year's real growth in output of only 1 1/4 per cent, the OECD anticipates growth of about 2 per cent this year, followed by 2 1/2 per cent in 1993. The one aspect of the French economy which remains a black spot is the high level of unemployment, which has remained in the 9-10 per cent range for about eight years, 'one of the worst outcomes among OECD countries'. Since there is little or nothing the French government can do to hasten economic recovery in the short term, the Paris-based organisation urges it to stick more firmly to its established medium-term policy guidelines, notably its earlier trajectory of steadily declining budget deficits. For the past two years, the national budget has swung into unplanned levels of deficit as a result of the economic slowdown. Now that recovery lies ahead, says the OECD, the government should hold down spending increases below the level of GDP growth, especially on current expenditure, whereas capital spending should be maintained. The report rejects suggestions the government could hasten economic recovery by a monetary relaxation and a devaluation of the franc. It also rejects the argument that this would allow lower interest rates and faster export growth as a result of greater competitiveness. The credibility of the government's successful anti-inflation policy would be destroyed, and the risk premium embodied in long-term interest rates would almost certainly rise. 'A policy reversal would not be consistent with France's central role in the process of European economic and monetary integration; it would also discredit the whole European enterprise,' says the OECD. 'Given a continuation of prudent macro-economic policies, once the current slow-down in partner countries is overcome, there is every reason to believe that activity will pick up and unemployment will begin to ease, while disinflation resumes and competitiveness continues to improve'. To help deal with the structural problem of unemployment, especially among the young,the OECD recommends the balance of labour market policy should be shifted away from unemployment benefit and early retirement, towards more active training and job placement policies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Occupied Jerusalem--Quds Press--[passage  omitted] In its statement Hamas said: This statement is a  warning to the people. The statement starts with the Koranic  verse: "And they ill-treated them for no other reason than that  they believed in God, exalted in power, worthy of all praise."  SAWT AL-SHA'B publishes the text of the statement:    O brave men of Hebron. O the lions of Gaza. O the heroes of  Nabulus. O the guardians of al-Aqsa Mosque. O the knights of  Ramallah and Bethlehem. O the enduring masses in all our towns,  villages and camps. O the men, women, youth, and children.  Declare it a fresh revolution against the occupation. Cry out  Allah Akbar [God is great] and let these cries tear out the  hearts of the criminal Zionist occupiers. Let the hearts of the  malicious settlers tremble. Pursue the occupation soldiers and  attack the gangs of settlers and slay them wherever you catch  them for things have come to a head and all the deception has  been uncovered. [passage omitted condemning Hebron massacre]  Let the veil drop from the eyes of those who have illusions  about peace with the enemy. Let the symbols of capitulation --  those of Madrid, Oslo, Washington, and Cairo, who are crouching  in Tunis watching the wounds of our people and nation -- fall.  [passage omitted]    Be united and do not allow any traitor or people with weak  spirits to join your ranks. Censure the capitulationists and  defeatists, force them to abide by your hopes and aspirations,  and block the road between them and the enemy. Let the  demonstrations and mass rallies take to the streets. Engage  with the soldiers and the herds of settlers. Let the heroes  pursue the settlers and turn their settlements into jails and  let them shed the blood of the rancorous Zionists in the streets  of the settlements.    We in Hamas call for the following: [passage omitted]    On 11 March, the last Friday in Ramadan, we urge all our  people to travel to holy Jerusalem to perform the Friday prayer  at the al-Aqsa Mosque. We urge them to defy the occupation  authorities and the siege and curfew, and to perform the prayer,  even on the walls of the al-Aqsa Mosque if necessary.    On 'Id al-Fitr day, we urge the people to perform the 'Id  prayer outside mosques in open yards, in accordance with the  Prophet's teachings. We also urge them to visit the families of  the martyrs, wounded, and detainees and the patients, and to  help the poor and the needy.    On 14 March, we call for staging mass rallies, to be  attended  in particular by the families of the martyrs, wounded, and  detainees. We also urge the demonstrations to proceed to the  homes of the members of the negotiating team to urge them to  withdraw completely from the negotiations and to join the  resistance against occupation.    Allahu Akbar. Victory to our mujahid people.</p>

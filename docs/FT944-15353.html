			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / PM on defensive over sleaze claim The government was yesterday forced on to the defensive over allegations of 'sleaze' inside the Conservative party as opposition MPs pressed home claims that leading Tories were guilty of corruption. In the first prime minister's question time since the summer recess, Mr John Major issued a staunch defence of his predecessor, Baroness Thatcher, over suggestions that her son had received Pounds 12m in commissions from a 1980s arms deal. The prime minister told the Commons that Lady Thatcher had 'acted with complete propriety throughout her long and distinguished period as prime minister of this country'. He also called on Labour MPs to provide firm evidence of any impropriety by his predecessor, rather than 'peddling' speculative remarks. However, amid claims that Mr Mark Thatcher had been heavily involved in the Al Yamamah arms deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia, Labour MPs continued to call for further investigation. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, claimed in the Commons that Sir Clive Whitmore, the former permanent undersecretary at the Ministry of Defence, had told Lady Thatcher of his disquiet over the involvement of her son in the arms negotiations. Mr Nicholas Soames, armed forces minister, rejected the claim, saying: 'Sir Clive Whitmore has already denied the veracity of that story.' Labour MPs were also hoping that the Commons public accounts committee would launch an investigation into Mr Thatcher's involvement at a private meeting today. Yesterday, replying to a call from Mr Paul Tyler, a Liberal Democrat MP, for an assurance 'that your administration is now a sleaze-free zone,' Mr Major insisted: 'I am as concerned as any member in this House or any person in this country that we should have the highest standards in public life.' Mr Major later insisted that a report into allegations of insider share dealing against Lord Archer, the former Conservative party deputy chairman, should not be published. Responding to opposition demands for publication of the DTI inspectors' report, Mr Major said there was no legal provision for such a move.</p>

			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Lilley heads off move to cut child benefit MR Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has successfully resisted a move by the Treasury to restrict child benefit to those with earnings below the national average of Pounds 16,000 a year. The cabinet approved yesterday the main Whitehall budgets for the next three years, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, underlined his determination to limit the cost of the compensation package for value added tax on domestic fuel. In his last appearance before the November 30 Budget at Commons questions, Mr Clarke said the proposed package of measures to help the poor and elderly with higher fuel bills would offer 'some' help to 'some' people. Mr Clarke stressed repeatedly that the impact on heating costs of the planned imposition of VAT would be less than feared. He told MPs: 'I would point out there has been such a fall in gas and electricity prices during the 1980s that even with the tax imposed in full, fuel bills will be no higher than they were 10 years ago.' His comments came as the prime minister's office confirmed that the size and scope of the compensation package remains the subject of a fierce struggle between Mr Clarke and Mr Lilley. They also coincided with a renewed attack by Mr Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, on the government's refusal to make deeper cuts in public spending. Mr Lamont said that present policies would 'never' achieve his goal of reducing the proportion of national income spent by government from more than 45 per cent to less than 40 per cent. Speaking at a London conference, the Mr Lamont added that the government should raise health service charges and cut state contributions to social insurance. Downing Street said if the differences remain unresolved the dispute over compensation for VAT on fuel could go to full cabinet before the Budget. The size of the compensation package will depend also on whether the chancellor decided to introduce the new tax at the full 17.5 per cent next April rather than at 8 per cent as presently planned. Friends of Mr Lilley said he had fought off a demand from Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, to 'means-test' universal child benefit by imposing a cut-off point at the level of average earnings. Mr Lilley had argued that the Treasury scheme was arbitrary and impractical and broke the Conservatives' pledge in last year's general election manifesto to protect child benefit.</p>

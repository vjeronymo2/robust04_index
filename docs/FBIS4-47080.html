			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Japanese Ambassador Extraordinary and </F> Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Uzbekistan Ukeru Magosaki by  Gulom Mirzo; place and date of interview not given: "Ukeru  Magosaki: Our Cooperation Began in the Distant Past"]    [Text] In the second half of May Uzbek President Islam  Karimov made an official visit to Japan.    Uzbekistan devotes considerable attention to the problems of  developing diverse ties with Japan, which is considered to be  one of the most highly developed countries in the world. Japan  in turn considers our republic to be a state with which mutually  advantageous cooperation would be worthwhile. The history of  cultural ties between our peoples extends far into the past, but  diplomatic relations were not established between Japan and  independent Uzbekistan until early 1993. An embassy of this  country is now operating in Tashkent. On the eve of Islam  Karimov's visit to Tokyo, this UzA correspondent asked a number  of questions of Ukeru Magosaki, the Japanese ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the Republic of Uzbekistan.    [Mirzo] Mr. Ambassador, 7 June will be exactly a year from  the time that you presented your credentials to the president of  our republic. What work has been done since then to develop  cooperation between our countries?    [Magosaki] What I find most gratifying is that talks are  proceeding successfully in a diversity directions. I'm referring  to visits by more than 20 delegations to Uzbekistan consisting  of specialists from different sectors of the Japanese economy,  and at long last, the official visit to be made to our country  by President Islam Karimov. Japan is preparing to receive him at  the highest level. Your methods of managing the economy are  highly valued by the Japanese. In particular, one of your  principles of establishing a market economy is that economic  reforms are initiated and implemented by the state. We ourselves  passed through this phase some time ago as well. We know from  our own experience that it is impossible to achieve positive  changes in the economy in the first stage without a plan and  without unified leadership.    [Mirzo] Please tell us briefly about the political changes  in  your country.    [Magosaki] Until recently there were two major parties of a  capitalist and a socialist orientation in Japan, which waged a  struggle for power. The end of the cold war had a positive  effect upon Japan's foreign and domestic policy. The struggle  between the two parties faded into the past. Our country is now  adhering to a new direction in domestic policy, one based on a  multiparty system. From this day forward the government is to be  headed by a unified coalition bringing together all parties in  the country. Of course, change in the composition of this  coalition is a fully natural phenomenon in the transitional  period. You are aware that Tsutomu Hata was recently elected  prime minister in place of Morihiro Hosakawa, who recently  retired. New ministers have been appointed. My hope is that the  newly formed government will work productively in behalf of  progress in our country, and to raise the welfare of our people.    [Mirzo] What is the new government's attitude toward states  of Central Asia, and particular toward development of relations  with Uzbekistan?    [Magosaki] Japan is perpetually concerned with problems of  mutual relations with Central Asian states. Our prime minister  understands well the significance of Central Asian states  because, among other things, he had worked previously in the  office of foreign affairs minister. The fact that our new  government made its first official invitation to the president  of Uzbekistan, Mr. Islam Karimov, is clear evidence of this.    [Mirzo] What can you say about the forthcoming visit by the  head of Uzbekistan to Japan?    [Magosaki] The visit to Japan by the leader of your republic  will doubtlessly open up new possibilities for industrialists,  bankers, and businessmen of our country. We anticipate signing  of intergovernment documents in a number of areas of bilateral  cooperation. During his visit President Islam Karimov will  conduct talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, and he will be  received by Emperor Akihito. In Japan, Mr. Islam Karimov is  known not only as the president of the Uzbek Republic but also  as one of the region's major political figures. We are very  interested in the opinion of your country's president regarding  the current situation in Central Asia, Uzbekistan's mutual  relations with Russia, the situation in Tajikistan and  Afghanistan, and Islamic fundamentalism. Consequently the  Japanese are impatiently waiting to meet Islam Karimov as an  authoritative and experience politician capable of objectively  assessing the situation.    [Mirzo] Mr. Ambassador, our compatriots have a rather full  understanding of your country and its people. But what do  Japanese know about Uzbekistan, about Uzbeks?    [Magosaki] As you yourself said, our diplomatic relations  were established around a year ago. However, the knots of  cooperation between Japan and your country were tied back in the  7th and 8th centuries. Friendly ties between our peoples were  established in that distant past through the Great Silk Route.  It is no surprise that during his trip to Japan Islam Karimov  will visit our emperor's personal museum, which contains unique  articles associated with the Great Silk Route, and ancient  relics left to us by your ancestors. Uzbeks are known in Japan  as an ancient people whose roots extend deep into the past, as a  people with a great future.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Benjamin Yeh] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 11 (CNA) -- The Taiwan High Court on  Wednesday [11 May] upheld the nine-year jail term meted out to  Shih Yuebo by the Taipei District Court earlier this year for  hijacking a passenger airliner from Mainland China to Taiwan on  Aug. 10.    Shih pled not guilty, claiming he hijacked the plane to seek  political asylum mere.    Shih, 30, of Hebei Province, forced the Air China Boeing  767,  which was en route from Beijing to Indonesia, to land in Taiwan  after he threatened the crew with what he said was a bomb but  that later turned out to be sulfuric acid in a bottle.    Nobody was injured during the incident, the third of 11  hijackings of mainland Chinese planes to Taiwan last year.</p>

			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL DIVISION ON CAMPUSES SADLY MIRRORS THE 'REAL WORLD';  </P> <P> UNIVERSITIES: THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF SEPARATION, A SORRY LACK OF COMMON  GROUND WHERE PEOPLE CAN TALK ABOUT RACE.  </P> <P> The man was talking about what he calls the "re-segregation" of American life.  He was a veteran of the civil-rights movement, and went South as a student in  the '60s when whites and blacks fought American apartheid together.  </P> <P> The man went on to make his life in a Midwestern university, where he was my  guide one spring day. Indeed, he taught about race in America until he felt  discredited on account of his skin color -- white -- and went into  administration.  </P> <P> Walking me into the student union, he said: "Look." The tables in front of me  were nearly as segregated as a lunch counter in the Alabama of the 1960s. There  was just one table where black and white undergraduates ate in noisy  camaraderie. They, my guide explained, were members of the varsity team.  </P> <P> Pausing, he counted on one hand the number of places where blacks and whites  interact on his campus these days: in sports, in the arts or, he added  ironically, in race-relations class.  </P> <P> I brought this story home to a woman who disputed only the term  "re-segregation." We never desegregated, she says. An academic and a black, she  knows very few people who ever had social lives that easily transversed the  color lines.  </P> <P> As a mother, she sees her grade-school kids with friends of all hues, but her  college students subdivided by skin color. So she also wonders when it happens  and why. Many of her black students believe they can integrate only on white  terms and turf. Many of her white students feel unwelcomed by blacks. Many feel  unwelcoming.  </P> <P> Who was defensive and who was racist and who was just uncomfortable? And why  this great silence today between blacks and whites about race relations in  America?  </P> <P> Both of these academics, now enjoying the summer that is their chief  professional perk, can cite incidents over the past year. Graffiti, hostility,  tension. Yet they would agree that these are by no means the worst days on  campus or the worst years. They remember the KKK, Mississippi, legal  segregation.  </P> <P> But they also know that nearly every campus holds a volatile mix of attitudes  that in no way resembles a melting pot. In some places, whites believe that  their black classmates were admitted because of their race. In others, blacks  believe that whites believe that.  </P> <P> On many universities, the black search for identity -- their own place on a  white campus -- can end up fusing blackness with victimization. In many  universities, white classmates resent the racist label brushing them  indiscriminately.  </P> <P> Neither of my guides believes that campuses are unique in their sharp  segregations. Quite the opposite is true, they say. Look around the office.  Look around town.  </P> <P> In Washington, it is still almost impossible for blacks and whites to talk  about the trial of Mayor Marion Barry. To most whites in the nation's capital,  the case was about the mayor and his alleged use of drugs. To most blacks the  case was about the entrapment of a black leader.  </P> <P> Even in journalism, bylines often come color-coded. White journalists are  awkward writing about blacks, as if race were a qualification. Black  journalists are often required to write about "their own" and discredited for  it.  </P> <P> In our cities, there are neighborhoods as separated by race as ever in our  history. There are people who speak for the "black community" and the "white  community" as if their apartness were an accepted and permanent reality. But  universities have often thought of themselves as models, communities of  scholars. At best, they are expected to uphold their own values. At a minimum,  they are places where we are to think and talk deeply about what troubles the  "real world."  </P> <P> The universities are re-opening. They start each new year with a fresh  curriculum. But what troubles the real world as much as anything these days is  race relations. It's a problem that exists on a scale as large as a city. But  it can also be seen -- and changed -- on a scale as small as a dining-room  table.  </P></p>

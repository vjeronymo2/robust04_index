			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon go-ahead for stake disposal Shareholders of MB-Caradon, the building products and security printing group, yesterday gave the board general powers to sell the group's 25.3 per cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, the European packaging company. The authority runs until next year's AGM. Carnaud Metalbox shares rose 157p yesterday to Pounds 28.25p, and have risen from Pounds 26.13p since MB-Caradon announced last month that it would seek authority to sell. There is speculation that a buyer of the stake could bid for the whole of Carnaud Metalbox. MB-Caradon shares rose 4p to 325p yesterday. The value of its stake has increased from Pounds 536m to Pounds 580m since it announced the possible sale. The stake, which dates back to the merger of Metalbox Packaging and Carnaud in 1989, earns a poor return for MB-Caradon, bringing in a dividend of Pounds 7.8m in 1991.</p>

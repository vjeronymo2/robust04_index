			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the outgoing prime minister, the  government's experiences of the past four years will be very  much missed in the coming period. Speaking on the "Sunday  Newspaper" radio program, Peter Boross expressed the view that  the coalition now being formed is not unified. At the same  time, the outgoing head of government also stressed that it is  in interest both of the country and of the Hungarian Democratic  Forum that a successful government be created.    He said also that this year there was a turnabout in the  economy. Inflation and unemployment fell and productivity  improved. At the same time, he believes that a wrong assessment  was made at the beginning of the system change in the region  about how much time is needed for people to become more  satisfied with their lives. According to Peter Boross, this  requires 10-15 years.    The outgoing prime minister believes that a government which  does not take up the vital issues of Hungarians beyond the  borders and does not make a stand in their interest does not  deserve the trust of the Hungarian people.</p>

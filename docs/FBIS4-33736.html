			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (NA) -- Chilean Foreign Minister  Carlos Figueroa Serrano stressed on 8 June that his country "is  not reviewing" the possibility of resorting to international  arbitration over the Continental Glaciers issue while the treaty  is under discussion by the two countries' Congresses.    The Chilean foreign minister made this remark during a news  conference at Government House after a one-hour meeting with  President Carlos Menem and Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella.    During the meeting, which he described as "cordial and very  positive," Figueroa Serrano presented Menem with Chile's  proposal to join Mercosur [Common Market of the South] as an  "independent country." Mercosur is an integration process  involving Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, and Paraguay.    The visiting minister denied that during the meeting they  reviewed aspects of a ruling the Rio de Janeiro Arbitration  Court will have to issue within a few months on the Laguna del  Desierto border conflict.    Instead the Chilean foreign minister extensively discussed  the Continental Glaciers treaty and said his country "is not  reviewing" the possibility of resorting to international  arbitration.    Figueroa Serrano pointed out: "We have not discussed this  issue, despite the fact that it is a formula that was included  in the 1984 Peace and Friendship Treaty, because Chile's and  Argentina's position is that here there is a proposed treaty  that settles the Continental Glaciers border problem."    Figueroa Serrano added that this solution "seems to be fair  and compatible with the terms of the border treaties between  Chile and Argentina and this is under discussion by the  Congresses."    Figueroa Serrano emphasized: "We do not want to consider any  other alternative contemplated in the 1984 treaty while this  issue is under discussion by the two Congresses."    Figueroa added that during his meeting with Menem, "we  reviewed the relationship between the two countries and were  able to confirm the excellent level of our current relations."    Figueroa Serrano immediately emphasized the "very close  relationship" existing between President Carlos Menem and  President Eduardo Frei, who will have a chance to meet again in  mid-June during the Fourth Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena  [de Indias in Colombia] and, subsequently, on 25 and 26 August  during a new working visit that the Argentine president will pay  to Santiago.</p>

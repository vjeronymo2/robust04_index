			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Sharp rise in US June trade deficit THE US June trade deficit soared 44 per cent to Dollars 12.06bn (Pounds 8bn), the highest monthly shortfall in nearly six years, the Commerce Department said yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington. Imports rose 5.1 per cent from May to a record Dollars 49.7bn, while exports fell 3.3 per cent to Dollars 37.65bn. The resulting deficit was well above private economists' expectations of an Dollars 8.6bn deficit and the biggest since the Dollars 12.56bn gap for October 1987. Meanwhile, the US deficit with Japan climbed to Dollars 4.33bn from Dollars 3.75bn in May. President Bill Clinton's administration wants Japan to keep stimulating its economy so as to bring its trade into better balance by importing more. The Commerce Department slightly revised its estimate for May's total US trade deficit to Dollars 8.38bn from a previously announced Dollars 8.37bn. US trade with western Europe deteriorated to show a deficit of Dollars 1.70bn in June from a small surplus in May of Dollars 332m. Exports of US-made industrial supplies fell Dollars 826m to Dollars 8.85bn in June, while consumer goods exports fell Dollars 202m to Dollars 4.3bn. One of the few export bright spots was sales of civilian aircraft, which rose in value by Dollars 521m to Dollars 2.19bn. Analysts had said Boeing's foreign deliveries increased to 22 aircraft in June from 18 in May. However, imports of many goods rose sharply and pushed the US further into the red on trade. Car imports climbed Dollars 431m to Dollars 8.59bn, while imported consumer goods grew by Dollars 629m to Dollars 11.3bn.</p>

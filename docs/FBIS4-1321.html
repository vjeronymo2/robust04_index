			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by J. Rees] </F>   [Text] Bloemfontein April 26 SAPA -- Voting in prisons  proceeded smoothly on Tuesday [26 April] as special polling  stations were set up for as many as 100,000 prisoners, a  Correctional Services spokesman said. No incidents were  reported and the atmosphere in prisons was calm, he said.    Independent Electoral Commission [IEC] officials set up the  stations behind bars and guards took eligible prisoners to cast  their votes. There was no adverse reaction from murderers,  rapists and other prisoners denied the vote by a last-minute  cabinet decision on Tuesday, the spokesman said.    Prisons Commissioner Gen Henk Bruyn this week barred the  media from prisons in order to "keep the atmosphere as calm as  possible".    Officials on Tuesday had no clear idea of how many of the  country's 115,000 prisoners would vote, but estimated the figure  could come close to 100,000.    In the Orange Free State and Northern Cape seven prisons had  completed voting by noon on Tuesday, a spokesman said.</p>

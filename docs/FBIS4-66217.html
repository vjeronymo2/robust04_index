For reasons of editing, it is slightly abridged in this  publication.    [passage omitted] Fang Litian [2455 4539 1131], a scholar in  the mainland, points out that the regions of "alarming" growth  for Christianity include Huaiyin City, Jiangsu (in 1981 the  approximate number of Christians was more than 20,000. It  increased by 20,000 every year until 1986, and by 1990 it had  increased to 140,000); the Wenzhou region of Zhejiang (in 1981  the approximate number of Christians was 200,000. By 1990 it had  increased to more than 300,000); and Lai'an County, Anhui (the  county only had eleven believers in the early 1950s; by 1976  there were only 77, but by 1990 there were upwards of 1,000  people). Mr. Fang believes that this phenomenon illustrates two  points: 1) Since the 1950s, religious believers have increased  the fastest in the last ten years. 2) Some regions of China  truly have developed a "religion fever." [passage omitted]    Although these data alarm people, there is no denying this  religious "upsurge." But the majority of people in religious and  scholarly circles in the mainland do not want to look upon this  as an "ailment." Wang Weifan [3076 4850 5672] of Nanjing  University's Institute for the Study of Religion believes that  although the growth of Christianity has exceeded that of other  religions in recent years, it is essentially normal. It has not  reached a "fever" level, and there is no need to be  "panic-stricken."    According to recent statistics (or estimates) of mainland  Christian circles, the approximate number of Christians  (Orthodox) currently in China is 6 million to 9 million. And  Hong Kong and overseas estimates of the number of mainland  Christians vary from 20 million to 50 million.    There are more women than men and more old people than young  in typical mainland churches.... But estimates of the proportion  of young believers have notably increased.... In addition, many  rural believers are illiterate, estimated at half or more. The  educational level of urban believers is rather high. There even  are professors and famous physicians among them....    What was described above, however, is the general situation.  The mainland certainly also has many atypical examples. As  regards the age structure of believers, there is a report that  indicates that in churches in certain areas of Henan and Shanxi,  80 percent of believers are 18 years of age or under. As regards  the educational level of believers, in urban churches, the  proportion of young intellectuals is constantly rising. In  academic circles, there even are quite a few students who are  trying to introduce Christian culture. They do not attend  church, but are "Christian sympathizers." [passage omitted]    People's zeal for Christianity began from the mid-1980s.  "Religious fever" or "Christian fever" is by no means a post  "June 4" incident phenomenon. In summarizing the reasons for  "Christian fever" among mainland students and Christians, they  can be divided into the following four aspects:    1. Traditional and historical factors: Most of the regions  with rapid growth of Christianity and a concentration of  believers have a rather long history of dissemination of  Christianity. For example, in such localities as Wenzhou,  Zhejiang and Fuqing, Fujian, the share of rural believers could  be the highest in the nation, and these regions both have a long  history of Christianity. In another respect, family's  traditional beliefs also are an important factor bringing young  people into the church. Parents give their children religious  instruction from when they are small. According to an  investigative report, the choir of a certain Shanghai church has  more than twenty young people, and "almost all of them are  children of believers."    2. Social and economic factors: Concepts of ghost are still  widespread, especially among farmers with a rather low level of  education. Some think that the more rapid growth of rural  Christianity than urban actually is the transfer or ("change of  sentiments") regarding ghost concepts. In another respect,  Chinese society has always emphasized men and slighted women.  Especially in the countryside, women have not been able to be  economically independent and they cannot decide for themselves  on family issues. They often are dissatisfied with their daily  lives. So, they go to church to seek satisfaction, to the point  that in some villages the ratio of female believers is as high  as 80 percent. For example, in Gaozuo township, Suining county,  Jiangsu, there are 1,248 Christians in the whole township and  1,185 are women, making up 92.8 percent of the total.    3. Psychological factors: A number of reports reveal that  the  majority of believers are believers because of illness.  According to a 1985 sample survey at the Puzhou Church in the  Longwan district of Wenzhou, 57 percent of believers entered the  church because of illness. According to a survey the same year  in Anhui's Bangbu, 126 of 160 Christians were believers because  of illness. And 1,620 of 2,500 Christians from Guzhen county  were believers because of illness. A survey of a village in  northern Jiangsu also indicated that 60 percent to 70 percent of  believers believed because of illness. In addition, some  believers who encountered setbacks in love, marriage, family,  school, or careers received spiritual consoling at church, and  this was a reason for them to become believers.    4. Other factors: For a long time during the Cultural  Revolution period, religion was forbidden. That could be a  reason for the "rebound" after the churches reopened in the  1980s. The more believers were repressed the more it brought  about regeneration and solidarity, triggering an opposite  effect. [passage omitted.]    Those in the mainland concerned with "Christian fever" are  mainly in three categories: academic circles, Christian circles,  and people in party and government departments concerned with  religion. Because people in the three categories have different  backgrounds and goals, their reactions to "Christian fever" are  naturally somewhat diverse.    The first "panic-stricken" group probably are some cadres  who  supervise religion. It is their duty to "normalize" religion and  attack "abnormal religious activity." Any religious activity  that is not registered with the government can be looked upon as  being illegal or abnormal.    Those concerned with "Christian fever" naturally also must  include people from Christian circles. They play up a lot the  evaluation of the positive aspects of religion and its  contribution to society and oppose the sweeping "opiate theory."    After it was proposed to establish a totally new concept of  religion in the mid-1980s, it brought openness to academic  research on religion and church circles strived more strongly to  implement a policy of "religious freedom," believing that  religious freedom included study, discussion, and criticism of  religion. Religious people should not be excluded from  participating in research on religion (indicating that in the  past there was this exclusion). In addition, they also  emphasized that a policy of freedom of religious belief should  not be a tactic to abolish religion.    As regards the reaction of academic circles to "Christian  fever," we can probably say that they gradually left the  "ultra-leftist" line and made significant breakthroughs in the  study of religion. In the past, the orientation of religious  studies completely obeyed the Central Committee of the Chinese  Communist Party. (For example, the "World Religion Research  Institute" was established in Beijing in 1964 because Mao Zedong  appointed them to criticize theology.) By the mid-1980s,  research on religion no longer was bogged down in philosophical  discussions of the nature of religion, but the focus shifted to  an investigation of the actual situation and gradually changed  to combining "theory" with "practice." This was mainly the study  of Christianity. The main content of the investigation was: The  growth in the number of believers, the age structure, the sex  ratio, the reasons for believing, the family background of  believers, and the affect of religious belief on family life and  social ethics concepts. Most of these types of survey reports of  the actual situation in churches were published in the two  biennial journals Religion and Modern Studies  on Religion. Between 1987 and 1992, nearly twenty of these  survey reports on the current state of Christianity were  published. Although some only contributed extremely sketchy data  and could by no means be considered rigorous in their research  methodology, as regards the Chinese Communist attitude toward  religion, this kind of research report was a very great  breakthrough. [passage omitted]    Regarding the study of religious theory, the "opiate theory"  no longer has a dogmatic position. In its place is the renewed  development of the early 1950s' "five natures theory" proposed  by people such as Zhou Enlai and Li Weihan: That religion is of  the masses, democratic, international, long-lasting, and  complex. The previous insistence on the argument that religion  would very quickly die out in socialism was changed to exploring  the possibility of religion becoming the superstructure of  socialism, conditions for cooperation between religion and  socialism, and the social function of religion. The most  difficult to change was the past close affiliation of religious  studies with the philosophical sphere. Moreover, ideological  issues often extended to political contention. But in recent  years, the study of religion has begun to be relatively  independent and have broadened to several fields of social  science research, including religious phenomenology, the  sociology of religion, religious anthropology, and the  psychology of religion.    In sum, in recent years academic circles' study of religion  and evaluation of Christianity have generally become open and  positive and people from church circles and religious workers  simultaneously participate in research projects. But the general  orientation of research and form of reporting still are rather  influenced by the party and government climate. The current  respected mainland authority on religious issues is Luo Zhufeng  [5012 4554 7364], the head of the East China Religious Affairs  Office in the 1950s. From the 1980s to the present Mr. Luo has  held such positions as vice president and advisor to the China  Religion Society, president of the Shanghai Municipal Religion  Society, and honorary head of the Institute for the Study of  Religion of the Shanghai Social Studies Academy. Religious  Issues in China's Socialist Period, of which he is the  chief editor can be considered representative of present  mainland opinion on religious issues. Mr. Luo is an old cadre  administering religious affairs. Obviously research on religion  still is essentially led by the party and the government.  [passage omitted.]    The sudden increase in the number of Christians in recent  years obviously caused greater interest and acceptance of  Christianity from people in various circles of Chinese society  and also helped churches and believers in various localities to  strive for their basic rights and freedoms. After churches in  the name of "uniting the broad masses of believers" contended in  the "democracy movement," the government exerted pressure on  Christianity. I am convinced that Christian doctrine and church  life can continue to attract the large number of Chinese people  who do not have any belief and have lost their ideals. I  estimate that in the next few years the number of believers will  continue to rise. As regards the clash of Chinese Christianity  and Chinese culture, mainland scholars, using Taiwan  Christianity as a precedent, believe that it would be difficult  for the churches to become a force clashing with Chinese  culture. The Christian churches in Taiwan also grew rapidly for  a period. Although Taiwan has freedom to spread religion, after  several decades of development, Christianity still is an  extremely small minority religion, not to mention  "Christianization" of the culture. As to Chinese Christianity's  being assimilated by the Chinese culture, it also will not  happen to a very great extent. In the past, Christianity's  development in China was not at all assimilated into the Chinese  culture or integrated with native religions like Buddhism.  Because Christianity's world view and the world view of the  Chinese people clash, China's Christian fever probably will  gradually stabilize. Christianity quite probably will be able to  maintain its basic characteristics in China and become a bit of  a decoration for Chinese culture.</p>

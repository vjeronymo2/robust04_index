			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] The terrorist group, the so-called Islamic  Movement, thought that through the use of weapons it could  generally obstruct the liberation march of our Kurdish people,  and in particular, harm the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and  isolate it from its masses. In order to implement its  aggressive plan against the just aims and aspirations of our  people, this terrorist group, the so-called Islamic Movement, a  few months ago resorted to the policy of creating crises and  establishing the necessary grounds and atmosphere for wicked  plots and plans against our people, which they prepared outside  Kurdistan. But it was the Almighty's will that the true face of  this terrorist group be exposed to our Kurdish people. This  group did not value the lives of the people of Kurdistan. It  directed its guns against the innocent people in  al-Sulaymaniyah, Irbil, Raniyah, Halabjah, Klar, and other  Kurdistani cities.    In view of this foolish action, the forces of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan, in cooperation with the angry people, chased  the members of the Islamic Movement and drove them out of  Kurdistan. The crimes committed by the fighters of this  so-called Islamic Movement are in flagrant violation of the  principles of human rights which Islam has strongly defended.  What we regret are not the actions of this group, but we are  sorry to see a country like the Islamic Republic of Iran  supporting such a terrorist group and directing it to kill the  children, women, and old people of Kurdistan. Kurdistan has  always looked to the Islamic Republic for assistance and support  and expected it to treat Kurdistan at least as it treated the  Muslims of Bosnia and not to interfere in its internal affairs.  Kurdistan never expected it to go against the will of its  people through a terrorist group which was rejected by the  masses of Kurdistan long before it started its wicked plots and  plans. This terrorist group has proved its failure and  inability to find any popular base in Iraqi Kurdistan and  inability to win the sympathy and support of the people. The  aims of any political party rejected by the masses are doomed to  failure, because the attitude of the masses is the proper  criteria for the suitability of any political party.    Our Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan thought that the  success of the Islamic revolution in Iran and the defeat of the  oppressive Shah regime would be good for them, because they  believed that the Islamic Republic, having has ended an  oppressive regime like that of the Shah, could not stand against  the will of oppressed peoples who yearn for freedom. We thought  defense of the oppressed people was one of the important  principles the Islamic Republic of Iran believes in, and our  Kurdish people in Iraqi Kurdistan is one of the leading  oppressed nations in the area which deserve support and  assistance. Any military action against our Kurdish people is  tantamount to siding with Saddam Husayn and his dictatorial  regime against the aspirations, desires, and aims of the Iraqi  Arab and Kurdish people, the Iranian people, and all the peoples  in the area.</p>

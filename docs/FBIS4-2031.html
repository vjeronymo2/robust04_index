			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter He Jinsong (6320 0513 2646)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (XINHUA) -- China will establish  grain risk funds to help promote sustained and steady  development of grain production and to ensure a stable grain  market, this reporter has learned from the National Conference  on Grain Risk Funds that opened in Beijing today.    Luo Zhiling, vice minister of the State Planning Commission,  gave an explanation on the general framework of the state grain  risk funds system at the conference. He said: The grain risk  fund is the first special macroeconomic regulation fund  established specifically for a commodity that bears heavily on  the state of the national economy and people's well-being.  Starting from the 1994 grain year, the central government and  the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly  under the central government must establish well-stocked grain  risk funds. Capital for the central grain risk fund will be  supplied by the central treasury. Capital for local grain risk  funds will come from subsidies from the central government and  appropriations from local budgets. Capital needed for the funds  must be raised within the year. He urged the localities to pool  their limited financial resources so that grain risk funds at  the central and provincial levels can be set up as quickly as  possible, thus creating a rather effective means for exercise  regulation and intervention.    Luo Zhiling emphasized that the grain risk fund is a  special-  purpose fund. It is forbidden to use grain risk funds for other  purposes, like helping the poor or social welfare and relief.  The funds should not be used to make up for regular operating  losses of grain enterprises or to subsidize the expenses and  interest incurred from regular stock turnover. Departments  concerned at all levels must not withhold, divert, or pocket  subsidies due the peasants.</p>

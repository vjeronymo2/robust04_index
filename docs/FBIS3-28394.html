"Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi, state President Le Duc  Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, National Assembly Chairman Nong  Duc Manh, party Central Committee Advisers Pham Van Dong and Vo  Chi Cong, and high ranking party and state cadres from the  central and Hanoi organs attended the function. Before coming  to the Presidential Palace, the families visited President Ho  Chi Minh in his mausoleum."    In a solemn and friendly atmosphere, General Secretary Do  Muoi, Comrades Pham Van Dong and Vo Chi Cong, state President Le  Duc Anh, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet, National Assembly Chairman  Nong Duc Manh, and leading party and state cadres warmly  received the families and invited them into the Presidential  Palace. The families were moved when they listened to the  statement made by State President Le Duc Anh. He said:    [Begin Le Duc Anh recording] "Ladies, Gentlemen, and  Comrades: Inheriting and developing the heroic and indomitable  tradition of our Vietnamese people from thousands of years of  national construction and protection, in more than half a  century, under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of  Vietnam and beloved Uncle Ho, our people conducted an extremely  formidable and brave struggle against mighty invading forces to  regain our national independence and freedom.    "Right here, when the invasion war was at its peak,  President  Ho Chi Minh declared: The war may prolong to five, ten, or 20  years or longer. Hanoi, Haiphong, and certain industrial cities  may be damaged. But the Vietnamese people are not in fear.  Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom.    "Uncle Ho spoke about the willpower, determination, and  aspirations of the entire people who had been miserably living  long nights of slavery with only oppression, prison, and wars,  but not democracy and human rights. In order to achieve the  present glorious victory, our people in the entire country  exerted their utmost efforts and endured much long suffering.  Dozens of millions of compatriots and soldiers contributed  outstanding service. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers were  killed in prisons and battlefields. Our Vietnamese people  eternally acknowledge and voluminously appreciate the fallen  combatants who sacrificed themselves for the nation's  independence and people's freedom and democracy.    "On behalf of the party, government, people, and soldiers, I  bow myself at the soul of fallen combatants who sacrafied for  our great national cause. I deeply appreciate families of  fallen combatants and mothers who bore and brought up brave,  stubborn, and loyal children before offering their beloved  children for the survival of our fatherland. Especially, the  noble mothers who sent off their children for national service  three, five, and seven times. And all of them were killed on  the battlefields, never returning to their mothers."</p>

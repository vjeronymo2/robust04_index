			<p>BFN     [Text] Today's special session of the Georgian parliament  debated the supreme legislative body's protocol decision  [protokolnoye resheniye] adopted by a majority of votes  yesterday that does not allow the Georgian delegation to sign  any documents at the Moscow talks on the Abkhazian conflict.    During today's session, a number of parliamentarians put  forward the issue of stripping the head of state of his special  powers relating to reaching a settlement in Abkhazia. However,  owing to the absence of the quorum at the evening sitting, the  issue was not put to the vote.    Since some deputies believed the protocol decision adopted  yesterday had no legal power, a proposal was made firstly to  hold a vote on stripping the head of state of his powers  regarding Abkhazia and then vote for a second time on  yesterday's protocol decision.    This resulted in heated debate among deputies, which  signaled  the end of the session.</p>

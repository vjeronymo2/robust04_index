			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt came to Latvia  today for a brief working visit. The guest had a meeting with  President Guntis Ulmanis and also with representatives of the  Foreign Affairs Commission of the Saeima and its head,  Aleksandrs Kirsteins.    The Swedish prime minister emphasized that, in his opinion,  the initialled agreements with Russia should be signed, because  such a process of dealing with relations between neighboring  states is strengthening Latvian ties with Western countries.  The stability of Latvia is also important to the Nordic  countries. Also, the United States has become morally involved  in the forming of the agreements. This process has been  internationalized, and with internationalization the process is  significant to the entire Western world.    The Swedish prime minister assessed positively the intention  of Guntis Ulmanis to meet prominent European politicians in the  nearest future. Quite probably official guarantees would not be  given during these meetings, Bildt said. The talks, however,  would assist foreigners in understanding better the difficulties  connected with the signing of these agreements.    Ulmanis told the Swedish prime minister that the inhabitants  of Latvia have diverse attitudes toward the initialled  agreements between Latvia and Russia. There is also opposition  to the government's and the Saeima majority faction's  standpoint. In the latest sociological poll, 52 percent of the  participants have expressed themselves against the Skrunda radar  station remaining in Latvia. The president, too, is receiving  many letters from writers who are against the initialled  agreements.    The inhabitants are alarmed, most of all, over the social  guarantees to former Soviet army officers that are envisaged in  the agreement, because these will allow approximately 100,000  officers and their families to remain in Latvia. There is also  no conviction that Russia will fulfill these agreements. The  president emphasized that it is also not clear what kind of  guarantees the Western countries could give to Latvia. It also  cannot be forgotten that Latvia was occupied in 1940, which  Russia should, after all, recognize.    Aleksandrs Kirsteins, head of the Foreign Affairs Commission  of the Saeima, in turn explained to the guest that the position  of the State of Latvia on the question of signing the agreement  must be coordinated with Estonia, because she does not initial  agreements with Russia in the sphere of social guarantees to  military pensioners. The prime ministers of Latvia and Estonia  will meet on 7 April to discuss these questions. The talks are  envisaged in Rujiena, and the press center of the Cabinet of  Ministers organizes representatives of the press who would like  to accompany those travelling there.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] There are strong indications that one of the most  burning issues in the run-up to the election could be the  question of intimidation. The National Party [NP] took the bull  by the horns today when its leader, F.W. de Klerk, signed a  declaration committing the NP to a free and fair election  without intimidation.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Ronel van Zyl] Today's signing  of  the declaration follows complaints by the NP about ANC [African  National Congress] intimidation in general and specifically  during Mr. De Klerk's western Transvaal road show over the  weekend. During his three-day visit he was advised not to visit  black townships. Mr. De Klerk said he had taken this advise  because the ANC's strategy was to disrupt NP meetings and he  wanted to avoid any confrontation. He said a later assurance by  ANC leader Nelson Mandela that all areas should be accessible to  all political parties was not enough.    [De Klerk, in progress] All parties must go further. I think  parties must bind themselves to discipline their followers and  to act in the case where calls are not heeded, where  instructions are not followed.    [Van Zyl] In terms of the declaration, disciplinary steps  will be taken against NP members found guilty of intimidation.  Mr. De Klerk expressed the hope that other political parties  would follow suit. The declaration offers a direct challenge to  the ANC by leaving space for its leaders' signatures as well.  As far as ongoing talks with the Freedom Alliance were  concerned, Mr. De Klerk said negotiations would continue despite  the deadline.    [De Klerk] Negotiations can continue and multiparty  agreements can then, after an election, become part of the law  of the land where all parties, or all significant parties,  participate in a debate to reach an agreement and sign  agreements with each other. It can be implemented and made law  also after an election. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pechiney aluminium plan wins Russian government support Pechiney of France has won Russian government support for a scheme to modernise gradually the Siberian aluminium smelters - Krasnoyarsk, Bratsk and Novokuznetsk - which between them account for about half of Russia's aluminium production capacity but are among the world's heaviest polluters. Mr Bernard Legrand, head of Pechiney's aluminium activities, said that a start would be made at Krasnoyarsk with a 'module' of 250,000 tonnes of annual capacity to replace outdated existing tonnage. Arranging finance for this, an estimated USDollars 400m to Dollars 500m, and completing detailed engineering studies would take 18 months to two years and construction another two years. Then a 250,000-tonne module would be built at Bratsk which, like Krasnoyarsk, has an annual capacity of 800,000 tonnes. Both are producing below that rate. He hoped this step-by-step process would continue until capacity at all three smelters had been modernised. Mr Legrand said that he was assured at a meeting with the Russian prime minister, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, that he had the Russian government's support for the project. 'I am pretty confident things will work out, but it won't be easy,' he added. Pechiney will work with Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, which will have to find a way to put together a bankable international finance package, while Bechtel, the US civil engineering group, will do detailed studies to see that as much Russian equipment as possible is used. Mr Legrand said Pechiney's involvement sprang from the recent multi-lateral trade agreement between the big aluminium producing countries when western governments pledged to offer technological help and finance to the Russian industry if it would join in the international efforts to cut output temporarily to bring the aluminium market back into balance.</p>

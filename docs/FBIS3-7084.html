The South Pacific correspondent, Erina  Reddan, reports that Fiji's newly elected government wants to  rejoin the Commonwealth and reestablish diplomatic links with  India.    [Begin Reddan recording] Fiji left the Commonwealth in the  wake of two military coups in 1987 which overthrew an  Indo-Fijian dominated government. It broke off diplomatic links  with India in 1989 after accusing an embassy staffer of  interfering in local politics. Now elected for a second term as  prime minister, one-time coup leader Sitiveni Rabuka says he  wants a new era of racial harmony between Fijians and  Indo-Fijians. The racist constitution which guarantees Fijians'  political dominance over Fiji Indians must be reviewed by 1997.  The spokesperson, (Jauna Nakabua), says it could be well enough  on the way by 1995 to satisfy the Commonwealth that it meets its  protection of human rights principles. [end recording]</p>

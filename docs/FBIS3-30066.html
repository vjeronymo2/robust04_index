			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] On 23 February, Lieutenant General Thiradet  Miphian, director of the Supreme Command Intelligence  Department, petitioned the Police Department to take legal  action against Generals Vang Pao and Thonglit Chokbengboun of  the Lao National Liberation Army [LNLA] on charges of violating  national security.    The purpose of the petition is to have the two Lao generals  investigated in accordance with government policy, because they  support the organization of illegal movements on Thai territory  opposing the Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. The LNLA  secretly gathered men, weapons, and food supplies in areas of  Chiang Kham District in Phayao Province and Thung Chang, Mae  Rim, and Tha Wang Pha Districts in Nan Province to launch  several armed operations in the LPDR. [passage omitted]    In October 1993, the Thai Supreme Command stated that action  was being taken against some of the 6,096 Lao refugees living at  Tham Krabok temple in Saraburi Province when it was discovered  that they were followers of Vang Pao.    The Thai Government's harsh policy against Generals Vang Pao  and Thonglit and their followers -- charging them with national  security violations and illegal entry -- will help eliminate the  LPDR Government's suspicions and contribute to stronger  relations between the two countries.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 2, IRNA -- The latest British  allegations against Iran are a clear indication of the  Conservative Party's desperate attempts to distract public  opinion from its pro-aggression and corrupt nature.    The international community should bear in mind the support  Khmer Rouge and Saddam Husayn got from successive British  governments, therefore, it should not come as a surprise to find  out that the Serbs are also included in the list of British  allies regardless of their atrocities against humanity.    One used to believe that the British politicians were more  clever than accusing Iran of forging foreign policy documents  already known to the public.    British allies, led by the United States, could only hope  now  that London government will come up with something more concrete  and convincing against Iran next time.    Keeping in mind the level of British politicians'  intelligence, as witnessed recently, the world has to wait for  quite a long time to hear a single convincing argument against  Iran from the British side.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Book Review: Common sense never goes out of fashion MANAGING TO SURVIVE: A GUIDE TO MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE 1990s By John Harvey Jones Heinemann Pounds 15 pp184 In the 1960s managers discovered accountancy. In the 1970s they discovered people. In the 1980s it was growth. In the 1990s they must put away fads and discover good management, or they will not survive the decade. With big gestures, big generalisations and big threats, Sir John Harvey Jones begins yet another cracking read of a business book. The world, he says, is changing rapidly and unpredictably. New technologies, new competitive pressures and new management theories are pouring on to the market faster than companies can absorb them. Everything is speeding up - a new product can only provide a lead for a short time. Sacred cows are dying - economies of scale are less important than flexibility. As plants become more mechanised, the gains come not from increasing productivity, but from putting capital to better use. The battleground has switched to marketing, branding, research and development, and distribution. Skills are becoming more quickly outdated, and workers are less willing to conform either in terms of behaviour or to fixed working time. In the 1990s, he argues, all companies have access to the same tools; the winners will be the ones with the best strategic aims, the best motivator of people, the best manager. There is barely an original word in all this. But originality is much over-rated when it comes to management books, as there is scarcely a new management idea under the sun. Instead, the appeal of the book is that it is lively, short, and (almost) jargon-free. Above all, it rings true. In spite of his huge following, Sir John is no management guru. For someone so opinionated he has few theories, and has little time for the 'instant panaceas' of those who do. His message is more of the different-strokes-for-different-folks variety. That allows him to pick and choose among the latest management ideas, and provide a great service to readers by explaining them in plain language. Once the theories are stripped of all their usual verbiage, it is hard not to agree with Sir John, who believes that most have their worth, but none alone will give a company more than a short-term edge. His discussion of 'total quality management' (squeezed incongruously into a chapter on the environment) is a case in point. He argues that having the quality seal will not determine who the winners are; it will only serve as an entry ticket to the race. Sir John's thesis is that to cope with the pressures of the decade, managers must be visionary. They must take risks; they must have a broader vision of all the international options. They must have a clear sense of where the company is going. They must be committed to continual change and continual learning. They must move fast; they must respond to environmental pressures; and they must manage technology rather than let technology manage them. Managers must be bold enough to be radical, and modest enough to admit mistakes. In spite of his insistence that there are no simple solutions, he does not hold back on giving advice. Again this is of the distinctly sensible variety. What should you do in a recession? The answer, he says, is to focus on the essential parts of your business. Cut costs. Bring in cash, selling assets even at knock-down prices. Look after your people; give the ones you make redundant as much help as you can; keep on training those you wish to keep. A sympathetic view of human nature radiates throughout the book. Sir John believes that employees want their companies to do well, and argues that they deserve the trust of their superiors. This means managers should delegate as much as possible, as those who do the job are best equipped to make decisions about it. People should also be told as much as possible about the business - the extra vision is worth the (minimal) risk that they will run off and tell the competition. And as for office politics, anyone who is engaging in that cannot have enough work to do. Perhaps that management layer could be cut out altogether. The same sense of decency colours the new relationship between customers and suppliers. Now that companies no longer seek to do everything in-house, they must find the fittest partners, working with them on the basis of mutual interest rather than fighting for extra margin. In all this there are many notes which will be familiar to readers of his earlier books. Indeed, Sir John has been a champion of common sense for decades. Yet the book feels up to date, with recent examples of companies that are doing - or not doing - what they ought. One gets the impression, however, that most businesses are not even thinking along the right lines, let alone starting to put the winning strategy in place. Though sensible, many of these themes are spelt out more than once, as if Sir John had written the book at great speed. Perhaps this is to be expected; his last book is barely cold on the presses, and given the number of his other commitments, it is a wonder he found time to write it at all. Its tone, however, marks a departure from previous books. Although on every page it is clear that Sir John is more a man of action than ideas, there are fewer personal anecdotes than in earlier works - which is just as well since it has been a good six years since he did an executive job at ICI. Instead, a slightly jarring evangelical note has crept in - one feels that he is writing the book not so people will go out and buy it, but so managers will take note and make Britain great again. But even if it is partly a tract, it is a stimulating and useful one. It could have been still more so with tighter editing, and some of the space saved used for an index.</p>

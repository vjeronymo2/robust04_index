Childhelp USA, a nonprofit organization for the prevention of child abuse, sent  residents of its village for abused and neglected children near Beaumont,  Calif., to Jackson's ranch, where he keeps giraffes, llamas and other exotic  beasts. Jackson donated the proceeds from his last concert in Los Angeles to  Childhelp after it renamed its research facility the Michael Jackson  International Research Institute. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Waters sink lower Heavy selling of the utilities sectors picked up yesterday with water stocks the latest casualties. It followed the big sell-off in the generators and regional electricity stocks on Thursday when regulatory fears drove the sector down 2.6 per cent. Dealers said it was the market's biggest and most influential broking firms that were behind the slide in share prices. UBS was said to have got the ball rolling in mid-week, adopting a negative view of the 'recs'. NatWest Securities said: 'Some of the recs may already be discounting an optimistic outcome from their regulatory review.' Water stocks were unsettled yesterday by news that SG Warburg, long-term and highly influential bull of the sector, had shifted its stance from over-weight to neutral for the second quarter. Warburg said; 'The combination of mounting regulatory uncertainty coupled with an uncertain market context regarding the outlook for inflation, base rates and bond yields will prevent any sector outperformance over what is certain to be a difficult period through to the end of July at least. The water industry regulator, Ofwat, is scheduled to announce new price controls towards the end of July. Anglian Water dropped 19 to 498p, Severn Trent 18 to 534p, Thames 17 to 496p and North West 9 to 513p. Eastern Electricity tumbled to 643p before ending the session 17 lower at 646p, while Southern closed 8 down at 631p. Talk of hefty US selling lowered PowerGen 18 to 489p.</p>

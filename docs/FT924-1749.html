			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Second line issues take the lead again THE TAIL wagged the dog to some effect in the UK stock market yesterday, when buoyant demand for stocks in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index helped the blue chip shares withstand a bout of nervousness ahead of the expiry on Friday of the current futures contract on the FT-SE 100. Investors were clearly unsure at first whether the stock market had run its course for this year, and early trading saw the Footsie down 11 points to 2,710.4; some London-based houses remain convinced that 2,700 will prove to be the year-end reading. But solid demand for the second line issues kept the FT-SE Mid 250 Index firm throughout to show a gain on the day of 12.5. The FT-SE 100 rallied, in spite of some distaste for a gloomy distributive trades' survey from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and news of a sharp rise in UK manufacturing input prices last month. At mid-session the index edged into positive territory, showing a 1.5 net gain. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,717.9 for a loss on the day of 3.9 points. Traders regarded this as a creditable performance, since London's late recovery was restrained a little by an early decline of 10.54 Dow points on Wall Street following a gloomy statement from IBM. The erratic performance in the Footsie largely reflected hurried switching between the blue chips and the Footsie December futures contract as the big investment houses strove to balance positions ahead of Friday's stock index futures expiry. These technical factors helped to boost the day's Seaq volume total to 549.9m shares from the 438.4m of the previous session. But low retail, or customer, business on Monday, worth only Pounds 846.8m, appeared to confirm that the big investment institutions are already winding down for the year. The CBI survey, indicating that retailers expect this December's sales to be little better than last year's, mildly discouraged the stores sector, where analysts hope for a rebound in the Christmas sales which provide the bulk of the year's profits at the big national retail and store chains. But market analysts did find the CBI report entirely convincing and preferred to wait for the official November retail statistics, which are due today. Falls in retail stocks were mostly held to a few pence and there was no pressure elsewhere in the market. The very modest increase in UK manufacturing production in October was virtually in line with expectations and a similar rise in November output prices was also found acceptable. But the increase of 2.4 per cent in producer input prices was received more nervously because of the underlying fear that sterling's devaluation could reignite inflationary pressures. At County NatWest, Mr Bob Semple commented that the input price news might prove 'a cautionary note for the future', counterbalancing the widely expected fall in headline inflation numbers as mortgage cuts continue to take effect. Equity strategists suggested that the underlying tone of the stock market appeared firm enough and that share prices were likely to close the year in good shape, once the stock index futures expiry is safely out of the way.</p>

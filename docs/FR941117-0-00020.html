			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Arkansas' proposed provision is substantively identical to section 507(c)(1)(F) of SMCRA. Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(A)(vi) is no less stringent than section 507(c)(1)(F) of SMCRA, and approves it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=3 --> ACA15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B), The Cost of Training and the Obligation to Ensure That Qualified Coal Operators Are Aware of SOAP Assistance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Arkansas proposed a new paragraph at ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B) concerning the responsibility to (1) provide or assume the costs of training coal operators that meet the qualifications under SOAP regarding the preparation of permit applications and compliance with the regulatory program, and (2) ensure that qualified coal operators are aware of the available assistance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA states that the Secretary of the Interior shall provide or assume the cost of training coal operators that meet the qualification stated in section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA concerning the preparation of permit applications and compliance with the regulatory program, and shall ensure that qualified coal operators are aware of the assistance available under this subsection. With two exceptions, which are discussed below, proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B) is substantively identical to section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first exception is that, at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B), Arkansas specifies that it is the Arkansas Department of Pollution Control and Ecology's responsibility rather than the Secretary of the Interior's responsibility to provide or assume the cost of training operators and ensure that operators are aware of the available assistance. OSM is provisionally interpreting section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA to specify that it is a requirement for State regulatory authorities in primacy states to assume these responsibilities. OSM intends to clarify this requirement when it promulgates implementing rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second exception is that, at proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B), Arkansas uses the term ``small operator'' in place of the phrase ``coal operators that meet the qualifications stated in [section 507(c)(1)]'' that is used in section 507(c)(2) of SMCRA. As discussed in finding No. 2 above, Arkansas' proposed definition of ``small operator'' is consistent with section 507(c)(1) of SMCRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds that proposed ACA 15&hyph;58&hyph;503(a)(2)(B) is no less stringent than the requirements of section 507(c)(2) SMCRA, and approves it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez denied press  reports stating that Carlos Hernandez had been appointed as the  person who would be responsible for the Banco Latino  intervention process.    [Begin Sosa recording] He was never a candidate. So far  there are no candidates and that is something that must be  determined by the president of the Republic. There are some  persons who, considering the superintendent's resignation, could  occupy the position. I believe that at this moment it would not  be fitting for me to start speculating on names. As I said,  that will be determined by the president after discussing it  with the Senate of the Republic. [end recording]    The finance minister's statements were made after his five  hour interpellation before the National Congress. He also  referred to the resignation by Banco Latino's intervention board  and stated that the creation of an administration board will not  undermine the authority of those who are already involved.  According to him, it is only a manner of expediting the entire  process. In conclusion, he did not discard the possibility that  Fogade's [Deposit Guarantee Fund] financial assistance to some  banks could be eliminated.    [Begin Sosa recording] We would first have to determine what  the situation is, because transient financial assistance which,  let's say, does not increase, could help to stabilize a specific  situation. However, I believe that financial assistance that is  constantly on the rise will undoubtedly lead us to at least some  type of intervention. [end recording]</p>

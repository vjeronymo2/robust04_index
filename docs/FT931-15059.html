			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Alcoa declines 30% to Dollars 196.3m before charges ALCOA, the world's biggest aluminium company, saw net income before charges fall by nearly 30 per cent last year to Dollars 196.3m, or Dollars 2.27m a share, from Dollars 279.7m, or Dollars 3.27m. After charges, mainly associated with the new US accounting standards, there was a net loss of Dollars 1.14bn, or Dollars 13.41, for 1992, against net earnings of Dollars 62.7m, or 71 cents. Alcoa last year reduced working capital and lowered costs which offset a significant proportion of revenue lost from low aluminium prices. However, the results were at the lower end of analysts expectations. Mr Tom Van Leeuwen, analyst at Lehman Brothers, said: 'This was a little disappointing, but not overwhelmingly disappointing.' He said Alcoa 'faces a very difficult earnings environment in 1993. The downside is limited but there is no upside at all'. Alcoa shipped 2.797m tonnes of aluminium last year, against 2.836m tonnes in 1991. In the fourth quarter earnings before charges were Dollars 49m or 50 cents compared with Dollars 25.5m or 30 cents in the same quarter of 1991. There was a loss after charges of Dollars 80m or 94 cents compared with a loss of Dollars 191.4m or Dollars 2.26. Alcoa restated its results for the first three quarters of 1992 in the light of its implementation of Financial Accounting Standard proposals and in the first quarter of 1992 took a one-time, non-cash net charge of Dollars 1.11bn or Dollars 13.06 a share in respect of these accounting changes. Alcoa of Australia, the Australian aluminium and gold producer, blamed lower metal prices for a 32 per cent reduction in net profit to ADollars 259m (USDollars 178.6m) for the year to the end of December. Sales revenue fell 13.1 per cent to ADollars 2.2bn, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. Alcoa, which is 48.25 per cent owned by Western Mining Corporation and 51 per cent by Alcoa of the US, said fourth-quarter profits fell to ADollars 55.3m from ADollars 77.8m, in spite of improved productivity and a lower Australian dollar exchange rate.</p>

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The San Diego City Council Monday agreed to have Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a  nationwide accounting firm with offices in San Diego, conduct an economic  impact study of the $1 billion in new development fees the council is  considering in order to pay for new public facilities that will be needed  during the next 20 years.  </P> <P> The Coalition for San Diego, a newly formed group that includes the Chamber of  Commerce and other business groups, has agreed to fund the $75,000 study.  </P> <P> The accounting firm was chosen from a number of companies submitting proposals  to the city.  </P> <P> The study, which is to be completed by early July, is designed to determine  what economic impact the proposed fees would have on San Diego. Developers  maintain the proposed fees will kill development in San Diego by increasing the  cost of housing and commercial development.  </P> <P> In late April, the City Council agreed to wait 90 days before once again  considering the $1 billion in "citywide impact fees" that would generate money  to build a new central library, some major roads and an improved trolley  system.  </P> <P> Although Monday's council vote to have Coopers &amp; Lybrand complete the study  was unanimous, Councilman Bob Filner questioned whether the accounting firm  would return with an unbiased report.  </P> <P> "There seems to be an assumption that fees will have a negative impact on the  economy," Filner said.  </P></p>

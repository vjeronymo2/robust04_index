The vice premier fully affirmed the achievements  made in the Haicang Investment Zone's development and in the  economic work of Xiamen. He stressed: It is necessary to handle  the relationship between reform and stability well. The central  authorities have urged grasping opportunity, deepening reform,  opening wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability  [zhuazhu jiyu, shenhua gaige, kuoda kaifang, cujin fazhan,  baochi wending 2119 0145 2623 6657, 3234 0553 2395 7245, 2368  1129 7030 2397, 0191 6651 4099 1455, 0202 2170 4489 1353]. This  constitutes the overall situation, and leaders at all levels  must take it into account and safeguard it.    Among those who accompanied Vice Premier Zu Rongji in  inspecting Xiamen were He Chunlin, deputy secretary general of  the State Council; Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning  Commission; Wang Zhongyu, minister of the State Commission for  Restructuring Economy; Gu Xiulian, minister of chemical  industry; Yu Zhen, chairman of the China Light Industry  Federation; Dai Xianglong, vice president of the People's Bank  of China; Li Yanling, vice minister of finance; and Li Yizhong,  vice president of the China National Petrochemical Corporation.  Leaders of Fujian Province and relevant departments -- such as  Jia Qinglin, secretary of the provincial party committee and  concurrently governor, and Wang Jianshuang, member of the  standing committee of the provincial party committee and vice  governor -- accompanied the vice premier on his inspection tour.    During his stay in Xiamen, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his  party went to Haicang to inspect the investment zone there in a  selective way. The vice premier visited Haicang in March and  July of 1992. During the current visit, he selectively inspected  the projects under construction in the Haicang Investment Zone,  such as the Gaoyu power station, the Xianglu polyester fiber  textile project, the Xinyang industrial park, Haicang's new  urban districts, the Haicang management committee, and the  construction of infrastructure in Haicang. He listened to  reports submitted by leaders of the management committee. Fully  affirming the construction and development of the Haicang  Investment Zone, the vice premier said: Compared with 1992,  Haicang has undergone very great changes and has roughly met the  need for infrastructure, including water and electricity  supplies, roads, and telecommunications. Haicang already has  had the conditions for large-scale construction and development.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji and his party also listened to the  report submitted by Xiamen Mayor Hong Yongshi on his city's  economic development last year, and had a discussion with  leaders of relevant provincial and city departments on the  question of tax reform. Fully affirming Xiamen's economic work,  the vice premier said: I am very pleased that Xiamen's economy  has developed rapidly and that the city has achieved very good  results in its work.    Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out: In 1994, we will  continue to implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the spirit of  the 14th CPC Congress and the Third Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee. Located along the coast, Fujian Province and  Xiamen have the conditions for somewhat more rapid development.  However, the rapid development we are discussing here means  rapid development with efficiency. We must seek rapid  development in line with the spirit of General Secretary Jiang  Zemin's speeches. The vice premier also stressed: In  considering problems, we must emancipate our minds and seek  truth from facts. With encouragement, he said: The Xiamen  Special Economic Zone has enormous strong points and a  foundation for construction. Moreover, it is "small, but  effective, and so has boundless prospects."    According to an analysis, in the days to come, Vice Premier  Zhu Rongji will show more substantial concern for Haicang's  further development and construction.</p>

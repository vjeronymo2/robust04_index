			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEXT STEP ;  </P> <P> SEPARATIST FIRES ARE BURNING AGAIN IN QUEBEC;  </P> <P> AFTER 10 YEARS OF PEACE, CANADA FACES A LANGUAGE CRISIS THAT SOME PEOPLE FEEL  COULD BLOW THE COUNTRY APART. AND A KIND OF D-DAY IS NOT FAR OFF.  </P> <P> On a packed bus rolling through the streets of Canada's bilingual capital,  Ottawa, the driver called out, "Please move to the rear of the bus," in heavily  French-Canadian-accented English.  </P> <P> Out of the crowd of passengers came a loud, sarcastic retort, and a sign of the  times: "Yes, move to the back and make room for French-Canadians!"  </P> <P> Separatism is back in Canada, after a 10-year time of peace. Even now, no bombs  are going off, no effigies are being burned, no rioters block the streets -- in  fact, it's hard even to find anti-English graffiti in the heart of  French-speaking Montreal. Government officials are quick to argue that Canada's  current malaise is just more of the general linguistic ill will that has long  plagued this country. Still, many Canadians are wondering whether this year's  language crisis will be the ultimate one, the one that blows the country apart.  </P> <P> Polls show that about half the population of the French-speaking province of  Quebec is now interested in achieving some new political arrangement with the  rest of Canada. The leader of one of Quebec's largest labor groups, the  Confederation of National Trade Unions, has recently come out for independence,  harkening back to the late 1970s, when Quebec's unionists, teachers and  intellectuals pushed for what they called "sovereignty-association," a status  that would have kept Quebec economically linked to Canada while granting it  political independence.  </P> <P> Perhaps more significant, some Quebec businessmen are even talking about  outright sovereignty -- not so much because they want political change as  because they are tired of linguistic bickering and think a break from English  Canada might help them get on with the real issues of profit and growth.  </P> <P> "The rest of Canada doesn't give us any choice," says Claude Beland, president  of the Mouvement Desjardins, the largest association of credit unions in the  province. "We are kicked out of Canada. That's the way I see it."  </P> <P> A D-Day of sorts will arrive on June 23, the date by which all 10 Canadian  provinces are supposed to have ratified a package of constitutional amendments  clarifying the relative powers of the federal and provincial governments. The  amendments were intended to be conciliatory toward Quebec but instead have  provoked much of today's bitterness both in the province and in  English-speaking Canada.  </P> <P> The package, which is called the Meech Lake Accord for the resort where it was  drawn up, is the brainchild of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and he has  mounted a tremendous 11th-hour battle for its ratification. Three provinces are  holding out, however.  </P> <P> At the 1987 Meech Lake meeting, Quebec presented what were called its "minimal  demands." Representatives of all provinces were willing to meet them at the  time, but since then, New Brunswick, Manitoba and Newfoundland have reneged and  begun calling for changes in the accord. Since Quebec, having already stated  its minimal demands, is left no room to maneuver, the amendments' chance of  ratification seem very unlikely today.  </P> <P> No one in Canada is predicting upheaval on June 24 if the package isn't  approved on the 23rd. Instead, the date is seen here as a mere milestone --  albeit an important one -- in the slow but inexorable unraveling of the  country. Even if the accord is ratified in the end, analysts say, the debate  has left deep wounds that will take much time and diplomacy to heal.  </P> <P> If the Meech Lake Accord does not pass, a look ahead:  </P> <P> * For the province of Quebec itself, the immediate reaction to the failure of  Meech Lake would be shock and a deep sense of rejection by English Canada.  </P> <P> * For Mulroney and the Progressive Conservatives, the debate over the accord  has been damaging enough; defeat would be disaster.  </P> <P> * Canada's Liberal Party, which wants to run the government and may have a shot  at the prime minister's job, is poised to capitalize on Mulroney's growing  problems. But the Liberals have problems of their own.  </P> <P> Quebec's main opposition party, the separatist Parti Quebecois, has printed up  thousands of pamphlets for distribution this summer, describing its own,  radical recipe for independence. The plan calls for a nation-state with its own  constitution, tax-collection system, foreign policy and army, and for Quebec to  go on using the Canadian dollar and seek minority shareholder status with the  Bank of Canada. Quebec's premier, Robert Bourassa, has taken a far more  temperate view. He hails from the Liberal Party, but he has nonetheless been  supporting Mulroney's Meech Lake Accord -- even though Mulroney is a  Progressive Conservative. If the Meech Lake Accord were to fail, though,  Bourassa would certainly feel pressure to back away from Mulroney and embrace  Quebec "nationalism," as separatism is called here, to avoid being swamped by  public opinion and overtaken by the Parti Quebecois.  </P> <P> If the constitutional pact fails, Bourassa would at the very least feel freer  than he has in the past to pass laws promoting French in the province. Such  laws tend to conflict with Canada's federal Charter of Rights and Freedoms,  since they restrict English-language minority rights; as such, they outrage  English-Canadians. Bourassa has so far enacted one such law, banning the use of  English outdoor signs in Quebec. He is feeling the English-Canadian backlash to  this day.  </P> <P> When Mulroney was first elected prime minister in 1984, he had two main goals:  to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the United States and to achieve the  ratification of the Meech Lake Accord. He succeeded in getting the trade accord  only at a high political cost; Canadians have been complaining ever since that  the deal sold out the nation's sovereignty.  </P> <P> Now, with Meech Lake, the stakes for Mulroney are even higher. The prime  minister had merely inherited the idea of a free-trade deal; he designed the  Meech Lake concept, promoted it in his 1984 inaugural address and conducted the  negotiations personally. If the accord goes down in flames, Mulroney's  authority, morale and ability to govern would be seriously shaken. And the blow  would come at a time when Mulroney can least afford it. His approval ratings  are a mere 15% to 16% these days, the lowest of any Canadian prime minister  since World War II.  </P> <P> Even as his popular support has trickled away, Mulroney has stayed politically  viable, thanks to the continued loyalty of both English-Canadian Conservatives  and Quebec nationalists. But if the Meech Lake Accord is defeated, the  Quebeckers will feel pressured to withdraw their support from Mulroney and  rally 'round Quebec. Last week, Mulroney's minister of the environment, Lucien  Bouchard, abandoned his prime minister: He first sent a telegram of support to  the Parti Quebecois, then resigned. Two other Quebec members of Parliament  broke ranks with the Progressive Conservatives last week as well.  </P> <P> For Canada's Liberal Party, Mulroney's growing problems don't necessarily spell  victory, however.  </P> <P> By coincidence, the Liberals will hold their convention on June 24 -- the day  after the accord deadline -- to select a new party leader. Under Canada's  parliamentary system, that leader could become Canada's new prime minister the  next time an election is called, since one must be before 1993. For now,  candidate Jean Chretien, a Quebecker, looks to be a shoo-in within the  Liberals.  </P> <P> But does that mean Chretien can capitalize on Mulroney's problems and beat the  Progressive Conservatives? Would the collapse of the Meech Lake Accord ensure a  Liberal government next time around? Not necessarily.  </P> <P> Chretien, a traditional Liberal, stands for a strong central government. Thus,  he opposes the Meech Lake Accord, which promises increased powers to the  provinces. This stance puts him squarely against Mulroney -- but also puts him  squarely against public opinion in his own home province. If the accord is  defeated, Quebeckers could hardly be expected to vote for someone who wanted it  to die. And it's hard for any political party to win in Canada without winning  in Quebec.  </P> <P> Fears about the provincial economy, perhaps more than any other factor,  frightened Quebeckers away from sovereignty when a referendum was held on the  issue in 1980, with 60% of them voting against it. One study carried out at the  time showed that real disposable incomes in the province would fall 5% if  Quebec were to secede.  </P> <P> Now, though, some gray-flannel types are contending that the Quebec business  class has matured and that the province could go it alone without marring its  international credit rating. Merrill Lynch has sent a report stating as much to  its clients. On the downside, political uncertainty never sits well with  investors. And economists point out that if Quebec were to let out all the  stops and opt for separation, the new nation-state would find itself relying on  imported fossil fuels (it now buys gasoline on the cheap from the western  provinces) and heavily dependent on boom-and-bust-prone natural resources  exports.  </P> <P> Meech Lake Accord at a Glance  </P> <P> The secessionist debate in Canada revolves around something called the Meech  Lake Accord, a 1987 package of constitutional amendments that must be ratified  by all 10 provinces. In a nutshell, the accord:  </P> <P> Recognizes the linguistic duality of Canada and points out that within Canada,  Quebec constitutes a "distinct society".  </P> <P> Permits the provinces to opt out of certain kinds of shared-cost federal  spending programs and requires the federal government to pay "reasonable  compensation" to provinces that choose to do so.  </P> <P> Gives provinces the right to negotiate their own immigration policies with the  federal government (Quebec has already reached such an arrangement, at an  administrative level).  </P> <P> Puts the Supreme Court under the constitution and gives the provinces the right  to nominate justices to fill vacancies; Quebec would have three of the nine  justices. The accord also gives provinces a say in the selection of Canada's  appointed Senate.  </P> <P> Changes the formula by which Canada amends its constitution.  </P> <P> Profile of a Troubled Province  </P> <P> Labor force (1989): 3.3 million  </P> <P> Unemployment rate: 9.3%  </P> <P> Personal income per capita (1987): $14,621  </P> <P> % of Canadian average: 95.4%  </P> <P> Gross Domestic Product (1989): $96.8 billion  </P> <P> % of Canada's GDP: 24.0%  </P> <P> Farm cash receipts (1989): $3.1 billion  </P> <P> Electricity generated (1988): 149,004,914 MWh  </P> <P> Mineral production (1988): $2.28 billion  </P> <P> Value of construction (1988): $17.7 billion  </P> <P> Value of logging shipments (1986): $932 million  </P> <P> Value of manufacturing shipments (1988): $60.9 billion  </P> <P> Total area: 636,400 sq. miles  </P> <P> Total population: 6.7 million (July, 1989)  </P> <P> Languages: French, English, Multiple, Other  </P> <P> All economic figures in American doillars.  </P> <P> Source: 1990 Corpus Almanac and Canadian Sourcebook  </P></p>

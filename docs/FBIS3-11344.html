He said there is  no longer consensus among U.S. citizens of Cuban descent about  whether Washington's economic embargo -- which has been in force  since 1960 -- should be maintained. "Most are against it," he  said.    Bolanos, 55, was interviewed by FOLHA during a farewell  dinner offered by the Brazilian-Cuban Chamber of Commerce in Sao  Paulo. He said it was "entirely contradictory" for the United  States to maintain the embargo on Cuba since revoked in February  the similar sanctions it imposed on Vietnam. "Both countries  are Communist, both have a single party system, and both have a  centralized economy."    Bolanos does not believe the UN Human Rights Commission 11  March decision to condemn Cuba reflects the country's isolation.  "It just proves the organization is subordinated to the United  States."    He said he believes the opening of the Cuban economy will  not  destabilize its political system. He cited the former USSR as  an example of the "illusion of capitalism" and mentioned the PRC  and Vietnam as examples of Communist countries that have  modernized their economies without losing political stability.    Bolanos, the first ambassador to Brazil since the two  countries resumed diplomatic relations seven years ago, will  become the Cuban deputy foreign minister.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> The Santa Ana Community Redevelopment Agency voted unanimously Tuesday night to  postpone -- for the second time in two months -- a decision on Bowers Museum's  expansion plans. The proposal, which includes hiring Bissell Architects of  Newport Beach and Holmes &amp; Narver Inc. of Orange as project manager, is to  be reconsidered at the agency's July 18 meeting.  </P> <P> The museum commissioned a $1-million design from Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer  Associates of New York two years ago, but decided to scrap it in favor of a  plan to leave more land on the site for future construction of a privately  funded office tower. The museum has been essentially closed since January  pending the expansion, which is expected to cost $12 million.  </P></p>

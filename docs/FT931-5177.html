			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / German car group looks to China DAIMLER-BENZ, the German automotive, aerospace and engineering group, is considering opening a bus assembly factory near Shanghai in China and setting up a local joint venture to manufacture rolling stock for underground railway networks. The opportunities opened up during a recent tour of the Far East, when executives examined a possible site for the bus works close to the Yangtse river. 'It was the most exciting trip I have undertaken in all my years at Daimler,' one participant said. The visit reflected growing interest among German companies in the region - China in particular - and widespread determination that Japanese industry should not be allowed to over-run the market unopposed. It also demonstrated Daimler-Benz's new strategy of exploring every possibility to extend manufacturing outside Germany and develop new markets. This policy is being driven partly by the need to overcome the exchange rate disadvantages inherent in exporting from Germany. For example, the group board will decide this year whether to manufacture its planned Mercedes-Benz leisure vehicle in the US. According to Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman, there is a 'fair chance' that a new plant will be given the go-ahead. Meanwhile, the company will soon start assembling a small number of cars in Mexico, and has recently signed a joint venture to make cars in Korea. In a separate development, Siemens, Germany's largest electrical group, has taken a 49 per cent stake in a telephone distribution and service joint venture with TN Inc of Bangkok. The new company, TN Communications Systems, aims to win a 25 per cent market share. Siemens also recently founded a joint venture in Shanghai to make and distribute telephone switchboards. South-East Asian telecommunications markets are growing by more than 10 per cent a year compared with the world average of 3 to 4 per cent. German exports to China grew last year by a record 40 per cent to more than DM5.5bn (Pounds 2.33bn), while the country's leading exporters said their shipments to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore rose by more than 10 per cent. According to the Hamburg-based East Asia Association, the improvement in these markets more than offset a 10 per cent fall in exports to Japan last year.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By D'Jay Lazaro] </F>   [Text] The Pambansang Ugnayan ng Mamamayan Laban sa GATT  [National Association of Citizens Against GATT] (PUMALAG)  yesterday vowed to actively lobby against the GATT (General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) treaty which will be submitted  to the Senate for ratification.    Rafael Mariano, Kilusang Magbubukid sa Pilipinas [Peasants  Movement of the Philippines] (KMP) chair, and spokesman of  PUMALAG, which has 45 member organizations nationwide, said the  group will hold an anti-GATT summit to hear crystallize public  opinion on the effects of GATT.    Mariano said millions of small peasants and fisherfolk  nationwide will mark this coming 15 April, when representatives  from various governments around the world convene in Marrakesh,  Morocco for the GATT signing, as an "International Day of  Protest."    The ratification of GATT, Mariano said, would cut across  such  issues as social equity, food security, agricultural production,  trading and pricing, and environmental protection and  development.    "The Ramos Government's Medium Term Agricultural Program is  attuned with the GATT in its thrust to liberalize agricultural  imports which will put Filipino farm produce in an unfair  competition with relatively cheaper imports," he said.</p>

			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / International Company News: Shipping helps lift AP Moller profits 65% A. P. MOLLER, the shipping, shipbuilding and oil and gas group, increased annual net profits by 65 per cent to DKr1.92bn (Dollars 305m) from DKr1.16bn and profits before tax by 36 per cent to DKr2.78bn from DKr2.04bn. The boost to profits arose primarily from shipping, which doubled net profits to DKr1.51bn from DKr743m and increased profits before ship disposals and special items to DKr892m from DKr556m. The preliminary statement, which contains more detail than in previous years, shows an increase in net turnover in shipping to DKr20.18bn from DKr16.82bn. Turnover in the oil and gas activities increased to DKr3.32bn from DKr2.75bn. Group equity capital and reserves rose to DKr16.29bn from DKr14.53bn and total assets increased to DKr35.29bn from DKr30.20bn. Investments in the shipping business last year totalled DKr5.3bn, while APM's share of investments in North Sea oil and gas activities, in which it is in partnership with Texaco and Shell in Danish Underground Consortium, was DKr1.4bn. An increase in the dividend in the twin parent companies which control the group was proposed. The dividend in D/S 1912 will go up from 40 to 45 per cent to DKr97m and in D/S Svendborg from 40 to 60 per cent to DKr89m. Oil and gas activities, which comprise production from the Danish sector of the North Sea, gave an increase in operating profits to DKr1.47bn from DKr1.14bn, but net profits, after inter-group allocations and tax, were down to DKr113m from DKr126m. Results by the Maersk Line container fleet and the tanker fleet were better than in 1990, said the statement, while bulk carriers and gas tankers did slightly less well and the offshore rigs and supply vessels yielded unchanged results. Shipping results in 1992 are likely to be 'significantly below' 1991.</p>

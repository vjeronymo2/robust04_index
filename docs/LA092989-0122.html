			<p><P> September 29, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIMMING WORLD BEACON  </P> <P> Re: "America Killed Andre," Sept. 24, by Nikki Finke.  </P> <P> "America" killed Andre Coffyn?! What nonsense! Must we be subjected to such  nattering of yet another tiresome European emigre who came here, made a  fortune, achieved a degree of trendy notoriety and -- what else? -- bad-mouths  America? Quelle chutzpah!  </P> <P> As an immigrant myself, I deplore Michel Richard's crass ingratitude. Given his  own depiction of the privations of his childhood in France, Richard of all  people should understand that for all its problems, this country remains a  shining beacon for the rest of the world. Individuals from all over the globe  literally risk their very lives just for the chance to come here and become one  of us.  </P> <P> But the way he talks, to him America is evidently just a place to make lots of  money. His pockets bulging with American dollars, he pines -- oh, how he pines!  -- for an inn far away from bad America, in the countryside of France whose  citizenship he has so carefully retained.  </P> <P> Of course, there won't be so many ugly American dollars there, and local chefs  may offer stiffer competition for the francs of the local gourmets who might  prove just a tad more demanding than the trendy Westsiders. Ah, but think of  how "good" France is compared to America, and what wonderful opportunities  await the Richard children there -- eh, Michel?  </P> <P> GIDEON KANNER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

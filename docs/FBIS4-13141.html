			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Yes, Jordan Acts According to its Own </F> Conviction, and Does Not Implement Others' Policy"]    [Text] There is no longer any doubt that the Rabin  government is facing a difficult impasse these days. After  losing both its credibility and international reputation, and  after appearing as a terrorist state that supports terrorism,  the Rabin government has become nervous and upset and has begun  to blame others for its impasse.    When the Israeli Army's collusion with the racist settlers  in  committing the crime of the age at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque was  confirmed, the Rabin government chose to move its political  battle outside Israel. It did so particularly after its  clear-cut failure to confront the escalating intifadah and  fedayeen operations, represented by the 'Afula and Hadera  operations. This escalation embarrassed and confused the Rabin  government before the Israeli public opinion. It also doubled  the Israeli opposition's activity against the government and the  demand to topple it.    In order to calm the onslaught of the Likud opposition and  decrease the indignation of influential settlers, the Rabin  government leveled false accusations against Jordan, claiming  that Jordan supports terrorism, and using as a pretext a  statement made by a Hamas information spokesman, during his  stopover in Jordan, about the 'Afula and Hadera operations.  This is despite the fact that the Rabin government is fully  aware of the true principled Jordanian position.    As His Majesty King Husayn said while chairing part of the  Council of Ministers' session, Jordan does not recognize any  organization other than the PLO. Jordan also condemns terrorism  and has offered sacrifices and blood in confronting terrorism  and terrorists; the blood of Jordan's sons was shed in Arab and  foreign capitals at the hands of terrorists.    Since the very beginning, Jordan has believed that terrorism  does not make a just and comprehensive peace; on the contrary,  terrorism, as King Husayn said, kills peace and foils peace  initiatives. Now that the Palestinian people--who are  frustrated and on the verge of despair over the possibility of  achieving a just and comprehensive peace and regaining their  national rights--have determined to continue their struggle and  escalate their fedayeen operations and intifadah until the  occupation is removed. The Rabin government itself is the party  responsible for creating this frustration and despair among  Palestinian circles, political forces, and organizations.    Therefore, our kinsfolk in the occupied territories, as King  Husayn said, are determined to continue struggle and resistance  until occupation is removed. Also as King Husayn said,  Jordan--which condemns and fights terrorism because it conflicts  with the principles of our true religion, Islam, and with our  Arab values and ideals--acts according to its own conviction,  and will not accept to implement the convictions of others or  receive instructions from any party whatsoever. This is because  Israel is primarily responsible for the Palestinians'  frustration and despair and for the escalation in the acts of  violence and counterviolence.</p>

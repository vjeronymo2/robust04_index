			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (31): Foreign investors take stock - Privatisation With the rise and rise of the world's emerging markets foreign investors have naturally been showing keen interest in privatisation issues. In Singapore last October, for instance, the government's flotation of a 10 per cent stake in the telecommunications utility was some 10 times subscribed and the stock exchange extended its hours on the first day of trading to cope with the demand. Offered at SDollars 2.00 the shares initially rose to SDollars 5.00 and now trade at around SDollars 3.60, making it by far the largest company in terms of market capitalisation. Nearby, in Bangkok, TelecomAsia also became the largest capitalised company on Thailand's stock exchange when its shares were publicly traded for the first time in December, the shares closing the first session more than double the Bt55 (Dollars 2.15) offer price. The shares are now trading around the Bt130 level. While there was considerable domestic interest in these two issues, demand was really fuelled by overseas investors, looking for opportunities in what became a spectacular rally from the third quarter onwards for emerging markets in general. Kleiman International Consultants, a US-based consultancy which monitors emerging markets, reported earlier this month that OECD data found portfolio investment from the west and Japan 'climbed by half in 1992 (the last time data was available) to Dollars 94bn, outstripping official finance of Dollars 60bn for the first time'. The main reason for this was due to the extent of liberalisation and privatisation in the emerging economies: Kleiman notes that globally Dollars 70bn was transferred from state to private hands in 1993, with Latin America making up 30 per cent of that figure. It was not, however, a coincidence that telecommunications has been among the first sectors to take off, since it is an area to which emerging economies have been giving priority for growth. Among the regions Latin America has been leading the way: according to Baring Securities, market growth in this sector for the period 1990-1995 is estimated at 12 per cent, just exceeding the 11 per cent forecast for south-east Asia. By comparison the same source estimates something like 4 per cent growth in Europe and 2 per cent in north America. Taken in context Latin America's lead is not so surprising, since over the past few years the authorities in Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela have sold majority shares in the national telephone utilities. Meanwhile, foreign investors are awaiting opportunities elsewhere, particularly in Brazil where Telebras, the state-owned group, is seen as a sell-off candidate. However, the privatisation process in Brazil ran into difficulties at the end of last year when the government was forced to cancel the auction of Petroquimica Uniao, a petrochemical company. This embarrassing situation - the first time an auction had been cancelled in the country since 1991 - arose after it was revealed that less than 7 per cent of the shares on offer had been bought. The auction was finally completed on January 27. This contrasts with the sale of the Argentine government's 45 per cent stake in June 1993 of oil and gas group YPF, which has claims to being the oldest state oil company in the world. This was the second and by far the largest of the state's privatisations of its main energy groups, raising some Dollars 3bn, including an international tranche of some Dollars 2.3bn. The country's first sale was of federal gas and electricity companies in 1992 and the last the sale of Hidronor, the hydroelectricity generator which raised Dollars 1.1bn. YPF was heavily subscribed by the foreign community, being a high quality stock which is also traded in New York. Access is also helped by Argentina's deregulated market environment with no restrictions placed on access or repatriation of funds, and the fact that unlike many of the region's economies it has a stable currency which is pegged to the dollar. The oil group, now the most active issue in Buenos Aires with a market capitalisation of around Dollars 8.5bn, saw its shares rise steadily in the first weeks of trading, before settling down to the Dollars 25 level, one-third above the flotation price. Because of its listing in New York, most of the trade is now of the arbitrage kind - one estimate has put the amount at some Dollars 80m a day. With investors constantly searching for new investment opportunities eastern and central European countries have become popular, with many of that region's markets showing strong gains during 1993. In Poland, for example, the equity market, comprising just 22 shares, soared last year, demonstrating gains of some 700 per cent in dollar terms; and such enthusiasm has spilled over into Hungary and the Czech Republic. Privatisation is the key word to the region's performance. In Poland the government has pledged that it will give this area top priority, with between 20-30 'National Investment Funds', run by foreign and domestic investment managers, being set up to control the first round of privatisation. Last year the sale of a 30 per cent stake in Bank Slaski, one of the nine state-owned banks being sold through the government's privatisation of banks, was greatly over-subscribed, and the shares started trading at 13.5 times the 500,000 zloty (Dollars 23) offer price. Research, often one important difficulty with emerging markets, is improving with brokers such as Smith New Court, IMI Securities and Creditanstalt, the Austrian bank, active in Poland. The Czech Republic has also excited interest among foreign investors as its voucher privatisation scheme takes off, with shares in more than 1,300 companies being distributed between 8m voucher holders. A second round of privatisation, involving more than 700 companies worth nearly Dollars 5bn, is also under way. Most of the vouchers have been deposited with investment funds. Capitalising on interest in this region, Kleinwort Benson has just launched the European Privatisation Investment Trust, which raised some Pounds 320m in the pre-placement phase - the public offer closes on February 2 - some eight times the amount anticipated. Up to 20 per cent of the fund will be invested in eastern and central Europe.</p>

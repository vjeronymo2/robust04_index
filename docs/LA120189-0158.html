			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BOEING'S ENGINEERS, TECHNICAL WORKERS TO VOTE ON CONTRACT  </P> <P> The union representing Boeing Co.'s engineers and technical workers will give  its members a chance to vote on a company contract offer, though it won't  recommend passage or rejection, a spokesman said today.  </P> <P> Dan Mahoney, general counsel for the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees  Assn., said negotiations between Boeing's second-largest union and the company  concluded Thursday night.  </P> <P> Mahoney declined to give details of the contract other than to say it contains  "a lot of significant improvements."  </P> <P> SPEEA represents nearly 28,000 Boeing workers, with nearly all its members in  the Seattle area. It has been in talks to reach a new three-year contract since  Oct. 17.  </P> <P> Members of Boeing's largest union, the International Assn. of Machinists &amp;  Aerospace Workers, ratified a new three-year contract Nov. 20, ending a 48-day  strike.  </P> <P> SPEEA originally sought a 35% salary boost over three years. The union has  since scaled back its demands, but neither it nor Boeing has released details.  </P> <P> Mahoney said the union will vote by mail on the contract offer, with ballots to  be counted Dec. 18.  </P></p>

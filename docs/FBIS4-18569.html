			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Bjarne Nitovuori: "Finland's Security Policy: No </F> Problems in United Europe"]    [Text] From a security policy aspect, membership in the  European Union [EU] would be without problems for Finland, if  Europe becomes integrated and the old bifurcation does not  recur.    But if Europe again splits into two blocs, as intimated by  the conflicts in East Europe, the setbacks suffered by the  reformists in Russia, and the signs of an emergence of a Russian  nationalistic foreign policy, then it will become difficult for  Finland to combine an EU membership with military nonalliance.    This is the conclusion reached in a study conducted by the  Institute of International Affairs regarding the consequences EU  membership would have on Finland's foreign and security  policies. The study was prepared by researcher Jukka Salovaara.    The study also emphasizes the fact that the ramifications of  an EU membership are dependent on whether Finland also makes a  military commitment, and on the direction Europe's development  takes.  <H5>  New Possibilities </H5>   As a member of the EU, Finland must commit itself to a  common  foreign and security policy, but the common policy only applies  to issues and activities regarding which there is consensus,  notes Salovaara. This commitment is counterweighted by new  possibilities opening for Finland's foreign policy.    As far as the possibilities to affect the common policy of  the EU are concerned, Salovaara makes a division into three  categories.    First of all, there are areas where policies conducted by  the  EU are well established, and where Finland must increase its  expertise, in order to exert any influence. This applies,  primarily, to the Middle East policy, but pertains also to  policies regarding CSCE and the UN.    In regard to the CSCE policy, there are no major differences  between Finland and the EU countries, nor as far as policies  toward the UN are concerned, remarks Salovaara. He notes  however, that, for example, as far as South Africa is concerned,  Denmark, in spite of its EC membership, has been able together  with the other Nordic Countries to take another tack than the EC  countries, and that Nordic cooperation in regard to UN policy  could also be conceivable in the future.    Secondly, there are areas where the policy conducted by the  EU will get a different emphasis, such as, for example, the  policy toward Russia and East Europe. EU membership would give  Finland's policy toward Russia new dimensions. Thirdly,  Salovaara believes that Finland, as an EU member, can add a new  Nordic dimension to foreign policy conducted by the Union. That  could lead to increased EU interest in the areas on Finland's  eastern border. Finland is unable by itself to solve the  problems afflicting these areas.    If Finland were to stay outside the EU, and Norway and  Sweden  also did so, then cooperation among the Nordic Countries could  be developed. If Sweden and Norway join the EU, but Finland does  not, then the relationship with Russia becomes more important.  The difference compared to the Cold War era would be that West  Europe's outer border would pass between Sweden and Finland. The  study notes, that this would make Nordic cooperation, in its  current form, difficult.    As far as defense solutions are concerned, Salovaara  presents  four different options, depending on whether Finland joins or  does not join the EU, and depending on whether Finland joins the  military alliance or not.    If Finland does not become a member, neutrality becomes the  most likely option. If Sweden also does not become a member, a  defense alliance with Sweden could be a possibility. Based on  the geopolitical status of the countries and historical  experiences, Salovaara deems this improbable.    The fact that the relationship with Russia could become of  central importance, is based, among other things, on the  realization that Finland lately has come to assume greater  military strategic importance for Russia. This has resulted from  the partial retreat of the Russian Baltic fleet to St.  Petersburg, and because the Kola Peninsula is assuming greater  importance than previously in Russian strategy.    As an EU member, Finland may still be militarily nonaligned  and have an independent defense. However, the Maastricht treaty  includes a statement regarding the goal of establishing a common  defense policy, which in time may lead to a common defense.    The study conducted by the Institute of International  Affairs  does not, however, provide an answer to the question of what the  ramifications of a common defense policy are. Salovaara believes  that no far-reaching decisions will be able to be made by the  government conference in 1995.    He assumes, however, that the EU will have some expectations  of Finland, after it has joined, primarily because the Union  then would have a long common border with Russia.    The study regarding foreign and security policies is one of  the studies that yesterday were presented in regard to the  consequences of Finland joining the EU or remaining outside.  Another study pertained to regional policies, and was prepared  by Hannu Tervo, Hannu Niittykangas, and Tuomo Nenonen from the  Economic Research Center of Central Finland .    During yesterday's presentation ceremony, Nenonen noted that  integration, in general, should provide an economic growth  impulse for the economy as a whole. Regional distribution is  not, however, expected to change from the impact of the EEA  [European Economic Area] treaty. On the other hand, the  assumption is that the EU will provide a stronger economic  growth impulse that the EEA did.    Competition will become tougher, which will cause problems  for the weaker regions. However, in the long run, the endeavors  of local businesses and the regions' own efforts will be of  decisive importance, noted Nenonen.</p>

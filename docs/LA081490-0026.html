			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEW;  </P> <P> A WOODY HERMAN EVENING TO REMEMBER  </P> <P> The dancers were ready, the ballroom lights were dimmed, the clarinetist raised  his horn and wailed his way into the eternal strains of "Blue Flame," the  band's famous theme. It was deja vu all over again, except for one thing: The  clarinetist wasn't Woody Herman.  </P> <P> The scene was the Marriott Hotel in Irvine, where a concert and dance was  staged under the direction of Frank Tiberi, who joined Herman's orchestra in  1969 and assumed leadership upon the maestro's death in 1987.  </P> <P> That this was an evening for remembering rather than innovating was hardly a  surprise; nor was the fact that the dance floor was often crowded. After all,  the first date Herman ever played (in 1936, long before any of the present  sidemen were born) was at a Brooklyn dance hall.  </P> <P> Tiberi learned well during his years with Herman. He has even developed a  clarinet personality reminiscent of Woody's own thin, reedy sound, although  most of the time he plays tenor as one of the four sax players who, with  remarkable fidelity, brought back the special pleasure of Ralph Burns' "Early  Autumn."  </P> <P> Tiberi also functions as an affable frontman whose comments help make these  vintage sounds accessible to those for whom "Woodchopper's Ball" and "Apple  Honey" are perhaps only vaguely familiar.  </P> <P> Like every Herman Herd, this is essentially a young ensemble, one that stays  together on a year-round basis despite a fair amount of personnel shifting.  This week, because of transportation costs, there are two local ringers, Frank  Strazzeri on piano and the drummer Paul Kreibach.  </P> <P> Among the regulars, a seven-man brass team attacked the charts crisply and with  warm conviction. Outstanding among the soloists was, coincidentally, a native  son of Irvine, Ron Stout, whose dark, mellow sound enables him to make the  trumpet seem like a fluegelhorn. Next to him in the horn section was Kye  Palmer, who distinguished himself in an arrangement of "Body and Soul" that  managed, with the help of Tiberi's arrangement, to give CPR to the 60-year-old  ballad.  </P> <P> There were a few unfamiliar charts: "Just in Time" arranged by ex-Basie drummer  Dennis Mackrel, and Tiberi's reworking of an old Neal Hefti piece,  "Repetition," during which his tenor solo assumed the role originally taken by  Charlie Parker.  </P> <P> In the sax section, the three tenor players traded solos with spirit on "Four  Brothers" and Mike Brignola's brisk baritone achieve a commendable mix of  rhythmic conviction and melodic creation.  </P> <P> Clearly this is not a band that is about to make history; it is rather the sign  of a welcome continuum in the story of an orchestra that made its unique impact  over a span of a half century. Tiberi deserves kudos for the honesty for which  he is carrying forward the lingering blue flame. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

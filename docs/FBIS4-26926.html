			<p>BFN     [Text] It is true the Governor would feel less sure of  pushing his electoral package through the Legislative Council  [Legco] if the three ex officio members were not allowed to  vote. It is also true they represent the government, not the  people of Hong Kong, and that their right to vote is an  anachronism which distorts the democratic process. Both the  present and future sovereign powers recognise this.    But the demand from some in the Liberal Party that they be  banned from voting on the electoral package tomorrow is  self-serving. The main proponents of this attempt at rigging  the vote in the opposite direction are Henry Tang Ying-yen, an  appointee (who represents nobody) and Howard Young, who as  tourism representative can hardly claim to speak for the people  of Hong Kong. If those who argue against allowing  unrepresentative members to vote were consistent, they would  demand the abstention of all 10 appointed members. They might  also urge the abstention of unrepresentative Functional  Constituency members as well.    Legco is not representative. That is why appointed members  and the officials will be dumped on the scrap heap next year.  It is also why Chris Patten is trying to extend the franchise  and why the Basic Law recognises future advances in electoral  representation.    But it is simply not sensible, or desirable, to try to  change  the rules of the Legco game according to a standard of  democratic representation which has never been applied in the  past. Legco as it is currently constituted, flaws and all, is  the only body which can decide on the competing electoral reform  plans.</p>

This was said by Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk during a meeting with Polish Defense  Minister Piotr Kolodziejczyk. The head of the Ukrainian state  and the chief of the Polish defense department discussed a wide  range of issues concerning deepening [word indistinct]  cooperation, including defense, as well as protecting peace and  stability in the region.

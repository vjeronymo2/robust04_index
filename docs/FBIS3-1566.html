			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Liu Zhenying (0491 2182 5391), Central People's </F> Broadcasting Station reporter, and XINHUA reporter He Ping (0149  1627)]    [Excerpts] Beijing, 25 Feb (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng had  an informal meeting in Zhongnanhai this afternoon with comrades  from grass-roots political and legal affairs departments,  enterprises, institutions, and relevant central authorities in  Beijing. During the meeting, Li Peng solicited their views on  how to improve the comprehensive management of public security  and build an environment in which people can live and work in  contentment -- issues that are to be discussed in the government  work report (draft for soliciting comments) that he will soon  present to the second session of the Eighth National People's  Congress for deliberation.    When the meeting began, Li Peng said: Public security is an  issue of public concern. We all want a stable environment in  which to work and live. While we have achieved certain  successes in this regard, there are still areas with which  people are not satisfied. I hope that you will say anything that  you wanted to say with regard to improving the comprehensive  management of public security and building a better democratic  and legal system.    Those attending the meeting actively presented their views  and suggestions about the actual state of public security.  [passage omitted]    They said: The problems that affect the comprehensive  management of public security today are theft, highway and train  robberies, a lack of order in certain urban districts, and  troubles caused by ruffians and other evil forces. This being  the case, party and government departments' attention and  support are essential for the better comprehensive management of  public security, and they must take up the responsibility of  ensuring local peace by following through on Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's strategic thought that firm efforts must be made to  promote material construction and socialist ethics at the same  time, by providing stronger leadership over the comprehensive  management of public security, by firmly cracking down on crimes  that jeopardize people's lives and property as well as the  modernization drive, and by waging deep-going struggles against  what is socially vile.    Li Peng thanked them for their opinions, which were needed  for the revision of the government work report. He also  indicated that he would improve and replenish the report in  accordance with their views and suggestions.    Li Peng said: Improving the comprehensive management of  public security and safeguarding public stability is an  important task of the CPC and the government this year. Not  only is this the demand of the people, but it is also a  responsibility that party and government departments -- and  especially political and legal affairs departments -- must not  evade. Party and government departments must consider this task  a routine assignment. He pointed out: The most essential  requirement for accomplishing this assignment is to integrate  the handling of special projects with the mass line. This is to  say that we must fully arouse the initiatives of the masses, all  social sectors, and relevant departments, and must broadly  mobilize and organize the masses to take an active part in the  comprehensive management of public security, giving full scope  to the roles of all departments in maintaining social stability  so that the problem can be solved with combined efforts.  Comprehensive management cannot be effective unless the  strength of all quarters has been rallied.    Li Peng stressed: While managing public security  comprehensively, we must pay special attention to properly  handling all types of contradictions among the people during the  new period. We must be good at mediating disputes, alleviating  contradictions, dissolving negative factors, and nip in the bud  all problems affecting public security. Meanwhile, people's  governments must always keep in mind the need to serve the  people wholeheartedly; give top priority to hearing the people's  voices, showing concern for their interests, and solving their  plight; and serve the people with more good and practical  services so that there will be closer flesh-and-blood ties  between the party and the government on the one hand and the  people on the other, and so that our work can win the masses'  support.    Li Peng said: To do an even better job in carrying out the  comprehensive management of public security, governments at all  levels must improve their analysis of the state of public  security, give priority to preventing and cracking down on  special crimes at the same time, and deal with the root causes  as well as the symptoms. [passage omitted]    Among those present at the meeting were Ren Jianxin, member  of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat and chairman of the  Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public  Security; and Luo Gan, State Councillor and vice chairman of the  Central Committee for the Comprehensive Management of Public  Security.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Jose Durao Barroso by Milos </F> Sklenka; place and date not given: "The Poor European Union  States Expect Solidarity From the Rich Member Countries"]    [Text] [Sklenka] Portugal is one of the poor countries on  the so-called southern wing of the European Union [EU]. Do you  give priority to intensifying integration within the framework  of the current Twelve or do you favor EU enlargement?    [Durao Barroso] Intensifying multilateral cooperation among  the current EU member countries and enlarging the Brussels based  organization are communicating vessels. The two processes must  take place concurrently without us giving priority to or  accelerating one of them.    Creating a new united Europe on the basis of closer  integration is the logical outcome of cooperation on the  continent. The Maastricht Treaty on European Union, which has  been signed and ratified by all 12 of the current community  members, defines quite clearly the image of the future  integrated Europe. Not only is the trend toward intensifying  internal integration among the member states becoming apparent  within the framework of creating a political, economic, and  monetary union, but the rules for the future EU enlargement are  also being defined at the same time.    The fact that the EU has now opened itself to the north in  no  way discounts its possible enlargement toward the East in the  future. In the case of Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway,  however, it was agreed that their affiliation to the EU will not  be linked to the Union's institutional reform. The talks on the  admission of the East European countries -- which can begin only  after the EU intergovernment conference in 1996 -- will,  however, undoubtedly take place against the background of the  reform of the present EU organizational structures.    [Sklenka] Realistically, when could such talks be initiated  with the Central and East European countries?    [Durao Barroso] It is necessary to proceed from the premise  that such a step can only be taken if the two sides are well  prepared for it. Admission into the Brussels based organization  will mean a completely new situation for both the European Union  and the interested parties from the postcommunist countries. In  our case, it is essential to ensure that the correct formula for  institutional reform is found with the proviso that the EU does  not lose its ability to function and operate, for instance, as a  20- or 24-member organization. On the other hand, the candidate  countries must adapt their economies and legal systems to the  West European arrangement.    Specifically, the Czech Republic -- whose entry into the EU  is supported on all sides -- must reckon with abandoning some  jurisdiction concerning national sovereignty and also  fundamental changes in its legislation, beginning with the  regulations on domestic trade and ending with foreign policy.  Of course, it is necessary to modernize and liberalize further  the economy and to prepare the entrepreneurial sphere for a free  competitive environment.    [Sklenka] However, opinions are sometimes expressed in  Portugal that reveal anxiety about the rapid admission into the  EU of the countries of Central and East Europe, because this  could reduce the financial aid for Lisbon from the Twelve's  structural funds, aid that would be directed toward the East.    [Durao Barroso] Such anxiety is absolutely unfounded. During  the EU summit in Edinburgh at the end of 1992, a package of  financial aid from the structural funds and the solidarity fund  was approved as a prerequisite for the joint journey of all 12  countries from the Brussels based organization toward political,  economic, and monetary union. Within the framework of economic  and social solidarity, the rich countries of northern Europe  have committed themselves to assist the poorer countries in  achieving the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty for  admission into the EU. The financial aid for the years 1993-99  has been fixed and is not linked to the EU's enlargement.    [Sklenka] There is no risk of a two or more-speed Europe,  then?    [Durao Barroso] By signing and ratifying the Maastricht  documents, all the European Union member states have committed  themselves to economic and social solidarity. All of the  prescribed parameters for convergence should be fulfilled by the  end of 1999 at the latest. If someone were to cast doubt on  this principle for a joint course of action now, he would -- at  the same time --be repudiating the very essence of closer  European cooperation and thus de facto be demolishing the  foundations of the future federal Europe, foundations that are  being laid only very slowly.    It is unacceptable to us for certain rich countries to use  the cyclical difficulties and still extant differences in  economic and social development within the European Union and  embark themselves along a quicker path. That would, obviously,  mean the end of the idea of pan-European integration and of a  united Europe in general.</p>

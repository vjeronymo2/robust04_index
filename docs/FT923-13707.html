			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Church sees Pounds 500m wiped off value of property investments: Commissioners borrowed heavily to fund speculative developments just before market fell NEARLY Pounds 500m has been wiped off the value of the Church of England's property investments after heavy borrowing to fund speculative developments in Britain and the US just before the market plunged. The financial debacle which has hit the Church's income was the result of a decision by the Church Commissioners to expand their property assets before the market crashed in 1990. This has emerged from a detailed investigation by the Financial Times into the finances of the Commissioners, who manage Pounds 2.7bn in investments to help pay for the salaries and pensions of the 11,300 Anglican clergy and a similar number of pensioners. A majority of the borrowings, which reached nearly Pounds 520m at their peak in 1990, were provided by National Westminster Bank on an unsecured basis. These were used for speculative property developments in offices, shopping centres and warehouses many of which have exceeded their budgeted cost or failed to find enough tenants. After this disastrous expansion, the Church Commissioners' income is expected to be flat for some years. To meet pay and pension costs that will rise at more than Pounds 5m a year, the Church is appealing to parish-ioners to bridge the gap. month the Church Commissioners, whose chairman is Dr George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, blamed their investment problems on the recession. The Commissioners' affairs are managed by a board of governors which includes several bishops, Mr Michael Allison, the Tory MP, and other prominent lay members including a leading actuary and a former chief executive of the M&amp;G unit trust group. Its asset committee, which dictates investment policy, has recently been strengthened by the appointment of Sir Christopher Wates of Wates City of London Properties. The manager in charge of property at the Church Commissioners until last year was Mr Michael Hutchings. Described as a flamboyant character by former colleagues, he refused to travel by air and took the QE2 to visit the Church's US investments. News of the Church Commissioners' financial crisis comes after a recent High Court case in which the Bishop of Oxford challenged their investment policies. He called for greater emphasis to be placed on ethical considerations. The court found in favour of the Commissioners, concluding that their existing ethical approach, which precludes investment in such industries as tobacco and armaments, reflected a proper exercise of the Commissioners' powers. In an interview, Sir Douglas Lovelock, the First Church Estates Commissioner, defended the decision to borrow for speculative development. Without borrowing, he said, the Commissioners could not have afforded to buy such successful investments as the MetroCentre in Gateshead, the largest shopping centre in Europe,now valued at more than Pounds 200m. But he acknowledged that other developments had been less successful. The Commissioners had too much property for historical reasons and were reducing it, he added. A spokeswoman for Chesterton, which acted as estates consultant to the Commissioners and introduced property developments to them, said yesterday that the firm was not in a position to comment. Chesterton also valued the properties to see how the investment had performed. Asked if valuations should not have been provided by a separate firm of surveyors, Sir Douglas said: 'We've always done it this way.' But added: 'We don't just accept it at face value.' Since the beginning of 1990 the Church Commissioners have sold investment properties with a book value of more than Pounds 350m in an attempt to reduce their exposure to property. But their remaining property holdings of Pounds 1.4bn still account for 56 per cent of the portfolio, compared with 7 to 8 per cent for the average pension fund. The MetroCentre in Gateshead accounts for more than a fifth of their UK commercial properties, which are valued at over Pounds 900m. Last year the Church Commissioners reduced their borrowings to Pounds 383m. A further Pounds 171m falls due for payment this year. Unholy saga, Weekend Page I</p>

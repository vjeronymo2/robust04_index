			<p><P> April 12, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RETAILERS PUT BLAME FOR MEDIOCRE MARCH SALES ON LATE EASTER  </P> <P> Some of the nation's big retailers today reported mediocre March sales due in  part to this year's later Easter.  </P> <P> The largest chain store reporting was discounter K mart Corp., which blamed the  calendar shift for a so-so performance.  </P> <P> "Sales were strong in the first two weeks of March but, because of the later  date for Easter in 1990 than in 1989, sales weakened in line with expectations  in the latter part of the month," said Joseph E. Antonini, K mart chairman and  chief executive officer.  </P> <P> The retailers' results were compared with March, 1989, when stores drew  customers because of holiday promotions to push everything from spring clothing  to candy. Easter fell on March 26 last year.  </P> <P> Several major mass merchandisers, such as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Wal-Mart  Stores Inc., posted their March sales a week ago as did a few department store  groups. Overall, those results were sluggish. The exceptions were the perennial  star performer Wal-Mart and stores concentrating on apparel.  </P></p>

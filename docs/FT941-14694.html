			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Elf Aquitaine While yesterday's large fall in full-year profits at Elf Aquitaine is a gloomy preamble to privatisation, the stock market was primed to expect the worst. The combination of a weak oil price and European recession was always going to be painful. The asset writedowns which cloud the figures look like a classic case of deck-clearing before new shareholders are invited aboard. With large exploration and production interests - and production rising through the middle of the decade - Elf should be well placed to benefit from any upturn in the oil price. Other parts of the empire are more difficult to judge. Overcapacity in petrochemicals is likely to hold back Elf's plastics interests, even as economic recovery takes hold. Petrol retailing in France faces intense competition as hypermarkets muscle in. That points to more restructuring if Mr Philippe Jaffre, who took over as chairman in August, is prepared to use the freedom of privatisation. With gearing approaching 50 per cent, he might also question the logic of maintaining Elf Aquitaine's portfolio of shareholdings. Yesterday's writedown of financial assets may not be the last. Measured against cash flow, Elf Aquitaine looks cheap compared with other big oil companies. But that has been true for some years without prompting a re-rating of the shares. A yield over 4.5 per cent amounts to a more persuasive argument for taking the plunge. Since the company accounts for around 8 per cent of the CAC-40 share index, international investors with a hunger for French equities may be unable to resist.</p>

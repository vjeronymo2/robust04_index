			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "There Is Only One Russia, Whereas </F> Crimean `Sons' Are Plentiful"]    [Text] Meetings of two political councils -- of the  "Russian Society of the Crimea" and of the "Russian Party of  Sevastopol" -- were held in Simferopol. (On the eve of the  presidential elections on the peninsula, the "Russian Party of  Sevastopol" seceded from the "Russian Party of the Crimea" and  created its own separate organization.) A number of appeals to  the electorate of the Crimean Republic were adopted, in  particular, not to take part in the elections to Ukraine's  Supreme Council and also to the Crimean Supreme Council in  accordance with party lists. The voters are urged not to accept  these two ballots at electoral wards. Such a position is due to  the fact that the aforementioned Crimean movements do not  consider the Crimea to be a part of Ukrainian territory.    With regard to elections to the Crimean parliament, the  "Russian Society of the Crimea" and the "Russian Party of  Sevastopol" are convinced that, today, the "Rossiya" [Russia]  bloc is not what it used to be when it brought [Crimean  President] Yu. Meshkov to power. According to chairman of the  "Russian Party of Sevastopol," deputy of the Crimean Supreme  Council and of the Sevastopol City Council Aleksandr Kruglov,  the "Rossiya" bloc has been joined by those people who betray  Russian ideas. The voters are urged to vote for individual  personalities, proceeding from their specific personal  characteristics, and not for candidates of the "Rossiya" bloc  during the Crimean elections to the Supreme Council that will be  held in accordance with the majority system.</p>

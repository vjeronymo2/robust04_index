			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 12 SAPA -- Independent Electoral  Commission [IEC] Chief Justice Johan Kriegler, who met  Bophuthatswana President Lucas Mangope in the early hours of  Saturday [12 March], had failed to obtain the cooperation of the  homeland leader with regard to the April election, President F W  de Klerk said.    "The government accordingly believes that very firm action  is  now required to ensure stability within Bophuthatswana and to  ensure that free and fair elections will take place throughout  the territory," Mr de Klerk said in a statement to SAPA.    An earlier statement released by the IEC on Saturday made no  reference to the failure to obtain President Mangope's  cooperation in regard to the election.    "As indicated yesterday, Judge Johan Kriegler, the chairman  of the Independent Electoral Commission, at the request of the  government, visited President Mangope as a follow up to the  announcement made earlier by President Mangope with regard to  his participation in the forthcoming election," said President  de Klerk's statement. "The purpose of judge Kriegler's visit  was to ensure the full cooperation of President Mangope with  regard to the election and all other aspects related to the  electoral and constitutional process in Bophuthatswana. I have  now been informed that the assurances that were sought by the  IEC could not be obtained.    "The government accordingly believes that very firm action  is  now required to ensure stability within Bophuthatswana and to  ensure that free and fair elections will take place throughout  the territory. I have consequently instructed Minister Roelf  Meyer, who is attending this (Saturday) morning's meeting of the  management committee of the TEC [Transitional Executive  Council], to obtain the cooperation of the TEC for all steps  which might reasonably be necessary to ensure this. Minister  Meyer will be making certain specific proposals on behalf of the  government in this regard."    The earlier IEC statement said that during the meeting  between Mr Mangope and the commission "full and cordial  discussions took place regarding President Mangope's announced  recommendation (to take part in the April election)".    The IEC statement recalled that Mr Mangope had on Friday  "issued a statement relating to a recommendation he intended  making to the Bophuthatswana Parliament concerning the upcoming  South African elections. Pursuant thereto and in view of the  unrest that had broken out in Bophuthatswana, the IEC resolved  to communicate urgently with President Mangope and also with the  South African Government and the TEC. Thereafter, at the joint  request of President de Klerk and Mr Mandela, Judge Kriegler and  Advocate (Dikgang) Moseneke, chairman and vice-chairman of the  IEC, met urgently with President Mangope in the early hours of  this morning...    "The IEC representatives were also requested by President  Mangope to convey to Messers de Klerk and Mandela his concerns  about the violence and consequent loss of life, damage to  property and 'politically instigated intimidation' in his  country. The IEC has reported accordingly to Messers Roelf  Meyer and Cyril Ramaphosa on behalf of their principals."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Kirill Strzhizhovskiy] </F>   [Excerpts] Moscow, 12 Apr -- Russia firmly condemns the  pointless bloody slaughter carried out in Kigali and the killing  of the prime minister and other state figures, a representative  of the Africa Department of the Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs said in an interview for the ITAR-TASS correspondent.  [passage omitted]    At present the situation in Rwanda is continuing to  deteriorate. The aborted cease-fire talks produced no result.  The events in Rwanda have dealt a serious political blow to the  Arusha peace process and the United Nations' peacekeeping  operation has been put in jeopardy.    Russia calls on the opposing sides to halt hostilities  immediately and to resume a constructive dialogue with the  participation of all the country's political forces in order to  settle the domestic political conflict in Rwanda as soon as  possible on the basis of the Arusha accords and the relevant UN  Security Council decisions, said the representative of the  Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>

			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Arts: A legend in search of form - Recital The celebrated German mezzo Brigitte Fassbaender is already something of a legend: since making her debut in the early 1960s, she has sung many of the great mezzo roles in the world's leading opera houses, and recently she has also turned her hand to directing opera. She is admired on the concert platform, and as the warm reception she received at the Wigmore Hall last week shows she has a devoted following. Her artistry has always been highly individual, but in this recital her opening group of Mahler songs disclosed some worrying mannerisms. Fassbaender's instrument is perhaps not as flexible as it was, and hardens under pressure. Of course, great interpretations are not made on sheer vocal beauty alone; but the occasional lapses of intonation would have mattered less had she brought a sense of life - vital in Mahler - and been less free with dynamics. The opening Rheinlegendchen had a Weillian, coarseness about it, and she missed the radiance of Liebst du um Schonheit. At least she captured the lonely desolation of another Ruckert setting, Ich bin der Weltabhanden gekommen. Indeed: her approach seemed wholly better suited to Aribert Reimann's stark Eingedunkelt cycle, written for Fassbaender and premiered by her last year, here receiving its first UK performance. A setting of nine short impressions of Auschwitz by the poet Paul Celan (pseudonym of the Romanian Paul Antsohel, who lost both his parents in a concentration camp), the cycle succeeds as a powerful lament where the horror of its subject can defy description. Eingedunkelt is set for a lone, unaccompanied voice and Fassbaender delivered the mournful, declamatory lines with incisive eloquence. The second half of the programme brought a reminder of Fassbaender's diversity and was pure, unalloyed pleasure. In two early Berg songs, Wo der Goldregen steht and Ferne Lider, she found the sense of line missing from her Mahler, and allowed the beauty of her voice to come through. The programme lightened up with Milhaud's cheeky Trois chansons de negresse, Fassbaender caressing the lines like a chanteuse and her pianist, Wolfram Riegen (who had been excellent in Berg's four Op 2 Lieder) coming into his own with the swinging accompaniments. Fassbaender put everything into her final group of Weill Songs, delivering such numbers as Nannas Lied, Wie lange noch? and Berlin im Licht with pungent vocal utterance. These seemed to say the most about Fassbaender's art today.</p>

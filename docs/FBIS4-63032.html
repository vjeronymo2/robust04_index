			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksey Kirpichnikov report in the "Ambitions" column: </F> "Shakhray Does Not Want To Be Chernomyrdin's Deputy. Yet  Another Resignation of the PRES Leader"]    [Text] Sergey Shakhray has tendered his resignation as  deputy prime minister. The official reason is his dismissal as  minister of nationalities and regional policy and the  appointment of a successor "even without formal consideration  for the opinion of the deputy prime minister in charge of these  matters." Mr. Shakhray stated that his resignation "does not  mean a move toward opposing the president or government, or any  personal grudge."    The statement expresses the hope that the dismissal is not  connected with the deputy prime minister's order about a  financial inspection of the former State Committee for Northern  Territories [Goskomsever], pressure by any regional groups, or  "intrigues from the president's inner circle."    So far it is hard to judge how substantiated the first hope  is (Goskomsever's involvement). Yet the next one has already  been called into question by one regional group -- from  Chechnya. The deputy prime minister believed negotiations with  the republic would be possible only after new presidential and  parliamentary elections there, while the president and  parliament have no intention of quitting early, describing Mr.  Shakhray as unobjective. The Chechen opposition, on the other  hand, agrees with his self-assessment ("no one understands the  question of nationality policy better than I") and believes that  it was precisely at the moment when Russia has developed a  clear-cut position on a settlement in Chechnya that the deputy  prime minister has been removed by "power structures connected  with Dzhokhar Dudayev and oil and arms."    The hope about the absence of "intrigues" appears totally  insincere. Tentatively, at least three can be pointed out. Mr.  Shakhray was one of the initiators of the political amnesty  while Mr. Rutskoy, released by him, came out with unveiled  threats during the recent May Day festivities. The PRES was  created mainly thanks to the structures of Mr. Shakhray's  ministry and this, incidentally, also makes it doubtful that Mr.  Shakhray's long-standing associate Aleksandr Kotenkov will keep  the post of deputy minister and even that another PRES leader,  Aleksadr Shokhin, will retain his vice premiership. Finally,  Shakhray's removal means a certain weakening of the positions of  Viktor Chernomyrdin who recently not only began a rapprochement  with the State Duma but also wrested too much power from the  presidential structures. Therefore to deprive the cabinet head  of contact with the territories via Shakhray is the first step  toward curbing the prime minister's powers. There are also  stories about the role of Yeltsin's aide Ilyushin and  presidential chief of staff Filatov, who endorsed the  resignation, about a future deputy prime minister's job for  Emergency Situations Minister Sergey Shoygu, and so forth.    If the resignation is accepted, Mr. Shakhray will  automatically cease to be a member of two councils: The  Security Council and the Cadres Policy Council. But the main  thing is that PRES, based mainly on a regional elite, is losing  powerful support and its future is becoming murky.</p>

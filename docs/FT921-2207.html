			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Letter: Freedom of choice is important element of UK pension system Sir, As providers of both final salary and money purchase schemes, including personal pensions, my company has no need to take sides over their rival merits. Our views are therefore likely to be more balanced than Philip Chappell's (Personal View, March 13). Each method has considerable merits and can deliver substantial pensions. Equally, each has shortcomings when compared with the other. With money purchase, for example, the pension you retire on cannot be finally known until the day you retire - a disconcerting thought if you have fastened on a particular proportion of final pay as the pension you want. Final salary safely delivers certainty, assuming no Maxwell rerun, but the uncertainty of money purchase might mean a better than expected pension, not worse. Final pay can be criticised for its cross-subsidies. But these do not work uniformly from leavers to stayers, young to old, or low paid to high paid. They can, and frequently do, operate by means of enhanced benefits, for example, for ordinary employees who are forced into retirement by ill-health or redundancy. A strict money purchase approach could not manage such treatment. The important element in today's pension system is the genuine freedom of choice for employers and their employees to exercise over which pensions route to follow.

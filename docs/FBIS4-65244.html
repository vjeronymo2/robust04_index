			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Tino Oldani and Renzo Rosati: "A Comprehensive </F> Map of the New Government"]    [Text] Berlusconi's, Bossi's, and Fini's people, and those  of the opposing alliances. Here is an initial "who's who" of the  Second Republic.    Initially, Irene Pivetti was expected to become  leader in the Chamber of Deputies and Carlo  Scognamiglio in the Senate, but now--with the cabinet being  formed, and given the alternation in every area that the  principles of alternation require--the presence of new faces and  unexpected personages promises, in a sense, to become the rule  rather than the exception during this transition from the First  Republic to the Second. Within a few weeks the pictures of a  defeated (and often not excessively old) nomenklatura will  disappear from the Palazzo walls and be replaced by the  definitely younger faces of the victors--of a smiling  Silvio Berlusconi, a sullen Umberto Bossi,  and a stern Gianfranco Fini. This will attest to the  fact that the advent of the new political class is accompanied  by a revolution that even has an anthropological aspect and  seems destined to lay siege--in concentric circles--to the  entire hierarchy of power in the public administration, the  banks, industry and finance, the press and television, the  judiciary, and the police.    A downright morbid curiosity has developed with respect to  the selection of the new key figures in the government,  beginning with the ministers who will be part of a still  hypothetical Berlusconi cabinet. All the newspapers constructed  and published--over a period of days--their own hypothetical  organization charts. Were these lists either right or wrong? The  leader of Forza Italia has dismissed them with the comment,  "They are fantasies." In his opinion, these lists of cabinet  ministers were wrong on two counts. First, they appeared to have  been compiled using the Cencelli manual and a logic--based on a  new version of the patronage system--that the Knight  [Berlusconi] finds intolerable; moreover, they did not at all  have either the appearance or the substance of an administration  of the Milan [Berlusconi's soccer club] type, that is to say, a  victorious administration composed of outstanding individuals,  which is his supreme desire. "Organizing a good team will take  time," Berlusconi cautioned, "all the time that is necessary."  His words surprised no one who is aware of Berlusconi's  convictions and of his modus operandi.    Berlusconi is a tenacious advocate of the free-market  economic theory known as "self-fulfilling prophecies" [preceding  two words in English], that is to say, "prophecies that become  true by dint of believing them." It is a principle that when  translated into action means setting for oneself, from time to  time, a great strategic objective--a goal that is increasingly  ambitious--and then striving with all one's energies and those  of one's team solely to attain it. From all appearances, this is  also the way Berlusconi built his fortune: first with the model  urban districts, then as a TV entrepreneur, then as a publisher,  and finally as president of the Milan soccer club.    If this is the logic employed, one can understand why  Berlusconi wants only outstanding individuals for his cabinet,  chosen freely as provided for by the Constitution. An example?  His most ambitious goal is to convince Antonio Di  Pietro--the magistrate most beloved by the Italians--to  accept the post of interior minister. Although the initial  indications in response were not encouraging, Berlusconi has not  given up. Is Di Pietro too heavily involved in the final stages  of the Cusani trial? No problem: the Knight immediately made it  known that the government will not be formed overnight. His  principal supporter in making this choice is Fini, who has  always maintained good relations with the judge, who is the  symbol of Operation Clean Hands. For this reason Giuseppe  Tatarella, one of the leaders of the National Alliance  [AN], took the field with an explicit invitation: "Di Pietro,"  he says, "is one of the founding fathers of the Second Republic,  and we are now asking him to help build it. It is a choice that  should be made from the perspective of history rather than that  of the daily news columns."    While waiting for a "yes" from Di Pietro, the Knight has  already obtained one from from two high-ranking civil servants:  Lamberto Dini, general manager of the Bank of Italy,  and Andrea Monorchio, the government's chief  accountant. The post of treasury minister awaits Dini, who is  perhaps better known and esteemed abroad than in Italy (before  joining the board of directors of the central bank--where his  relations with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi have been difficult--he was  for almost 20 years an IMF executive). This was confirmed on  several occasions by Dini himself in recent discussions with his  European colleagues in St. Petersburg during the meeting of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The only  obstacle which could derive from the economic program that the  government coalition plans to implement. "There must not be even  the smallest recrudescence of an inflationary spiral," Dini  said. "Otherwise, I will never accept."    Dini's appointment, however, can be viewed as a certainty,  to  judge from certain programmatic suggestions that Dini himself  has made to his interlocutors. First, complete disclosure of the  actual accounts of the state, where the gap left by the Ciampi  administration is reportedly much greater than the official  figures. Second, the immediate resumption investment in major  public works projects and simultaneous simplification of the  attendant procedures. For example, a model for granting  concessions that has been successful in the United States could  be adopted in Italy: namely, allowing the firm that carries out  a public works project to profit from its operation for a period  of 30 years before it is transferred to the state. This model  could be applied--in conjunction with a large-scale mobilization  of private savings--to two major projects: a high-speed railroad  system, with a spin-off of 50,000 new jobs, and a bridge over  the Strait of Messina--an infrastructure that could virtually  ensure to the Berlusconi administration its place in history.    A novice in politics, Berlusconi in recent days has made no  secret of the fact that he is also somewhat lacking in expertise  in bureaucratic matters. And because the reorganization of the  office of prime minister allocated great powers to what had  previously been merely the government's "chief notarial office,"  this particular shortcoming of his must be remedied forthwith.  Within the Knight's entourage the word is that the best solution  would be the appointment of Andrea Monorchio as  secretary-general to the office of prime minister, inasmuch as  Monorchio is esteemed not only for his levelheadedness but above  all for his exceptional knowledge of the actual accounts of the  state. Berlusconi reportedly would like to appoint Gianni  Letta, vice president of Fininvest Communications and his  longtime political adviser, to serve with him in Palazzo Chigi  [office of the prime minister] in a role of institutional  importance and trust (i.e., undersecretary to the office of the  prime minister). The appointment--which Letta has attempted  gracefully to avoid and which has also reportedly elicited some  resistance on the part of Fedele Confalonieri, who is reluctant  to deprive himself of a key executive of the firm--has already  been submitted to the legal experts for an analysis of all  possible implications, inasmuch as Letta is in fact not a member  of parliament, although this would appear not to be an obstacle.  If it proves to be, Letta could be given a different post: for  example, that of first private secretary to the prime minister.    With Dini on board, the troika of economic ministers will  probably be rounded out by the appointment of Giulio  Tremonti as finance minister and Giancarlo  Pagliarini as budget minister (the ministry was explicitly  requested by the Northern League). Although Tremonti was elected  on Mario Segni's Pact [Patto] ticket, he has never shared  Segni's stubborn position that led the referendum leader [Segni]  to side with the opposition to the Knight. Indeed, Tremonti's  federalist theories on taxation--which came to light at an  unexpected moment--make him a valuable hinge for linking  together the allies of the Freedom Alliance with a view to  reconciling the federalism that the League insists should apply  even to tax matters, on the one hand, with the drastic reduction  of the IRPEI [personal income tax] rate that Forza Italia and  the AN are requesting.    Nothing has been decided with respect to the other so-called  series a cabinet ministries (such as foreign affairs, defense,  justice, and posts), despite the numerous organization charts  provided by the newspapers. A poll conducted by Gianni  Pilo's Diakron (to which Berlusconi has always paid close  attention) disclosed that Italians would like to see in the  government--in addition to Di Pietro--prominent individuals such  as Gianni Agnelli, Romano Prodi, and Umberto  Veronesi. To take this poll into account would mean wiping  out the hopes of many aspiring ministerial candidates,  especially those who are closest to Berlusconi. Indeed, the  League and the AN are unlikely to renounce their goal of  restructuring their representation in the executive branch.    Change will come not only to the government, however. Among  the nerve centers of power that will be effected by change are  the banking and financial system, which has always been of  strategic importance. No one has any doubts as to who the  victors are in this sector. The first is Enrico  Cuccia, 84 years of age, the honorary president of  Mediobanca [Financial Credit Bank], listed by many observers two  or three years ago as among the losers, inasmuch as the  separation of Mediobanca from Comit [Italian Commercial Bank]  and Credit [Italian Credit Bank] threatened to shut off the  financial spigots that had always enabled him to carry out his  projects. But the "little man of steel" did not lose heart: he  devised a strategy for the reconquest of Comit and Credit, and  in spite of his most tenacious adversary--IRI [Institute for  Industrial Reconstruction] President Romano Prodi--he succeeded  in reconquering them, thanks to privatization. The result is  almost incredible: Mediobanca is today the most authoritative  and credible hinge linking the old and the new--between an old  in which the only ones who counted were the great families under  Cuccia's care, and a new in which--thanks to the privatization  of the public banks--certain entrepreneurs who have become  prominent stockholders of Credit and Comit are coming on stage,  such as Diego Della Valle, Leonardo Del Vecchio, Steno  Marcegaglia, Lionello Adler, and Vito  Gnutti--the latter wearing two hats, the one of an  entrepreneur-stockholder in Credit and the other of a League  deputy who is being considered for a post in the cabinet. This  list can be enlarged to include the leaders of the small and  medium-sized manufacturers who took part in the recent  convention of the Verona chapter of Confindustria [General  Confederation of Italian Industry]: leading figures such as  Massimo Zanetti and Paolo Rovagnati, or  Giorgio Panto, who is working on Project Azzurro  [Blue], an association that will be an alternative to the old  Confindustria nomenklatura.    Other events serve to confirm the fact that Mediobanca has  again become the crossroads of the nation's financial activity.  After years of incommunicability, Fininvest--of which Berlusconi  is still the owner--has entrusted Cuccia's people with the  Mondadori sale. And Maurizio Gasparri, the AN's chief  economic adviser, has asked the government to give greater  consideration to those banking operations that relate to the  divestitures and specifically those of Mediobanca, which alleges  that it has heretofore been placed at a disadvantage vis-a-vis  the foreign merchant banks [preceding two words in English].    The list of victorious bankers includes the names--in  addition to Cuccia's--of Mediobanca's allies, and in particular  those of Luigi Fausti of Comit; Lucio  Rondelli, back in the saddle at Credit; and  Pellegrino Capaldo and Cesare Geronzi of  the Bank of Rome. As for the losers--who had bet on an election  victory of the center-left coalition--many of them are pointing  the finger at Giovanni Bazoli, president of the Sao  Paolo Bank of Brescia. "When Berlusconi entered politics," his  enemies say resentfully, "Bazoli's initial reaction was to  demand that the loans made to Fininvest be called."    Some are predicting the triumphal return to Via  Filodrammatici [Mediobanca headquarters] of Antonio  Maccanico--undersecretary to the office of the prime  minister during the Ciampi administration--who would replace  Francesco Cingano as the bank's president, a post he previously  held. Some say that among those making this prediction is  Maurizio Romiti, a top manager [preceding word in  English] at Mediobanca, who is regarded as one of the most  unenthusiastic supporters of the theory that his father [Cesare  Romiti]--the managing director at FIAT -- should be dragged in  to fill the post. In Milan, a rumor is making the rounds of the  more important suites to the effect that Cesare  Romiti--after having for 15 years had a major impact on the  operations of FIAT -- is about to hand over the controls at  Corso Marconi [FIAT headquarters] to Paolo  Cantarella--a generational change that for Romiti senior  should not at all mean retirement, for rumor says that as an  alternative to the Mediobanca job, he could become president of  Montedison.    A shock wave is also expected to hit the sector of the  state-owned enterprises, foremost among which are the IRI  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] and the ENI [National  Hydrocarbons Corporation]. A particular Chinese metaphor is  popular with the Freedom Alliance, to wit: It does not matter  what color a cat is; the important thing is that it catch the  mice. As if to say: Let no preconceived policy be applied to  capable managers, provided they agree to implement the  government program. IRI President Romano Prodi, however, has  already decided to resign as soon as the new government takes  office; then, if he is invited to remain, he will weigh the pros  and cons. ENI Managing Director Franco Bernabe will  in all probability do likewise. Meanwhile, there are those who  venture to predict who the new strong men will be: Lorenzo  Necci, the lord of high-speed transportation, a key element  in the future government program; former IRI Vice President  Pietro Armani, author of the AN's economic program,  who has been mentioned for the top post at STET [Turin Telephone  Finance Company]; Ernesto Pascale, candidate for the  top post at Telecom Italia; Fabiano Fabiani, whose  diligent performance in the construction of the new Finmeccanica  [Mechanical Engineering Finance Corporation] was judged  favorably by the League; IRI General Manager Enrico  Micheli and Vincenzo Dettori, who distinguished  themselves in connection with the privatization already carried  out by the IRI; Renato Cassaro of Fintecna, an expert  practicioner of downsizing; and Roberto Schisano, who  became managing director of Alitalia following a successful  career with Texas Instruments. And there are those who predict  that one of the present ENI managers [preceding word in  English]--Carlo Da Molo, formerly of Italgas [Italian  Gas Company]--will be recycled.    On the labor union front, hard times are predicted for the  top leadership respectively of the CGIL [Italian General  Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade  Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], all of  whom before the election were committed opponents of the Freedom  Alliance. On the launching pad, however, is the ISA [expansion  not given], a new federation that groups together 10 independent  unions--headed by CISNAL [Italian Confederation of National  Trade Unions], CISAL [Italian Confederation of Independent Trade  Unions], CIMO [Italian Confederation of Hospital Doctors],  CONFSAL [Confederation of Autonomous Trade Unions], and DIRSTAL  [National Association of Executives of the Civil Service])--with  a total membership of 6 million and new leaders [preceding word  in English]: Gaetano Cerioli, Mauro Nobilia, and  Rosy Mauro.    In spite of those who for years have been writing him off,  the position of the chief of police, Vincenzo Parisi,  is deemed to be "static." Working in his favor are reportedly  not only his friendship with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro but  also his thorough knowledge of the intelligence services, with  whose top officials the progressive coalition had developed  positive relations during the Ciampi administration but  conflictual relations with Parisi himself.    Last but not least [preceding four words in English], there  is the political chapter that is perhaps the most sensitive of  all: the press and TV. The new antitrust [preceding word in  English] law--which has been invoked by several parties--will  bring profound changes that no one is able to foresee. Many,  however, are predicting the departure from the scene of  Eugenio Scalfari--just turned 70--the most famous of  the newspaper editors who lined up with the progressives and the  center. Some even indicate 1 September as the date of his  departure and Ezio Mauro--currently the editor in  chief of STAMPA--as his most likely successor.  <H5>  Bossi's Key People </H5>   1.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 2 (CNS) -- According to the  Bulletin of Environmental Protection, environmental pollution in  Guangzhou is by and large under control. However, measures  curbing pollution in the city are still inadequate, in view of  the growth of pollution.    Though industrial pollution is initially under control,  environmental pollution is still rather serious. For instance,  organic contamination in the water of the Guangzhou part of the  Pearl River is getting worse. Disposal of urban refuse is still  a headache. Harmful industrial rubbish has not yet been all  collected together to be disposed of. Growth of the number of  motor vehicles is too fast, and their exhaust gas pollutes the  air. Noise pollution along the sides of main traffic lines  remains high. Environmental administration over the tertiary  industry is lagging behind its development. Urban residents are  seriously suffering from waste water, waste gas and noise caused  by the food industry there. Some enterprises are still shifting  their responsibility of curbing their own pollution to society,  aiming at making profit at the expense of people there.    According to an official from the Guangzhou Municipal  Environmental Protection Committee, Guangzhou would be built  into a metropolis of international standard in five years time,  and 1994 is a crucial year for the realization of the goal.  Protection of the environment must keep up with the development  of economy. The plan for the protection of environment must be  worked out in conformity with the total urban construction plan  and the plan of municipal economic development. Departments of  Urban construction, municipal administration, environmental  protection and public utilities must take effective measures to  speed up construction of projects for disposal of waste water  and urban refuse, strengthen administration over and harness  motor vehicles' exhaust gas, strengthen supervision over  environment of food industries and control motor vehicles' noise  pollution so as to improve environment for people's living. At  the same time, Guangzhou municipality will further improve its  laws and regulations on environment, endeavor to make publicity  of the importance of environmental protection so as to enhance  people's understanding of environmental protection.</p>

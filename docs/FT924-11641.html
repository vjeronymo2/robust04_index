			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Growth in money supply to be flat THE Bank of Japan yesterday projected flat money supply growth in coming months, but said there would be no further reduction of the official discount rate despite government calls for an interest rate easing. In its quarterly economic outlook report, released yesterday, the bank said the previous monetary easing and the government's emergency economic package would help a gradual recovery. Mr Kagehide Kaku, director of the central bank's research and statistics department, denied any moves to ease monetary policy. The 0.4 per cent drop in the September money supply figure, the first decline on record, which was released earlier this week has increased pressure on the Bank of Japan to cut the official discount rate. Meanwhile, surveys by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) have revealed that company and consumer confidence of an economic recovery remains weak. The Business Survey Index - a survey of 4,565 companies, weighing up those expecting an economic upturn against companies predicting a downturn in the October-December period - stood at a negative 33. Corporate capital investment plans for the current year to March have fallen by 3.2 per cent against the previous period, while the EPA's consumer confidence index fell by 6.3 per cent in the July-September quarter.</p>

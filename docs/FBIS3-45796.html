"Bioengineering is a high-tech industry which will develop  rapidly across the world in the next century," Director of the  Municipal Commission for Science and Technology Hua Yuda said.    An important base for China's pharmaceutical industry,  Shanghai has about 30 research institutes and a dozen  higher-learning institutions engaged in the study of  bioengineering and medicine.    Its 70 pharmaceutical works produced five billion yuan-worth  of bio-medical and pharmaceutical products last year.    According to the director, Shanghai will boost the  bioengineering industry by deepening the reform of the  managerial system of scientific research institutions and  co-operating with overseas companies.    The municipal government will work out a package of  preferential policies to encourage the establishment of key  pharmaceutical enterprise groups and the combination of research  institutions with production enterprises.</p>

			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / US struggling to find competitive edge The US has not solved the structural problems that have impaired its competitiveness, despite its recent economic turnaround, a report by the Council on Competitiveness warned yesterday. The council, a panel of leaders in business, labour and higher education, warns that although many high-profile US sectors, such as the car and semiconductor industries, have regained market leadership, it is not clear that the US has created the productive assets for future growth. 'The competitiveness challenge is here to stay. We are making progress, but are in for a lengthy struggle,' said Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive of Xerox and chairman of the council. The report, Competitiveness Index 1994, combines a macro-economic study with an opinion poll of the council's members and affiliates. It highlights several deep-seated structural problems that need tackling. Although US investment in plant and equipment surged by 11.8 per cent last year, investment as a proportion of GDP has been the lowest of any of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations for six of the past seven years, the report says. Growth in US long-term industrial research and development has been running at less than half the rate for most other G7 countries, with only the UK showing a lower rate. The merchandise trade deficit climbed to Dollars 131bn last year as rising imports outstripped export growth. In the council's survey, 91 per cent of respondents ranked the threat to competitiveness posed by weaknesses in the primary education system (from kindergarten up to 12 years of age) as their top concern. The US net national savings rate has been the lowest of all G7 nations for most of the past two decades, dipping last year to 1.8 per cent of GDP, little more than one tenth of Japan's savings rate. However, the report notes several positive developments. Last year the US saw the biggest rise in the standard of living of any G7 nation, at 1.9 per cent, although this was partly a result of the recession still affecting many of the US's competitors. US manufacturing productivity rose 4.2 per cent last year, the biggest annual increase since 1987. Two thirds of respondents said that US overall competitiveness was good and getting better. They pointed to undergraduate and graduate education, management, quality and technology as particular US strengths. The Clinton administration received relatively high marks for its technology and trade policies, but was urged to increase incentives for savings and investment and strengthen worker training programmes. The biggest competitive challenge was seen as coming from Japan, followed by the newly industrialised Asian countries and China. Germany was ranked fourth. Stiff competition was foreseen, particularly in electronic components and equipment, machine tools and robotics, and cars. 'Although American companies have cut a lot of fat, many have not yet built the innovative capacity that will be necessary to compete in the future,' said Mr Michael Porter, professor of business administration at Harvard Business School and project adviser for the Competitiveness Index. 'Private sector investment in people and in productive assets is still much too low.'

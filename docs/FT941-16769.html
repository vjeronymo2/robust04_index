			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / New status of French bank 'will boost franc' The Bank of France's new independence in setting monetary policy would help to fight inflation and reinforce the 'international credibility' of the franc, Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, said yesterday. Installing the central bank's new board and monetary policy committee, Mr Balladur told its members that they now had the 'very heavy responsibility . . . of being the guardians of the nation's currency'. He promised to 'scrupulously observe' the independence of the bank's nine-member monetary policy committee, who are forbidden by law to accept or solicit outside instructions in determining interest rates. The new bank law, closely modelled on the Bundesbank statutes, gives the prime minister and the economy minister the right to attend - but not to vote at - monetary meetings. Mr Balladur said he would exercise this right 'rarely, but, like the German chancellor with the Bundesbank, I will do when it seems right'. He and Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, attended the start of the first formal meeting of the committee, whose six outside members later drew lots to decide the length of their terms of office. Eventually, all outside appointees will serve a non-renewable nine-year term. But initially some will serve less so that two of their number can change every three years. Yesterday Mr Michel Sapin, a former Socialist finance minister, and Mr Michel Albert, former head of the AGF insurance group, got nine-year terms; Mrs Denise Flouzat, an economist, and Mr Jean-Pierre Gerard, an industrialist, got six years; and Mr Jean Boissonat, a journalist, and Mr Bruno de Maulde, a financier, three years. Mr Balladur said he was confident that the Bank of France would match the performance of the independent Bundesbank and US Federal Reserve Board. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the Bank of France governor who, along with his two deputies, is an ex-officio member of the committee, claimed that the French people, often considered 'flighty or inconstant' in other matters, were now 'firmly attached to the value of their money'.

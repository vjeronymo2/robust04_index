			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Productivity seen as key to US expansion: White House economist predicts investment will grow and efficiency pick up Economic expansion in the US in the 1990s will be powered by a sustained increase in productivity growth, Ms Laura Tyson, chief White House economist, indicated yesterday. This year's Economic Report of the President - the first produced under Ms Tyson's supervision - predicts that non-farm business productivity will grow at an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent during the 1990s, roughly twice as fast as in the previous two decades. The increase in productivity growth - output per hour - will compensate for a decline in labour force growth caused by the ageing of 'baby boomers' and permit the economy to grow robustly throughout this decade, she says. Most economists regard productivity growth as the main source of long-term improvements in living standards. Without an increase in productivity growth, President Bill Clinton would not be able to deliver on his promise to raise real wages for the bulk of middle income families whose incomes stagnated during the 1980s. Ms Tyson's prediction of a sustained recovery in productivity growth follows release of encouraging statistics for the past two years, especially in industry. Manufacturing productivity grew by 5.3 per cent last year after a 4.3 per cent gain in 1992. Overall productivity increased 1.6 per cent last year and by 3.1 per cent in 1992. The report says productivity growth will stay strong for three main reasons: The baby boom generation that entered the workforce during the 1970s is now fully assimilated. Today's workforce is thus older, more educated, and more experienced than in past years. The low level of long-term interest rates, reflecting expectations of low inflation and a declining budget deficit, will result in a steady rise in private business investment. Targeted public investments in education, workforce training, infrastructure, high-tech communications, and commercially relevant technology will increase economic efficiency. Private sector analysts would add that productivity is likely to be permanently boosted by extensive corporate restructuring to meet the challenge of more vigorous global competition. The council of economic advisers appears confident that the current business upturn will persist through this decade, making it one of the longest on record. Ms Tyson predicts that real gross domestic product will grow by 3 per cent this year and by an annual average of 2.5-3.0 per cent from 1995 to 1999. The unemployment rate (on the revised basis introduced this month) will decline from a range of 6.6-7.2 per cent this year to 5.8-6.4 per cent in 1999. The forecast assumes the Federal Reserve will accommodate a gradual increase in inflation, from 2.7 per cent last year to 3.0 per cent this year and 3.4 per cent from 1997 onwards - a period when the Fed will be chaired by a Clinton nominee rather than Mr Alan Greenspan, whose announced goal is 'price stability.' In spite of the projected increase in inflation, Ms Tyson optimistically expects short- and long-term interest rates to remain below 4.5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively throughout the forecast period. The tone of Ms Tyson's report differs from those produced by conservative economists during the Reagan and Bush years. It tries to debunk the notion that higher tax rates damage economic performance, claiming that economies 'can thrive under a wide range of top marginal tax rates'. Thus the US enjoyed healthy growth of 4 per cent a year during the 1960s when the top rate averaged 80.3 per cent - nearly twice as high as that imposed in last year's budget. While some people may cut their hours of work, others will work longer to meet savings or consumption targets, the report predicts. Ms Tyson also claims that cuts in top rates in the 1980s led to a permanent reduction in personal tax revenues as a share of GDP, whereas tax surcharges in the late 1960s had the opposite effect. Higher rates under the Clinton plan were thus likely to raise revenue and reduce the deficit. The report also takes a different view of microeconomic efficiency, arguing that this can often be promoted by government intervention. The goal of the administration's technology policy, for example, is 'not to substitute the government's judgment for that of private industry' but to 'correct a genuine and significant market failure - underinvestment in basic research and in precommercial R&amp;D resulting from the divergence between private and social returns to those activities'. The rapid increase in federal support for commercially relevant technology reflected the end of the cold war and the need to replace a 'defence-led' strategy by one aimed at improving US global economic competitiveness. Perhaps the most significant deviation from previous economic reports of the president is a lengthy justification of the administration's deviation from classical free trade principles - its attempt unilaterally to force Japan to agree to numerical targets for increases in foreign companies' share of its domestic market. The report says 'the preponderance of evidence' points to the 'closed nature of the Japanese market' despite Japan's nominal adherence to international trading rules. The Clinton administration's controversial 'results-oriented' policy is thus the only practicable way to tackle Japan's hidden trade barriers.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Deng Xianchun [6772 6343 2504]: ``Large Fiber </F> Optic Vibration Testing and Analysis System Unveiled in  Chengdu'']    [Summary] Chengdu (ZHONGGUO KEXUE BAO wire report) -- The  YM1000 large-scale fiber optic dynamic vibration testing and  analysis system--jointly developed by the University of  Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) and Shenzhen  Yangming [7122 2494] Fiber Optic Technology Ltd.--passed formal  technical appraisal in Chengdu a few days ago. This achievement  is a major advance for domestic fiber optic sensor utilitarian  testing technology. The system's main performance indicators  match those of advanced foreign-made early-90s products, and the  indicator for temperature stability exceeds that for comparable  foreign-made early-90s products. The prototype system, built at  the 1987 request of the Shanghai Electric Machine Plant and  completed by UESTC in October 1991, was used in a successful  experimental test of vibration at the ends of the stator  windings in the 300 mW and 125 mW turbogenerators at the  Shanghai plant, and passed technical appraisal at that time.  The YM1000 system, a digitized, modular, ``smart''  second-generation system developed upon the prototype, has been  used in a successful vibration test of the stator winding ends  in the 12 mW turbogenerator at the Eastern Electric Machine  Plant and in measurement tests done at the China Institute of  Testing and Metrology.</p>

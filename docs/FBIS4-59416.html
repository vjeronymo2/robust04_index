			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The good offices by a number of Cabinet members  and deputies, including Deputy Prime Minister Michel al-Murr, to  resolve the government crisis were resumed today. Al-Murr today  visited President al-Hirawi, Chamber Speaker Birri, and Prime  Minister al-Hariri to establish channels for positive dialogue  to allow the country to return to normal and proceed with the  development and reconstruction march. [passage omitted]    Speaking after his meeting with Speaker Birri, al-Murr said  that what is happening is not a crisis as much as a political  problem to which we seek a solution. He added: Speaker Birri  plays a major role in finding this solution or helping to find  one. Noting that certain proposals exist, al-Murr added: We  hope that these proposals will help us emerge from the crisis.    Following his meeting with Birri, al-Murr returned to Prime  Minister al-Hariri's residence, where he met with him in the  presence of Minister Walid Junblatt. Earlier, al-Murr visited  Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul. Al-Murr denied any knowledge  that a Syrian envoy is expected to arrive in Lebanon today or  that the president, Chamber speaker, and prime minister would  leave for Syria. He noted that the crisis is on the way to  being resolved.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A SHOW OF HANDS;  </P> <P> PHOTOS THAT PAY TRIBUTE TO ARTISTS AND THEIR TOOLS  </P> <P> VENICE ARTIST RENA SMALL began photographing the hands of artists in 1984, and  now she regards the process as something of a ritual. First, she isolates the  hands with a black drape that makes them look as if they are emerging from a  monk's robe. As she shoots, her subjects become more conscious of their hands,  often assuming a prayerful pose. But Small is the one doing the worshiping: She  is an unabashed romantic about the life of the artist, and she sees the artists  she has chosen to photograph as mentors, if not quite saints. Her series of 60  black-and-white photographs will be exhibited at Art Center College of Design's  downtown Pasadena gallery this weekend through July 5.  </P> <P> The 34-year-old photographer, painter and performance artist says the project  was inspired in part by a wish to pay tribute to the artists she reveres. At  the same time, she says, it is "a way of shaking hands with the audience,"  selling the romance of the artist to a public that sometimes perceives artists  as unsympathetic creatures who force incomprehensible or offensive works on  them.  </P> <P> Small started the project while living in New York and expects to continue her  study of two of all artists' most basic tools throughout her life because it  allows her to collaborate with contemporary art's luminaries. Half a dozen,  among them Julian Schnabel and Robert Graham, refused her invitation to sit. It  took three months to set up her 1985 shoot with Andy Warhol; now she's on the  trail of David Hockney. In general, though, most have been cooperative. Christo  became not a draper but a drapee; Richard Diebenkorn was happy to take part as  long as his face wasn't photographed; Charles Arnoldi showed up with  ink-stained hands from a print run. "He liked that," Small says, "because it  was about being an artist and having your hands dirtied."  </P> <P> Along the way, Small unwittingly became involved in the tragedy of an artist  she had meant to celebrate. She captured New York sculptor Carl Andre's hands  making what could be interpreted as a pushing motion. The photo took on bizarre  significance when, in 1985, Andre was accused of murdering his wife by pushing  her out a 34th-floor window. He was acquitted last year.  </P> <P> The Art Center gallery, at 54 W. Colorado Blvd., is open 12:30 to 6 p.m.  Tuesday through Thursday and 12:30 to 9 p.m. Friday and Saturday.

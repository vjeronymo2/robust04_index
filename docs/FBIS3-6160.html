He believes the military and civilian authorities were  able to take the situation under control. He said that the  frequent incidents took place in remote areas where it is  difficult for authorities of both the Thai and Cambodian  Governments to control. However, the foreign minister is  confident that the banditry is not supported by the central  government in Cambodia.    [Begin Prasong recording] I do not think they were supported  by the Cambodian Government. No, it's natural that there are  bandits in Cambodia; the same as in our own country. Here we  also have a lot of criminals and they are not supported by the  government. It is the same. This has nothing to do with  relations between the Thai and Cambodian Governments. Relations  will remain the same or even be strengthened. When we can  discuss with each other, it is easy to solve problems. There is  no reason to allow the acts of Cambodian bandits to sour our  relations. [end recording]    The foreign minister welcomed the news that Thai nationals  have started moving out of Pailin which is controlled by the  Khmer Rouge. He said the people who move out will be safe from  the assault on Pailin planned by the Cambodian Government.    Commenting on the same issue, Deputy Foreign Minister Surin  Phitsuwan said he will leave for Cambodia on 23 March. He  expects that he will be able to discuss with Cambodian leaders  and find solutions to many troubles along the Thai-Cambodian  border. He said the central government in Cambodia always  cooperates with the Thai Government. He does not think that the  present situation will necessitate closing any border passes.</p>

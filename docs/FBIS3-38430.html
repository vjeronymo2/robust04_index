			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Defense -- Triple Contract With </F> Saudi Arabia"]    [Excerpts] France and Saudi Arabia have entered into three  armament contracts involving the upgrading of warships and the  maintenance of ground-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft  batteries, the Defense Ministry announced yesterday. [passage  omitted]    The three contracts are as follows:     -  The ROH contract,  worth Fr3.5 billion, provides for the upgrading of four  2,000-tonne frigates and two 10,000-tonne refueling tankers sold  in 1980 (Sawari I contract). The upgrading, to be carried out  in Toulon (Var region) by the French Naval Construction Division  (DCN), entails over 3 million hours of work for DCN and 1.2  million hours for subcontractors and services suppliers  (Thomson-CSF, Navfco). To this must be added the support  services for the six ships' crews, which will remain on board  during the whole upgrading process. To take full advantage of  this period of inactivity, some equipment and on-board weapon  systems will also be upgraded.    -  The SLBS (Logistical Support for  Bitube and Shahine Systems) maintenance contract, worth Fr3.4  billion, is the continuation of the 'Al-Thaked contract (1984),  which provided for the provision of short-range ground-to-air  Crotale-Shahine missiles batteries and bitube 30-millimeter  weapon systems (complete with command stations, carriages, and  radars). French manufacturers will supply spare parts and  technical assistance.    -  The Shola maintenance contract, worth  about Fr2 billion, involves rocket thruster units for  short-range ground-to-air Shahine and Crotale missiles  previously purchased by Saudi Arabia. The program provides for  replacing several hundred thruster units intended for all  missiles already sold, and includes technical assistance. Both  missile-related contracts entail some 4.5 million hours of work,  which will be distributed between project leader Thomson-CSF and  its major subcontractors (Giat industrie, Renault Vehicules  Industriels, Matra, SNPE [National Company for Powders and  Explosives]).</p>

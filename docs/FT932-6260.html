			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Israel sells 16.5% of shares in Bank Hapoalim THE Israeli government yesterday sold off 16.5 per cent of its shares in Bank Hapoalim, the country's largest bank, raising an immediate Shk360m (Dollars 132m), our Jerusalem correspondent writes. The sale, which was 120 times over subscribed, is expected to yield a total of Shk783m once various share options are realised over the coming year. Yesterday's sale marked the first time that shares in Hapoalim have been traded on the Israeli stock exchange for almost a decade. Shares in the big Israeli banks collapsed in October 1983 after years in which they inflated their own share prices, leaving the Israeli government with little option but to bail out the sector by taking a controlling interest in the banks. Until yesterday, the government owned 97 per cent of Hapoalim and the sell-off represents only the first small step on the government's long road to divesting itself of all the shares in the major banks it stepped in to buy 10 years ago. Yesterday's sale was originally scheduled for three months ago, but was delayed following a report by the State Comptroller's Office which recommended that the government first approved proposals for a radical reform of the banking system. Last month, the government agreed a series of proposals designed to limit the power of the major banks. Among the reforms are measures limiting the banks' holdings in non banking subsidiaries, requiring major banks to sell off smaller subsidiaries, and providing for separate managements to run provident and mutual funds owned by the banks. Further sales of government shares in Bank Hapoalim, which has total assets estimated at Shk4.75bn, are anticipated in the not-too-distant future. The next bank shares sale, however, is likely to involve Bank Leumi, Israel's second largest bank. Treasury officials say that the government is expected to sell off a 20 per cent holding in Leumi within the next few months. Israel yesterday said it freed 250 Palestinian detainees in a Moslem holiday gesture but Arabs of the occupied Gaza Strip said the army simultaneously tightened a ban on entry to Israel, Reuter reports from Gaza. 'Of the 250 detainees released today, 171 of them were residents of the West Bank and the rest residents of the Gaza Strip,' an army spokeswoman said. She said other detainees would be released on Friday. Officials have announced Israel would release a total of 280 Palestinians ahead of next week's Eid al-Adha feast. They said the step applied only to minors, the ill, women and the elderly, and those about to complete sentences for victimless offences. Relatives gathered at a Gaza Strip checkpoint to greet detainees released from a prison in southern Israel. Some of the detainees said they were due to be freed in a few days anyway. As some prisoners tasted freedom other Palestinians who had managed to go on working in Israel despite a two-month ban on entry found themselves barred again. Palestinians said over the past three days soldiers had been confiscating entry permits in Gaza without explanation. By yesterday about 1,000 permits had been taken.</p>

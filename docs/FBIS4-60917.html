			<p>BFN     [Text] In Friday's interview with INTERFAX the leader of  the Ukrainian Socialist Party Alexander Moroz said that if  President Kravchuk decided to call off the pre-term presidential  elections, the coal miners would an launch industrial action and  Kravchuk would be forced to revoke his decision.    On 28 April, 120 members of the Ukrainian parliament urged  Kravchuk to call off the June 26 elections. They felt early  voting would provoke constitutional chaos and anarchy.    Kravchuk said the parliament's refusal to call off the  elections would aggravate the constitutional crisis. He said he  would know what to do after the lawmakers had discussed the  issue.    According to Moroz, there were no legal grounds for the  suspension of the presidential elections. If the president said  he was out to protect the nation's Constitution, said Moroz, he  must use constitutional means to do so.    But, Moroz said, the president enjoyed the right to propose  new legislation and could address the Supreme Soviet with a  proposal for the postponement of the elections.    The new body of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet will be  expected  to open session on 11 May.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi] </F>   [Excerpts] The Brazilian Army is reequipping its units with  Russian and U.S. materiel. On 30 May, the Army Ministry Materiel  Department chief signed a contract with Russian Government  representatives in Brasilia for the acquisition of "more than  100 ground-to-air" rockets to shoot down low-flying planes and  helicopters. General Gilberto Serra, head of the Army Social  Communications Center (Cecomsex), said: "The purchase of this  sort of materiel had been contemplated in our plans." [passage  omitted]    Gen. Serra added that the new equipment will be distributed  among the different Army units. The Russians will train the  military in using missiles here in Brazil. The general commented  that the Brazilian defense policy is "dissuasive," but the  country must be ready for possible attacks. This is the first  time Brazil has bought materiel from Russia.</p>

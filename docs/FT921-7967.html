			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Few vote in Punjab after poll threats ONLY 30 per cent of Punjabi voters went to the polls yesterday in the state's first elections in nearly five years after Sikh militants urged a boycott. The election is for 13 members of parliament and 117 members of the state legislature. Fear of the militants was blamed for the low turnout, particularly in the rural areas where fewer than 15 per cent voted. Polling booths were heavily guarded by armed troops and the day went off more or less peacefully. There were only two bombs attacks, killing one person and injuring 17. Counting of ballot papers will begin today and the results should be known within three days.</p>

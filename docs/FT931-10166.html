			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Complaints for Ofgas THE RANGE of complaints in the annual report of Ofgas runs from crossed meters to disconnection problems, theft from gas meters and accounting errors. One customer ended up with arrears of Pounds 880.20 because he was connected to the wrong gas meter. When he complained to British Gas, the company offered to write off half the bill but Ofgas persuaded it to write off the whole account. Another customer complained after gas bills and a disconnection notice were sent to his deceased mother's account in spite of his informing British Gas several times of her death. The company paid the customer Pounds 250 compensation for distress caused. An industrial customer was charged Pounds 1,596.43 after using a gas-fired fan heater for four months. When he asked the manufacturer whether the heater could burn 86,063kW-hours in the time stated, he was told that if the fan heater was on for 24 hours at maximum output it could burn only 6,992kW-hours. The customer received an account reduction of Pounds 1,200.</p>

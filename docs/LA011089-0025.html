			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAUDI ARABIA HIKES ESTIMATED RESERVES OF OIL, GAS SHARPLY;  </P> <P> NEW ASSESSMENT INDICATES NATION HAS 50% MORE CRUDE  </P> <P> Saudi Arabia, already blessed with the world's largest reserves of crude oil,  declared Monday that a new computer assessment shows it has about 50% more  crude oil and 25% more natural gas than previously believed.  </P> <P> If correct, the new Saudi numbers would boost by about 10% the free world's  proven reserves of crude oil to the 900-billion-barrel range. This would tend  to prolong the oil era and underscore the reliance of industrialized nations on  the Middle East.  </P> <P> Some Saudi watchers said the dramatic upward revision is legitimate and  overdue, while others said it was at least partly inspired by the politics of  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Both views might be correct,  analysts said.  </P> <P> "This was a political announcement. On the other hand, they may well have the  oil," said William D. Dietzman, a retired Energy Department geologist who has  studied the Saudi oil fields for the U.S. government.  </P> <P> Several other OPEC nations, including Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela, have  also increased their own oil reserve estimates sharply in the past year. The  higher a country's reserves, the greater its influence and production quota in  OPEC. Within the oil community, Iran's claims are widely discounted while the  others are accepted to varying degrees.  </P> <P> The Saudis, through their Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco, said that six  years of studies at their new oil exploration and engineering computer center  showed that they have 252.4 billion barrels of proven crude oil underground and  177.3 trillion cubic feet of gas.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Estimates Similar  </P> <P> For many years, the official Saudi government number was 110 billion barrels.  But since at least 1975, the scientific community has carried Saudi Arabia on  its books as having 150 billion to 170 billion barrels, the estimate varying  annually with oil prices, discoveries and production levels.  </P> <P> The U.S. Geological Survey in Reston, Va., said its estimate a year ago was 167  billion barrels, similar to the Saudis' own numbers at that time. The USGS put  the natural gas estimate at 130 trillion cubic feet, while Aramco had  previously estimated 141 trillion.  </P> <P> Dietzman and others said the timing of the announcement dramatically boosting  the Saudis' official oil reserve estimate strongly suggests that it was  inspired by the need to hold their ground within OPEC for the purposes of  determining quotas.  </P> <P> "They're saying, if Iraq says it has 100 billion barrels, then we say we have  250 billion," Dietzman said.  </P> <P> Even without the political element, any assessment of how much oil is  underground and how much of it can be recovered with known technology and  current prices is inexact. But in Saudi Arabia, the reserves are considered so  large that it is hard to challenge any estimate.  </P> <P> Consultant Joseph Story of McLean, Va., a former Aramco executive, said there  is so much oil in Saudi Arabia that until recently, not much effort has been  expended at determining just how much there is.  </P> <P> But skyrocketing oil prices in the late 1970s and early 1980s prompted Saudi  Arabia to spend some of the financial windfall on establishing a  state-of-the-art oil exploration and engineering center in Dhahran in 1982 that  is the envy of oil geologists.  </P> <P> Aramco, calling the latest estimates "very conservative," said the work done at  the Dhahran center is the basis for the big increase in the official reserve  estimates.  </P> <P> "There was no need to look for oil. But now they've put a lot of money into  upgrading their seismic capabilities and into exploration activity," said  Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services Inc. "The point of this is, the  numbers are probably true. But in announcing it, they might also be trying to  alleviate any worries that there are going to be shortages any time soon."  </P> <P> The more plentiful the supplies of low-cost crude oil such as Saudi Arabia's,  the lower prices are likely to remain. However, the Middle East oil fields --  which already account for about 70% of free world oil reserves -- are expected  to account for a steadily increasing share as other producing countries such as  the United States run low.  </P> <P> Aramco, once a joint venture of the Saudi government and the U.S. oil giants  Exxon, Mobil, Chevron and Texaco, operates Saudi Arabia's oil fields. It is now  100% owned by the Saudis and its duties are to be supplanted by a new national  oil company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co.  </P></p>

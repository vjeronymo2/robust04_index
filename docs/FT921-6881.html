			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Tension rises after Bosnia bomb Tension rose in Bosnia Hercegovina yesterday after a bomb injured 12 people and damaged a building housing a Croat cultural centre in the northern town of Odzaci, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. The explosion late on Monday threatened to damage relations between the Slavic Moslems, Serbs, and Croats who make up the Yugoslav republic's population, just days before this weekend's referendum on independence. Moslems, who make up 41 per cent of the 4.4m population, are expected to vote for independence. Croats - 17 per cent of the population - mostly support independence although ultra-nationalists want Bosnia to join Croatia.</p>

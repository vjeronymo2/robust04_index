			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / International Company News: Benetton plans bond and share issues Benetton, the Italian clothing group, is to seek shareholder approval for a bond issue and a placing of 19m new shares on foreign markets. The group yesterday called an extraordinary meeting of shareholders for May 25 and 26 to vote on the share and bond issue, causing a drop in Benetton's share price on a day in which the Milan stock market rose. Benetton will also ask shareholders if some or all of the new shares can be issued in the form of convertible bonds on foreign markets. The aim is to increase the geographical spread of the group's shareholders. In February, Benetton raised L265bn (Dollars 162m) by selling 10m new shares in an issue aimed particularly at increasing the number of US shareholders in the group. Shareholders gave authorisation to issue 30m new shares three years ago. The group said yesterday that the separate issue of bonds with warrants attached could raise up to L150bn on the Italian market, but it did not state how much would be raised by the share issue.</p>

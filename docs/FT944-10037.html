			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Upton gets 16% take-up on offer Upton and Southern Holdings, the stores group, yesterday announced that only 16 per cent of its open offer of 90.4m shares had been subscribed. The company launched the Pounds 5.5m placing and offer of 120.3m shares to rescue its business last month. Upton had warned that the Reject Shop, the home furnishings retailer, would have to cease trading without the new funds. The placing and open offer by MeesPierson and Townsley and Co represented about 72 per cent of the enlarged share capital. Some 30m shares were placed with a new unnamed institutional investor, with the balance subject to the open offer on a 49-for-20 basis. The company said that the remaining 76.2m shares would be taken up by institutional and other investors under the terms of the placing. The shares closed - before the announcement - unchanged at 5p, matching the offer price.</p>

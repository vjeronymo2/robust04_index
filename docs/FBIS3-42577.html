Oreshkin, </F> department chief at the All-Russia Institute for Market Trends  Research of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations:  "The Year 1994: Basic Directions in the Formation of Foreign  Trade Policy"]    [Text] The Russian system of state regulation of  foreign economic activities has undergone a difficult two-year  period of formation. On the whole, developments moved in the  direction of strengthening economic methods of regulating one of  the most important spheres of the national economy, albeit not  always consistently. In the second half and toward the end of  last year the first normative documents were adopted, on the  basis of which the basic provisions of national foreign trade  policy for 1994 were formulated. We will see how optimal and  well-considered the combination of economic and administrative  methods of control on the part of the state over the activities  of Russian importers and exporters in foreign markets is over  the current year.    At the editors' request, our regular author, Candidate  of Economic Sciences V.A. Oreshkin, department chief at the  All-Russia Institute for Market Trends Research of the Russian  Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, reflects on this  subject.    The basic document that defines the main directions of  nontariff regulation of exports from Russia in the current year  is the Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation  Decree No. 1102, issued on 2 November 1993. Like last year, this  system envisages first and foremost quota restrictions and  licensing of exports of certain categories of products and a  special policy regarding exports of strategically important raw  materials (SIRM).    In 1993 the licensing policy set by Government Decree No.  854, dated 6 November, was on the whole relaxed: Ammonia,  synthetic rubber, phosphate fertilizer, ammonium sulfate,  methanol, calcium phosphates, and some varieties of timber and  sawn lumber were removed from the list of goods to which quotas  applied and which constituted the bulk of Russian exports--fuel  and electric power and raw materials, although later this list  was expanded by adding grain and the products of its processing,  oil-yielding crops, ethyl alcohol made from edible raw material,  meat and milk products, casein, and wax. Beginning 1 January  1994, in keeping with Decree No. 1102, the list of goods that  require export licenses within established quotas included 12  items: fuel and electric power, hydrocarbon raw materials,  certain categories of nonferrous metals and raw materials for  their production, cellulose, wheat, soy and sunflower seed,  nondenatured ethyl alcohol, fish, crustaceans, and caviar.  Council of Ministers-Government of the Russian Federation Decree  No. 2213-r, dated 10 December 1993, added to this list  coniferous varieties of commercial timber and wood ties for  mainline railroads.    First put into effect on 1 July 1992, the original SIRM list  included 13 commodities; in September it was expanded to 15, and  after 1 April 1993 it was modified to include fish and fish and  marine products, while certain varieties of timber and paper  products, sodium, and household items made from aluminum were  dropped from it. Thus, the SIRM list became virtually identical  to the list of commodities subject to quotas, with the exception  of rolled ferrous metals, exports of which were unrestricted.  This identification generally remains effective for 1994,  although the SIRM list defined by aforementioned documents Nos.  1102 and 2213-r is somewhat broader than the list of commodities  subject to quotas due to the inclusion of some varieties of  nonferrous, alkaline, alkaline-earth, and rare metals and  materials for their production, fertilizer, raw diamonds, and  sawn coniferous varieties of lumber.    Government Decree No. 1103, dated 30 October 1993, made  effective as of 1 November new export duty rates for goods  exported from the territory of Russia, and GTK [State Customs  Committee] of Russia Directive No. 479, dated 11 November 1993,  set the procedures for their calculation and collection.    In 1992-1993 export duties applied to about three-quarters  of  Russian exports. Exports of fuel and raw materials, foodstuffs,  and industrial semifinished products were subject to duty. Of  finished industrial goods, tariff regulation applied to exports  of aviation equipment and arms. New export tariffs differ from  those previously in effect first and foremost in the following  respect:    --the list of goods subject to export duties has been cut  almost by half (to 29 items) due to the exclusion of animal  husbandry products and the products of their processing, certain  varieties of food-processing output, alcohol, paper and  cardboard, printed material, and textile raw materials and  semifinished products;    --duties vary by item and range from 2 to 64,000 ECU per  tonne of exported commodity (in the past the maximum rate was as  high as 80,000 ECU); ad valore custom rates--from 3 to 25  percent (5 to 70 percent, respectively). The most noticeable  reduction in duties occurred with respect to agricultural  products and foodstuffs, to which high export rates were applied  in the past at a "proscriptive" level in order to limit exports,  since exports of such products from Russia in 1993 were to a  considerable extent made possible by state subsidies, which  later dropped off sharply. There has been a perceptible  reduction in duties with respect to certain varieties of  nonferrous metals and raw materials for their production.  According to Decree No. 1102, exports of goods for state needs  and exports of commodities from Russia to CIS countries on a  clearing or interrelated basis are exempt from export duties in  1994, as they were in 1993.    Policy in the area of tariff regulation of exports in 1994  will be formed taking into consideration the same factors as the  policy in the area of administrative regulation. Exports of a  number of raw materials that previously fell under the  government's administrative and economic control currently no  longer have to be restricted, either directly or indirectly:  Domestic prices for them have reached the world level or even  exceeded it, which leads to practically identical results  regardless of whether these goods are sold on the domestic or  foreign market. I want to remind you that in keeping with the  Law "On Customs Tariffs" quantitative restrictions on exports  and tariff regulation expire on 31 December 1995.    Liberalization of foreign trade policy with respect to  Russian exporters in 1994 does not mean that the state forfeits  control over their "civilized" conduct in carrying out  deliveries of products to the foreign market. Strengthening of  this control will be aimed first and foremost at the timely  repatriation of foreign currency earnings to Russia. On 12  October 1993 the Central Bank and the GTK of Russia issued Joint  Instruction No. 19 and 01-20/10283, which sets the procedure for  hard currency control over repatriation to the Russian  Federation of foreign currency earnings from exports of goods.  For SIRM exports it goes into effect on 1 January 1994, for all  other goods--on 1 March 1994.    As is known, over the past two years similar documents had  been adopted at different levels of legislative and executive  authority on numerous occasions. The aforementioned instruction  is probably the first appreciable step on the road to creating a  real working mechanism of control over repatriation of foreign  currency proceeds by exporter enterprises. The control structure  is quite complex, since it must tie into a single chain all the  Russian components of an export deal: "exporter--customs--bank."  In keeping with the instruction, control documentation has been  introduced allowing the passage of goods over the border to be  traced, and foreign currency proceeds to then be repatriated. In  these circumstances the role of authorized banks increases  dramatically, since now they will in fact perform the functions  of foreign currency control agents, especially when possible  sanctions and penalties envisaged by the instruction are applied.    Another direction of strengthening export control on the  part  of the state is necessitated by factors of an "external" nature.  On 2 December 1993 Government Decree No. 1248 was issued "On  Measures of Settling Trade Disputes Arising in Connection With  Exports of Russian Goods." In keeping with this, the government  will implement control over the activities of exporting  enterprises whose dishonest trade practices lead or may lead to  importing countries imposing antidumping or other restrictive  measures with respect to Russian goods. Such control will be  exercised in the form of establishing additional quotas for  exports of commodities with respect to which importer countries  introduce restrictions; requiring their licensing; setting  minimum export prices; and limiting the actual number of  exporters. The MFER [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations] has  the right to revoke the export licenses of Russian  exporters--regardless of form of ownership--that are identified  as "violators."    Russian exporters should be aware of the preferences they  may  be eligible to claim in exporting goods to the countries of the  European Community [EC], which unites 12 states in Western  Europe. The point is that the General System of Preferences of  the European Communities (GSP EC) has been in effect since 1971,  which envisages customs and tariff preferences in importing into  EC countries goods from a state to which the preferential  (favored) treatment is extended.    In order for a commodity exported from Russia into EC  countries to qualify for this preferential treatment, the  Russian exporter has to present in these countries a Form "A"  certificate of the origin of goods issued by MFER authorized  representatives in the regions in keeping with departmental  instruction No. 452 dated 24 June 1993 "On Procedure of Issuing  Certificates of the Origin of Goods for Selling Within the  General System of Preferences of the European Community (GSP  EC)." Otherwise, "nonpreferential" rates of European Community  customs duties will be applied to imports.    The system of regulating imports in 1994 includes the same  instruments as last year--procedures for determining the customs  value of imported goods and control over their safety,  procedures for establishing the country of origin, tariff and  tax regulation of imports, etc.    However, in keeping with Government Decree No. 985 dated 30  September 1993 and GTK of Russia Instruction No. 445 dated 1  November 1993, on 11 October 1993 new rates of excise taxes on  imported goods went into effect, which are higher compared to  those in the past. Then excise tax rates were once again  modified in keeping with Government Decree No. 1185 dated 19  November 1993 and made effective by GTK of Russia Instruction  No. 501 dated 26 November 1993. Currently excise tax rates in  effect range from 10 to 250 percent of the customs value of  imported goods.    Letter No. 01-13/11649 of the GTK of Russia dated 22  November  1993 establishes the procedure for importing goods by physical  persons. The main provision of the document is to set general  provisions for regulation of imports of goods, including payment  of duties, value-added tax, excise tax, customs fees, and so on,  for both legal and physical persons if these goods are imported  with the intention of their subsequent use for production or  commercial purposes.    The tightening or liberalization of import policy in the  future will depend to a large extent on new import tariff rates,  which are now at the stage of approval.    In the current year work will continue on the formation of a  normative base which will define the contents of customs  regulations set by the Customs Code, and the finalization of  trade regulations governing trade with all countries that are  former USSR republics.    The MFER has completed work on analyzing the reports of  enterprises, sectors, and regions in utilizing the means  received as a result of preferences granted in 1992-1993 in  their conduct of foreign economic activities. In the future the  ministry, which has always advocated an integrated system of  state regulation of foreign economic activities, will strengthen  record-keeping and control over the receipt and targeted use of  such means.</p>

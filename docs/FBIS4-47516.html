New coal deposits have been  found in the Kharkov and Lugan regions (the Barvenkov and  Bogdanov deposits, respectively). A single complex has been  created for the extraction and processing of coal and production  of electric energy all at one site. Preliminary research has  shown that a 1600-1800 MW state regional electric power plant  can be constructed at the Barvenkov deposit, and a 2700 MW plant  can be built at the Bogdanov deposit. Technical documentation  will be developed for these projects in 1993-1994. The  configurations of the deposits are described. The industrial  coal resource of the Barvenkov deposit is 403.8 milion tons. The  Bogdanov deposit has balanced resources of 1068 million tons,  with industrial resources of 860 million tons. Properties of the  coal at each deposit are listed in a table. Table 1.</p>

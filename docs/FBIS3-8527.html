			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 9 (TANJUG)--Yugoslavia  (Serbia/Montenegro) [FRY--Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] was on  Wednesday again unjustly accused of violating the human rights  of ethnic Albanians in Serbia's southern province of  Kosovo-Metohija.    The U.N. Human Rights Commission has adopted a special  resolution alleging, in the absence of any valid explanation and  evidence, that the Albanian minority in Kosovo-Metohija is being  subjected to a brutal policy, summary arrests and even mass  executions.    However, Yugoslav authorities deny the truth of this,  insisting that there have never been any mass executions of  ethnic Albanians in the province, and that only those ethnic  Albanians have been arrested who have been actively involved in  the movement to detach Kosovo-Metohija from Serbia and  Yugoslavia.    In combating the separatist movement, Yugoslav authorities  have acted in strict accordance with the law and have taken no  action that would not have been taken by any other state in  similar circumstances.    A strong separatist movement has been active in  Kosovo-Metohija for decades, striving for the province's violent  secession from Yugoslavia and annexation to neighbouring Albania.    The Russian representative to the U.N. Human Rights  Commission moved that the resolution should not be put to the  vote, explaining that individual positions included in the  resolution had been incorporated, albeit in a milder form, in an  already adopted omnibus resolution on former Yugoslavia.    The motion was supported by most Western countries, except  Germany and some Nordic states, but the resolution was  nevertheless voted in place, having been upheld by the Moslem  countries which make up an overwhelming majority in the  commission.    Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo-Metohija are Moslems, and  neighbouring Albania is a member of the Organization of the  Islamic Conference.</p>

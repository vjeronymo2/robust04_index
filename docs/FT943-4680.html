			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy trade in utilities Corporate activity continued to drive the utilities, with the regional electricity companies (recs) again heavily traded after news of yet more share buy-back operations. But it was a restructuring programme announced by Manweb that caught the market's imagination and drove its shares sharply higher. Analysts welcomed Manweb's strategy, with Kleinwort Benson, in particular, said to have been an aggressive buyer of the stock, which raced up 20 to 851p. Analysts pointed out that Manweb had been the second worst performer in the recs since the distribution review last month and that they had been impressed by the details of the big cost savings after the restructuring. South Wales Electricity rose 21 to 817p after stating that it had bought back 500,000 of its shares at 815p, confirming recent speculation that such a move was imminent. And South Western moved back into the market to buy a further 750,000 of its shares at 805p. It purchased 3.5m last week and has now acquired 3.4 per cent of its stock. The company has shareholder authority to buy in up to 12.3m of its shares. South Western declined 7 to 803p. Midlands Electricity, also expected to announce a big restructuring in the near future, rose 10 to 799p amid talk of an imminent buy recommendation from one of the leading UK broking houses. The Scottish generators, Hydro-Electric and Power, were both under pressure ahead of their own distribution review, with some analysts of the opinion that any good news may well have been already factored into their share prices. Both stocks retreated 9, Hydro to 398p and Power to 399p.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / EC to recognise Bosnia and lift Serbia sanctions THE European Community yesterday decided to recognise Bosnia's independence and conditionally ended trade sanctions against Serbia, in a twin move designed to underline even-handed EC mediation. The Twelve will delay until today their diplomatic recognition of Bosnia, so that the US can join in the move. Washington is also now likely to recognise Croatia and Slovenia, as the EC did in mid-January. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which holds the EC presidency, reported a consensus among his EC counterparts that 'we should not give arguments (by withholding recognition) to radicals who are against independence'. He was largely referring to the Serb third of Bosnia's 4.5m population who boycotted last month's referendum, in which a very large majority among Bosnia's Moslems and Croats voted for independence. Recognising Bosnia should, on balance, reduce the scope for interference from neighbouring Serbia and pacify majority Moslem-Croat sentiment in the violence-torn republic, EC ministers hope. At the same time, the Twelve reached a classic compromise on Serbian sanctions. Mr Pinheiro said the Belgrade government of President Slobodan Milosevic had proved 'much more constructive' towards EC-sponsored peace efforts recently. The EC will therefore restore to Serbia the EC tariff and quota preferences which the five other republics got back at the turn of this year, as France and Greece, Belgrade's main sympathisers within the EC, have urged. But to ease the deep distrust of Serbia and the Serb-led federal army, notably in Germany, the EC has set pre-conditions. These are that Serbia endorse the principle of the EC peace conference on non-violability of frontiers; open airspace over Croatia and Slovenia to flights by the United Nations peace-keeping force and others; and repeal Serbian legislation purporting to apply to Serb enclaves in Croatia. Serbia has only come close to fulfilling the first of these conditions. The briefing of Lord Carrington, chairman of the Yugoslav peace conference, to ministers yesterday was instrumental to both decisions. While he opposed the German-led recognition of Croatia three months ago as undermining his peace efforts, Lord Carrington told ministers that such was the instability in Bosnia that there was nothing to be gained from further delay in putting last month's referendum verdict into effect. Macedonia's quest for recognition is still stuck on the nomenclature dispute with Greece. Mr Pinheiro said he hoped soon to be able to announce a formula easing Greece's worries about recognising Macedonia under that name. Lobbying for Macedonia yesterday in the corridors of the Luxembourg council building was Mr Robert Macfarlane, President Reagan's national security adviser who resigned over the Iran-Contra affair. He said that Macedonia, whose name in itself hardly constituted claims on Greece, was ready to sign non-aggression pacts with its neighbours, once it was independent and able to do so.</p>

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Hospital cleaners lose test case on transfer of jobs EMPLOYERS yesterday welcomed a judgment from the Employment Appeals Tribunal that appears to halt the progress of regulations which have confused the contracting-out system for UK public services. Britain's Transfer of Undertakings - Protection of Employment (Tupe) regulations, based on the European Community's Acquired Rights Directive, require that pay and working conditions are protected when jobs are transferred from one employer to another. In many cases, this has discouraged private companies from bidding for contracts. Yesterday Mr Justice Wood, the outgoing president of the appeals tribunal, upheld an industrial tribunal judgment that 107 cleaners at Orsett Hospital in Basildon, Essex, were not covered by Tupe when their jobs were transferred from Initial Health Care Services to the Pall Mall Services Group. The cleaners' pay was cut as a result of the transfer. The cleaners' union, Unison, said the judgment would prolong the confusion about Tupe and threatened to take the case to the European Court of Justice. According to Ms Melanie Tether, a Tupe expert and a partner of City solicitors Norton Rose, the judgment runs against the grain of recent decisions in the UK High Court and at the European Court of Justice. However, the decision was welcomed by several employers' organisations. Mr John Hall, director-general of the Cleaning and Support Services Association, said: 'It is very good news which we should be shouting from the rooftops.' He said the government should pursue with renewed vigour the attempt to revise the original EC legislation. Mr John Major, the prime minister, recently discussed with the new French government the issue of revising the legislation to exclude contracting-out from the public sector. France, which has a large programme of privatisation and contracting-out, is sympathetic to the idea but several other EC countries are likely to block any change. The appeals tribunal's main reason for rejecting the claim that Tupe applied is that only staff were transferred between the two contractors. Lawyers say that Tupe is more likely to apply where equipment and goodwill are transferred as well as staff.</p>

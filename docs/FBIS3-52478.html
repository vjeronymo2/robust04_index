The security sources who reported this have not disclosed  the  date when the team is expected to arrive. They explained,  however, that the major objective of this secret visit is to  report on the actual security and political conditions in  Lebanon so as to help the U.S. Administration decide whether to  allow U.S. nationals to travel to Lebanon and resume flights  between the two countries or to continue the present ban.</p>

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Brasway benefiting from cost reductions Consolidating the recovery shown at the interim stage, Brasway produced pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.25m for the 53 weeks to May 2. That compared to Pounds 513,000 reported last time, although that has been restated to a loss of Pounds 892,000 after moving reorganisation costs to trading, rather than extraordinary, charges. Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, said the encouraging performance reflected concentration on cost reduction programmes, efficiency improvements and gains in market share during a period of weak demand. Turnover decreased by only 1 per cent to Pounds 33.9m. That generated an operating profit of Pounds 1.81m against Pounds 1.21m, or a restated loss of Pounds 194,000. Mr Swaby believed there was growth potential in existing businesses and instead of looking for new operational legs to enhance profitability they would be developed. Earnings per share were 1.15p (losses 0.73p restated). The final dividend is 0.34p for a total of 0.58p (0.51p).</p>

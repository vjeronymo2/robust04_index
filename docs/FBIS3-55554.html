Deputies of a major parliamentary faction told Interfax that  the rubles and hard-currency reserved for buying building  materials, equipment and furniture had been mishandled.    According to some estimates, spending on the restoration and  construction work alone amounts to $75 Mn-$85 Mn. The work is  done round the clock by Russia builders and their Turkish  colleagues from the companies Enka and Gama.</p>

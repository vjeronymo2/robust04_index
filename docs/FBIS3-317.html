			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Italicized passages recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Durao Barroso and Nelson  Mandela have met in South Africa. Both came out in favor of  peace and of a peaceful channeling of the South African  electoral process.    [Correspondent Antonio Mateus] An election boycott poses a  potential conflict situation in South Africa. After meeting the  South African president, the ANC [African National Congress]  president, and the PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress] president,  Barroso still has reservations regarding the future of this  country. The consensus between the government and the ANC raises  hopes of a peaceful transition but this is not enough. Six  weeks away from the elections the objective is to extend  participation in the process. Barroso's message was echoed by  some of those involved, anxious to prevent the worst. Barroso  found today in Mandela an attentive listener to the Portuguese  experience of transition in Africa.    [Mandela, in English with superimposed Portuguese  translation] They have had a lot of experience regarding  the problems that South Africa will have to face, because the  former colonies, Angola and Mozambique, had difficult  experiences that we do not want to see repeated in this country.  I have found the exchange of opinion with him [Barroso] very  useful in that regard.    [Mateus, interviewing Barroso on the street] After the  brief contacts, are you more optimistic regarding the future of  this country, or is it too early to say?    [Barroso] I still have many reservations because I think  that  until we can ensure that everyone will participate there will be  the potential for destabilization. Essentially, I think there  is a great consensus in South Africa -- for which it would be  enough that the ANC and the National Party saw eye to eye -- but  it is important for that agreement to be as widespread as  possible in order to reduce to a minimum the potential for  destabilization of some forces.

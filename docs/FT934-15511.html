			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Serbs halt relief to siege enclaves SERB fighters yesterday prevented UN relief convoys reaching up to 150,000 people trapped in two besieged Moslem enclaves in north Bosnia. The inhabitants of Maglaj and Tesanj, northern Bosnia. issued an appeal, broadcast on Sarajevo radio, for the outside world to relieve their plight. The appeal warned that the mostly Moslem population was barely surviving after 'months without water or electricity lacking adequate supplies of food and medicine'. It criticised the 'indifference' of the international community and called for the opening of land routes. Overland convoys have been blocked by Serb and Croat forces vying for control of the region from the outgunned, mostly Moslem Bosnian army. Emergency airdrops have been the only relief supplies to reach the towns, cut off for more than three months. David White adds: Lt Gen Philippe Morillon, former commander of UN forces in Bosnia, yesterday put his weight behind calls for placing the country under provisional UN control. 'If the present leaders really don't succeed in finding a solution urgently and if they carry on being overtaken by their most extreme supporters - and it is a real problem - won't it be time to set up a provisional UN protectorate?' he asked in a speech to the Royal United Services Institute in London. He recognised that this would be costly but warned that if a purely Moslem state were created in the middle of Bosnia the country might become a long-term source of tension comparable to the Middle East. Islamic fundamentalism would be given a chance it never had before in the former Yugoslavia, he said. The UN could try to 'freeze' the present situation and prevent the three proposed states of a partitioned Bosnia from driving out minorities.</p>

			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / Arts: The visual scene - Edinburgh International Festival IN the past, there have been complaints that the visual arts at the Edinburgh Festival have not sufficiently reflected the state of Scottish art past or present. This situation is handsomely redeemed this year with exhibitions of Allan Ramsay at the National Portrait Gallery, James Pryde at the Gallery of Modern Art, Will Maclean at the Talbot Rice Gallery, University of Edinburgh, while the Scottish Gallery is celebrating 150 years of purveying exclusively Scottish art. Will Maclean is a Highlander whose art is informed by his heritage. His acute consciousness of the tragic history of his people was passed on to him by his father, who came from a fishing-crofting family. Maclean's symbolic and mythological imagery, drawn principally from the sea, offers levels of metaphor beyond the visible. The panels and boxes that he makes, a mixture of carved wood, bone and found objects, often take the form of reliquaries, shrines to a vanished age, or altars for the worship of a pagan cult lost in the mists of time. Maclean archaeologises and reinvents the past, his own in Memories of a Northern Childhood, 1977, consisting of a panel to which are attached found objects connected with seafaring, a piece of slate carved with a fishing vessel inset like a votive offering into a kind of tabernacle. Equally unspecific, yet at the same time a more general requiem for a disappearing culture, is Abigail's Apron, 1980, a surrogate portrait of his aunt, represented only by her carved wooden apron and the mysterious objects protruding from the pocket. The elegiac Skye Fishermen In Memoriam, 1989, is a lament for those lost at sea, the discarded piece of sacking, the fishing net and an old industrial glove inducing a sense of the fragility of life. The most recent piece The Emigrant Ship, 1992, is central to Maclean's lifelong concern with the Clearances. The title is a homage to the painting of the same name by Sir William McTaggart, who was also a Highlander. Maclean's painting was inspired by the skeleton of a ship scratched on an old school wall in Mull and the inscriptions on the windows of the church where the victims tried to shelter. The space and symbolic imagery of Maclean's piece works at both conscious and unconscious levels; it is at once a threnody for the tragic misfortunes of the past and a warning for the future. The darkling paintings of James Pryde (1866-1941) are exhibited in all their theatrical splendour at the Gallery of Modern Art in a fitting tribute to one of Scotland's more neglected sons. The central room is hung with the huge romantic paintings commissioned by Annie, Lady Cowdray, for the Library at Dunecht House in Aberdeenshire. The walls have been repainted a deep turquoise for the occasion, the original colour at Dunecht, and the paintings are brilliantly lit, bringing out the inherent drama of the canvases. Pryde had a predilection for ruins, which was given full rein in the Cowdray paintings A Blue Ruin, A Red Ruin and Cowdray Ruins. Building on a legendary visit by Queen Elizabeth I to Cowdray, there is also Queen Elizabeth's Bedroom, which, not surprisingly, is in ruins. They are haunting and nostalgic images, certainly the flower of his achievement. Pryde was born and brought up in Edinburgh, and the memory of the towering vistas of the Old Town architecture stayed with him all his life, the figures in his paintings becoming progressively smaller while the architectural features grew ever more elongated and mannered, until they become the stuff of nightmares. The final series, on which he was still working at his death, was inspired by the vast bed at Holyrood House in which Mary, Queen of Scots, was supposed to have slept. For him it encompasses birth and death, especially death. Pryde's best-known early achievements were the posters he made in collaboration with William Nicholson, collectively known as the Beggarstaff Brothers, but the partnership was short-lived. Pryde went on to indulge his fascination with low-life portraits of notorious criminals and, more important for his future bent, theatrical portraits. His passion for the theatre culminated in his stage sets for the 1930 production of Othello, starring Paul Robeson and Peggy Ashcroft. It was his swan song, and the last 10 years of his life were barren. Nothing to do with Scotland, but tenuously connected to Britain's presidency of the EC and supported by the European Arts Festival, the Royal Scottish Academy is hosting an exhibition of Joan Miro's sculpture a year ahead of his centenary, lent in its entirety by the Fondation Maeght, France. However, no spurious reason is required: the exhibition is pure joy. Miro only came to sculpture in a big way during the last 20 years of his life, although he had modelled and cast a few in the 1940s. One senses that the 72 sculptures here exhibited are more in the nature of jeux d'esprit, a relaxation of the intensity of his work a painter. There is no relaxation in the inventiveness of the forms and the mischievous pleasure he takes in juxtaposing incongruous features. As ever, his recurrent motifs are women and birds, together or separately. The bird, symbol of freedom, takes many forms - as long as it is on top, you know it is a bird, whether it be a shoe tree or a tuning fork. Women too can take any form, from a high chair, representing maternity, to an upturned stool, suggesting passivity, while the materials encompass any amount of found objects, from a turtle shell to a kettle. Miro delighted in using anything that came to hand, hoarding odds and ends until he found a use for them, even appropriating the casting tools he was working with. The imaginative transformation of banal objects is comparable to Picasso's assemblages, such as his She-Goat, 1950, whose belly is cast from a wicker basket. Miro casts a straw basket for a woman's head, and a one-armed plastic doll for her nose. The sculptures are vivid reminders of Calder's circus figures of the 1920s, when both he and Miro were newly arrived in Paris. Miro's relationship with contemporary British sculpture is apparent. Balancing Act, 1970, presupposes Barry Flanagan's leaping hares, and the shinily-painted red legs of Young Girl Escaping 1968, have a jauntiness similar to Allen Jones's tangoing figures. They may be an old man's playthings, but the old man was in full inventive flight.</p>

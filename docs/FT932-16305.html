			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: ISMA considers cutting standard settlement period THE International Securities Market Association is to canvas its members on whether to shorten the current standard settlement period in the international bond market from seven calendar days to three, or possibly even two, business days. Mr John Langton, Isma secretary-general, said a shorter settlement period would help reduce systemic risk by cutting the length of time market-users were at risk from default by a counter-party. Isma plans to raise the matter at its annual meeting in Copenhagen in May. Three-day settlement was recommended by the Group of 30 four years ago as one of the standards for national settlement systems. Mr John Dowsett, a director of fixed income brokers Luthy Baillie Dowsett Pethick and one of the promoters of the idea, said that domestic bond markets in a number of countries - including Germany, the UK and the US - already operated on settlement cycles of two days or less. 'With the technology in place these days, most people are already capable of settling in one day,' he said. The possible switch was generally welcomed by large brokers and traders in London, though it is likely to meet with greater resistance from smaller financial institutions, which could face higher costs in upgrading their systems for a shorter settlement cycle. Isma is unlikely to recommend the introduction of the shorter period before 1996.</p>

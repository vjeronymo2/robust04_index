			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading STOCK index futures followed the afternoon slide on Wall Street, falling sharply after a steady performance earlier in the day, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the March contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,854. This proved to be the high of the day and March drifted down, mainly due to a lack of buying interest at the higher levels. By mid-morning the contract had retreated to 2,846. However, the release of Public Sector Borrowing Requirement figures that were better than expected provided some comfort and caused a turnround in the contract as buyers emerged. But this recovery was wiped out in the afternoon when dealers in London, seeing the falls on Wall Street as it reacted to the prospect of higher taxes, rushed to sell March in a bout of almost panic trading. Having traded at around fair value for most of the day, the contract fell to a discount which was as deep as 6 points at the worst. March finished at 2,798, just ahead of the day's low and with a fall of 55 against the previous session. Turnover, at 12,151 lots, was healthy. Volume in the traded options was also good, reaching 34,541 contracts by the close. The FT-SE 100 option had 9,581 lots dealt, while some 1,606 contracts were traded in the Euro FT-SE 100 option. BP, the busiest stock option, traded 2,568 lots, followed by Tesco with 2,093.</p>

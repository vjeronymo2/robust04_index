			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Valeriya Mikhaylova report: "Konstantin Trenchev Closes </F> PODKREPA Daily"]    [Text] The Executive Council of the Podkrepa Labor  Confederation adopted a decision on "temporarily" stopping the  publication of the PODKREPA daily as of 2 March. The decision  was explained by the trade union's activity related to  restructuring its information-publishing activity.    An announcement of the Podkrepa Labor Confederation's Press  Center indicates that the Executive Council has declared a  partial liquidation of the PODKREPA daily as a separate  department of the confederation. The effective date is 2 March  1994.    The decision on the newspaper's going into liquidation was  adopted against the background of the conflicts that developed  between the newspaper's editorial board and the leadership of  the Podkrepa Labor Confederation. More than one month ago Dr.  Trenchev openly expressed his dissatisfaction with the  information published by the newspaper. Margarita Vurbanova,  PODKREPA's chief editor, was fired. PODKREPA's journalists  accused the confederation of refusing to pay their wages and  royalties. Informed sources claim that the newspaper will begin  to appear in a new format, and that it will be financed by  powerful economic groups.</p>

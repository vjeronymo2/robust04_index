The Iraqi minister explained the  deteriorating medical conditions in Iraq due to the  international embargo imposed on that country since the Gulf war.    Mubarak asked the Arab League to help in releasing Iraq's  frozen funds abroad so that medicine, food, and medical supplies  can be bought for the Iraqi people.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that the Arab League's bodies,  for  humanitarian reasons, are concerned about lifting the suffering  of the Iraqi people.</p>

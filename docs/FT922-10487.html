			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / International Company News: European offshoot stages a recovery FORD of Europe staged a financial recovery in the first three months this year and achieved a net profit of Dollars 84m against a loss of Dollars 129m a year ago. Its automotive operations, including Jaguar, its UK luxury car subsidiary, slumped to a net loss in the whole of last year of Dollars 1.079bn from a net profit of Dollars 145m in 1990 and a profit of Dollars 1.19bn in 1989. Ford said it operated profitably in most of its main European markets in the first quarter, and had reduced the operating losses of Jaguar to Dollars 90m from around Dollars 130m. The company claimed Ford of Britain - now excluding Jaguar, where ownership has been transferred to the US parent company - had also achieved a small profit in the first three months after suffering record losses last year. The financial improvement in the UK, achieved despite the continuing decline in the UK new car market, was the chief factor behind Ford of Europe's return to profit. In the whole of last year the losses of Dollars 761m at Ford of Britain and Dollars 354m at Jaguar had more than offset profits made in continental Europe and in some other overseas markets. Ford of Britain, excluding Jaguar, made a small profit in the first quarter, despite a 10.3 per cent fall in sales volume to 95,896 from 106,892 a year ago. Ford said its UK marketing costs, although still high, had been reduced to 17 per cent of sales revenues from 19 per cent a year ago.</p>

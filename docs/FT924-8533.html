			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown warns on Europe MR PADDY Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday served notice that his party could withdraw its support for the government over Maastricht if ministers fail to show, 'the urgency necessary' to get the treaty ratified 'as soon as possible'. Mr Ashdown accepted the bill's committee stage would not be completed before the Spring. But in a letter to Mr John Major he signalled that Liberal Democrats may withdraw support if the treaty is delayed much beyond April - in order to wait for the second Danish referendum on Maastricht - for the third reading. Support of 19 Liberal Democrat MPs last week saved Mr Major from defeat. Mr Ashdown says he would still have voted with the government if he had known Euro-sceptics were told the third reading would be after the Danish poll. But his letter hints at some irritation over the concession. He called for Mr Major to clear up the confusion over whether the second Danish referendum and the third reading were interdependent, in order to, 'counter the growing suspicion. . . that your leadership at this crucial stage on Europe is failing.' Separately, the Liberal Democrats yesterday reversed their general election pledge to raise income tax to finance extra education spending and a recovery package. Unveiling Liberal Democrat plans for economic recovery ahead of tomorrow's Autumn Statement, Mr Alan Beith, the party's Treasury spokesman, said: 'I would be reluctant to impose a general tax increase in the current, even deeper, state of recession.' But he defended the pledges made during the election, saying: 'We don't think what we said at the general election was a mistake. Indeed had it been done, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in now.' Liberal Democrats promised in April not to implement the new lower 20p tax band and to increase the basic rate of income tax by 1p. That would have helped finance an extra Pounds 4bn of public investment and boost education expenditure. The recovery package announced yesterday included a 'large and immediate' increase in public investment.</p>

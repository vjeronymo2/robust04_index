			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary acknowledges that there are many possible approaches to the establishment of the standards for measuring success in prebaccalaureate vocational programs, both in terms of the information collected and the minimum standard selected. For example, if an institution's students are mainly first-time, full-time students in short-term programs, agencies could use data collected by institutions under the Student Right-to-Know and Campus Security Act of 1990 for calculating completion rates. Minimum job placement rate standards might be developed using three-year moving averages, adjusted for regional unemployment rates as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor. Further, a job placement rate could be calculated only for those jobs in the areas for which training was offered, all jobs obtained by graduates, or a combination of the two.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary specifically invites suggestions for standards in this area. Further, the Secretary understands that developing appropriate standards in these areas is not easy and requests suggestions with regard to specific rates for the standards in these areas. The Secretary suggests as a reference point for completion and placement rates the statutory requirement, contained in section 481(e)(2) of the HEA, that, to be an eligible short-term vocational program under the SFA programs, a program must have a 70 percent completion and a 70 percent placement rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 602.26(b)(10)&blank; <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the HEA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Section 496(a)(5)(J) of the HEA requires an accrediting agency to have standards that address an institution's default rates in the student loan programs established under Title IV of the HEA. It is the Secretary's view that the purpose of this requirement is to enable the agency to determine if an institution is out of compliance with its accrediting standards when the institution's latest cohort default rate under the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) programs exceeds a certain threshold or has increased significantly over its previous rate. The Secretary proposes to require an agency to conduct a review if an institution's latest cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25 percent. The Secretary establishes this rate as the trigger for review because that is the rate, beginning in fiscal year 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 1, 1993, at which an institution will be disqualified from participating in the FFEL programs. An accrediting agency is free, of course, to set its trigger for review at a default rate below 25 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also is concerned that a significant change in an institution's default rate could be an indication of other serious problems that may affect the institution's compliance with an agency's standards. For this reason, the Secretary proposes to require an agency to conduct a review when the institution's latest cohort default rate increases significantly over its rate the previous year. The Secretary does not propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to define the term ``significant increase'' in the proposed regulations but invites comments on an appropriate definition. One possibility that the Secretary is considering is to require an agency to conduct a review when the institution's default rate increases by more than 50 percent from its previous rate, provided that previous rate exceeds 10 percent. The Secretary believes that a cohort default rate below 10 percent is not necessarily an indication that the institution may be in violation of its accrediting agency's standards. Therefore, this provision would apply only if the institution's latest cohort default rate exceeds 15 percent and has increased by more than 50 percent from its previous rate. The Secretary invites comments on this approach and other approaches that will provide guidance to agencies on what constitutes a significant increase in default rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

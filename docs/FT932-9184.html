			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: Moody's downgrades two Skandia offshoots MOODY'S Investors Service yesterday downgraded the short-term ratings of two units of Skandia, the Swedish insurer, due to concerns about the group's asset quality and financial flexibility. The agency lowered its ratings on the Eurocommercial paper programmes of Skandia Capital AB and Skandia International Capital Corp to Prime-3 from Prime-2, affecting programme totals of Dollars 600m and Dollars 200m respectively. Moody's said 'substantial leverage' was needed to support Skandia's finance operations and investments in subsidiaries and real estate, but warned that its ability to generate capital through retained earnings would remain under pressure 'given the likelihood of additional deterioration in the value of its real estate holdings in Stockholm, London and Madrid'. However, it was positive about the group's proposed restructuring and said its position should have been improved by rising Swedish share prices. Nikki Tait in New York adds: Centre Reinsurance Companies, which is majority-owned by Zurich Insurance Group, is to take over the 'finite' reinsurance business of Skandia America Reinsurance Corp, part of the Skandia group. Under the agreement, New York-based Centre Re will reinsure the portfolio and take financial responsibility for the business. The Swedish-owned company said this would allow it to focus on traditional property-casualty insurance. SARC has assets of more than Dollars 1.4bn and a surplus in excess of Dollars 293m. Centre Re, which also counts Kemper Securities and Northwestern Mutual Life Company among its shareholders, had assets of Dollars 49bn at end-1991 and a surplus of Dollars 4.9bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report from a meeting at the Belarusian </F> Defense Ministry]    [Text] The Belarusian defense minister has held a meeting  with Collegium members, chiefs of administrations, services, and  departments of the central administration, as well as the  leadership of the "Transaviaeksport" air transportation company.    At the beginning of the meeting, Colonel General P.  Kazlowski  said the election campaign has entered its final stage.  Candidates for Belarusian president meet with working teams and  servicemen and present their election platforms and views on the  current political processes in the country on radio and  television. They also criticize economic reforms carried out by  our government in a bid to attract as many voters as possible.    To win the trust of the general public, they often resort to  various tricks. Sometimes, not only are they untactful toward  each other, but they also cast shadow on entire public groups,  including the Armed Forces and their leadership. Facts,  arguments, and proof mean nothing to them. What matters to them  is smearing everything with black paint and adding as much  slander and even lies as possible. These are the kinds of  weapons they fight with.    The reason for this may be that teams of some candidates  include people of dubious reputation. Unfortunately, their  instructions are indiscriminately used in public appearances.    The Defense Ministry, Colonel General P. Kalzowski said,  closely watches the election debates and will certainly react to  attacks targeted at it. The objective of all commanders, staff  officers, and educational structures is to help the personnel  listen to televised addresses by the presidential candidates,  carefully study them, and select the best one. It stands to  reason that the future president will have to care for Belarus,  its Armed Forces, and the people's well-being. Therefore, he  should have a broad life experience, an extensive professional  background, and have good organizational and personal skills.  He should be a man who instead of wasting his breath, will  wisely and consistently conduct socioeconomic transformations  and protect the security of his country.    Lieutenant General N. Churkin, General Staff chief and first  defense minister, presented a report at the meeting. He  stressed that the Armed Forces is a state institution. The Army  properly performs its constitutional duties, reliably protecting  boundaries of its Homeland. Complying with the law, all  servicemen will participate in the presidential elections. And  they do care who will occupy the highest post in the state.  This is why one needs to meet people constantly to explain to  them the presidents' programs, and to help them properly  understand the current situation so that the servicemen make the  right choice.    Reports were also made by A. Tushinskiy, first deputy  defense  minister; Lieutenant General A. Zuyev, deputy defense minister  for logistics; Major General A. Sikora, deputy defense minister  for military construction and housing; Major General V.  Lepeshinski, chief of the Engineering Troops Administration;  Colonel V. Chekov, chief of the Relations and Information  Administration; and other officials who expressed their attitude  toward populist and groundless statements by some presidential  candidates about the Armed Forces, and presented their proposals  for involving servicemen, the full-fledged Belarusian citizens,  in election campaign events.    The Defense Ministry Collegium adopted a declaration. It  also examined other important issues.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Jan 10, BNS - Estonian President Lennart  Meri at 3.40 p.m. [1340 GMT] today officially denied reports on  having approved the list of the four minister nominations and  said the information provided to the press by Prime Minister  Mart Laar was wrong.    Meri also said he had "no intention to sign the ruling," the  president's spokesman said.    The spokesman confirmed reports that the president was going  to address the parliament 10 a.m. Tuesday.    The president also confirmed the reports that he had talked  with the parliament's Deputy Speaker Tunne Kelam on the  telephone, but denied having told Kelam that he was going to  approve the minister candidates.    The president's statement came after the prime minister less  than two hours earlier had quoted Kelam as saying that the  president had promised to approve all four minister candidates.  Kelam conveyed the president's words at a meeting with the  ruling coalition MPs at the government and parliament residence  at Toompea today, Laar said.    The prime minister said the government coalition at the  meeting had ruled to offer to the president the possibility to  meet all the coalition's MPs at a time and conditions convenient  for the president.    "I am glad that the problem got a solution. This provides us  with the possibility to continue our work confidently and with  constructiveness. There are things to learn for all of us in the  recent developments. The things that happened show that we have  to adopt a number of laws to establish more exactly how things  have to proceed. That sparks strike every now and then from  contacts between the institutions of the president, the State  Court and the chancellor of law unfortunately cannot be avoided  in the first year following the adoption of the constitution,  since we are a young democracy," Laar said.    The prime minister said a constitutional dispute was no sign  of the constitution's weakness.    "The same provisions also exist in the German constitution,  for instance, and our legal system in many aspects is based on  that system. In Germany the democratic tradition quite simply is  so long that problems like this never come up," Laar said.    Ain Saarna, spokesman to the prime minister, said the  government was expecting the document from the president and was  going to abstain from comment for the time being.    The presidential press office in the latest report said  Prime  Minister Mart Laar on Sunday, Jan. 9 had presented to the  president the new ministerial candidates and submitted a new  proposal to approve the ministerial nominations.    The president is going to make his decision Tuesday and read  it to the parliament at 10 a.m. the same day.</p>

			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / W German production picks up speed West German industrial output, the main motor of the federal economy, is gaining momentum and order intake is rising sharply, according to data published yesterday. Production from western factories, mines and power plant rose 1 per cent during June, the economics ministry said in a preliminary report. Adding a rider that it expected this to be revised upwards to more than 1.5 per cent, it noted that May's decline, originally put at 0.7 per cent, had been only 0.1 per cent. Economists said if this pace were maintained, and orders continued to rise, west Germany could see overall economic growth of more than 2 per cent this year - matching government forecasts previously regarded as over-optimistic. Although some voiced concern about the effect of the strong D-Mark on exports and the still-evident lack of domestic demand for consumer goods, most expected a recent rise in business confidence to be underpinned by strong growth in industrial order data, due later this week. An early indication of demand trends emerged yesterday when officials in North Rhine-Westphalia, the region's manufacturing heartland, said orders had risen 7 per cent in June, with domestic and export bookings both showing the same rate of growth. This indicated further hardening of a recently detectable increase in support from the home market for a recovery which had hitherto been predominantly export-led. Although German industrial output figures tend to be volatile, the economics ministry's comparison of aggregate data for May and June with the same period of 1993 showed overall western industrial production up 3.2 per cent. Manufacturing industry, excluding mining, energy and construction, stepped up output by 3.5 per cent in the same period, with items such as components and basic materials up more than 7 per cent. The most significant negative result came from consumer goods, down 1.3 per cent for the two-month period. The North Rhine-Westphalian order figures suggested that falling real incomes are still depressing consumer-related industries. While foreign orders for consumer goods from the state's factories rose 6 per cent, domestic bookings fell 4 per cent during the month. Apart from economists, several leading German companies, including the Allianz insurance group and BMW, have recently suggested Germany's recovery could be damaged if an over-valued D-Mark depressed exports. However, latest data from the Bundesbank show that the currency has appreciated against those of its most important European Union trading partners by only 0.1 per cent since the start of the year. It has risen 8.2 per cent against the dollar in the same period, but the US accounts for only around 10 per cent of German exports.</p>

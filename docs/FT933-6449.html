			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Rentokil So much for worries about Rentokil's ability to keep earnings growing by 20 per cent a year. Thanks to some impressive work on margins in the first half, it remains comfortably within that target, even after stripping out exchange rate effects. That should keep the faithful satisfied for a while. Its growth ambitions are growing harder to satisfy just the same. UK margins approaching 30 per cent simply cannot be pushed much higher. Rentokil thus has to rely on volume growth. Its recent purchase of Securiguard could help. But it is still likely to need a steady diet of further acquisitions. Although Securiguard has eaten up the Pounds 74m net cash on its books at the half year, Rentokil could easily accumulate a further Pounds 100m by the end of next year. Yet with net assets low in proportion to its business, Rentokil cannot afford to write off much goodwill. Any large acquisitions might therefore have to be accompanied by a share issue, for much the same reason as MB-Caradon launched a rights issue to help pay for its purchase of Pillar from RTZ. The difference is that, unlike Caradon, Rentokil has a large single shareholder: Denmark's Sophus Berendsen owns nearly 56 per cent. Rentokil must hope that, if the need does arise, Berendsen will put its money on the table. Its failure to do so would be a clear signal that others should sell.</p>

			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / People: Waddell to Shanks &amp; McEwan Shanks &amp; McEwan, the Glasgow-based waste management company, has appointed Gordon Waddell to replace Peter Runciman as chairman at the end of the year. A Glasgow-based boy who was capped 17 times for Scotland, Waddell went to South Africa where he married the daughter of Harry Oppenheimer, the head of mining group, Anglo American Corp. Reversing a more normal course of events, Oppenheimer hired the persuasive Scot after Waddell had already separated from his daughter. In spite of sitting as a Progressive Party Member of Parliament in Johannesburg for three years in the 1970s, Waddell decided not to settle in South Africa and returned in 1988 to reacquaint himself with his Scottish roots. He is a director at Cadbury Schweppes and, in 1989, became chairman of Fairway Group, the educational products group. And he sat alongside Peter Runciman as a director of Scottish National Trust. He becomes chairman only two months after joining the board, his elevation apparently accelerated by an illness Runciman suffered 18 months ago. Runciman, who is approaching 65, is unlikely to lack distractions. He retains a large shareholding in Shanks, where he was first appointed as company doctor 12 years ago when the company was capitalised at Pounds 12m and losing money. Runciman is also a director of Scottish Opera and a non-executive director of British Steel. Though on the Environment Council of the CBI, Runciman is likely to increase his attacks on the local wildlife - and not just on his own river. A keen amateur of fly fishing, Runciman says he is close to tracking down suitable stretches of river in Russia, where the sport is apparently hardly known. See Observer</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Arts: Today's Television Barry Hearn is a key factor in the sports world. In the 1980s he dominated snooker, acting as agent to most of the leading players, including Steve Davis. When the popularity of the green baize started to wane Hearn shifted his attention to boxing. This has proved a much harder game to crack, but, as the manager of Chris Eubank, Hearn has already made fortunes for himself and his clients. In On the Line: Boxing Clever (BBC 2 at 8pm), the TV cameras follow Essex man Hearn around the world as he does his deals. It had to happen: British television is linking into Court TV, the US channel which brings live transmissions of court room proceedings. Tonight there is footage of the case which has gripped the US by the throat - the trial for murder of one of its most celebrated black sports stars and actors, OJ Simpson. (BBC 2 at 9pm). In Travels with my Camera (Channel 4 at 9pm) Charles Nicholls tries to replicate the journey into Africa of the poet Arthur Rimbaud a century ago. For escapists, Martin Jarvis is reading William stories by Richmal Crompton every morning on Radio 4 at 8.40am.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Sprint/EDS A disagreement over the relative values of Sprint and EDS caused the breakdown in their merger talks. But the logic of putting a telecom operator together with a data processing company is still plausible, if a little fuzzy. Since both companies are important pieces on the multimedia chess board, a further phase in the complex game of telecoms alliances is in prospect. Sprint will be the centrepiece of attempts to put together a third force in the US telecoms market to compete with AT&amp;T and MCI. It will also be a player in whatever group emerges to rival the global alliances led by AT&amp;T and BT/MCI. With indications that France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are going cold on linking up with AT&amp;T, the likelihood that Europe's two largest carriers will join forces with Sprint has increased. Some sort of alliance with NTT is also possible, though the Japanese carrier is still being wooed by BT and in any case is limited by regulations in what it can do in overseas markets. There is little point in combining EDS with another company which does not own a US telecom network. It may therefore make sense for it to gain its independence from General Motors and use whichever networks offer the best deal. Alternatively BT, which came close to buying a stake in EDS two years ago, may renew its interest. Shareholders in the UK group, though, are likely to be worried about the dilution implicit in such a move.</p>

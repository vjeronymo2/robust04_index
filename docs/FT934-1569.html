			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Poor advice on pensions feared for 1m women: Survey indicates mis-selling Nearly 1m women who contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme to invest in personal pensions may have been better off staying in the state scheme because they earn too little to benefit from tax incentives which make contracting out worthwhile. Government statistics released by the Department of Social Security yesterday show that, in addition to unsuitable pension sales to these women, there may also have been widespread mis-selling to other personal pension holders. The first demographic analysis of personal pension holders in Britain shows significant numbers of sales to those who cannot benefit from tax incentives. These people may in fact be worse off if they contract out of Serps because they have given up their rights to state benefits. The data show that the tax rebates which have been a chief selling point contribute very little to the average personal pension. The median annual contribution from tax rebates for women was Pounds 205 per year, and for men Pounds 395. Government statistics released yesterday also show that the greatest increase in personal pension sales in the 1991-92 fiscal year was to those who were 45 years or over at the time, and who would have been better off remaining in Serps. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief regulatory watchdog, has announced a sweeping review of all personal pensions sold to individuals who have transferred out of their occupational schemes. The SIB commissioned a study by accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick which, after a sample review of files, found that there was clear evidence that nine out of 10 files contained too little information, suspect advice or both. The SIB has said it also intends to review the sale of rebate-only pensions. The government data represent the first comprehensive review of the categories of people who make up the UK's 5m personal pensions holders. It examines which types of individuals have received more than Pounds 9bn in tax benefits since personal pensions were introduced in mid-1988. The data show that a significant number of personal pensions - 18 per cent of the total - have been sold to those with no income, and another 7 per cent were sold to people earning under the Pounds 2,704 a year lower limit who did not have to pay national insurance. The statistics show that the median income of women personal pension holders is Pounds 6,250. While estimates vary of just how much income an individual needed in 1991/92 to benefit from contracting out, insurance companies agree that at least Pounds 6,000 to Pounds 8,000 of earnings would be required. The study found that the median income of male personal pension holders was Pounds 9,550, suggesting that significant numbers of men had also contracted out against their own interests.</p>

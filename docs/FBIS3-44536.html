			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 5 (XINHUA) -- Chinese agriculture  minister Liu Jiang said today that some Chinese farm produce  will be more competitive on the international market after China  resumes its GATT status and unifies its dual-rate foreign  exchange system.    Speaking at a four-day national conference on rural work,  the  minister said that with the resumption of China's status as a  GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) founding member  country, some Chinese farm produce will have a broader  international market.    "After China unifies its foreign exchange rates, prices of  some farm produce will be more competitive, such as corn,  soybeans, fruit, aquatic products and meat products," said the  minister.    China unified its exchange rates on January 1 this year and  is preparing to resume its GATT status.    However, production of some other agricultural products,  such  as wool, rubber, milk and milk products, and prawns, will  inevitably be affected, since China will abolish some non-tariff  protection measures, including the system of import and export  licensing for and quotas on farm produce.    He said that China should actively readjust its agricultural  product mix, make greater efforts to develop an export-oriented  farm economy and improve the quality of its farm produce.    According to the minister, the export of farm produce and  their finished products accounts for 40 percent of China's  foreign exchange earnings.    Liu described exports as important in balancing the  country's  foreign exchange income and expenditure and in promoting  agricultural development.    He admitted that the export of farm produce in recent years  has not been "as good as it should be," attributing the problem  mainly to low quality and lack of competitiveness.    "Rice is a traditional export product for China. Although  its domestic prices have been lower than those on the  international market in recent years, the total quantity of  exported rice has be shrinking," said the minister.    He urged agricultural departments at all levels to help  agro-  businesses to set up group firms and improve the quality of farm  produce, so as to rapidly increase international trade of  China's agricultural products.</p>

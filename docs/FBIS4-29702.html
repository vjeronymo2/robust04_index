			<p>BFN     [Text] Cuba's ambassador to the Philippines, Jose Luis  Martin Portal, had been found dead at his Manila home,  apparently from cardiac arrest. He was 49.    The Philippines' Foreign Office said Portal's body was found  on Sunday evening [19 June] by his household staff, who called  the police. Portal's wife and children were in Havana, and the  envoy was living alone in the exclusive North Forbes Park  district in Metro Manila. Police said they found no sign of  foul play.    Portal assumed his Manila post in October 1990.</p>

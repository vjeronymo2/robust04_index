This was stated by Zhang Sai, director-general of the State  Statistics Bureau, at a press conference focusing on a  communique on the 1993 national economic and social development.    According to the official, the country's gross domestic  product (GDP) last year reached 3,000 billion yuan, an increase  of 736 billion yuan, or 13.4 percent over the 1992 figure at  comparable prices.    This was the highest annual growth since 1985, Zhang said.    The output of key industrial and agricultural products was  all-time high and the infrastructure facilities were improved  further, thus creating favorable conditions for the sustained  development of the national economy, he added.    Zhang also said that in 1993, China's scientific and  technological capabilities continued expanding, and that the  foreign exchange reserves increased.    On people's living standards, he noted that in 1993,  household income registered further increase.    The per capita income of urban residents that could be used  as living expenses was 2,337 yuan, and the per capita income of  rural residents was 921 yuan, a real growth of 10.2 percent and  3.2 percent, respectively, if the increase in prices was  excluded.    The living conditions in both urban and rural areas further  improved, Zhang said, noting that 266 million square meters of  new housing were completed in urban areas and another 570  million square meters of new houses were built in the  countryside.    The scope of household consumption widened. Following  possession of durable goods such as refrigerators, color TV  sets, VCRs and hi-fi systems, some families were targeting  telephones and automobiles as new items of consumption, Zhang  said.    By the end of 1993, he continued, private telephone  subscribers had reached 7.826 million, 3.672 million more than a  year ago. Seven percent of the urban households had installed  telephones. Pagers and mobile telephones were becoming  increasingly popular.    On China's economic reforms, he noted that in 1993, reforms  that focused on the establishment of a socialist market economy  developed in depth.    The official cited progress in the rural reforms and reforms  of the state-owned enterprises, the labor and wage system, the  social security system, the housing system, the macro-economic  regulation system and the pricing system.    Major breakthroughs were made in two aspects, he said.    On the one hand, the price system was straightened out, and  this helped raise the unduly low prices of basic products and  infrastructure facilities and promote the formation of market  mechanisms.    On the other, while breaking away with the traditional means  of macroeconomic regulation, experiments were made in using  various regulatory approaches at proper timing with appropriate  strength. Positive results were made and good experiences  accumulated as a result.    In 1993, Zhang said, China continued its opening policy in a  comprehensive, in-depth and multi-facet way. Foreign trade  further expanded, with improved structure of import and export.    The utilization of foreign capital registered significant  increase, and new record was set both in the number of new  contracts signed for using foreign capital and in the value of  foreign capital actually used, he said.    The official also noted what he called "noticeable progress"  made in economic and technical cooperation with foreign  countries and in international tourism.    According to Zhang, major problems that remained in China's  economic performance included: a decline of living standards  for some households as a result of the high price increases, two  large a scale of the investment in fixed assets under  construction, and failure of the development of basic industries  and the infrastructure to meet the requirements of the high  economic growth.    In summary, Zhang said, the economic development in 1993 was  encouraging, and new changes took place in all fields, thus  creating favorable conditions for implementing the guideline for  1994 economic work -- seizing the opportunity, deepening the  reforms, widening the opening of China to the outside world,  accelerating development while maintaining stability.</p>

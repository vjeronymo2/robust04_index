			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / UK Company News: Bundaberg may let offers lapse Bundaberg Sugar, the Australian subsidiary of Tate &amp; Lyle, is expected to allow its ADollars 121m (Pounds 58m) offers for two crushing mills in Queensland to lapse on April 29. The company yesterday published the required formal notices stating that the offers could not be declared unconditional. It has also passed the date for notifying a further extension of the bids. Bundaberg's decision to withdraw, follows a battle for control of the Tully and South Johnstone mills, whose unlisted shares are mainly held by local cane growers. The turning-point came last week when South Johnstone shareholders voted against lifting the limit on the number of shares which any single investor could hold in the mill. Yesterday, an adviser to the mills said they would now pursue their own plan to merge.</p>

			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Business and the Environment: Put to the green test - Environmental advice is becoming big business, but there are calls for higher standards When Falkirk District Council hired a consultant four years ago to assess the environmental impact of a proposed asbestos disposal site, the report it received was far from comprehensive. In exchange for their fee, officials were sent a meagre two pages of text and a couple of low-quality maps of the area under examination. It was hardly the basis for a detailed assessment of the risks to the soil and water, the level of treatment of the waste or a consideration of alternative uses for the land. As legislative requirements and voluntary pressures have forced companies and government agencies to take environmental issues seriously, demand has grown for consultants to help meet their needs. But the last few months have also brought growing calls for improved quality from these consultants, as bitter experiences of the results take hold. Now professional bodies are beginning to respond. Carl Fuller of the Institute of Environment Assessment, who regularly examines consultants' reports, says one of the most frequent problems is a lack of consideration of alternative options during a review. Consultants often fail to identify weaknesses in proposals, ignore the way sites would change if a project did not proceed and make elementary errors such as conducting ecological surveys in December when there is little prospect of discovering the full range of fauna and flora in the area being surveyed. His thoughts are supported by research conducted by Norman Lee of the environmental impact assessment centre at Manchester University. Based on a sample of 85 of the 500 environmental statements in the UK prepared during 1988-91, he found a gradual improvement over time, but that even in 1990-91 two-fifths were still graded unsatisfactory (see table). The demand for environmental consultancy is very large and partly externally imposed. Legal requirements such as the 1990 Environmental Protection Act, and other codes such as BS 7750, the British Standard on environmental management, and Emas, the EC's new ecological auditing and management scheme, are all playing a part. A recent survey by Environmental Data Services identifies 339 entities which it recognises as environmental consultants, with billings of Pounds 400m. The institute's figures suggest the total of those using the label is nearer 700. At the same time, there are no real barriers to entry and no regulatory or other official body to ensure that minimum standards are maintained. The National Accreditation Council for Certification Bodies may examine those wishing to be verifiers of company environmental statements for Emas. But, in the far more lucrative market of general consulting, there is no such independent scrutiny. 'The whole environmental business has expanded very dramatically,' says Chris Luck, a director of Environmental Resources Limited (ERL). 'You become concerned about the maintenance of professional standards. There have been worries about how people will know whether they are going to get a good quality service.' Prime among the difficulties is the lack of adequately qualified staff. The institute has taken a lead in tackling this problem through the creation of the Environmental Auditors Registration Association scheme (Eara) last October, backed by industry, government bodies and consultancies. Eara maintains a register of those individuals who have reached one of the three recognised levels of membership: provisional environmental auditor, environmental auditor and principal environmental auditor. Registration at the different levels depends on achieving a certain number of points through professional and academic qualifications, training and practical experience. Principals must also submit a written dissertation on which they are orally examined. David Thompson, the scheme manager, says there have been more than 500 applications. He hopes that there will be more than 1,000 names on the register before the end of the year. There are similar attempts to raise standards for businesses through the Association of Environmental Consultancies - which currently represents 28 of the larger firms in the industry. At the end of last month, the association finally ratified a code of practice and launched a registration scheme. Companies are subject to a review conducted by individuals from two or three other member consultancies, who look at systems and procedures. They are supported by a team from Imperial College, London who examine a sample of commercially-sensitive files on client work. There is a nominal Pounds 750 fee. Those that pass or have only minor shortcomings will be audited again in a year, and then every two years. Those that require more work will be re-examined after six months. So far, 18 companies have been registered and can be expected to be audited by the end of March next year. 'It is by no means a formality,' says Geoff Mills, head of Gibb Environmental and chairman of the working group for the scheme. 'There has been some real soul-searching from firms about applying. But this is not a cartel. We would love others to apply.' ERL was chosen as the guinea pig, and was visited last December. Luck says: 'Overall the process worked pretty well. It served to confirm our approach and will ultimately enhance the quality of service we provide. We have mentioned our registration to clients and in proposals and it has certainly been very well received.' That leaves two questions. First, how far credibility in a system of self-regulation can be maintained. That may only be tested when the institute and the association have to police and take disciplinary action against members. Second, whether in the absence of any formal legal requirements, the reputation and the profile of the two schemes will be sufficient to persuade potential customers to use those registered rather than the many continued fringe players who are not.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                   ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS: HOW THEY RATE  --------------------------------------------------------------------- A  Relevant tasks well performed, no important tasks left incomplete  --------------------------------------------------------------------- B  Generally satisfactory and complete, only minor omissions and/or    inadequacies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- C  Can be considered just satisfactory despite omissions and/or    inadequacies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- D  Parts are well attempted but must, as a whole, be considered just    as unsatisfactory because of omissions and/or inadequacies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- E  Not satisfactory, significant omissions or adequacies  --------------------------------------------------------------------- F  Very unsatisfactory, important task(s) poorly done or not attempted  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Institute of Environmental Assessment  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

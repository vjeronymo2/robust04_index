			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAVING OVER THE CIVIL WAR  </P> <P> One after another, the Civil War battles that determined America's future are  being refought, with money and political influence instead of muskets and  cannon. As Washington, Richmond and other cities in the theater of that war  sprawl outward, development pressure is intense. Multimillions are at stake. So  is the heart of American history.  </P> <P> Last week, up the road at Manassas, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan announced a  federal program to resist commercial intrusion on these battlefields. Earlier,  Congress stepped in to buy threatened land there for more than $100 million. As  Lujan said, that is "the worst way to do it . . . We don't have enough money  just to go off and buy all these sites."  </P> <P> He named 25 Civil War battlefields where the National Park Service wants to  help stave off development. Among them is this one, Brandy Station, not a clash  on the scale of Manassas but a tactical turning point in the war because here  the Federal cavalry finally fought a large-scale stand-up battle against the  vaunted Jeb Stuart and got away with its pride intact.  </P> <P> The owner of more than 5,000 acres of the battlefield site has applied to build  an industrial park and housing complex. If local officials approve the  development, there is no way the government can buy the whole battle site as a  national shrine.  </P> <P> Lujan's idea is to spread around a mere $15 million as seed money to encourage  private preservation efforts. He cites the Richard K. Mellon Foundation's  donation of 10 important parcels to the park service through the Conservation  Fund as an example of what he hopes will follow.  </P> <P> But at least one park service historian bemoans "the visionary notion that  partnership can cure all the ills of the modern world." Considering the stakes,  the most an ambitious developer is likely to volunteer in the way of  battlefield preservation is a plaque noting that so many thousand Americans  died in a battle fought beneath the pavement of his latest shopping center.  </P> <P> Lujan wants to encourage zoning, easements, land-banking and historic  designations. He would help publicize threatened projects. His department will  start a national Civil War commission as a clearing house, which would support  state commissions and battlefield studies.  </P> <P> Only an ingrate would see this as a low-cost public relations gesture, empty of  substantive meaning in the big-money world of zoning and development.  </P></p>

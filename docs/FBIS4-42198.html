			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, May 27 (AFP) -- Bosnian refugees might soon  start to return home, but this is unlikely to herald a mass  influx of the estimated two million Bosnians displaced by war, a  UN refugee spokesman said Friday [27 May].    "The Bosnian Government is pushing very hard for the return  of refugees but it's a question of legal conditions and of  security conditions in the region," said Peter Schatzer of the  International Organization for Migrations, a UN agency, at a  press conference.    He said refugee officials wanted to map "safe" regions to  ensure that repatriated Bosnians were not caught in fighting or  threatened with reprisal attacks.    But Schatzer said certain specific groups, such as highly  qualified professionals who could help with the reconstruction  of Sarajevo, might be returned soon.    Another group could include some 1,000 Bosnian children who  were sent to Libya to flee the fighting, but whose parents want  them home. Schatzer mentioned no specific dates.    "We do not yet see the possibility for a massive return of a  large number of the maybe two million refugees" who fled Bosnia  during the two years of warfare, the spokesman said.    He said that issue would be tackled at a new meeting between  UN representatives and the Sarajevo government here in June.</p>

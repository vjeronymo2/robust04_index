			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonid Mlechin: "Kim Il-song Dreams of Getting </F> Along With the Americans: And They Are Squeamishly Turning Their  Backs on the Old Dictator"]    [Text] The Korean crisis has been engendered by the  West's incapacity for understanding what is going on in the  minds of the communist leaders.    The Korean nuclear crisis could be terminated in two  instances: if Kim Il-song departs this life or if the United  States conceives a desire to come to terms with Pyongyang.  <H5>  What Is Driving the Great Leader? </H5>   Being a dictator is good for the health. The great leader  Kim  Il-song was 82 on 15 April, and he is sound in body and mind. He  has kept politicians guessing for almost a year: Does Kim have a  nuclear bomb or not?    Meanwhile, the armies of both Koreas have been put on alert.  A battalion of American Patriot air defense missiles, which from  the experience of the war with Iraq in the Persian Gulf are  considered the most dependable means of combating Scud ballistic  missiles, is being transferred to the south of the peninsula. A  Patriot battalion means approximately 200 missiles and 850  service personnel. The missiles will be deployed so as to ensure  cover for military airfields and ports, at which American ships  with reinforcements would call, in the event of an attack from  the North.    The appearance of the Patriot missiles is being perceived in  Pyongyang as preparation for aggression. North Korea has  declared that if it is threatened, war will begin.    The West is captive to false alternatives and is deciding  what is more dangerous: permitting North Korea to create its own  nuclear weapons or organizing a second Korean war.    Everyone is asking: What is driving Kim Il-song? To what end  is Pyongyang making the whole world, virtually, its enemy? What  does Pyongyang need an atomic bomb for?    Do the North Korean leaders believe that it is possible,  finally, with the aid of a bomb to complete the great cause of  the country's unification?    Or are the Pyongyang leaders driven by fear? And they need  the bomb as a guarantor for their own survival in a world in  which there are virtually no islets of real socialism left?  <H5>  Blackmail </H5>   Meanwhile, Kim Il-song's aim is obvious. He is blackmailing  South Korea and in actual fact appealing to the United States.  He needs full diplomatic recognition and, possibly, some  material assistance. He wants to leave his son and heir, Kim  Chong-il, a stable country in more or less favorable  international surroundings. But Kim Il-song is not in a position  to say plainly what he wants.    He retains the hope that Washington will succumb to  blackmail, and for this reason everything moves in a closed  circle.    The DPRK declared that it would withdraw from the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty, then stayed put, all the same, and is  now once again threatening to pull out. IAEA inspectors were  asked to leave the DPRK, then they were admitted, kicked out  once again, and again invited back. The United States agreed to  negotiations with the DPRK, then refused, agreed once again, and  once again refused.    The United States, by all accounts, does not wish to soil  its  hands and conclude some agreements with Kim Il-song. North Korea  is of no key significance for world or even regional policy, and  Washington has decided, it has to be assumed, that it can  perfectly well wait for the great leader to depart this world  and for some changes in the country to begin.    The United States is setting prior conditions for Pyongyang:  an exchange of envoys between North and South and agreement to  the inspection of the nuclear facilities. When Pyongyang  declined an exchange of envoys, the anticipated Geneva  negotiations between representatives of the United States and  the DPRK were canceled.  <H5>  Is There a Bomb? </H5>   All this notwithstanding, Kim Il-song is undoubtedly  dreaming  of his own nuclear bomb. In what way is he worse than Stalin or  Mao, who saw the possession of nuclear weapons as the basis of  their power and influence?    American specialists maintain that the DPRK already has one  or two nuclear weapons. But there is no proof of this claim.  China's composed attitude toward the situation on the Korean  Peninsula is explained, possibly, by the fact that Beijing's  leaders, who are better informed as to Pyongyang affairs than  anyone, know that Kim Il-song has no bomb.    Pyongyang is refusing to admit experts of the IAEA to the  radiochemical laboratory that, it is believed, is engaged in the  enrichment of plutonium. This is giving rise to suspicions, but  this is only indirect evidence. We know of the mania for secrecy  characteristic of all socialist regimes. In addition, if it is  ascertained that there is no bomb, Kim Il-song would be left  looking like a fool. He would like to avoid this unpleasant  affirmation.    It is hard to imagine that North Korea, where intellectual  potential has been destroyed for decades, is capable of  providing itself with nuclear weapons. Had a nuclear explosive  device been created, Kim Il-song would be in a hurry to test it  to convince himself of the success. And all nuclear tests are  easily recorded.  <H5>  Jealousy </H5>   South Korea, which is jealously keeping an eye on the  Pyongyang-Washington contacts, is not behaving all that  prudently. Seoul does not want the North Koreans to come to an  agreement with the Americans behind South Korea's back.    Amazingly, even the South Koreans harbor some illusions in  respect to the Kim Il-song regime. Seoul completely  misunderstands the mentality of socialist leaders. For example,  Seoul is talking about an internal power struggle in Pyongyang  and seriously expects that on 15 April, Kim Il-song's birthday,  the DPRK will announce the start of economic reforms per the  Chinese model.    Seoul is sincerely calling on Pyongyang to open up to the  world in accordance with China's example. This, the southerners  are urging on the northerners, could help them obtain the  recognition of the United States and Japan and attract foreign  capital investments....    Some Americans believe that the DPRK needs to be threatened  a  little and that it needs to be shown that the United States is  not afraid of war and will not succumb to blackmail. Any other  behavior will merely encourage Pyongyang, creating among Kim  Il-song and his entourage a false sense of success in the  struggle against world imperialism.    The Americans like to recall that in 1950 the young Kim  Il-song made up his mind to strike at the South after Dean  Acheson, secretary of state of the United States at that time,  had in a speech delivered on 12 January at the National Press  Club withdrawn the Korean Peninsula from the territory protected  by the United States. It was decided in the North that  Washington would not intervene in a Korean war and would not  come to the South's assistance. As a result the United States  had to fight for three years to restore the lost territory to  the South.  <H5>  Seoul in Tank Pincers </H5>   Memories of that war are still alive in Washington, and the  American military is now discussing the possible course of a new  war.    Two-thirds of the 1 million-strong North Korean Army are  concentrated along the 100-km demilitarized zone separating  North and South. The North's long-range artillery could shell  Seoul. Lt. Gen. James Clapper, chief of the Pentagon's  intelligence agency, gave the combat readiness of the Korean  People's Army high marks, saying that it would attack the South  before the latter was ready to repulse it.    The American military believes that Generalissimo Kim  Il-song, promising to turn South Korea into a "sea of fire,"  intends to repeat the 1950 experience--throwing the  American-South Korean forces into the sea before reinforcements  can arrive in time from the United States.    Mobile units of the Korean People's Army, military  specialists forecast, would attempt with a swift push to break  through the South's defenses and capture Seoul and the ports in  order to prevent the approach of reinforcements. The forward  units of Kim Il-song's army are composed of an armored strike  force of 3,500 tanks, 4,000 infantry fighting vehicles, 8,000  self-propelled artillery pieces, and 2,500 missile launchers  (Katyusha-type).    An attack would be preceded by artillery preparation, the  purpose of which would be destruction of the South's defensive  infrastructure. Aviation would strike at airfields, munitions  dumps, and barracks. Having broken through the fortifications  and having made use of the tunnels, which, it is believed, Kim  Il-song's people are digging continuously beneath the  demilitarized zone, North Korean tanks and motorized infantry  would rush deep into the country. Phase two of the operation  would be the encirclement of Seoul and the capture of the rest  of the peninsula.  <H5>  What Is Pyongyang Thinking? </H5>   The success of the Korean People's Army could, however, be  hampered by the low operational skills of the officers, who  devote too much time to study of the ideas of chuche, and a  shortage of fuel.    But all this is speculation. No one has any real information  about the situation in the North Korean Army or knows the extent  of its combat capability, mobility, and provision with  ammunition and fuel.... And no one is giving any thought to the  effect this debate is having on the North Koreans, who believe  that they have for half a century been living in a besieged  fortress.    The prolonged escalation of mutual military preparations  could perfectly well lead politicians on both sides of the  demilitarized zone, which has separated North and South since  the times of the Korean War, to break under the strain and to  decide to strike first.    The South Koreans are already demonstrating to the world  that  their patience is exhausted.    "We have no intention of debating indefinitely," Song  Yong-de, head of the South Korean delegation at the negotiations  with the North, declared. "I would not even want to say what  will happen if the nuclear question is not properly resolved."    Yet it is not hard to guess the feelings with which  Pyongyang  read the reports to the effect that more than 2,000 radical  South Korean students organized a demonstration in the center of  Seoul against the deployment of the American Patriot missiles.  What dreams are evoked by the antiwar demonstrations in South  Korea among Kim Il-song's elderly associates, the majority of  whom have never been abroad and who derive all their information  from secret reports of the Ministry of Public Security? Does it  not seem to members of the Politburo that the long-anticipated  uprising in the South, which should be supported by a rapid  armored strike, has, finally, begun?</p>

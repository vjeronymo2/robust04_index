			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Survey of Relocation in The UK (2): How financial packages ease the burden - Moving home MOVING managers can be an expensive business. It is estimated that more than Pounds 4bn is now tied up in bridging finance alone on 35,000 unsold houses throughout the UK. But companies are also becoming aware of the affect such delays in selling a home can have on the performance of staff once they have moved, particularly if they are having to meet the interest on bridging finance. The type of relocation package on offer varies greatly. Of the 120,000 moves sponsored each year by companies, 50,000 are fully sponsored, including bridging finance, while the remaining 70,000 are unbridged, with other kinds of corporate assistance. But with the cost of bridging on a Pounds 100,000 home over 8 1/2 months with interest rates at 12.1 per cent adding up to Pounds 8,600, the proportion of fully sponsored moves is falling. Increasingly, companies are now providing relocatees with more financial aid towards the direct costs of moving home, such as legal fees, temporary accommodation and removal expenses. That assistance ranges from five to 50 per cent of salary. It is being extended by companies to groups which previously did not qualify, such as junior managers, technicians and graduate recruits, just to attract and retain key staff. The CBI estimates that the average cost per employee-move, even without bridging finance, is Pounds 13,000. It has been estimated that the cost to a company of fully subsidising a move could be as high as Pounds 30,000 if bridging interest, loss of value and other costs such as maintenance repair and insurance payments are taken into account. On 20 properties with an average value of Pounds 150,000, the annual cost would be Pounds 500,000. In rehousing staff, Nationwide Relocation claims that by using an agency, savings of up to a third can be made, compared with companies which attempt their own housing relocation, (see page 8: motives for moving). Given the difficulties and expense of managing moves, particularly in the present property market, some companies are choosing to use the services of relocation specialists. Britannic Assurance dealt with relocation in-house until 1989. It provided relocating employees with interest-free bridging finance, freeing them from the need to synchronise sale and purchase, but leaving all marketing and selling of properties to employees to arrange. Empty houses, vacated but unsold, incurred mounting costs. Employees were unable to oversee the selling of their old home and the company was unable to control the marketing of the property in a volatile property market. Britannic consulted the CBI's employee relocation council, and enlisted the services of two specialists relocation bureaux. A relocation scheme was introduced for all staff from assistant managers upwards. Empty homes - 'orphans' - which had been receiving bridging finance for 12 months, were reviewed at the end of that period and considered for inclusion in the scheme. 'The management and disposal of orphan cases was a major factor in our decision to use specialist assistance,' says Glenn Hanson, Britannic's assistant agency manager. 'There was the obvious cost of bridging finance, but there was also the issue of control. Before deciding to use a bureau we had limited control; now we have total control.' After a 12-month trial between two relocation specialists, Britannic appointed PHH Homequity as sole provider. 'Establishing a good working relationship with the bureau was particularly important, as the scheme meant changes in an area which had traditionally been managed in-house. An additional critical factor was PHH's willingness to provide a relocation package tailored to our needs. There has been a significant reduction in the number of relocation homes on our books, saving substantially on the costs of bridging finance.' A relocatee's house is assessed by at least two, often three, independent professional valuers contracted to PHH, and a guaranteed offer made to the relocatee. This offer is the total bridging loan advance guaranteed by the employer to the employee to enable him to purchase a new home, based on what the property is realistically expected to fetch in the prevailing market conditions. If the relocatee rejects the guaranteed offer, the company will not provide bridging finance. The guaranteed offer is effectively a minimum selling price while the employee may actually achieve more. PHH group companies manage 40,000 transactions worldwide each year. Of the 10,000 units currently managed by PHH in the UK, 4,000 are relocations, and 80 per cent of those are individual career moves, rather than wholesale relocations. However, it is also tendering for three government department moves. 'A house might fetch Pounds 105,000 if you hold out for seven months, but in the meantime, it might require Pounds 2,000 of maintenance and incur seven months' bridging interest. Or, it might sell for Pounds 98,000 in one month and require Pounds 100 of maintenance. 'That is what we are managing, using our experience, local market information, computer-modelling based on thousands and thousands of cases. 'If we find something in the valuation report which would make the house unsaleable, then we advise the company not to purchase. We are risk managers.' 'We were rather surprised at the number of houses which needed work done on them before they could be marketed,' says Glenn Hanson. Early disclosure of such problems has meant that the cost of remedial work can be reflected in the guaranteed offer, or that the employee is asked to complete the work before the offer is made. PHH, which manages both bridged and unbridged home-sales, claims to achieve prices in the range of 95 per cent and 105 per cent of open market value. To ensure it is using the most reliable valuers, PHH compares valuations with the eventual sale price - 'if the relocatee's home is valued at Pounds 100,000 and he is convinced its worth Pounds 20,000 more, then he might not join the relocation scheme. With accurate valuations, the maximum number of employees are likely to move,' says Mr Buckthorpe. Through its network of independent search agents, PHH establishes the requirements of the relocatee and his family for a new home, and these agents then liaise with estate agents to find a suitable property. 'We can now move the employee quickly into his new area with minimum disruption to him and his family, and he doesn't even have to worry about his own home,' says Mr Hanson.</p>

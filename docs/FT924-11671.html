			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Skiing: Whipping up a desert storm IF YOU HAVE had enough of Tyrolean thigh-slapping and yet another fondue, why not book a flight to Morocco? Seriously. The Moroccan High Atlas have several metres of snow each winter - while the Alps bite their fingernails and pray, the Moroccans are pulling out the snowplows. Even in the steaming Marrakesh summer, Toubkal, the 4,200 metre prince of the Atlas, remains brilliant white above the fig tree orchards. The Atlas cry out to be skied but they do not make it easy: this is ski-mountaineering country. You do not come to Morocco to carve easy Giant Slalom turns on well-tended pistes; the Atlas make you earn your skiing. To get limbered up for the great adventure there is a one chair-lift resort at Oukaimeden, 40 km from Marrakesh. Chic Casablanca folk ski here - and surprisingly elegantly too. French skiers have come to Morocco for years, not for Oukaimeden, but for the virgin slopes beyond the pistes. An alternative Haute Route has been pioneered through the High Atlas with the help of the local Berber people, who have become used to seeing their mules laden with skis. The mule is at the heart of Moroccan skiing, and the fleabitten animals plod right up on to the snowfields. 'Snow is fine to look at,' says one Berber shepherd, 'but it's murder to shovel. I can't understand why you spend all this money on skiing - is it really that good?' The Berber has a point: your skis cost more than his house. Twenty kilometres south of Oukaimeden and 1,000 metres higher, the mules hit the snowfields and the real slog begins. You have to haul yourself up the mountain. At first it is hellish. Skins are strapped to your skis, which give grip. Where the mountain pitches into ice walls you have to resort to rope and crampons. You reach the ridge swearing and sweating. It is all downhill from then on. Arabic coffee is brought out, the skins are packed away and the Moroccan guide points down a 1,500 metre flank of virgin snow. Life begins to look up. You take a first turn, then another. You are skiing a fall-line nobody has skied before. Solitude and serenity hits you between the eyes: to the west is a tapestry of green fields and beyond, floating up in castellated amber glory, is imperial Marrakesh. To the south and east is the Sahara, golden, never ending. After a day's mountaineering and skiing a Moroccan mountain hut seems like the Savoy. The guide lights a juniper log fire, a lamb casserole is wolfed down and a Moorish blizzard whips up outside. After five days of this cycle, morning climbs and afternoon skiing and nights around log fires learning Arabic stories, you drop down into forests of helm-oak where black bear and lynx live. It is world-class tree skiing. And the best of it is that there is no rubbish strewn over the mountain, no dictatorial ski patrols, nothing but empty beauty. You meet up with the mules again at the head of the Ouki gorge. It is souk day in the village of Asni. Berber children tug at your skis; their fathers invite you to eat with them. lambs. After dinner you sleep like a baby on a narrow pine cot. The next day you take a Mercedes taxi back to Marrakesh. You can now play golf on the Royal Marrakesh course without guilt, and ponder the jeweled skiing heaven of the Atlas. Factfile: Fly direct to Marrakesh on Royal Air Maroc, daily service (from London, Paris, Madrid). Accommodation in Marrakesh is at the luxurious Hotel de 1a Moumania. In the mountain villages stay with Berber families. Whilst skiing stay in the mountain huts of the Royal Moroccan Mountaineering Club. Cost of mule and guide for five days, about Pounds 100 a head.

			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THIS FAMILY HAS ENDURED;  </P> <P> DESPITE LOSS OF BUSINESS, JOB, KIDNEY DISEASE, SON'S ILLNESS, THE MACIASES  STILL HAVE FAITH  </P> <P> In September, when her husband learned that he would probably lose his job as a  VCR repairman, Kathy Macias thought that her family's incredible string of bad  luck had run its course.  </P> <P> "I thought nothing else can happen to us this year, because everything bad had  already happened," she said.  </P> <P> Kathy, her husband, Juan, and the couple's six young children were looking  forward to 1991. The new year, they hoped, was sure to bring them better times.  </P> <P> But 1990 was not through with the Macias family.  </P> <P> Just when the family learned about the impending layoff, just when Kathy Macias  thought that nothing else could go wrong for her family, doctors told Juan that  he was suffering from a potentially fatal kidney disease, focal  glomerulosclerosis, that also afflicts his brother.  </P> <P> His employer "told me that I was probably going to lose my job. Then the doctor  told me that, if I hadn't come in when I did, the disease would have probably  killed me in six weeks," said Juan.  </P> <P> The disease struck Juan's older brother, Henry, eight years ago. The brothers  both fell victim to the mysterious illness when they were 32 years old.  </P> <P> Although they both suffered from kidney failure at the same age, Juan said  doctors are not sure if the disease is hereditary or what its cause is. But  doctors suspect the disease is inherited from a faulty gene passed on to them  by their mother.  </P> <P> Juan's illness confirmed their worst fears, said Kathy. He had been having up  to 30 cramps daily, for several weeks, and complained of chronic fatigue.  </P> <P> "When he went to the hospital for tests, I prayed to God that it wasn't kidney  disease," said Kathy.  </P> <P> The news was especially devastating for Juan because he has only one  functioning kidney. Two years ago, he donated his right kidney to Henry, who  lost both kidneys to the disease.  </P> <P> Despite his predicament, Juan finds humor in his situation.  </P> <P> "I'm in a very exclusive category," he said. "It's really rare for someone to  donate a kidney and then have a kidney transplant. I'm one of a small number of  people who can say he's been at both ends. It's an easier operation for the  recipient."  </P> <P> Juan's illness was only the latest blow to befall the Macias family this year.  </P> <P> Earlier, the couple lost their video business and were left with a debt that  will probably take 20 years to pay. In addition, 4-year-old Brian, who suffers  from spina bifida and is paralyzed from the chest down, required hip surgery  this year and was in a body cast for four months. The youngster has a twin  brother, Paul, who is perfectly healthy.  </P> <P> And, recently, the family's van required some expensive repairs.  </P> <P> "This had already been a tough year for us," said Kathy. "It seems like  everything has happened to us in 1990."  </P> <P> Others might say that her family is facing a bleak Christmas. But Kathy thinks  otherwise.  </P> <P> "This is probably going to be our best Christmas ever," she said. "True, things  are awfully tough for us. But a lot of people who have heard about our  situation have been so kind to us. Our Christmas tree was donated to us. The  staff at Children's Hospital has helped us out with gifts for the kids. A  teacher helped us out with Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner. Everywhere we  turned, somebody was helping us. I consider ourselves very fortunate."  </P> <P> Kathy Macias, 32, seemingly unflappable, juggles Brian's thrice-weekly therapy  sessions at Children's Hospital and Juan's dialysis treatments, also three  times a week. Each treatment takes three hours.  </P> <P> Their 10-year marriage has been solidified by the crises they have faced, the  couple said. They met at the old Doctors Hospital, where Kathy worked as a  nurse's aide. Juan, who was a baseball standout in high school and college, had  gone to the hospital for an operation on his throwing arm. He said the  California Angels were going to draft him, until they found out about his  injury.  </P> <P> Kathy conceded that the strength she found to face the challenges confronting  her family was not always there. A combination of her Catholic faith and family  support has led her through every crisis, she said.  </P> <P> Money remains a problem. The family is living on Juan's disability payments  from the state, but most of that is eaten up by the $334 health insurance  payments they have to make every month. They were forced to give up their Mira  Mesa apartment and move in with Juan's parents in Clairemont, where Juan, his  brother and two sisters were raised.  </P> <P> "When all of this crashed down on us, I couldn't get a grip. I was feeling  depressed, because everything was caving in on us," said Kathy. "I don't know  the reason for all this. We're part of a bigger and grander plan. Everything is  wrapped around God's purpose."  </P> <P> By contrast, Juan never lost his optimism. At the beginning of his illness,  Juan's outlook clashed with Kathy's depression.  </P> <P> "We had a few arguments about this," Juan said. "Money was tight. We have six  children who still depend very much on us. I've always been a very positive  person. I kept telling Kathy things would work out."  </P> <P> Fortunately for the young couple, the Macias family pulls together in time of  crisis. Juan's parents, brother and sisters are very close. His parents  mortgaged their home to help Juan and Kathy start up the video business that  failed.  </P> <P> When the kidney that Juan donated to Henry failed, a younger sister, Maria,  promptly donated her kidney to Henry.  </P> <P> "Henry is walking around with three kidneys, and only one is functioning,"  laughed Juan.  </P> <P> When Juan fell victim to the disease, an older sister, Linda Sturtevant,  offered him one of her kidneys. In a telephone interview from her Moreno Valley  home, Sturtevant said she has already passed the first battery of tests for a  donor.  </P> <P> "I've never given it a second thought. Doubt never crossed my mind. If I can  help my brother, I will," said Sturtevant. "I have a great deal of faith. I  pray every night for guidance and strength."  </P> <P> Henry Macias, an electrical engineer for Bonneville Power in Wennatchee, Wash.,  expressed admiration for his brother.  </P> <P> "My brother has fought an uphill battle. When I became ill, he stepped forward  without hesitation," said Henry. "When you come close to your losing your life,  you learn to appreciate life more. My brother gave me a second chance at life,  and I got a third chance from my sister."  </P> <P> If Sturtevant goes through with the operation, every one of Juan's siblings  will be left with one functioning kidney. Donors and recipients have become so  commonplace in the Macias family, that the procedure has led to a family  tradition.  </P> <P> "This is a family thing," Kathy said. "If you donate a kidney, you get taken  out for a dinner of steak and lobster. It's not a bad deal, a kidney for steak  and lobster."  </P></p>

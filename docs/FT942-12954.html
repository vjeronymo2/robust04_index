			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / UK Company News: PosTel Pounds 39m portfolio sale to TR Property PosTel, the UK's largest pension fund, is to sell Pounds 39m of properties to TR Property Investment Trust in a transaction which will almost double the size of the fund and leave PosTel as a 21 per cent shareholder in the trust. TR is buying a portfolio of 10 properties with a rental income of Pounds 3.14m. The deal will be satisfied through the issue to PosTel of 39m conversion shares, which will be converted into ordinaries by November 15. In addition, TR is raising Pounds 60m from the placement of 61m C shares, 21m of which are subject to clawback for an offer to existing shareholders and to the public. The placing and offer will raise Pounds 100m before expenses, compared with the fund's market capitalisation of some Pounds 112m. The properties were held by PosTel Properties, a property fund jointly owned by the Post Office and British Telecom pension funds. The company has been gradually selling this Pounds 1bn property portfolio. It sold Pounds 143m of properties to Hammerson last month and other properties are up for sale. Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, chief executive of PosTel Investment Management, said that 'it is a question of greater flexibility, for as and when we want to become net sellers of property'. Mr Ross Goobey will join the TR board. TR has existed in its current form since 1982 and has focused on investments primarily in smaller listed and unlisted property companies. One of its early forays into unlisted investment was its stake in the consortium that won the contract to develop County Hall. The consortium went into receivership with losses of about Pounds 50m after facing problems with planning permission from Lambeth Council. TR lost Pounds 10m and has since shied away from passive stakes in large property schemes. Mr Peter Duffy, director and manager of TR, said the latest deal 'gives us the capacity to increase our property content at a time when we think direct property is more attractive than property shares'. He said TR might swap the properties for property shares in another company at a later stage. It will have 31 per cent of its gross assets invested in properties; some 46 per cent of the latest portfolio is industrial, 42 per cent office, and 12 per cent retail. Also proposed is a 1-for-5 scrip issue of warrants, which will apply to the new owners of C shares.</p>

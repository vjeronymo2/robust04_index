			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Interest rates in French franc money market fall sharply Interest rates in the French franc money market fell sharply yesterday amid growing speculation that the Bank of France may cut the country's official interest rates this week, writes James Blitz. One-month French franc interest rates fell more than a full percentage point from 11.20 per cent to 10.18 per cent. Three-month interest rates also fell by a similar amount from 11.00 per cent to below 10 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENS;  </P> <P> MISSION POSSIBLE;  </P> <P> OUT OF A BACK YARD OF SOLID ROCK, A HOMEOWNER FASHIONS AN OLD-TIME CALIFORNIA  GARDEN  </P> <P> THE SITE WAS promising, but the soil was not. Still, antiques dealer Richard  Mouck had found the house he wanted. Craftsman in feel, if not in fact, it was  perched on top of Goat Hill in Eagle Rock with a sweeping view and surrounded  by several hundred feet of priceless arroyo boulder walls. But why had the  previous owners not planted a thing? Why was most of the back yard barely  covered with dry, weedy grasses?  </P> <P> The answers lay just below the surface -- solid rock. According to neighbors,  the few trees and shrubs on the property were planted in holes dynamited in the  1920s by the original owner, a Los Angeles fireman who also built the stone  walls, hauling the rocks up from the Los Angeles River in his old truck.  Undaunted by his discovery in 1978, Mouck was determined to build his dream  garden here, one inspired by the stone walls and turn-of-the-century post cards  depicting California mission gardens.  </P> <P> The post cards were part of a phenomenal interest in the California mission  era, which spawned an architectural style featuring arches and low-pitched tile  roofs; heavy, dark furniture, and gardens with a distinctly Spanish ambience.  The results of the Mission Revival period, which began in the late 1890s and  lasted well into the 1920s, were not exact copies of the missions or their  gardens but romanticized versions, because true mission gardens, being designed  for Franciscan fathers, had few creature comforts.  </P> <P> During that period many missions were restored, and mission-inspired buildings  sprouted everywhere, including Mouck's favorite, the massive Mission Inn in  Riverside. Californians traveled up and down the state in their new  automobiles, visiting the missions and purchasing post cards, many of which  pictured idealized gardens full of plants that were considered quite novel and  exotic at that time -- palms, olives, bird-of-paradise, hibiscus, cactus and  succulents. A few of these plants existed in actual mission gardens, but most  were more recent arrivals; Californians were just discovering what they could  grow in this mild climate.  </P> <P> From hundreds of these post cards, Mouck picked his favorite views and began  planning his garden in 1982. A bell tower dominates nearly every post-card  view, so in a great flight of fancy, Mouck built one to anchor his garden. Made  of 2x4 framing covered with rough stucco, it is attached to the house, though  it is visible only from the garden. Below the tower is a small tiled patio,  another post-card feature, and a small archway that leads to the garden.  Mouck's extensive bell collection celebrates the entry: Bells are hung from the  branches of an old tree-sized hibiscus.  </P> <P> The garden is laid out in a cruciform pattern, with a Spanish-style fountain at  the intersection of two paths. In some places, the paths are solid rock,  natural outcroppings, and bordered by low stone walls that hold imported sandy  soil, about 9 inches deep. All of the plants are drought-resistant because they  must survive in shallow soil. (The garden won the Los Angeles Department of  Water and Power Water Conservation Garden Contest in 1988.) Each of the four  main beds is planted with a different color of lantana, which were salvaged  from the Valley Drive-In Theater. Even the fountain is part salvage -- the base  is an old industrial washbasin covered with river rock, with an imported  Mexican fountain perched on top.  </P> <P> Around the fountain are pots filled with cactus, and oleanders and crape  myrtles make a screen at the edge of the garden. Other plants, though no longer  novel, would have thrilled California tourists in the early 1900s: spiny aloes  and agaves, neon-bright bougainvilleas, cascading plumbago, rosemary, yuccas  and, of course, palms -- seen in nearly every early California post card.  </P></p>

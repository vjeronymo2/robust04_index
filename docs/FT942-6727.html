			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / International Company News: Competition blamed for 56% decline at NTT Increased price competition hurt profits at Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the Japanese telecommunications company, as three new companies entered the long-distance telephone market. The company posted a 56 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax earnings for the year ended March to Y109.5bn (Dollars 1.04bn) on a 1.4 per cent fall in sales to Y5,809.1bn. Operating profits fell 41.2 per cent to Y230.2bn and after-tax profits plunged 74.5 per cent to Y41.4bn. NTT said revenues had fallen due to an average 21 per cent cut in long-distance telephone call rates implemented last October to compete with its three rivals - DDI, Japan Telecom, and Teleway Japan. The dominance of NTT, a former state-owned company, has been eroded by the cheap rates offered by the competitors. Non-operational costs, including interest payments, fell 7.2 per cent due to interest rates, while personnel costs declined due to the company's restructuring programme. On a consolidated level, the company also posted sluggish results. Pre-tax profits fell 47.3 per cent to Y139.9bn on a 2.3 per cent rise in sales to Y6,652.4bn. After-tax profits declined 70.2 per cent to Y49.9bn. For the current year, NTT expects pre-tax profits to decline by a further 5 per cent to Y104bn on a 0.4 per cent dip in sales to Y5,784bn. On a consolidated basis, the company forecasts flat pre-tax earnings growth at Y140bn on a 1.4 per cent rise in sales to Y6,747bn.</p>

			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Football clubs to confer over tax probe The Football Association's Premier League has called a meeting of leading clubs to help co-ordinate their response to a tax investigation by the Inland Revenue's Special Office - the arm of the Revenue that carries out special probes. The agenda for the meeting, to be held in London on August 9, includes discussions of loans to players, payments to agents, testimonial matches for players and relocation expenses. In a letter to the clubs Mr Rick Parry, the Premier League's chief executive, recommends that they do not grant the Revenue full access to records and players' files. He says: 'You should be aware that the working party advisers are unanimous in the view that it is preferable to undertake your own review, rather than allow Special Office unrestricted access.' The FA recently fined Tottenham Hotspur, the London Premier League club, Pounds 1.5m, deducted six league points for next season and banned it from the season's FA Cup competition after deciding that it had contravened FA rules by making interest-free loans to players between 1985 and 1989. Tottenham says it has settled with the Revenue and will not be at the meeting. However, the Premier League's efforts on behalf of clubs being investigated is said to have 'hardened the resolve' of Mr Alan Sugar, Tottenham chairman, to fight the penalty, possibly with legal action. One football insider said: 'It's amazing that the FA hands down such a stiff fine for things that went on before Sugar took over at Spurs and then we see the Premier League arranging a meeting to help other clubs facing a Revenue investigation.'</p>

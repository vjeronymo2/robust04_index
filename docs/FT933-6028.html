			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Swiss Re joins US bank in venture SWISS Reinsurance, the world's second largest reinsurance group, is following the growing trend of creating companies which specialise in natural catastrophe insurance. The group has joined John Head &amp; Partners, a New York merchant bank specialised in the insurance field, to form Partner Reinsurance. Swiss Re will put Dollars 100m into the venture, which will be based in Bermuda, John Head Dollars 25m, and other founder institutional investors Dollars 130m. Partner Reinsurance then plans to raise Dollars 500m from the US, European and Japanese equity markets in an initial public offering as early as October. The move follows a series of similar ventures created by leading reinsurers in recent months. The idea is to respond the soaring demand for natural catastrophe insurance following the sharp increase in damage caused by earthquakes and hurricanes around the world in recent years. Paradoxically, while soaring insurance claims have hurt all reinsurers in the short term, they have also led to a fundamental improvement in trading conditions by shaking out weaker competitors. As a result, the US capital market has become more enthusiastic about insurance securities, making it possible for ventures like the new Partner Re to raise equity. Swiss Re said the new venture would differ from its rivals in that it would concentrate more on markets outside of the US. 'Our wide experience in other parts of the world will be of great value,' Mr Walter Kielholz, a Swiss Re director said. Partner also differed from others in that Swiss Re would not control it. Its stake, initially 13 per cent, would not exceed 20 per cent. Swiss Re said it deliberately sought to maximise outside capital. 'Our aim is to generate as much new capacity as possible,' Mr Kielholz said. Also, Swiss Re itself did not want to raise its exposure to the natural catastrophe market. The public share issue, of 66 per cent of the initial share capital, is being arranged by Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley International.</p>

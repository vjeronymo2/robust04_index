			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Moldova forms stock exchange Former Soviet Moldova has set up its first stock exchange to trade shares in enterprises being privatised, said Mr Oleg Crasnogon, deputy finance minister, Reuter reports. The exchange, with a founding capital of Dollars 60,000 has been formed by commercial banks and investment trust companies. 'The market will shortly be full of shares in enterprises being privatised,' Mr Crasnogon said. Moldova plans to sell 30 per cent of state-owned property, or some 1,600 enterprises, by end-1994. Economists say the percentage may be closer to 40 - 45 per cent given sell-offs of state collective farms, which are being converted into joint stock companies.</p>

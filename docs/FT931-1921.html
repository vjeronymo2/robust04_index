			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: World equities Yesterday's weakness in US and European equities bore faint echoes of August 1991 when markets plunged following the coup against Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. Now as then there must be doubt whether events in a country with Russia's negligible share in world trade have real meaning for equity markets. Western governments may step up aid payments, but surely not enough to influence interest rates. Similarly their budgets are unlikely to come under pressure from higher defence spending when Russia's main danger is to itself. That leaves only vague worries about refugees and disrupted commodity supplies. Then again, there are some differences with 1991. The coup attempt came as a real surprise, forcing markets down sharply. Yesterday's equity falls were more restrained, while the dollar's limited rise suggests the foreign exchange market is less perturbed. The Russian crisis may have been more an excuse for equity market correction than its cause. P/e ratios on both sides of the Atlantic look stretched, while in some countries, like Germany, the recent run-up in prices has left equity yields unattractive next to bonds. If these are the real worries, equities may not recover as quickly as in 1991 - but neither probably will the situation in Moscow.</p>

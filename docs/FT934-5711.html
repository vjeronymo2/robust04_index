			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Fear of job loss ebbing, says poll Fears among British workers that they may lose their jobs in the next 12 months fell slightly in November, the latest MORI/IRS survey for the Financial Times suggests. Fear of redundancy and unemployment rose sharply in the previous month to 53 per cent of those in full-time or part-time work. This month the figure fell to 47 per cent. Anxiety is most prevalent among women, part-timers and the young. People in the Midlands appear the most vulnerable, with very little improvement in confidence compared with the north and south. Mr David Martin, editorial director of Industrial Relations Services (IRS), said the figures might have been influenced by the fall in the latest set of official unemployment figures. But he said: 'It must still be of concern that almost half of those interviewed fear for their jobs in the next 12 months.' The surveys, which started in April, also show big monthly fluctuations in the number of people who believe that the economy will improve.  -----------------------------------------------------------------                     What does the future hold?  -----------------------------------------------------------------                      Worried       Economy                      about         will                      redundancy    improve  ----------------------------------------------------------------- April                  41%           39% May                    43%           33% June                   44%           28% July                   51%           35% Aug                    47%           33% Sept                   43%           26% Oct                    53%           24% Nov                    47%           27%  ----------------------------------------------------------------- Source: MORI/IRS poll of 930 adults, November 18-22  -----------------------------------------------------------------</p>

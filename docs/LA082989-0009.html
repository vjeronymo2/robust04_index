			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROPOSITION 13 HAS MADE EVERYONE'S TAX REASONABLE  </P> <P> Proposition 13 has always had its critics. Lately, however, the criticism has  been more widespread. Even some policy analysts who generally favor limited  taxes and less spending have complained of an "inherent flaw" in Proposition  13.  </P> <P> Because Proposition 13 uses acquisition value (usually the purchase price) as a  basis of taxation, it is possible for owners of identical side-by-side  properties to have significantly different tax bills. In short, the system  generally favors those who have owned their property longer.  </P> <P> To understand why Proposition 13 is fair, one must understand how it works.  Proposition 13 curbs property taxes by restricting the maximum rate (1%) and,  more important, by limiting increases in assessed valuation (2% annually). With  the latter provision, it is easy to see how a home's current market value can  greatly exceed its taxable value over a span of just a few years.  </P> <P> The substantial difference between a property's actual value and its taxable  value disappears when the property changes hands. When this occurs, county  assessors reassess the property at full market value. Thus, recent purchasers  derive no immediate benefit from the limitation on annual increases in taxable  value.  </P> <P> So is Proposition 13 fair, even to recent home buyers? Yes. It treats equally  property owners who purchase property of similar value at the same time. Unlike  any other tax system in the country, it provides absolute certainty to  homeowners as to what their tax bills will be in all future years. It prevents  a homeowner's taxes from skyrocketing as a result of the vagaries of the real  estate market -- something over which they have no control. Instead, the amount  of property tax liability will depend almost exclusively on the voluntary act  of purchase.  </P> <P> Shortly after Proposition 13's adoption by the voters in 1978, the California  Supreme Court recognized its inherent fairness. Justice Frank K. Richardson,  speaking for a nearly unanimous court, concluded that "an acquisition value  system . . . may operate on a fairer basis than a current value approach."  </P> <P> The fairness of Proposition 13 also becomes apparent when one looks beyond the  concept that property taxes should always be based on current value.  Admittedly, Proposition 13 is unique. However, as a matter of law and policy,  there is nothing requiring property taxes to be confined to a system that  arguably has more inherent unfairness to it than does Proposition 13.  </P> <P> Once people discard their preconceived notions and view Proposition 13 in  isolation, they will be surprised at how much sense it makes. Think of  Proposition 13 as being a hybrid between a property tax and a sales tax. After  all, if sales taxes can be based on acquisition value, why can't property  taxes? Even Justice Richardson noted that Proposition 13 introduced a tax  system "roughly comparable" to a sales tax.  </P> <P> Critics might concede that Proposition 13 provides absolute tax certainty and  yet still assert that the system is flawed because owners of similar property  may be paying different tax amounts. The response to this is that it should be  no concern whatsoever to a new resident what his neighbor's tax is -- as long  as his or her own tax is reasonable. The absolute cap of 1% imposed by  Proposition 13 makes everyone's tax reasonable.  </P> <P> Critics also complain that owners of similar properties are paying different  amounts for the same public services. However, this is no more unfair than the  traditional method of taxation under which owners of more valuable property pay  more for the same services. This entire argument ignores the nature of taxes.  If we were that concerned with proportionality between the amount of tax and  the level of service, we would resort to a system of nothing but user fees.  Because proportionality between tax liability and services has never been an  attribute of property taxes, it is unfair to level this charge against  Proposition 13 alone.  </P> <P> Proposition 13 is certainly fair to existing property owners because it bases  tax liability on acquisition value, not on the mercurial real estate market. It  is fair to local governments because it allows for periodic reassessment of  property when it changes ownership (and under other circumstances as well). Few  people realize that total property tax revenues to local governments in  California have increased at a rate exceeding inflation and virtually all other  economic indicators.  </P> <P> Finally, Proposition 13 is fair to new property owners, because it gives them  two things they otherwise wold not have: the benefit of a reasonable maximum  property tax of 1% and the absolute certainty as to what their tax bills will  be in future years. In light of skyrocketing property values, this is not a  minor consideration.  </P> <P> On the charge of "unfairness," Proposition 13 must be judged "not guilty."  </P></p>

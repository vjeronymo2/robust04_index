			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ikuji Nakaya] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, May 2 KYODO -- With peace talks in progress  in the Middle East, once-reluctant Japanese businesses are  beginning to turn to Israel with its high technology and the  potential of Tel Aviv to become one of the financial centers of  the region.    Both on official and private-sector levels, Japan and Israel  started exchanging various delegations in late 1992.    The historic agreement reached by the Israeli Government and  the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) last September on  Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank city of Jericho and the  Gaza Strip accelerated Japanese interest in business with Israel.    On Wednesday in Cairo, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and  Israeli  Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin are scheduled to finalize the  agreement, inviting dozens of top diplomats including japanese  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa.    Akio Aoki, managing director of U.S.-based consultant TTT  Technology Trade Inc., says the so-called Arab Boycott, hitherto  believed to be the biggest hurdle in doing business with Israel,  has become in effect "nominal."    Aoki, who is head of TTT's Tokyo office, says Japanese firms  are increasingly showing interest in Israel's high tech,  especially in areas like medical equipment and biotechnology.    TTT has recently agreed on a business tie-up with Nippon  Investment and Finance Corp., an affiliate of Daiwa Securities  Co., to provide small and medium-sized Japanese firms with  information on business opportunities with Israel.    Kiyoshi Tsuji, president of electronic equipment trader  Kaytec Ltd. based in Tokyo, hopes to triple turnover this year.  The company mainly sells Israeli-made software linked with the  local area network (LAN) system to major Japanese System  Integrator (SI) concerns.    A Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry  official agrees with Aoki that the Arab boycott, under which  countries and companies could be subject to retaliation for  doing business with Israel, is losing its power, and trade  between Japan and Israel is actually increasing.    "It is true that the Japanese business industry is  interested  in Israel," says Kanji Hayashi, assistant director of the  Federation of Economic Organizations' (Keidanren) Asian affairs  department.    Keidanren sent a 14-member delegation to the Jewish state  last year, mainly composed of executives at major trading houses.    In addition to Israel's strong ties with the United States,  Hayashi says, the country can serve as a bridge to European  nations as well, while being one of the commercial centers of  the Middle East.    Auto manufacturers like Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (MMC) and  Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. have considerable experience in  exporting cars to Israel. Other manufacturers like Toyota and  Nissan recently followed suit.    An MMC spokesman said the company exports about 20,000 cars  per year and the vehicles are sold through local dealerships,  which the company considers will not be subject to the Arab  boycott since it is not a direct investment.    But, while showing interest in business with Israel, major  companies, at least superficially, still express caution over  taking risks in deals with Israel.    A spokesman for trading firm Mitsubishi Corp. bluntly said,  "the Arab boycott has never been canceled," while an Itochu  Corp. spokesman said the company is merely "in the stage of  collecting information."    A spokesman for NEC Corp., a major electronics maker,  acknowledged Israel's high technology but was skeptical about  launching major business relations with Israel.    In the financial sector, however, government sources said  two  to three brokerage companies, including one or more "Big Four"  securities firms, are planning to open representative offices in  Tel Aviv soon for the first time.    Daiwa Securities, an affiliate of Nippon Investment and  Finance, declined to comment on its strategy in Israel.    An official with the Japan Securities Dealers Association  says there is a good possibility that Israel will become a  financial hub in the future.    "We shouldn't be left behind then," he said, but the problem  is the scanty knowledge Japanese financial institutions have of  the Middle East, India and Pakistan. "All they think about is  New York and London," he said.    The official said the association is ready to designate the  Tel Aviv Stock Exchange as a preferred market for Japanese  investors any time, but so far there has been no request from  Japanese securities firms nor from foreign brokerage houses in  Tokyo.    Max Livnat, minister of economic affairs at the Embassy of  Israel in Tokyo, says the country is seeking to attract direct  investment from Japan in addition to trade of goods.    He says it will be great business if Japan can do  international marketing on products developed by Israeli  research and development, which is one of the areas that  Japanese firms are streamlining due to the economic slowdown.    "To my surprise, they are still cautious," he said, but he  believes it is "just a matter of time."    Livnat said he is expecting a major reconciliation between  Israel and the Arabs within this year and perhaps "faster than  people believe," suggesting Japanese firms should not lose time  by "being so cautious."</p>

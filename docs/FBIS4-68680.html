			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Afrikan Solovyev and Galina Pechilina: </F> "President of Chuvashia Does Not Get Into Conflict With the  Agrarian Lobby"]    [Text] After the federal center got over the fever of  drawing up economic programs at the beginning of 1990, the  Russian provinces fell ill with program-creating. Lately  KOMMERSANT experts have been predicting a sharp increase in the  activeness of local authorities in seeking various options for  getting out of the economic crisis. In this connection, the  question of the powers of local political elites will be raised  anew. This past weekend Chuvashia, where the local press  published the theses of a "Program of Popular Reform," made  itself known.    Interest in the program has to do with the identity of the  consultants who took part in drafting it. In addition to the  president's economic advisers, Finance Minister Boris Fedorov  and Sergey Glazyev, head of the parliamentary Committee on  Economic Policy, as well as Viktor Kisin, the former minister of  industry in Ivan Silayev's government (and now Chuvashia's  representative to Russia's highest bodies of state  administration), the program was prepared by specialists from  the Russian government's Center for Informational and Social  Technologies (its director Yevgeniy Saburov became the "main  reformer" in Crimea's government), and the Export-Import Bank,  which is the Chuvash government's financial agent.    Noting the complexity of the republic's socioeconomic  situation, Nikolay Fedorov (former minister of justice in the  governments of Ivan Silayev and Yegor Gaydar) wrote an item in  the press on behalf of the authors and attributed this  complexity not only to reasons that are typical of  Russia--inflation, the decline in production, the shortage of  working capital--but also to distinctive features of Chuvashia  that have deepened its economic crisis. Among these he included  the lack of a clearly defined economic specialization, a  sizeable proportion of production facilities that are subject to  defense-industry conversion, a labor surplus, agrarian  overpopulation, the high unit-cost of production, and the  underdevelopment of the market infrastructure. Fedorov defined  his objective somewhat uniquely: "The coming years will be years  of gathering money in order that afterwards there will really be  something to give out." Many people believe that hidden behind  these words lies an announcement of the introduction of a regime  of strict economy in the republic. The financial creed of the  Chuvash government has been announced more candidly: "Not to  give in to pressure from the people that is irresponsible in  terms of the future."    As for relations with Moscow, Fedorov did not show any  particular originality in noting the need to renovate them,  which was supposed to have been provided for in the treaty with  Russia on the delimitation of powers and subjects of  jurisdiction.    Implementation of the program will be carried out on the  basis of individual subprograms. In particular, there is a  proposal for joint actions among Russia's republics and the CIS  countries to establish an international bank and clearing  system, as well as several joint concerns in the form of  financial and industrial groups. In addition, it is planned to  establish, on the basis of Chuvashia's enterprises, five or six  model concerns that will be assigned the role of being the  locomotive of a fundamentally new economic system in the  republic--"an industrial-agrarian type in combination with small  and medium-sized private enterprises." The partners of  participants in this program will be determined through  international, federal and republic investment competitions. An  incentive for successful implementation of the idea will be the  condition that after two or three years of effective work a  firm's original property and newly created property, including  land, will be transferred to collective or private ownership.  Touching on issues of privatization, Fedorov expressed a rather  populistic support for making active adjustments in it: "We  cannot be pleased by a practice of privatization as the result  of which we get, in place of monopolistic prices,  supermonopolistic prices; instead of an increase in the  efficiency of production, a decline or total collapse of  production; and instead of an increase in budget revenues, a  drastic decrease in revenues." As a matter of fact, the  "privatization" part of the program is limited to that.    It is interesting that, against a backdrop of rather liberal  statements, the program declares that, under the conditions of a  republic that is small in terms of land, private farming is not  promising: reliance is being placed on well-organized collective  farms. Thus, through the example of Chuvashia, we can see the  vanity of any attempts to smash the colossus of the agrarian  lobby, which opposes the least disturbance of the status quo in  land relations.</p>

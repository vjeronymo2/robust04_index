			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Facts speak for themselves in review of local government Sir, I can only explain my friend and colleague Josie Farrington's views on the local government review (Letter, October 30) by reminding myself that she is speaking on behalf of the Association of County Councils and that county councils are due to be abolished if the review continues as scheduled. In attempting to make her argument against reform she attacks both a government minister (David Curry) and tries to quote public opinion in her argument. Neither is justified. The ACC knows there is a consensus between the three national political parties about the review. This is clear from the parties' manifestos at the last election. If she is looking for some authoritative historical support for the Labour party's position, I refer her to Aneurin Bevan speaking in 1954: 'There is little or no spiritual identification by the citizen with the administrative county . . . Its disappearance would involve the dispersal of sometimes highly efficient teams of officials but no emotional disturbance among the electorate embraced by it.' As for the public opinion polls she mentions - but does not detail - what they actually show (based on three polls on a sample of more than 6,000 individuals) is that 65 per cent of respondents expressing a view want to see a single local council in their locality rather than the existing two councils (district and county). This finding is not really surprising. Two councils equals confusion about which is responsible for which service. There can be little genuine local accountability without clarity of responsibility. A single local council in each area, based as locally to citizens as possible, will result in both efficiency gains and greatly improved local accountability. This is, therefore, one reform for which the government does not deserve to be criticised. We do not wish to squabble with our colleagues in counties - the provision of quality services is our prime concern - but the facts speak for themselves, if properly reported.

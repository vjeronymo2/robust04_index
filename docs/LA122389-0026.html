			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES  </P> <P> Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors, has called  for a staff study to help determine just how active county government should be  in the arts. The study is long overdue.  </P> <P> The questions of whether the county should have an arts policy and, if so, what  it should be, are interesting ones that should be determined.  </P> <P> Several cities in the county have long provided support for the arts. Just last  Thursday Dana Point, one of the county's newest cities, allocated a modest  $27,500 to six local cultural organizations.  </P> <P> Although the county for years has been conspicuous by its absence in support of  the arts, its consideration of financial support now is curious, coming when  the county budget is strained and when critical community needs -- like  prenatal and maternity care for impoverished pregnant women and support for  trauma centers -- are woefully underfunded.  </P> <P> Although the spending of public funds to support cultural facilities and  programs has long historic precedence, even in the best of financial times,  government spending is subject to hard priority decisions. That is even more  true today.  </P> <P> The county, however, still could play a vital role in the arts, financially as  well as in other ways. It may be possible for the county to secure otherwise  unobtainable funds that would not take money from other county programs. And  there certainly is a need for leadership and coordination of countywide efforts  in the arts that could bring together public and private efforts.  </P> <P> Theater productions, concerts and museums are important to the quality of life.  Riley is right in finally trying to determine the board's responsibilities in  the county's cultural future.  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The ICI statement confirming a rights issue and a demerger also dominated trading in the derivatives sector, writes Joel Kibazo. In stock index futures, the March contract continued trading in a tight range of about 20 points for most of the session. It started the day at 2,828 and moved lower, as the market reflected on the chemical giant's rights issue and restructuring plans. It fell to the day's low of 2,809 at around 11.15am. Thereafter, sporadic buying helped March recover some of the earlier falls, before a squeeze in the late afternoon caused a jump in the contract, with demand boosted by renewed firmness of sterling. It touched the day's high of 2,837 at 3.30pm but came off the top to close at 2,831, up 13 on its previous close. Turnover at 7,537 lots was poor. In traded options, total volume was also poor reaching a meagre 24,838 lots. Turnover in the FT-SE 100 option was a dull 3,668 lots and that in the Euro FT-SE 1,452. BTR was the most actively dealt stock option with 3,741 lots traded. It was followed by ICI at 2,915, and then by Abbey National at 1,564. British Aerospace and Sainsbury were also busy. Liffe announced yesterday that Smith New Court had received approval to become a market maker, thereby increasing the number on the exchange from 7 to 8. It starts trading next month.</p>

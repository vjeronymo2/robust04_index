			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> NOTHING-TO-LOSE PASS CAN BECOME WINNING PROPOSITION  </P> <P> One of the NFL's worst offensive formations, and probably its least popular, is  the kneel-down formation.  </P> <P> It is used by many teams in the last minute of the half or the game, when the  quarterback takes the snap and, forsaking a chance to score a quick touchdown,  kneels down to run out the clock.  </P> <P> "The NFL tells us they're in the entertainment business," says Times reader  Norton Beach. "Do they think we're paying to see an athlete hunker down?"  </P> <P> It isn't likely that Chuck Knox, who coaches the Seattle Seahawks, was  considering that question Sunday. But he probably won the game when he  renounced a splendid opportunity to send in a kneel-down play three seconds  before halftime.  </P> <P> At that moment, with Seattle losing, 6-3, Knox ordered a long pass, which  enabled quarterback Dave Krieg to practice the Seahawks' desperation offense.  </P> <P> And although the play failed, the next desperation pass that Krieg threw -- on  the last play of the game -- beat the Kansas City Chiefs as Paul Skansi caught  it in the end zone.  </P> <P> Like any other play in football, the desperation or Hail Mary pass has to be  practiced. That's the best strategic argument against the kneel-down formation.  </P> <P> Most coaches reason that the odds are almost hopelessly against completing long  passes when the clock is running down.  </P> <P> "Why wear out your wide receivers?" Hall of Famer Sid Gillman asks. "They could  pull a muscle. A lot of bad things could happen.  </P> <P> "Coaches aren't in the entertainment business. They're in the winning  business."  </P> <P> That's one side.  </P> <P> The other side is that a long desperation throw makes more sense than a  kneel-down play because it provides as many as four scoring chances:  </P> <P>  -- It could be deflected for a completion.  </P> <P>  -- It could be deliberately deflected by a receiver tipping the ball away on a  designed play.  </P> <P>  -- It could bring an interference penalty setting up a closer-in shot.  </P> <P>  -- It could be completed to the intended receiver.  </P> <P> The Raiders are still ahead in the AFC West because, this time, Krieg's was  completed.  </P> <P> The Chiefs demonstrated again in the Seattle game that a talented, skillful  pass defense isn't much help in pro football if accompanied by a unproductive  offense.  </P> <P> It was after a Kansas City linebacker, Derrick Thomas, sacked Krieg seven times  that Krieg got up and won it with his last throw.  </P> <P> The pass-defense problem for any pro club is that no passer can be roped on  every play. Any quarterback is bound to complete a few against any NFL defense.  </P> <P> In Kansas City, despite Thomas' record binge of sacks, Krieg completed 16 of 23  for 306 yards.  </P> <P> The Chiefs have probably the AFC's best defensive, offensive and special-team  players -- except at Steve DeBerg's position, quarterback.  </P> <P> They have produced only one touchdown in their last three games -- and the  defense scored that.  </P> <P> The NFL fined Raider owner Al Davis again Sunday -- in effect. It took $300,000  or more away from Davis and the Green Bay Packers when it scheduled the Rams  against the New York Giants at the same hour, 1 p.m., in Anaheim.  </P> <P> To an estimated 20,000 or more potential Raider-Packer fans, the free Ram-Giant  game on TV was preferable, holding attendance at the Coliseum to 50,855.  </P> <P> It isn't easy for the Rams to sell out Anaheim Stadium, which seats 69,008, but  it has proved almost impossible for the Raiders to sell out the 92,488-seat  Coliseum -- with or without a competing game in Anaheim.  </P> <P> In New York, the NFL never schedules the Giants against the Jets in competing  games. It can't -- because they play in the same stadium.  </P> <P> For scheduling purposes, it should pretend that the Raiders and Rams play in  the same stadium, too.  </P> <P> The league's present scheduling policy is a disservice to its own teams as well  as to pro fans who follow both the Rams and Raiders.  </P> <P> The most likely explanation is that the NFL office is still mad at Davis.  </P> <P> In their 29-16 defeat Sunday, the Raiders learned that the best time to have  played the Packers this year was in the first half of the season, when they  were a struggling team.  </P> <P> As a former Ram coach, Tommy Prothro, used to say: "The thing that counts in  football is who you play when."  </P> <P> By the time the Raiders got around to Green Bay, quarterback Don Majkowski had  finished his own personal training camp and, after a few rough early-season  performances, had finally come almost all the way back to his 1989 form.  </P> <P> When the other Packers were in their training camp last summer, Majkowski was  holding out for a multiyear, multimillion-dollar contract, which the club  wouldn't give him.  </P> <P> If it had, it would be that much closer to the Super Bowl. For he is a genuine  talent. Throwing on the run, he is nearly as accurate as the San Francisco  49ers' Joe Montana, even in the midst of eight sacks.  </P> <P> As Derrick Thomas learned, seven or eight sacks can be surmounted.  </P> <P> "I don't think its ever possible to miss a training camp and get things down,"  Green Bay Coach Lindy Infante said. "You can't get the guy enough repetitions."  </P> <P> The 8-1 Chicago Bears, who play in Green Bay's division, can be thankful for  that.  </P> <P> As for the Raiders, they know now what Prothro meant.  </P> <P> The Giants have been talking about their money packages lately -- their nickel  and dime defenses and the others -- in which, on passing downs, they add one to  three defensive backs to the starting four.  </P> <P> As Giant General Manager George Young said when asked about the club's fast  start: "Our money packages have been on the money."  </P> <P> If you're looking for a reason to promote the Cal State Long Beach coach,  George Allen, for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, that's one good one.  </P> <P> For it was Allen who, as the 1960s coach of the Rams, invented the nickel  defense. He came up with both the alignment -- five defensive backs replacing  four -- and the name for it.  </P> <P> One day against a particularly strong passing team, Allen added another  defensive back and called him the dime back.  </P> <P> His and other clubs, needing even more help, subsequently put in quarter and  dollar defenses.  </P> <P> As a college coach, Allen, 72, had a chance Saturday to join Auburn's Pat Dye  and the other famous college coaches this year by playing for a tie. Instead,  Allen went for two and beat Cal State Northridge, 25-24.  </P> <P> The undefeated 49ers ran the ball with a little more style Sunday night in  Dallas, but as a running team they still are no match for the undefeated  Giants, their opponent at Candlestick Park Monday night, Dec. 3.  </P> <P> Few teams match the Giants for ground power, as they demonstrated again in  Anaheim Sunday. Although they won, 31-7, the score was 10-7 in the second half  when, on second and 11, rookie running back Rodney Hampton burst 19 yards  through the Rams for a touchdown on the game's big play.  </P> <P> The Giants also attack with a tough old workhorse, Ottis Anderson, as well as a  5-foot-7 pony back, David Meggett, who weighs 180 pounds, not to mention a sure  old blocker, Maurice Carthon.  </P> <P> Their running plays set up quarterback Phil Simms' decisive passes against the  Rams as surely as Majkowski's passing against the Raiders set up the Packers to  run for a season-high 101 yards.  </P> <P> In the Giant-49er game, Montana will be on his own unless the 49ers can in the  meantime find a running attack.  </P> <P> "We're concerned," said 49er Coach George Seifert. "We're working on it every  week."  </P> <P> Quote Department:  </P> <P> Boomer Esiason, Cincinnati quarterback, on how the Pittsburgh Steelers have  caught the Bengals for first in the AFC Central: "We've got guys open, and I'm  not hitting them."  </P> <P> Bubby Brister, Pittsburgh quarterback, on the Steelers' rise from 1-3 to 5-4:  "We should be proud and enjoy it, because the first month was hell."  </P> <P> Dan Henning, San Diego coach, on winning four of his last five: "There is an  overall stability factor that we hadn't had earlier or last year."  </P> <P> Mike Ditka, Chicago coach, on chasing the 49ers and Giants: "I don't think  there are very many people even right now who respect (the Bears). That's the  way I like it. That's the way I want it."  </P></p>

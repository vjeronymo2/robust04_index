These processes are as  follows: Process A: Acidification and Methane reactors, Process  B: Acidification and Methane reactors followed Membrane, Process  C: Acidification reactor, Membrane and Methane reactor. Three  performance data were compared from the points of gas production  under identical organic loading and operating conditions.    Process C is excellent and recommendable when a waste water  enriched organic SS is treated, because a membrane application  between Acidification and Methane reactors allows a clear  two-phase separation in substrate degradation.  <H5>  Introduction </H5>   Methane fermentation process is considered one of the major  biological waste water treatment processes characterizing energy  recovery from substrates contained in a waste water. From a  kinetic viewpoint, methane fermentation is described as three  steps involving 1) hydrolysis of complex organic material, 2)  acid production, 3) conversion of acetate or hydrogen to  methane. The overall anaerobic conversion of organic matters to  the end products: CH[.sub]4[/], CO[.sub]2[/] and  NH[.sub]3[/], proceeds simultaneously within a reactor.  Otherwise, according to reactor operating conditions, methane  fermentation is classified under acidogenic phase and  methanogenic phase. While a major drawback in methane  fermentation was long hydraulic retention time (HRT), lots of  work for upgrade of methane fermentation efficiency have been  carried out.    Such efforts are attempted to improve methane fermentation  efficiency, for example, 1) two-phase fermentation process in  which acidogenic and methanogenic phases can operate under  optimal conditions,[.sup]1[/] 2) accumulation of high  microbial concentration in a reactor using microbial  carrier,[.sup]2[/] 3) UASB rector contributed by microbial  pellet and granule formation,[.sup]3[/] and 4) membrane  introduced reactor.[.sup]4[/]    A membrane reactor of aerobic waste water treatment plant  has  widely been utilized in water reclamation systems. On the other  hand, application of membrane to methane fermentation process is  on a starting step. A great advantage of membrane application in  methane fermentation process might upgrade efficiency due to  methanogen accumulation. However, few studies have been reported  regarding where a membrane should be introduced in a two-phase  methane fermentation process. Further, few reports on  quantitative analysis of improved performance between a  conventional two-phase fermentation process and a membrane  combined two-phase fermentation process.    This study demonstrates a two-phase methane fermentation  combined with a membrane separation unit for furthermore  improvement of efficiency in gas production and treated water  qualities. The purpose was to obtain comparison performances in  terms of three different methane fermentation processes. These  processes are as follows: Process A: Acidification and Methane  reactors, Process B: Acidification and Methane reactors followed  Membrane, Process C: Acidification reactor, Membrane and Methane  reactor.    Since a membrane was introduced between two reactors, it was  of great interest whether perfect two-phase separation occurred  in the process. A series of continuous field test was carried  out in a soybean processing factory employing pilot scale plant  consisting of fixed bed reactors.  <H5>  Experimental </H5>   Apparatus    A flow sheet of pilot plant and the specification of main  apparatus are shown in Figure 1 [not reproduced] and Table 1  respectively. The reactor is divided into two chambers,  acidification and methane reactors. Both reactors equip  microbial carriers made of polyvinylidene chloride nonwoven  fabrics. Circulation pumps provide up-flow in each reactor. Gas  produced from each reactor passes through desulfurization tower.  A membrane used is of an external pressure capillary type whose  molecular weight cut off approximates 15,000. Five modules of  ultra filtration (UF) membrane ensured a constant effluent water  quality with merry-go-round usage.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1.

The temperature of waste water was  controlled at about 30 Celsius.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 2.

The HRT ranged 3.3-3.5 hour in acidification  reactor and 6.7-7.0 hour in methane reactor.    Figure 2 [not reproduced] gives a block diagram of three  different processes used in this study. The continuous run for  Process A was initially conducted for approximately six months.  In the second step, Process B continued for approximately 100  days. In the final step, a membrane was replaced between  Acidification and Methane reactors. The continuous run for  Process C proceeded for approximately six months. Thus, a series  of continuous run for three processes employed the identical  experimental conditions.    Analysis and Measurement    Flow rates of water and gas, temperatures, pHs, ORPs and  methane content were continuously recorded. The water quality  analysis, in terms of TOC, BOD, COD, SS, VFA and ammonia, was  executed routinely. An automatic TOC measurement monitored  hourly variation of raw and treated waters.  <H5>  Results and Discussion </H5>   Performance of Process A    The continuous run for Process A was carried out to compare  performances of two membrane introduced processes with a  conventional two-phase process. Performance data from organic  loading of approximately 3 kg COD/m[.sup]3[/]/day was chosen  for the comparison. Average data are summarized in Table 3.       Table 3.

When a membrane is combined with a  reactor, Effluent implies permeate.   G[.sub]a[/]: Acidification reactor Gas, G[.sub]m[/] : Methane reactor Gas, G[.sub]t[/]: Total Gas   Methane conversion expresses on a COD basis, namely oxygen consumption (kg) required for produced methane combustion divided by raw waste water COD (kg).       Process A showed a higher gas production and methane content  in Methane reactor than those in Acidification reactor. One  m[.sup]3[/] of waste water produces 308 Nl of methane. In  treated water, SS and COD concentrations were relatively high  and acetic acid (HAc) of 38 mg/l was still residual. The COD  removal percentage (51.8 percent) that should theoretically be  greater than the methane conversion resulted in the opposite  phenomenon. This might be attributed by high SS concentration  discharge in the treated water due to slough off of attached SS  (microbes and soybean particles) on carriers during the period.  Because acclimation run (COD loading 3.0 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day)  prior to this test provided a good material balance showing up  COD removal 67.8 percent, methane conversion 54.9 percent and SS  concentrations in raw water and treated water, 608 mg/l and 238  mg/l respectively, all the data in Process A except SS and COD  might be considered possible to employ for process performance  comparison.    Performance of Process B    The purpose of Process B was to obtain a clarified water and  an enhanced biogas production due to recovery of methanogen with  membrane. Average data for Process B are also demonstrated in  Table 3. The resultant COD loading was 3.25  kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day. COD removal (77.7 percent) was  appreciably improved by decreasing free SS in the treated water.  In terms of soluble organic acids, higher acetic acid (HAc) and  propionic acid (HPr) concentrations were found residual in the  treated water. Pertaining to gas production, methane conversion  (68.9 percent) showed, on the contrary of the expectation, a  little lower value than that from Process A.    Since the membrane separated perfectly solid and liquid, the  decrease in methane conversion seemed to be derived from an  accumulation of soybean suspended solids in Methane reactor. The  scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observation proved the  presence of mixture, microbes and soybean SS. Accumulation of SS  in Methane reactor might cause simultaneous reaction of  solubilization, acidification and methane production, the  simultaneous reaction led deterioration of methanogenic  activity. The two-phase separation was found difficult when a  membrane introduced in the final step.    Performance of Process C    A membrane was replaced between acidification and methane  reactors in Process C. The purpose of this process was to  enclose soybean particles in the acidification reactor and to  promote solubilization of particles therein. Accordingly, the  methane reactor received a permeate contained organic acids.  Average data for Process C from Table 3 shows the resultant COD  loading 3.0 kg/m[.sup]3[/]/day. Process C revealed a  remarkable improvement in terms of COD removal (92.4 percent)  and methane conversion (83.4 percent).    Some 100 mg/l of COD, 26 mg/l of HAc and 16 mg/l of HPr in  the treated water gave the lowest concentrations among three  processes. Further, 4 mg/l of SS was a low value, which could  explain a firm attachment of methanogen on nonwoven fabrics  carriers. Unlike the performance of Process A and B,  Acidification reactor provided an increasing gas production.  Methane production from Acidification reactor occupied 53  percent of the total value. Hence, Acidification reactor  introduced membrane system permitted symbiosis of acid forming  and methane forming bacteria. Since, the membrane permeate was  free of SS, an ideal methane fermentation seemed to take place  in the second reactor. A SEM observation disclosed a lot of  methanothrix-like bacteria attached on carriers.  <H5>  Conclusions </H5>   Introduction of a membrane in different locations caused a  great difference in performance. Process B showed a clear  blockage of SS in the treated water. However, there was no  remarkable improvement in terms of gas production and soluble  organic matters in the treated water. Process C gave noteworthy  improvement results compared with Process A. Concerning  two-phase separation, Process B did not attain it and inversely  enhanced a heterogeneous microbial formation in Methane reactor.  Process C, despite a membrane application between Acidification  and Methane reactors, performed no obvious two-phase separation  either. However, it allowed a clear two-phase separation in  substrate degradation process. Conclusively, among three  processes, Process C is excellent and recommendable when a waste  water enriched organic SS is treated.  <H5>  Acknowledgement </H5>   This study is a part of ``Research and Development for New  Waste Water Treatment System (Aqua-Renaissance '90 Project)''  supported by NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology  Development Organization).

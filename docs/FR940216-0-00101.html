			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has chosen to use the GC&hyph;OFID method as the single regulatory method for measuring oxygen content and oxygenates. As with the aromatics determination, EPA felt compelled to develop a new method given the shortcomings of the methods presently available. However, the ASTM method D&hyph;4815&hyph;93 can be used for the compounds specified in the method until January 1, 1997 to meet industry testing requirements under section 80.65(e). ASTM method D&hyph;4815 has been used for quite some time, but with the addition of heavier oxygenates,  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> D&hyph;4815 has become increasingly difficult to use. EPA is aware that there has been an attempt to expand the scope and range of D&hyph;4815 to include heavier oxygenates (as set forth in D&hyph;4815&hyph;93). However, the longer one has to wait to extract the heavier oxygenates, the more likely it is that hydrocarbons will be drawn out with the oxygenates, interfering with the test results. In addition, EPA is not satisfied with the accuracy of D&hyph;4815. The reproducibility and repeatability factors are quite large. Presently, OFID is the only accurate method known that is capable of testing for oxygenates at all ranges. EPA believes a reliable, accurate and precise method that is capable of testing for oxygenates at all ranges is required when the reformulated gasoline requirements go into effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has been using GC&hyph;OFID for four years. During that period, the cracker reactor has required replacement on only one occasion. EPA has had the opportunity to use various portable IR methods for field screening tests and has been pleased with the results. However, although these are excellent screening devices, they are not presently at the stage of development that would allow their use as a regulatory enforcement method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sulfur.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed to use an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer (ICP&hyph;AES) method for sulfur analysis that was developed at EPA's laboratory. Most commenters were opposed to this method because it is an unproven technology, because it is very expensive, and because there are no substantial benefits received from this technology that are not also available through existing methods. It was also thought not to be practical in a refinery environment. Commenters suggested the use of ASTM D&hyph;4045, ASTM D&hyph;2622, or ASTM D&hyph;4294.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After considering the comments, EPA has chosen ASTM D&hyph;2622&hyph;92, an x-ray spectrometry method, as the regulatory sulfur test method. This is a newer version of the same test method that is used for testing sulfur in the low sulfur diesel fuel program. Industry should already be on-line with this method since the diesel program went into effect on October 1, 1993. The newer version has correction factors to adjust for the interference from oxygenated product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Olefins.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA proposed to use the ASTM method D&hyph;1319&hyph;88 to determine olefin content. Most commenters were in favor of this method since there are no other standard methods for olefins from which to choose at this time. Most commenters pointed out that the method is not as accurate as it should be. Comments were made that the method was updated in 1989 (D&hyph;1319&hyph;89). Comments were made that the method would not detect any oxygenates present, but that the results can be normalized to determine the amount of oxygen present using multiplications factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has chosen the ASTM method  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> D&hyph;1319&hyph;93, Fluorescent Indicator Absorption method (FIA) as the single regulatory method to determine olefin content. EPA has chosen this method because there are no alternative methods available. EPA believes that an accuracy greater than is possible with the D&hyph;1319 method is desirable and looks forward to working with industry to develop a suitable GC&hyph;MS method to detect olefins in the near future. The newest version, ASTM D&hyph;1319&hyph;93, was chosen because it contains multiplication factors to determine the amount of oxygen present.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

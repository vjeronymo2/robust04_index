			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / The Markets: Testing time for coffee market Commodities By Deborah Hargreaves and Kenneth Gooding Traders in London will be eager for the opening of the coffee futures market this morning as it will be the first opportunity to react to a report by the US Department of Agriculture assessing the extent of frost damage to the 1995 Brazilian coffee crop. The USDA report was released after the close of the London and New York markets on Friday. It estimated that next year's Brazilian crop will reach between 17m and 20m bags - a figure well within market expectations. Trading at the London Commodity Exchange last week had been volatile and jittery as the market awaited the outcome of the USDA report. But brokers had expected the report to be more optimistic than Brazil's own estimate of frost damage and for this reason pushed prices downwards last week. By close of trading on Friday, the November futures contract was some 10 per cent lower than it had been the week before at Dollars 3,273 a tonne. It has dropped from a peak of over Dollars 4,000 after the initial reports of the frost damage. Meanwhile, traders will be keeping a close watch on London Metal Exchange lead stocks which, against all expectations, have been rising in recent weeks. On Friday the LME reported lead stocks at a record 365,425 tonnes. Unexpectedly large shipments from China are partly to blame - the official China Daily reported exports of lead surged by 209 per cent to 124,300 tonnes in the first half of 1994. All of this metal was absorbed by the booming markets of south-east Asia, but its presence in the market forced other producers to deliver more to the LME. Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish about lead's prospects. There are serious shortages of concentrate (an intermediate material) because low prices have forced many mines to close. This must soon have an impact on western producers of refined lead and they will have to cut supply, analysts suggest, even though demand remains robust.</p>

			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PREGNANT DRUG ADDICTS, BABIES JAM AGENCIES  </P> <P> Sarah got her first taste of heroin at age 14, when an uncle fashioned a  tourniquet around her skinny arm and injected her.  </P> <P> She was quickly hooked, and by the time she turned 18, she was pregnant, too.  But motherhood scarcely interrupted her addiction then, or the next time she  got pregnant. Or the next time.  </P> <P> "When I was pregnant, I had to use double," she explained, "because a lot of it  went to the baby. . . . I would say, 'I don't want to use.' Then I would stick  the needle in my arm and say, 'God help me.' "  </P> <P> Now 30, Sarah is an Orange County mother of three daughters, ages 1, 2 and 11.  One, born while Sarah was in a methadone-treatment program, entered the world  addicted to the heroin substitute. And although Sarah, who spoke on condition  that her real name not be used, insisted that the other 2 children were not  affected by her drug use, she recalled that the 2-year-old "for the first 4 or  5 months . . . would shake real bad out of nowhere."  </P> <P> There are many women like Sarah in Orange County, and many more children,  according to county health and child welfare officials. Their numbers are  growing rapidly, but the social network is not. Two county agencies that assist  pregnant addicts and protect their children are overloaded, constrained by a  county hiring freeze and, increasingly, unable to meet the burgeoning need.  </P> <P> "The problem is enormous and getting worse," said Sylvia Wall, deputy director  of child care for the Orange County Social Services Agency. "There are hundreds  of mothers out there, and for every child we come in contact with, there are  probably two or three more that we never hear about."  </P> <P> Sarah is now in the Orange County Health Care Agency's Perinatal Treatment  Program, an intensive regimen of counseling and drug screening that may enable  her to regain custody of her children. The model program, started with 18 women  in 1985, has grown to 170 women, with a waiting list of 60 to 80 more.  </P> <P> Her daughters are in foster care, as they have been off and on throughout their  lives. Children of substance abusers make up 62% of all newborns who are  referred to the social services agency, and 30% of the agency's caseload of  2,200 youngsters. Meanwhile, only 38 of the county's 400 foster-care slots are  equipped for the special problems of drug babies, who often suffer physical and  neurological defects.  </P> <P> No one knows how many drug-exposed babies fall through the cracks because they  show no obvious signs of withdrawal. But a case review of families involved in  just two county programs found that 1,662 children under the age of 3 had  likely been exposed to drugs during pregnancy but had not been detected  previously. The study, presented in January by county health educator Marian  Henry, recommends expansion of prenatal care and drug-treatment services.  </P> <P> "It's at a crisis stage for us, because we are always struggling to find foster  homes for these babies," said Mary Harris, program analyst for the social  services agency. "We never have the luxury of too many foster homes."  </P> <P> Glenn and Jan Allen measure the distance they dare stray from their 1-year-old  foster son in seconds, not feet or yards.  </P> <P> When he naps, Billy's breathing is monitored by an electronic device that  sounds a piercing alarm if he does not draw a breath for 20 seconds. The  Allens, both nurses, must be close enough that they can quickly reach Billy and  awaken him or perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation.  </P> <P> "You can't ever be more than 10 seconds from the baby, because by the time you  get to him, he's already been without oxygen for 30 seconds," Jan Allen said.  "Sometimes, the monitor will go off 150 to 200 times a night, and then there is  nothing for a month."  </P> <P> The Allens, who have a 15-year-old daughter, have opened their San Juan  Capistrano home to 105 foster children in less than 10 years. Like Billy, who  was born in a hotel room to a cocaine addict, most of the children were exposed  to street drugs in the womb. And, like Billy, many cry inconsolably, suffer  bouts of jitters, lethargy and apnea, a neurological defect that can cause them  to suddenly stop breathing.  </P> <P> Withdrawal has been different with each child, according to Glenn Allen.  </P> <P> "Some of the kids have gone through intense periods of pain and aversion to  touch or any stimulation. Then they seem OK. Other kids go through withdrawal  that seems to go on forever and ever. Developmentally, these children are  usually delayed; a year or more behind other kids in some areas. They might  catch up, if they are fortunate and get the right care."  </P> <P> Billy is tethered to a portable apnea monitor that records his breathing  whenever the Allens bring him on an outing: he could fall asleep in a car seat  or a shopping cart and suffocate. Their home is outfitted like a neo-natal  nursery, with high-tech gadgetry and dim lights to reduce environmental  stimulation for hypersensitive infants. Care of such infants is so demanding  that the couple have formed a High Risk Infant Team to train and support other  foster parents.  </P> <P> "I feel angry at the mothers," Jan Allen said. "I think they should be forced  to go into drug treatment programs. We need more treatment programs to help the  borderline cases keep their kids. But sometimes, you have four or five addicted  kids from the same mother who is always on drugs. That's a hopeless case."  </P> <P> Billy's mother has visited him once in the 8 months he has spent with the  Allens. "She seemed like a nice girl," Glenn Allen said. "She was trying to get  it together and for a while she was drug-free. But then she went back to drugs  and we haven't heard from her since."  </P> <P> Billy, whose name has been changed to conceal his identity, will be the Allen's  last foster child. The couple is about to complete the adoption of a 3-year-old  boy whose mother and grandmother were heroin addicts. Then they will  concentrate on their newly expanded family for a while.  </P> <P> "These children need a homelike environment, but not at the cost of burnout for  a foster family," Jan Allen said. "It can be very stressful. You have to give  yourself space, time to keep your relationship alive with your husband and the  rest of your family. You can't try to save the world."  </P> <P> There isn't much public sympathy for drug addicts, especially women who are  addicts, officials of the Orange County Health Care Agency realize.  </P> <P> "There is a pervasive attitude that these women are criminals and what they are  doing is a crime," said Bill Edelman, manager of the agency's drug program.  "But they are producing children, and unless we get involved, we won't change  their lives."  </P> <P> The women who participate in the health care agency's Perinatal Treatment  Program all are mothers, ages 18 to around 35. Some come voluntarily, but more  often they are ordered to take part by a judge or a social worker as a  condition to keeping or regaining custody of their children.  </P> <P> No residential treatment is available for drug-addicted mothers in Orange  County, but the outpatient perinatal program includes some of the hard-nosed  structure found in inpatient programs. Clients are required to attend group and  individual therapy sessions and to undergo drug testing twice a week. If their  drug tests indicate recent use, they risk expulsion. If they are late for  appointments, they are counted absent.  </P> <P> For many, it is the first time in their lives that they have had to follow  strict rules. Their lives have been chaotic and often violent, without the  daily discipline of school or employment. Most of the women were victims of  their environments long before they victimized a new generation through drugs.  </P> <P> "What society needs to understand is that these women do drugs for a reason,"  said Shoni Welsh, chief of the perinatal program, which operates on a $400,000  annual budget. "Drugs help them deal with their lives. They have very  transient, unstable life styles. Without the drugs, it would be more difficult  to deal with issues like incest, abandonment, abuse."  </P> <P> Sarah is typical of the women being treated by the county. Her father and all  nine siblings were addicted to heroin, and family arguments were occasionally  punctuated by gunfire. In her out-of-control household, drugs were a part of  "normal" life. Even as an adult, she is more comfortable around fellow drug  addicts than people who don't use drugs.  </P> <P> Sarah twists her long, dark hair around a finger as she talks. Her voice is  soft and flat as she describes the need for drugs that led her into burglary,  prostitution and theft. "I started with heroin; I guess that's why I never  liked pot," she said. "I was the youngest, and every time I came home it  (heroin) would be there. I didn't know where else to go. After a while, I did  what I had to do to pay for my drugs."  </P> <P> Sarah said she realized that she was hooked around age 17. Because drug use  caused her to stop menstruating and to feel sick most of the time when she  wasn't high, she said she did not realize that she was pregnant until she was 7  months along.  </P> <P> "I wanted to stop. When you're hooked, you hurt, you vomit and you cry. . . .  How can people think a drug addict don't care (about her children). Get a drug  addict when they are clean and sober and they'll tell you how much they care."  </P> <P> Even with help, the success of the women in the perinatal program at staying  off drugs is not good, Welsh said. "Over 50% of our women do get their children  back," she said, pausing for a long moment before adding, "but there is a big  relapse rate."  </P> <P> Sarah began "slipping" during recent weeks, Welsh said. She tested positive a  few times in succession, perhaps as a result of a family crisis. Finally, Sarah  entered an inpatient detoxification and drug-counseling program, where she is  still being treated.  </P> <P> "She went into detox voluntarily," Welsh said. "That's a good sign -- it shows  motivation."  </P> <P> DRUG BABIES  </P> <P> Infants born to addicts raise fetal rights issue. Part I, Page 1.  </P></p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Survey of Courier and Express Services (7): Danger; nervy computer on board - A mobile tracking system that boosts security and reliability ANYONE stuck in traffic behind a Securicor Datatrak van sees this warning emblazoned on the doors. 'Securicor vehicles are fitted with Datatrak, an automated vehicle tracking system. Should the vehicle be stolen, or unlawfully removed, Securicor will track its precise movements, and will pass that information to the police immediately.' Securicor developed its Datatrak system to track these cash-in-transit vans, to provide continuous automatic real time reporting of location and status. Between 1988 and 1991 the system was extended to include two-way messaging. Each vehicle has a small computer unit which receives signals from the nationwide transmitter network. The data gathered is then sent via a network of base stations and displayed on a series of digital maps on a colour screen in the controller's office. Users of the Datatrak service include police, ambulances and London Transport. The first independent courier operation to use the Securicor Datatrak system was Link Couriers at Heathrow. Dick Temple, Link's founder and managing director, says it helps to fulfil the two things which matter most to courier clients, 'speed of response and some feedback on where the parcel is and when it will be delivered'. When Temple first set up in the courier business in Godalming in 1975, communications technology was non-existent, or at least limited to using the customer's telephone to report a delivery. But the 1980s saw great leaps in the technology available: private mobile radio, online databases, even barcoding for monitoring what arrived where and when. Now mobile data and satellite communications are providing increasingly sophisticated systems. In the last two years, large companies such as Securicor, Parceline and Royal Mail have invested millions on information technology. Countrywide networks have created the infrastructure for Automatic Vehicle Location. Now smaller companies such as Link can benefit from some of that investment. Temple says he has always been an enthusiast for any advances in communications technology which enable his company to improve its service. Link's fleet of 40 vans and motor cycles handles around 1,000 national and local jobs a week from its Heston, Middlesex base. Temple has moved from tone-only pagers in the 1970s into private mobile radio in the 1980s, and for the last two years, the company has used Band 3 radio, enabling it to take customers from a much wider area than the M25 corridor. Temple sees Datatrak as a leap ahead of telephone and radio communications. Each of Link's 20 vans now has an antenna and locator unit which enables the controller to see the exact location of vehicles to within 50 metres' accuracy, via a signal that is updated every 108 seconds. (Security companies operate the more expensive eight-second option.) The chief benefit is the efficient deployment of resources. 'In the early days it was acceptable to collect within the hour,' says Temple. 'Now customers expect 10 to 15 minutes. With this system we can use the closest vehicle. It is also very impressive in giving accurate feedback to the customer who is chasing a consignment on the phone. 'We can paint a picture for them - it's doing 60 mph on the A308, or just about to pass junction X on the motorway.' The console in the van includes a small printer and a keypad. The driver can glance at a message as it is printed out and tap a number into the keypad in acknowledgment. The response is pre-coded signifying, for example, whether the van can accept another job or not. 'The next step', says Temple, 'is to have proper two-way messaging rather than the one-way message and confirmation from the driver.' Another company, Cognito, is already using two-way data terminals on its own network but without Datatrak's location tracking facility which allows the controller to pinpoint a van on a map. The hardware in each van costs about Pounds 600, (the price has dropped from Pounds 1,400 two years ago) with radio charges at about Pounds 15 per week per vehicle. The controller uses a Compaq connected to the network, costing about Pounds 5,000, and the 20-inch screen used for the map display is an Eizo monitor, costing another Pounds 3,000. Link estimates the system costs it around Pounds 1,000 per year per van, an expense it can easily justify. Link drivers are paid on performance, (commission per completed delivery), not on hours worked, so they are happy to use the system, and find it needs the minimum of training. It is for the user to decide what level of detail is recorded for any one job. For example, Datatrak could solve the problem of policing a large fleet (100 vehicles or more), which might lose a great deal of money if the employees used the vans privately, or claimed unjustified overtime. Temple is well aware of Datatrak's potential for policing and control, but that's not what interests him. 'It's a service benefit. The customer notices the difference because we are able to give realistic collection times. We would build a margin into our estimates previously, but now we can say with confidence that we can be there in 10 minutes.' He knows that Datatrak might in time be overtaken by satellite systems, but feels he has picked the right technology for the moment, especially if delivering in urban areas where radio reception can be patchy. He believes that new advances may include voice/data lines, and yet smaller onboard computers, the size of a portable CD system, or even, eventually, a watch. Currently his main concern is integrating his Datatrak system with software bought from Marlow-based Fleetway, which manages booking and charging automatically. Fleetway provides modular software for administration and online booking, for courier, taxi, delivery and other transport companies. According to Keith Fellowes, group sales manager, Fleetway has 250 users in the UK, and 4,000 worldwide. 'Currently we work with both Cognito and Datatrak. This gives users seamless integration making voice-radio contact unnecessary.' Fleetway can use any existing messaging system, but currently finds these two provide the best result. Becky Clark, technical director, sees a largely unexploited market among smaller courier and delivery companies, who, as hardware costs spiral down, can afford to emulate larger companies with online systems. 'I reckon that there are at least 8,000 potential customers out there in the UK alone,' she says. Mark Attwood, of Manchester Publishing Company, describes the industry as 'paranoid' in the 1980s: 'They never talked to one another.' His newly launched magazine, Courier Express, has a deliberately high IT content, looking at future trends such as mobile data. 'The people who have invested in technology early can point to success.' He cites two companies as proof: Link Couriers, and Dale Express, a fast-growing Croydon-based company with an unusual 'one-consignment per van' operation, which is administered by custom-built software from Fleetway. 'IT should be the key to growth in the future,' concludes Attwood.' I believe it's an investment in increasing service levels, and research shows that's an issue that rates above cost for most customers.'</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Technology: The mouse proves to be a boy The single gene that makes an embryo turn into a boy rather than a girl has been identified conclusively. In this week's Nature, scientists from the National Institute for Medical Research and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund publish the proof that SRY (which stands for Sex-determining Region on the Y chromosome) - one of 100,000 human genes - is the male gene. They created a male mouse simply by injecting Sry genes (the murine version of SRY) into a female embryo. The animal grew up with normal male sex organs and mated with female mice, although he was infertile. The British scientists said last July they were nearly certain that SRY was the male gene, after studying those rare individuals whose 'biological' sex was different from their 'genetic' sex. They found that SRY was missing from women who had a Y (male) chromosome; in men who had no Y chromosome SRY was transposed to another chromosome. The experiment reported this week is a milestone in academic genetics - not a recipe for producing boy babies. The scientists say that it would not only be illegal and unethical to do human genetic engineering in this way but also completely impractical. The technique of injecting genes into a newly fertilised egg is not reliable. Only three of 11 female mouse embryos with Sry genes actually developed as males; the others stayed female because Sry ended up on chromosomes where it could not work properly. And even when it does work, the male is infertile because he still has two X (female) chromosomes and sperm cannot survive in mammals with two X chromosomes. The challenge now is to find out what switches SRY on in a embryo 10 to 12 days after conception - the period when sex is determined - and to discover how it in turn regulates the 'cascade' of other genes which control the development of male features.</p>

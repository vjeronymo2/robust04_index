			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / Accountancy income plunges: Competition and recession dent earnings, league table shows INTENSE COMPETITION and the effects of the recession severely dented the fee income of the UK's accountancy firms, according to the Financial Times league table of the profession published today. Revenues excluding expenses for the largest 30 firms were stable over the past 12 months while the number of partners, professional staff and offices has fallen substantially. Just one third of the firms reported growth in income, with most of these reporting single digit increases. The greatest growth was 17.5 per cent at Andersen, and the biggest decline 11.1 per cent at Casson Beckman. Fees from audit fell 0.6 per cent to Pounds 1.4bn, but were offset by an 11.3 per cent increase in insolvency to Pounds 352m, 2.7 per cent growth to Pounds 784m in tax and 2.2 per cent growth to Pounds 667m in management consulting. The number of partners rose 1.5 per cent to 5,037 but the number of other professional staff fell nearly 5 per cent to 43,600. The figures show that accountancy firms are an enormous business, with the top 30 generating more than Pounds 3.4bn in the 12 months to this spring. They also demonstrate the continued dominance of the 'Big 6' firms. These largest firms alone generated revenues of Pounds 2.6bn during the past year  - or three quarters of the total for the highest 30. This concentration of control in a few hands has grown substantially over the last decade. A year ago, Coopers &amp; Lybrand was the only Big 6 firm to report a decline in fee income. This year, only one of the Big 6  - Andersen  - has managed to report positive growth. Just one third of the firms reported growth in income. The figures are the best attempt to make fee income from the firms comparable, but the process is made difficult for a wide range of reasons including two firms which have reported for the first time this year. Accountancy firms  - while they are substantial businesses in their own right  - are under no obligation to publish any financial information because they are private partnerships and not limited companies. They persistently refuse to provide details of profits. Many of the firms' year-ends are different, although most have attempted to compile figures for the 12 months to April or May this year. Some have had income boosted by mergers during the year. Several - such as Moore Rowlands  - are associations of different firms rather than a unified organisation, while a number of others  - like BDO Binder Hamlyn and KPMG Peat Marwick  - comprise separate partnership. Others have very distinct businesses. For example, 56 per cent of Andersen's revenues come from Andersen Consulting, an all but autonomous business. Two fifths of Smith &amp; Williamson's revenues come from its investments and securities arm. The firms have different policies on issues including staff on secondments, allocating revenue between their operating divisions, and their practices in Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By CRIME-TASS correspondent Olga Solodova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Yevgeniy Savostyanov, head of  the Moscow department of the Federal Counterintelligence, is not  going to insist on his resignation after President Boris Yeltsin  had turned it down.    He told TASS on Thursday that he had forwarded the  resignation to his chief Sergey Stepashin and the latter  informed Boris Yeltsin about it. "The resignation was  rejected", Savostyanov said.    He categorically denied mass media reports that his  resignation was prompted by contradictions with Stepashin. An  engineer by education Savostyanov came to the  counterintelligence bodies during Perestroyka years of Mikhail  Gorbachev in 1991. He told TASS that he had offered to resign  because he believes that he had fulfilled his mission of  "depoliticizing" the counterintelligence agency which used to be  a branch of notorious KGB which, in its turn, was controlled by  the former Soviet communist party. Savostyanov said he simply  wanted to return to public and political activities.    Now he will "work with full strength, as far as it is  necessary", Savostyanov said, adding that he believes it  impossible to insist on his resignation after the president had  turned it down.</p>

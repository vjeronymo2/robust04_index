			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / Bank steps up EC campaign THE Bank of England yesterday stepped up its campaign to make London the home of the monetary institutions that will be set up as the European Community moves towards economic and monetary union, Peter Norman writes. Mr Eddie George, the Bank's deputy governor, said London was the 'logical location' for future European monetary institutions because of its dominant position in world foreign exchange markets. Speaking at a conference organised by Telerate, the financial information group, Mr George said it would be 'disappointing, though not fatally damaging, for London' if the institutions went elsewhere. Britain's commitment to the present parity of sterling in the European exchange rate mechanism was underlined both by Mr George and by Mr John Maples, the economic secretary to the Treasury.</p>

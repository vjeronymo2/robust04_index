Texas Gas also states that the term of its Agreement coincided with the term of a gas purchase contract, with Unocal, involving gas reserves in the Bayou Pigeon Field. Texas Gas asserts the gas purchase contract expired on November 1, 1993, and thus the Agreement also terminated on this same date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas Gas and Unocal state there is no abandonment of any facilities pursuant to the instant application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  October 21, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

CNG further states that NFG Supply serves these consumers by utilizing CNG's B&hyph;5 and B&hyph;M7 lines. Because of the age and condition of these lines, and a declining supply, NFG Supply desires to retire these lines. CNG proposes to construct a four-inch tap, measuring and regulation station and add approximately 150 feet of 4-inch connecting line from CNG's pipeline system near the Village of Wilcox. This would replace the gas supply delivering it through the new facilities to NFG Supply so that NFG Distribution could continue serving its consumers in Wilcox and vicinity. CNG states that the estimated cost of the construction is $124,596.00, and that NFG Supply has agreed to reimburse CNG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  November 14, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

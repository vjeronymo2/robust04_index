			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Consumers fail to lead recovery THERE is still no sign of a consumer-led recovery, according to a survey of more than 1,000 adults published today by Mintel, the market research organisation. Mintel concluded that a 'consumer-driven' recovery, instigated by the government and financial institutions, would be needed. It added that the UK population had suffered 'its greatest shock since the Second World War' and was 'understandably cautious'. According to the survey, 59 per cent of consumers felt that borrowing money for anything other than buying a house should be avoided. A strong majority - 65 per cent - also said they were not prepared to use credit cards to buy from sales. On the strength of those figures, Mintel predicted that the next quarter will show a net repayment of consumer credit. Meanwhile, two thirds said they intended to put money aside for a rainy day, and more than half of the sample said they would want to put money into long-term tax-efficient investments. Mr Paul Hersey, senior researcher, pointed out that youngsters - particularly those in the 15-19 age group - had grown significantly more conservative in their financial outlook over the past few years. He said: 'Three years ago, 15-to-19-year-olds were far more likely to look at borrowing than they are now. Now it's a question of save now and borrow later for them.' However, there were some causes for hope, as a slim majority (48 per cent) agreed with the statement that 'I feel quite confident in the outlook for the UK economy', while 46 per cent disagreed. Only 37 per cent are worried about their long-term financial security. He said: 'People are not going to rush out and spend money. They still remember the rapid hike in interest rates in 1989, and many are still recovering from the extra costs they incurred then, so they are building a cushion for themselves.' The report concluded by saying that long-term optimism might mean that recovery, when it happens, could be 'very fast'. The Election &amp; Recovery?

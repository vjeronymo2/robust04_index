			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Riots sharpen Clinton Bush rivalry PRESIDENT George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, each conscious that the other's campaign was watching closely, walked a fine, and moveable, line yesterday in reacting to the riots in Los Angeles. Mr Bush began the day urging calm and expressing his own deep anguish. A noontime televised statement touched all bases, but it led off with what he called 'frustration over a verdict' and emphasised that the Justice Department would continue a criminal investigation of the police violence case in Los Angeles. By mid-afternoon, the president was in Columbus, Ohio, and there had been a discernible shift in emphasis. He spoke of his 'revulsion and pain' at the street violence, of 'mob brutality' that was 'sickeningly sad'. He did not mention federal action against the acquitted police offers, but said: 'I will keep telling the country that we must stand up against lawlessness and crime wherever it happens .. and what happened last night was purely criminal.' At the same time his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, was telling the travelling press that Mr Clinton's reactions throughout the day had been politically conditioned and were worthy of 'slippery Willie.' He added that the president of the United States would never second guess the verdict of an American jury. The Democrat's first reaction on Tuesday night had been to condemn the trial verdict. Yesterday morning he said the riots had been a reflection of society's failure, a lack of faith in a system that was no longer responsive. But he, too, urged an end to the violence. When Mr Bush announced possible federal prosecution, Mr Clinton said that was the right way to go. With Mr Bush emphasising his involvement in solving the problem, and with a previously arranged trip to California on the presidential schedule next week, Mr Clinton said he was contemplating going to California to see if he could help. At the end of the day, it almost seemed that both had reverted to political type, the president talking up law and order, always a strong Republican issue, Mr Clinton arguing the case for social healing, which he has tried to make his issue this year, and for programmes to assist inner city revitalisation. Bill Schneider, the political expert, pointed out on TV that urban violence tends to polarise American opinion, generally towards the right, where Mr Bush sits. The US public seems to expect a strong response, which a centrist like Mr Clinton may find hard to express. On the other hand, shock at the acquittal of the police officers seems to have been universal, cutting across racial divides. Failure to bring the weight of federal prosecution against the four policemen following their acquittal in the state courts would be widely, and unkindly, noticed. Rev Jesse Jackson, the black activist, attacked the Los Angeles police force, recalling its past history of violence before the Rodney King affair, and recalling that its police chief, Daryl Gates, was close to the president. Mr Jackson himself, never shy of publicity but sensing the need for some leadership, was as active as any yesterday. He conferred with William Barr, the attorney general, and with Mr Clinton. He promised to go to Los Angeles. He was constantly on television.</p>

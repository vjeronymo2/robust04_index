			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Cao Min: "Five-Year Plan for New State </F> Insurance"]    [Text] The government plans to bring in a unified social  insurance system nationwide within the next five years, it was  announced yesterday.    This means all enterprises across the country, regardless of  ownership, will be covered by the same social insurance  standards.    The move is seen as a major plank in the state's bid to form  a modern enterprise system and develop the labour market, said  Labour Ministry spokesman Liu Guanxue.    The current social insurance system covers only state-owned  enterprises and has created a bottleneck in the drive towards a  socialist market economy. The system is too narrow, its  management is weak, and it places too heavy a financial burden  on the government and enterprises, said Liu.    China began to set up its labour insurance system in 1951.  It included pensions, free medical care, and benefits for  industrial injuries and maternity, based on a planned economy.    Only regular workers or staff of state enterprises, units,  and institutions received retirement pensions--75 percent of his  or her wage.    But the market economy has changed social values and the way  enterprises are run and the old insurance system is quite  incompatible with the demands of a freemoving labour force.    The changes in the labour system have enabled most  enterprises to start employing who they want without government  involvement.    But firms remain unable to dismiss redundant personnel under  the old system, said Liu.    The new unified one will help relieve workers' worries and  let them look for new jobs with more confidence.    About 80 million people are covered by pension schemes and  about 18 million retired workers receive the payments.    China first set up unemployment insurance for workers in the  state-owned enterprises in 1986. Last year, about 900,000  people were getting unemployment relief--three times the figure  in 1992.    The Labour Ministry is also to speed up reform of wage and  labour systems in such pilot areas as Shandong and Guangdong  provinces and 10 major cities this year, said ministry officials.</p>

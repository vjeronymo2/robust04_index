			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Murayama acknowledges 'crushing defeat' Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, acknowledged yesterday that the ruling coalition led by his Social Democratic party (SDP) and the Liberal Democratic party (LDP) had suffered a 'crushing defeat' in Sunday's Upper House by-election in Aichi Prefecture. The candidate backed by the government lost heavily to a representative of the opposition parties in the first electoral test since the administration was formed in June. Mr Murayama attributed the setback to a late start to the coalition's campaign, and an inability to differentiate its policies from those of its opponents. 'It is regrettable,' he declared. 'I accept the result humbly and will try again.' Opposition leaders hailed their victory as a mandate to create a new, single political party to fight the next election. 'We will put all our energy into forming a new party,' said Mr Tsutomu Hata, the former prime minister and leading light behind the unity moves. 'The people are investing high hopes that we will persistently pursue reform and conduct responsible politics.' The opposition's candidate, Mr Yuzuru Tsuzuki, a former labour ministry official, won 931,936 votes, easily defeating the governing parties' nominee, Mr Jiro Mizuno, a former United Nations diplomat, who polled 544,637 votes. But a more detailed analysis of the result suggests that the opposition's early euphoria may be misplaced. In fact there was little enthusiasm for either of the two main groupings. Though the government's performance was lamentable, the main beneficiaries were not the opposition but independent candidates. At the last election in 1992, the constituency was evenly divided, returning two members from the present opposition and one from the governing LDP. In that election the LDP and SDP (running separately) secured 42 per cent of the total vote between them, against 44 per cent for the combined vote of today's opposition parties. Coalition support slumped to just 25.1 per cent, but while the opposition was comfortably ahead, its proportion of the vote also fell slightly, to 43 per cent. The big winners were the various independent candidates, one of whom, Mrs Makiko Suehiro, a local television personality, came close to beating Mr Mizuno into third place. Altogether, five other candidates took a remarkable 31.9 per cent of the vote, up from 14 per cent in 1992. This strong performance by independents and parties not aligned with the opposition coalition, combined with the low turnout (at 43 per cent the fourth lowest for the constituency since the second world war) points to a significant degree of voter disillusionment with the main parties. During the campaign, opinion polls suggested that electors were dissatisfied with the chaotic nature of Japanese politics which, in little over a year, has produced no fewer than four changes of government. The same polls detected a degree of cynicism from voters about the seriousness of any party's commitment to political reform, a genuinely popular concept. That cynicism was exacerbated by the fact that both government and opposition asserted with equal vigour throughout the campaign their commitment to reform. Nevertheless, the political runes are undoubtedly more alarming for the SDP and the LDP. Sunday's defeat is likely to accentuate the tensions within the uneasy alliance. But it also makes a general election an even more distant prospect. The two main coalition partners will probably choose to cling to each other more tightly, postponing for as long as possible their appointment with the nation's voters.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- AICHI BY-ELECTION SEPTEMBER 11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                           SEP 94              JUL 92  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- LDP                       544,637 (25.1%)     590,618 (26.1) SDP                       (combined)          357,592 (15.8) Opposition parties        931,936 (43.0)      994,454 (44.0) Others                    691,332 (31.9)      316,242 (14.0) Turnout                   42.9%               47.0%  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

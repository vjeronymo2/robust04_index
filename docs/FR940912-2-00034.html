The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=1 --> Appeal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> The National Security Archive, 5/3/94, LFA&hyph;0365 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> The National Security Archive (NSA) filed an Appeal from a determination issued to it on March 18, 1994 by the Office of Resource Management (ORM), Office of Policy, Planning, and Program Management of the Department of Energy which denied a request for information it had filed under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The request sought information concerning the export of 4.3 tons of heavy water from the U.S. to Israel in 1963. The ORM stated that it did not possess any responsive documents, and the Appeal challenged the adequacy of the search. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that NSA's FOIA request may not have been subjected to a search sufficiently thorough and conscientious to meet the established standard of reasonableness. Accordingly, the Appeal was granted and remanded to the FOI Branch for further action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=74 g=1 f=3 --> Requests for Exception  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Carson Petroleum Co., 5/4/94, LEE&hyph;0055 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Carson Petroleum Co. (Carson) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering Carson's request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a gross inequity or serious hardship. On March 10, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. No Notice of Objection to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed within the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Carson's Application for Exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Dick's Oil Co., 5/3/94, LEE&hyph;0067 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Dick's Oil Co. filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this request, the DOE found that the firm was not suffering gross inequity or serious hardship. Accordingly, exception relief was denied. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Friendly Service Stations, Inc., 5/3/94, LEE&hyph;0070 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Friendly Service Stations, Inc. (Friendly) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;82B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' Friendly showed that it had been forced by financial difficulties to reduce its staff to such an extent that complying with the reporting requirement would impose an inordinate burden on the firm. DOE therefore determined that exception relief should be granted. Friendly hopes that its current difficulties will prove temporary. The exception relief granted will therefore be effective for a period of nineteen months, ending April 30, 1995. If Friendly wishes to receive continued exemption from filing requirements after that time, it must then reapply with the DOE. Accordingly, the Application was granted in part. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Raymer Oil Company, 5/3/94, LEE&hyph;0095 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Raymer Oil Company (Raymer) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this request, the DOE found that the firm was not suffering gross inequity or serious hardship. On March 24, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. No Notice of Objections to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE within the prescribed time period. Therefore, the DOE issued the Proposed Decision and Order in final form, denying Raymer's Application for Exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=3 --> Rockford Grain Growers, 5/4/94, LEE&hyph;0064 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Rockford Grain Growers (Rockford) filed an Application for Exception from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) requirement that it file Form EIA&hyph;782B, the ``Resellers'/Retailers' Monthly Petroleum Product Sales Report.'' In considering this request, the DOE found that the firm was not experiencing a serious hardship, gross inequity, or unfair distribution of burdens arising from this filing requirement. On February 10, 1994, the DOE issued a Proposed Decision and Order determining that the exception request should be denied. A Notice of Objections (Objections) to the Proposed Decision and Order was filed at the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the DOE on March 14, 1994. In the Objections, Rockford submitted additional information which demonstrated that the firm's precarious financial situation was exacerbated by the requirement to file EIA&hyph;782B. Since Rockford demonstrated in its Objections that it was experiencing an unfair distribution of burdens, the DOE issued a Decision and Order, granting Rockford's Application for Exception. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

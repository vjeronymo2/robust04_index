			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GAMBLING ON FOREIGN TRADE  </P> <P> President Bush has used welcome moderation and careful targeting in putting  together a list of alleged unfair trading practices under the so-called Super  301 provisions of the new trade law adopted last year. He has, in other words,  made the best of a law that could, if not used with great care, trigger trade  wars.  </P> <P> Japan's angry and stubborn response will not help matters, because it once  again fails to face up to the extensive protectionism, overt and covert, that  operates in Japanese markets and also fails to recognize that Bush's findings  under the new law merely set the stage for negotiations.  </P> <P> The other two nations cited, India and Brazil, pose delicate problems, for many  of the protections they have prolonged are similar to those that the United  States itself used when it was seeking to develop its own industrial base. But  the citation of those two nations also provides an opportunity for talks that  can underscore the importance, in the modern world, of unencumbered trade for  developing as well as fully industrialized nations. In the late 20th Century,  development is not possible without a vigorous global trade and an open door to  private investments. Furthermore, the citations could also encourage a more  constructive response from the two nations in the new round of negotiation on  the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). Both India and Brazil have  obstructed expansion of GATT.  </P> <P> For the United States, the 1988 omnibus trade law also poses a problem because  of the widespread recognition that the Super 301 provisions almost certainly  violate GATT rules. Under the American law, the President is required to cite  nations suspected of unfair trading practices and may impose sanctions if the  problems are not corrected after 18 months of negotiations. That sort of  unilateral action runs counter to the establishment of multilateral GATT  arrangements.  </P> <P> Japan's initial rejection of negotiations is disappointing. The American  Administration had understood the sensitivity of Japan about making the list,  but there was no way that Japan could be kept from the list. The imbalance in  U.S.-Japanese trade accounts for almost half of the staggering U.S. trade  deficit. Congress has been increasing its demands for action targeted on Japan  because of the difficulties American exporters have had penetrating the  Japanese market. The Administration could have drafted a list going beyond the  supercomputers, satellites and wood products that were cited. The Japanese will  be well advised to understand that, and to accept Bush's short list as a  cordial invitation to meaningful talks, a useful opportunity for both nations.  </P></p>

Ober, through his counsel David S. Baron of the Arizona Center for Law in the Public Interest (hereafter ``ACLPI''). The lawsuit concerns EPA's alleged failure to perform a nondiscretionary duty with respect to promulgating a PM&hyph;10 final implementation plan (``FIP'') for the Phoenix, Arizona Planning Area. The proposed settlement agreement provides that EPA shall sign a Notice of Final Rulemaking (``NFRM'' regarding the moderate nonattainment area PM&hyph;10 State implementation plan (``SIP'') submitted by the State of Arizona for the Phoenix Planning Area, respecting which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM'') was published at 59 FR 38402 (July 28, 1994), no later than March 1, 1995. If final rulemaking action by EPA results in disapproval of the SIP, in whole or in part, EPA would agree to sign a NFRM promulgating a FIP that corrects the disapproved portions of the SIP no later than March 1, 1996, unless prior to that date EPA has fully approved a SIP revision that corrects the deficiency that formed the basis for the disapproval action. If EPA takes final rulemaking action approving the SIP, in whole or in part, the parties will file a joint motion to stay litigation in the district court pending the outcome of appellate review. Additionally, it after appellate review EPA's approval is vacated, the parties will file a joint motion to lift the stay, and plaintiffs would be free to pursue litigation of their original FIP claims without being required to file an addtional 60-day notice of intent to sue or a new complaint. If, however, EPA is upheld on appellate review, plaintiffs shall, within 30 days, file a motion to dismiss or withdraw their complaint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For a period of thirty [30] days following the date of publication of this notice, the Agency will receive written comments relating to the settlement agreement. EPA or the Department of Justice may withhold or withdraw consent to the proposed settlement agreement in the comments disclose facts or circumstances that indicate that such consent is inappropriate, improper, inadequate, or inconsistent with the requirements of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the settlement agreement are available from Phyllis Cochran, Air and Radiation Division (2344), Office of General Counsel, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, D.C. 20460, (202) 260&hyph;7606. Written comments should be sent to Michael A. Prosper at the above address and must be submitted on or before January 18, 1995.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: December 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </ACTION> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jean C.

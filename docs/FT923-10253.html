			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Government's plans lift Nikkei by 3 per cent THE Japanese government's decision to bring forward its plans to stimulate the economy, together with Wednesday's rise in overseas markets, lifted sentiment in Tokyo stocks yesterday, and the Nikkei average rallied 3 per cent on short-covering and arbitrage-linked buying, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average, which registered a six-year low the previous day, rebounded 459.65 to 15,555.60. The index opened at the day's low of 15,152.35 and rose as high as 15,586.31 in the afternoon. Volume, however, decreased to 220m shares from 259m. Traders said institutions remained on the sidelines and activity centred on buy-backs of shares sold on Wednesday. Rises outnumbered declines by 656 to 319, with 125 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks recovered 22.55 to 1,193.48, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased a slight 0.67 to 946.85. The government's plan to implement its economic stimulus package in August, one month early, encouraged the market. Plans to bolster property prices by government purchases of land for public works projects sparked buying in bank and real estate issues. Traders were relieved that the Nikkei found support at the 15,000 level. However, Mr Takatoshi Okuyama at Daiwa Securities cautioned that the rise was technical, and that the market had yet to hit the bottom. 'We have not seen real demand from investors coming in,' he said. Banks gained ground on short-covering as the market hoped that the government's efforts to stop asset deflation would lighten the burden of bad loans at banks. Industrial Bank of Japan advanced Y80 to Y1,710 and Mitsubishi Bank Y100 to Y1,740. Property shares also improved, Daikyo moving forward Y21 to Y520 and Sato Kogyo Y30 to Y610. Speculative theme stocks were actively traded. Meiji Milk Products continued to head the active stocks list and regained Y29 to Y860, while Okamoto Industries put on Y10 to Y1,030. High-technology blue chips, which have been sold on fears of lower earnings, showed only a slightly firmer tendency as some investors remained cautious. Toshiba edged ahead Y3 to Y621 and Sony Y10 to Y3,810, but NEC dipped Y3 to Y762 and Fujitsu Y3 to Y567 on continuing fears about profits. In Osaka, the OSE average picked up 226.13 to 17,362.52 in volume of 13.7m shares. Roundup MOST Pacific Rim markets followed Tokyo higher. HONG KONG reversed early gains after Sino-British talks on the financing of the new airport failed. The Hang Seng index finished 27.46 down at 5,829.83 but after an intraday low of 5,811.21. Turnover came to HKDollars 2.1bn. Property issues were moderately lower, with Hong Kong Land off 20 cents at HKDollars 13.90. AUSTRALIA gained ground in spite of the release of some disappointing economic data showing a wider than expected balance of payments deficit. The All Ordinaries index finished 8.7 ahead at 1,621.0 following turnover of ADollars 288.2m. North Flinders Mines rose 40 cents, or some 10 per cent, to ADollars 4.25 on news that reserves at one of its sites were double previous estimates. NEW ZEALAND was led lower by Fletcher Challenge, which saw its shares lose 22 cents to NZDollars 14.31 on rumours of a rights issue. The NZSE-40 index slipped 14.31 to 1,514.17 in turnover of NZDollars 29.86m. SINGAPORE advanced amid foreign institutional demand for selected blue chips. The Straits Times Industrial index climbed 19.43, or 1.4 per cent, to 1,449.02. Banks rose on expectations of good half-year results being reported shortly. KARACHI continued its downward slide on the last trading day of the week, writes Farhan Bokhari. The KSE-100 index fell 29.37 to 1,311.30, now down 6.4 per cent since last Sunday. Concern about profitability in the textile sector and a setback in the government's plans to sell off Pakistan's largest gas company weighed on the market. TAIWAN extended early gains to finish sharply higher. The weighted index closed 82.21 up at 4,029.53 in moderate turnover of TDollars 21.55bn. MANILA rose afresh in active trading. The composite index added 10.41 at 1,495.72 in combined turnover of 227m pesos. PLDT gained 30 pesos to 1,100 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR followed other markets higher. The composite index put on 7.85 to 598.56. Rises led falls by 125 to 110 after 53.5m share volume. BOMBAY's BSE index dropped 56.42, or 2.1 per cent, to 2,698.83 on the last day of the account on fears of high carry-over charges.</p>

Yeltsin's recent  visit to the republic remains the central theme which is being  actively discussed both in the press and at an everyday level.  And whereas the set of economic agreements has not inspired any  particularly emotional assessments, the agreement designed to  regulate the presence of the Russian military contingent on  Georgian territory has not been spared that fate. It was that  fact which predetermined Russia's decision to sign a full 25  documents with the leadership of the one of the most unstable  states in the Commonwealth. And this was the main theme of the  head of the state's traditional radio interview.    "The presence of foreign troops on the country's territory  is  not a source of pleasure to anyone," E. Shevardnadze stated.  "Georgia, which wants to create its own armed forces, has  neither the corresponding base nor the armaments. The  functioning of the internal troops and the police is being held  up by this problem. We have been forced to agree to compromises  in order to resolve these questions and obtain the corresponding  aid from Russia."    There has been no reaction from the Georgian parliament yet.  Parliamentarians preferred to leave the satisfaction of setting  Shevardnadze another obstacle till later -- until the next  session -- so as first to analyze the agreements which have been  reached and then be better prepared for the general battle ahead.    Meanwhile, on 8 February the head of state signed an edict  on  the creation of working groups for the preparation of the state  symbols of the Republic of Georgia and also for the drafting of  an anti-crisis program and the main principles and predictable  parameters of economic and social development for 1994-1995.    Yesterday Shevardnadze paid an urgent visit to Western  Georgia where two passenger trains had collided near the village  of Kharagauli 200 km from Tbilisi. According to preliminary  information three people were killed.</p>

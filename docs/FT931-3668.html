			<p>930315 FT  15 MAR 93 / Korea central bank gets new governor SOUTH KOREA'S new government has completed its appointment of senior economic officials by naming a new central bank governor. Mr Kim Myung-ko, the head of the central bank's Office of Bank Supervision, will replace Mr Cho Soon, who was forced to resign at the weekend after serving only a year of his four-year term as the Bank of Korea governor. Mr Cho repeatedly challenged the government last year, which probably contributed to his departure. He is a strong advocate of financial liberalisation and greater autonomy for the BOK. His removal reflects the central bank's lack of independence from political interference. The BOK staff held a protest meeting after Mr Cho's resignation was announced. His main achievement at the BOK was to persuade the government to adopt a tight monetary policy to cool the overheated economy. Inflation slowed to 4.5 per cent last year from 9.3 per cent in 1991. But he was criticised by business for causing an economic slowdown, leading to a record number of bankruptcies and falling profits. When the government recently decided to revive growth by cutting key lending rates, Mr Cho at first opposed the step. He relented after the government agreed in return to deregulate most interest rates, a key step in financial liberalisation. The government is now debating whether more stimulative measures are needed to achieve its target of at least 6 per cent GNP growth this year against 4.5 per cent in 1992. Mr Kim said his priority as BOK governor would be to stabilise the currency.</p>

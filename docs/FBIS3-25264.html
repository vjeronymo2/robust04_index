This forms part of measures by  government to restore law and order to the areas engaged in  ethnic conflict which has resulted in loss of lives and  property. In a statement to Parliament today, the minister of  interior, Colonel Osei-Wusu, reiterated government's  determination to maintain peace in affected areas.    [Begin recording] While affirming its commitment to the  resolution of the conflict through dialogue and negotiation,  government's immediate concern is to enforce a cessation of  hostilities and to restore order to enable people go about their  day to day business. Mr. Speaker, the president, having  considered the grave dimension that the communal violence has  taken, has -- in exercise of the powers conferred on him under  Clause 1 of Article 31 of the Constitution -- declared a state  of emergency in the following areas of the Northern Region:    1. Tamale Municipality;    2. Saboba Chereponi District    3. Yendi District    4. Zabzugu Tatali District,    5. Nanumba District    6. Gushiago Karaga District, and    7. East Gonja District.    Mr. Speaker, by Clause 3 of Article 31, Parliament is  required to decide whether the proclamation of state of  emergency should remain in force or be revoked. The president  is of the considered view that the situation requires the  declaration of state of emergency and I call upon Parliament to  approve the proclamation. [end recording]</p>

			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): High hopes sag as locals remain wary - Tokyo / Emiko Terazono reflects on a year that started well but fell away in the second half The Kabuto shrine in front of the Tokyo Stock Exchange has had another bad year. During the late 1980s, the offering box was frequently full of Y10,000 notes. But this year, as with the three before it, Y50 and Y100 coins have been more the norm. The god of investment does not really deserve such unkind treatment. Investors in 1994 at least saw the Nikkei average of 225 shares gain more than 10 per cent in local currency terms. In dollar terms, the index rose more than 20 per cent because of the yen's appreciation against the US currency. It is, however, hard to ignore the fact that the Tokyo stock market failed to reach the heights predicted by many pundits at the start of the year. At that time, overseas fund managers hoped that an easing of government regulation over industries, active corporate restructuring, and the easing of short-term interest rates by the Bank of Japan would lift the economy and, consequently, boost share prices. Foreign funds - mainly US and European - bought a record Y3,200bn in net terms during the January-March quarter. But Japanese investors did not follow suit and share prices, which had risen 24 per cent in the first half, sagged after peaking in June. Many US and European fund managers blamed the sluggish second half on this conspicuous lack of stock-buying by the Japanese. But they were constrained by continuing problems with their balance sheets and profit/loss statements. Banks, which needed to offset their losses on bad loan write-offs, sold their long-term holdings to realise profits while manufacturing companies also liquidated their securities portfolios to shore-up earnings. Life assurers, the leading institutional investors, found their ability to put money into risky investments (such as shares) limited by the falls in value of their existing investment portfolios. Their unrealised capital gains provided a safety margin, allowing them to take some risks, but this safety margin contracted as the market dropped. Indeed, the unrealised gains of the top 18 life assurance companies totalled just Y12,500bn last year, down 72 per cent from the peak in 1988. Most retail investors have been absent from the stock market since the Nikkei average started its tumble in 1990. Some analysts had hoped that a rally led by private investors - similar to that of the UK and US a few years ago - would pull the market out of its slump, but they have stuck to safe bank deposits. Although the mood has improved since last month's fall in the Nikkei to a nine-month low - triggered by the Y600bn privatisation of Japan Tobacco and Sony having to write off losses arising from its entertainment business - fund managers at leading life assurance companies and banks remain cautious over equity investments. And while the likelihood of a gradual economic recovery, a double-digit rise in corporate profits and low inflation point to a case for buying Japan, companies' balance sheet problems will continue to act as a drag on their ability to take investment risks. While a rise in corporate profits could stem the degree of profit-taking selling by Japanese companies, most analysts believe it could take until the latter part of the year for banks and life assurers to resume buying shares. The compelling question is what overseas investors intend to do in 1995. Yuichi Matsushita, an analyst at Nikko Securities, points out that although this year's performance could have left some foreign fund managers less than impressed, Japan - as the last major world economy to recover from recession  -would seem to offer favourable returns with only a low degree of risk. Jason James, strategist at James Capel in Tokyo, says overseas funds remain underweight in Japanese shares. Average weightings in Japan for UK pension funds, for instance, were only 5.1 per cent at the end of September, while a neutral weighting within the overall overseas equity component would have been around 6.3 per cent. James estimates that the underlying rate of net buying by foreign fund managers could be around Y2,000bn next year. He argues that while they may not increase Japanese weightings further, it is unlikely they will fail to buy Japanese shares in 1995.</p>

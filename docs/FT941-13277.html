			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Triton Europe hit by lower Brent oil prices The combination of lower Brent oil prices and a decline in French production were blamed by Triton Europe for a swing from profits of Pounds 18,000 to pre-tax losses of Pounds 2.76m for the half year to November 30. Turnover fell to Pounds 6.94m (Pounds 9.37m). Interest income rose to Pounds 166,000 (Pounds 138,000) but foreign exchange gains fell to Pounds 108,000 (Pounds 868,000). Losses worked through at 2.45p (earnings 0.07p). Cash and short term investments amounted to Pounds 7.14m, equal to 8.7p per share. Earlier this month Triton Energy, the independent US oil and gas company, made an agreed offer to acquire the minority interests in the company - it currently holds a 59.47 per cent stake.</p>

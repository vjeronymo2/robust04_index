			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals The muted response of the stock market to President Clinton's healthcare proposals reflects the absence of either hard detail or nasty shocks. Drug companies should gain volume sales as the healthcare net is widened. The trade-off is lower prices as the discounts demanded by the government's Medicare programme for the elderly increase, and power concentrates in the hands of big private sector buyers. The overall impact is likely to be negative, but investors were anticipating as much. The extent of the damage will not be clear until the process of political horse-trading has come to an end. True, drugs companies have escaped direct price controls. But prices paid by big buyers of healthcare are already falling as market forces take hold. By proposing to extend the role of such buying groups, President Clinton is simply accelerating the trend. Capping the rate of growth in health insurance premiums may anyway have much the same effect as direct controls, since insurers will have more of an incentive to restrict the cost of claims. Making all employers bear at least 80 per cent of healthcare costs will equally increase the number of parties with an interest in keeping drugs prices down. The range of responses by drugs companies to such change, in the US and elsewhere, suggests a degree of confusion. Glaxo believes that innovative research and good marketing will suffice. Wellcome is developing its position in over-the-counter medicines, while others are moving into low-cost generic drugs. Merck's acquisition of Medco, the postal drugs distributor, is a bold attempt at vertical integration. Not all the options will turn out to be correct.</p>

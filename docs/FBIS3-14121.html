			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interviews with Islamic writer Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah and </F> former Egyptian Ambassador to Algeria Husayn Amin by Tal'at  al-Mughrabi in Cairo; date not given]    [Text] [Al-Mughrabi] What are the similarities between  Egypt's and Algeria's Islamic fundamentalism?    ['Amarah] The term fundamentalism, as used in the Western  sense, has a negative connotation. In the Islamic and Arabic  sense, fundamentalists are groups that advocate jihad and  revival and they are not, as is the case in the West,  ungrateful, reactionary, and imitative. The aspects that all  Islamic movements in the whole Islamic world have in common are  that they have an Islamic source [al-marji'iyah al-islamiyah]  and form an alternative to Western secularism and materialism.  They seek to establish a totally Islamic society and a state  committed to the Islamic shari'ah. However, they can be  distinguished from one another and their programs vary according  to their own national situations and the challenges confronting  them. The Islamic movement in Egypt is not newly-formed, as is  the case in Algeria.    [Al-Mughrabi] Are there any differences between the two  movements?    ['Amarah] The Muslim Brotherhood constitutes the major  Islamic movement in Egypt. It is the mother movement of all  Islamic movements worldwide. In Egypt there are a group of  ulema, thinkers, and innovative and creative revivalists who are  involved in the Islamic cultural plan. Egyptian society does  not accept large-scale violence. In Algeria, the Islamic  movement is new and is poor in cadres. The Algerian movement  represents a grouping of trends and is a front in the real sense  of the word. Also, the challenges of Westernization and the  francophonists in Algeria are more intense in view of the  influence of French colonization.    [Al-Mughrabi] Are there contacts and coordination between  the  two movements?    ['Amarah] No. The Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] in Algeria  is purely Algerian and emanated from Algeria. The Algerian  group that is methodologically linked to the Muslim Brotherhood  is "Hamas" [The Algerian Islamic Society Movement].    [Al-Mughrabi] How would you evaluate the authorities'  relationship with each group?    ['Amarah] The present regime in Algeria derives from an  illegal coup against the Algerian nation's choice. This is not  the case in Egypt. Also, violence in Algeria is comprehensive  and severe, whereas in Egypt a limited number commit acts of  violence, although the information media exaggerate them.  Violence in Egypt meets violence from a sector of the state,  but not all the state supports violence and not all the Islamic  movement supports violence.    [Al-Mughrabi] What is the dilemma of the Islamic movements  in  Egypt and Algeria?    ['Amarah] The Islamic movement in Algeria will inevitably  triumph because all the people support it and the Algerian  regime is completely impotent. The situation in Egypt is  different. The Egyptian regime's resources are much greater  than those of the Algerian one. However, the red lines that the  outside world draws against any change in favor of Islam in  Egypt are much clearer in view of Egypt's role and influence.  Moreover, the Islamic movement in Egypt is not facing a  dilemma. The dilemma in Egypt lies in the absence of secular  parties among the masses. My conviction is that the Islamic  trend in Egypt is not in a hurry to take power; its present goal  is to have an opportunity to act legally, and this would lessen  the violence that is distorting the image of the Islamic trend.    [Al-Mughrabi] How long will the confrontation with the  ruling  regime continue?    ['Amarah] It will continue as long as the regime prevents  the  Islamic trend from exercising lawful and legal rights in  accordance with the democratic rules and as long as it refuses  to yield power, particularly if the masses elect the Islamic  trend. If the regimes in Egypt and Algeria agree to honest  elections and provide an opportunity for all diverse ideological  trends, the confrontation will come to an end and violence will  decline.    [Al-Mughrabi) Do you really expect either of the movements  to  take power?    ['Amarah] That the Islamic trend is fated to take power in  all Islamic countries is inescapable.    [Al-Mughrabi] What are the similarities between Egypt's and  Algeria's Islamic fundamentalism?    [Amin] These two phenomena have an identical socioeconomic  background particularly in the obvious features of unemployment,  housing shortages, slums, corruption, high cost of living, and  inflation. Another similarity lies in the just demand of both  Islamic streams to establish a government that will apply  Islamic shari'ah.    [Al-Mughrabi] Are there any differences between the two  movements?    [Amin] There is a difference that results from Algeria's  history and its bitter struggle against French colonialism. In  that struggle Algeria had to raise the banner of Islam, not the  banner of Algerian or pan-Arab nationalism, in order to secure  the loyalty of the Berbers, who comprise more than 30 percent of  the population. Consequently Algeria's Islamic appeal began  before its Egyptian counterpart. Another difference is the  topography of the land. Unlike Egypt, Algeria has hilly terrain  that facilitates resistance and jihad operations, and subsequent  escape. The third difference is that Algerians lack proficiency  in the Arabic language because of French colonialism. As a  result, an ordinary member of any Islamic group in Egypt knows  more about Islam than the FIS leaders themselves. I realized  this during a 3-hour meeting with Abbasi Madani. A third  difference is the Algerians' hot temper, resulting no doubt from  their long struggle against colonialism. This quality is  evident in the FIS terrorists' actions against the government.    [Al-Mughrabi] Are there contacts and coordination between  the  two movements?    [Amin] Certainly there are. When I was ambassador in Algeria  I knew perfectly well that contacts were going on and that  dozens of FIS members were constantly traveling to Egypt on  commercial or educational pretexts. Members of Egypt's Islamic  groups were doing the same thing, and the Egyptian intelligence  services were aware of that. When I noticed that these contacts  were going too far, I proposed restoration of visa requirements  for travel between the two countries.    [Al-Mughrabi] How would you evaluate the authorities'  relationship with each group?    [Amin] Just as the two Islamic groups communicate and  coordinate with each other, the Egyptian and Algerian  Governments are also coordinating their stands. I believe that  the two regimes are very wrong to handle this issue from the  security angle alone. This method is fruitless, especially as  these groups do not value life very highly and eagerly seek  martyrdom in order to go to paradise. This is why I believe  terrorist actions will continue.    [Al-Mughrabi] What is the dilemma of the Islamic movements  in  Egypt and Algeria?    [Amin] Algeria has no Christian minority like Egypt. It does  not have a problem similar to the Egyptian Christians' refusal  to be governed according to shari'ah. The real dilemma in both  countries is the existence of an intellectual class that rejects  Islamic rule. If the Islamists take power, the intellectuals  will emigrate. Algerian intellectuals began to leave the country  after the Islamists won the local elections in 1990.    [Al-Mughrabi] How long will the confrontation with the  ruling  regime continue?    [Amin] It will continue until either the regime or the  Islamic trend is defeated.    [Al-Mughrabi] Do you really expect either of the two  movements to take power?    [Amin] This is more likely to happen in Algeria than in  Egypt, particularly as [Algerian President Lamine] Zeroual has  begun reconciliation moves. In Egypt the terror will last for  many more years.</p>

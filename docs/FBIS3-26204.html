Xiao Bin, Liao Yiwu and Ding Junze were recently released by  local intermediate people's courts, sources here said today.    Xiao Bin, 46, was released on parole. He was a worker at an  aluminum window factory in Dalian city, Liaoning Province,  before he was arrested.    In July 1989 he was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment by  the Dalian Intermediate People's Court for inciting disturbance  in the June 1989 anti-government riot in Beijing.    On December 11, 1991, the Chaoyang City Intermediate  People's  Court reduced his prison term by six months because of his  penitence. On February 2 this year, the Chaoyang City  Intermediate People's Court decided to grant Xiao parole because  of his good behavior in prison over the years. Xiao expressed  gratitude for the kind treatment and regretted over his crimes.    Liao Yiwu, 34, was an employee at the People's Cultural  Center in Fuling city, Sichuan Province. In January 1990, the  Chongqing City Intermediate People's Court sentenced Liao to  four years in jail from March 16, 1990 to March 15, 1994 for his  crimes in anti-government activities.    On January 31 this year, the Dachuan City Intermediate  People's Court decided to release him before expiry of his  sentence because of his penitence and good behavior in jail.    Ding Junze, formerly a teacher at Shanxi University, was  sentenced by the Taiyuan City Intermediate People's Court on  June 25, 1990 to 12 years' imprisonment for inciting  anti-government activities in June 1989.    Ding, 52, now suffers from heart disease and cervical  vertebra disease, and on February 2 this year, the court decided  to free him on bail for medical treatment.</p>

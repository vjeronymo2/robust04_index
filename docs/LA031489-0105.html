			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BANOWSKY WILL PAY $750,000 IN STOCK TIP CASE  </P> <P> A leading Los Angeles businessman and educator confirmed Monday that he has  agreed to settle civil charges for initiating widespread insider trading in the  stock of Thrifty Corp. in 1986.  </P> <P> William S. Banowsky, a former president of Pepperdine University and one-time  Republican prospect for governor, said he will pay $750,000 in fines and  penalties to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the settlement.  </P> <P> The settlement, which is expected to be finalized and made public soon, is the  result of a nearly three-year investigation by the SEC regional office in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Didn't Buy Stock Himself  </P> <P> Banowsky, 53, who is also a former president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of  Commerce and two-time president of the University of Oklahoma, did not buy  Thrifty stock himself and did not profit personally, according to Banowsky's  lawyer, James W. Mercer.  </P> <P> But, while serving on Thrifty's board of directors, he violated securities laws  by disclosing confidential information related to the pending acquisition to  several people, including relatives, said two sources close to the  investigation.  </P> <P> The people he told informed others, and a total of 18 traded on the  information. They made $450,000 in profits by purchasing Thrifty stock during  the week before its acquisition was announced and the price of the shares rose,  according to the sources who spoke on the condition that their names be  withheld.  </P> <P> The relatives informed by Banowsky "just killed this guy. They told everybody,"  said one person close to the investigation. "He figured they'd buy a few shares  for themselves and that would be it."  </P> <P> Another source said that Banowsky was shocked by the extensive trading touched  off by his disclosure and that he has cooperated fully with the SEC  investigation.  </P> <P> The settlement ends the SEC's investigation into all trading related to  Banowsky's disclosure, and no criminal charges will be filed, said one of the  sources.  </P> <P> However, the SEC and the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles are conducting a  further investigation into other insider trading in Thrifty stock during the  same period, according to two sources.  </P> <P> Banowsky was a board member of the Los Angeles-based drugstore and sporting  goods chain in May, 1986, when it was acquired by Pacific Lighting, the parent  of Southern California Gas. The company is now called Pacific Enterprises, and  Thrifty is a wholly owned subsidiary.  </P> <P> The sources said Banowsky tipped off his relatives and friends after learning  that a special meeting of the company's board of directors was likely to be  called. Other directors at the time said in interviews that they had been  cautioned to keep the upcoming meeting secret.  </P> <P> The relatives and others who profited are contributing their trading profits to  the settlement cost, one source said.  </P> <P> Irving M. Einhorn, the SEC administrator here, declined to comment.  </P> <P> Banowsky is executive vice president of National Medical Enterprises, a  nationwide health-care company based in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In response to Times inquiries, he said Monday: "Three years ago in the space  of a single hour I made a mistake in judgment. It has caused a lot of grief for  me and others. I sincerely regret it. I have cooperated fully with the SEC  staff to resolve it. I am hoping that this gets it behind me."  </P> <P> He declined to elaborate or identify to whom he passed the inside information.  </P> <P> The case is similar to the last big insider trading case brought by the SEC in  Los Angeles. In a civil lawsuit filed last April, Carl N. Karcher, chairman and  founder of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain, and 14 members of his family were  accused of insider trading in the company's stock.  </P> <P> Six defendants in the civil lawsuit against the Karchers agreed last month to  pay fines and penalties to settle the case. A seventh was found guilty of  insider trading in a civil case. Criminal charges of insider trading were filed  last month against Alvin A. DeShano, the accounting director for the chain and  the only non-family member involved. He has pleaded innocent.  </P> <P> The SEC office here has limited resources and is unable to bring a large number  of insider trading cases. As a result, officials have said in the past, the  office tries to target cases likely to attract publicity in order to achieve  the greatest deterrence possible.  </P> <P> Banowsky, a native of Abilene, Tex., has been a prominent figure in Los Angeles  since he became president of Pepperdine in 1971 at age 35.  </P> <P> During seven years in the post, the Church of Christ preacher raised $40  million for the expansion of the university to its present campus in Malibu and  was widely hailed for improving its academic standing.  </P> <P> He also became active in conservative Republican politics, serving as a  fund-raiser for Ronald Reagan when he was governor of California. Reagan  appointed Banowsky Republican national committeeman.  </P> <P> In 1973, Banowsky was considered briefly as a Republican candidate to replace  Reagan. He also was a prospect for the U.S. Senate.  </P> <P> In 1978, he became president of the University of Oklahoma. He left that post  in 1982 to become president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, but  resigned after six weeks and returned to the University of Oklahoma.  </P> <P> In 1985, he became president of Gaylord Broadcasting Co. in Dallas and later  served as head of the Texas effort to win a $5-billion federal atom-smasher  project. In October, 1988, he joined National Medical Enterprises as an  executive vice president. He had been an outside director of the health-care  giant since 1977.  </P> <P> Banowsky was an outside director of Thrifty in May, 1986, when the company was  approached about a friendly takeover by Pacific Lighting. The deal was  negotiated in two weeks of highly secret meetings between executives of the two  companies, but it required approval by the boards of both.  </P> <P> Thrifty's board was not told of the talks. However, on May 21, Banowsky was  informed by the company's chairman that he might have to attend a special board  meeting.  </P> <P> According to his SEC agreement, Banowsky suggested to several people, including  some of his relatives, that they consider buying Thrifty stock.  </P> <P> One of the sources said Banowsky was in Washington when he was alerted about  the possibility of a board meeting, and he disclosed the confidential  information in several telephone calls to friends and relatives in Dallas.  </P> <P> Mercer, Banowsky's lawyer, said his client did not know the specific purpose of  the meeting, but there had been rumors of a possible Thrifty merger. The deal  was announced on May 28.  </P> <P> While Banowsky did not buy any stock or make any money, securities laws make  him liable for profits earned on all trades based on information he provided  illegally. The $750,000 represents profits of $450,000 earned by others on the  trades, plus penalties and fines. The money is coming from Banowsky as well as  the people who made the trades, according to one source.  </P></p>

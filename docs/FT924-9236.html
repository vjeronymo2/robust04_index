			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / AT&amp;T plugs into a new market: Martin Dickson explains why the industry giant wants to spend Dollars 3.8bn for a 33% stake in the largest cellular telephone company in the US 'The communications market is a boiling sea of change,' declared Mr Robert Allen, the undemonstrative chairman of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, in a recent speech. On Wednesday he added a tidal wave of his own with the announcement that AT&amp;T is negotiating to spend Dollars 3.8bn (Pounds 2.3bn) on a 33 per cent stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the largest cellular telephone company in the US. Part of the stake would come from the purchase of British Telecom's 22 per cent stake in McCaw for Dollars 1.8bn. The proposed deal, likely to be sealed in the first half of next year, would also give AT&amp;T the option of eventually taking voting control of McCaw, a Seattle-based company which has grown rapidly from humble origins, thanks to the entrepreneurial spirit and vision of its chairman, the youthful Mr Craig McCaw. If the alliance goes ahead it will represent a dramatic plunge by AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance telecommunications company in the US, into the rapidly growing cellular telephone market, and will bring it for the first time into competition with the so-called 'Baby Bells'. These seven regional telephone companies, which are major players in the cellular sector, were spun off from AT&amp;T in 1984 when AT&amp;T, affectionately known as 'Ma Bell', was dismembered in an anti-trust court settlement. The rump of AT&amp;T was left to fight it out against competition in the long-distance and international markets and equipment manufacturing. The Baby Bells, with their local monopolies, were barred by the courts from entering the long-distance, information or manufacturing businesses. However, over the past eight years, this neat structure has been gradually eroding, thanks to technological, competitive and political change. The emergence of wireless communication, and cellular in particular, has started to reduce the effectiveness of the Baby Bells' monopoly of local telephone wires. So too has the growth of entrepreneurial companies using new fibre optic circuits to link local business customers directly to long-distance providers. The Baby Bells, for their part, have been trying to get the 1984 restrictions on their activities removed, but so far have only succeeded in parts of the information services industry. The McCaw deal would erode the wobbly structure even further. 'This is a major, major move in terms of the destabilisation that is going on,' says Mr Victor Schnee of New Jersey-based Probe Research. As such it could run into opposition from the Baby Bells, even though Mr Allen insists there are no legal or regulatory impediments to a deal going through. 'Is this a wireless approach to putting the Bell system back together again?' asks Mr Al Boschulte, head of cellular operations at Nynex, one of the seven babies. The Modified Final Judgment, the court agreement which broke up the old AT&amp;T, does not prevent AT&amp;T going into the local telecommunications business, as long as it does not buy assets of the Baby Bells. Nor does the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the industry, seem likely to object to any transfer of licences involved. Opponents could try to raise anti-trust objections with the Justice Department, either on the grounds that this is an alliance between the two leading service providers in their respective markets, or because AT&amp;T, which invented cellular technology, is a leading supplier of cellular equipment. The laissez-faire Bush administration might give these arguments short shrift. But the anti-trust policies of the incoming Clinton team are not known. An alternative tactic for the Baby Bells might be to use the McCaw deal as ammunition before the courts and in Congress for them to be allowed to enter the long-distance and equipment manufacturing businesses. Whatever the upshot, analysts regard the AT&amp;T-McCaw pact as favourable for both parties. Wireless communications is the fastest-growing area of the US telecommunication industry, expand-ing at a rate of 30 to 40 per cent a year, in spite of the recession. The sector was established in the early 1980s as a patchwork of local licensees and has been consolidating ever since. McCaw has been one of the most aggressive acquirers, driven by its chairman's vision of creating a 'seamless national wireless network' to allow cellular subscribers to communicate easily with other parties anywhere in the US. Mr McCaw has long argued that the wireless revolution will eventually allow individuals to have their own portable personal, telecommunications numbers, allowing phone, fax, video and handwritten communications wherever they are. AT&amp;T evidently shares this view. The proposed alliance will give them a strong position to advance this revolution and profit by it. For McCaw, which has been financially stretched by takeovers, the deal means being able to reduce its heavy debt burden, while getting access to AT&amp;T's research and marketing resources and a long-term licence to use the AT&amp;T name. For AT&amp;T, the deal means not just a stake in a fast-growing company, but should also boost its own revenues, with additional traffic being directed into its long-distance network. This could spell trouble for its biggest rival in the long-distance market, MCI Communications, which ironically sold its cellular interests to McCaw in 1986. Sprint, the third largest long-distance carrier, also sold its cellular interests in the 1980s, but is now trying to get back into the market through a Dollars 2.8bn takeover of Centel, an independent Chicago-based local telephone company which is also the 10th largest cellular provider. That deal, like the AT&amp;T one, underlines the rapid blurring of America's telecoms boundaries.

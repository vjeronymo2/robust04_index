			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / MacGregor backs ERM camp: Transport secretary stresses he would favour early re-entry MR John MacGregor, recently cited as a possible future chancellor, yesterday lined up squarely with senior cabinet colleagues backing Britain's early return to the European exchange rate mechanism. The transport secretary's unequivocal support for re-entry to the ERM as soon as feasible will disappoint those who saw him as less controversially 'European' than Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary and the other widely tipped contender for chancellor. In repeated statements since Britain left the ERM on September 16, Mr John Major, the prime minister, has felt obliged to stress that there is no question of Mr Norman Lamont being removed from the chancellorship. However, speculation over Mr Lamont's medium-term future has continued, fuelled by the poor reception from commentators and the City to his speech at the Conservative party conference in Brighton last week. The question mark over the chancellor provoked widespread discussion at the fringes of the conference - itself fiercely divided over the desirability of UK membership of the ERM - as to his likely successor. While a straight switch of jobs between Mr Lamont and Mr Clarke was cited as one option for the prime minister, some argued that Mr MacGregor, a former chief secretary to the Treasury, would be a less controversial alternative. But Euro-sceptics rallying to Mr Lamont made clear such a move would still be viewed as a serious shift in the delicate balance of influences on the prime minister towards the most vehemently pro-Maastricht Europeans. In a BBC television interview, Mr MacGregor made plain yesterday that he was closely allied to Mr Clarke, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, in the strongly pro-ERM faction of the cabinet. Their opponents are Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, Mr Peter Lilley at social security and Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary. Mr Lamont's official backing for a return 'when circumstances allow' is widely viewed as indicating scant enthusiasm for any such move. Taking care to pledge unqualified support for the chancellor's decision to leave the mechanism, the transport secretary said unprecedented currency flows had left no alternative, although the exit was 'a great pity'. He added: 'Once we have sorted out what needs to be done to produce an ERM, or post-ERM, that will assist the Community with dealing with those currency flows, then we should be back in it.' As a new round of discussions on public expenditure begins this week, the transport secretary made clear that a balance had to be found between defending capital expenditure programmes and current spending on welfare benefits. He hinted strongly that restraints on public sector pay rises were almost certain to be part of the equation now being examined by Mr Lamont's so-called EDX committee on the expenditure round.</p>

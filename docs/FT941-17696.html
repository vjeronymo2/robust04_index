			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Midland &amp; Scottish in rig deal with Trafalgar Midland &amp; Scottish Resources, operator of the Emerald oilfield east of Shetland, has successfully completed negotiations with Trafalgar House over the leasing of the rig Emerald Producer. Mr Jon Hawksley, managing director, said yesterday the company would be making an announcement about the new arrangements next week. He would not comment on reports that creditors of the group's two subsidiaries operating the field would be asked to agree to a creditors' voluntary arrangement, or rescue scheme. He denied that the parent company would seek such an agreement. The Emerald field, which was initially expected to produce 30,000 barrels a day, has proved extremely disappointing. It started in August 1992 with production of 25,000 barrels a day, but this has dwindled to 16,000 barrels a day. Last August Midland wrote off the entire value of the development. The provision of Pounds 97m put it Pounds 113.6m in the red for 1992 on turnover of Pounds 28.1m. In September the company defaulted on its charter payments to Trafalgar for the Emerald Producer, which it was leasing for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 44,000) a day. Last month Trafalgar, which at the end of September had the rig on its books at Pounds 66m, wrote down the value by Pounds 42.1m and made a Pounds 9.5m provision for costs pending its redeployment or sale. Mr Hawksley said yesterday that the life of the Emerald field would now depend on when the rig and equipment could be redeployed. Opportunities were available, including in the UK sector. He estimated the field's life at between six and 18 months. The company has prepared a plan for abandoning the field at a cost of Dollars 11m. The shares closed yesterday at 2 1/4 p, down  1/4 p. The company's main asset apart from Emerald is a floating oil production vessel under construction in Italy at a cost of Dollars 350m to Dollars 400m.</p>

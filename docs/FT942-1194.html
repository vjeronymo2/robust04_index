			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / 'Pretty' Blair is rapped by left Labour faces an inevitable split if Mr Tony Blair, the party's leading moderniser, wins the leadership election, leftwing MPs warned yesterday. Most leftwingers privately accept that Mr Blair, the shadow home secretary, will win the election, in spite of deep misgivings about his modernising approach. They said Mr Blair was unlikely to face problems from the left in the short-term because of the overwhelming support emerging for him on the centre and right of the party. But influential members of the hard-left Campaign group said his 'social democratic agenda' would lead to a 'huge internal conflict' with the left and the unions in the first year of a Labour government. 'He will win because people will agree that he is the prettiest of the pack and that he can get Labour into Downing Street,' one leading Campaign group member said. 'But once he is in office the people in the press who have created him will not be seen within a million miles of him, and he will be in really deep trouble. 'After a year of Labour government the public will be demanding something different, and they will measure the success of the government in terms of jobs and growth. 'If Mr Blair is still talking about community values and saying that we cannot have full employment because of Gatt or the European Union, people will turn on him and blow him apart.' More moderate leftwing members of the Tribune group said they were worried by the 'fuzzy' personal manifesto for the leadership published by Mr Blair on Thursday. They voiced concerns about his failure to set out a clear economic programme, his lack of support for public sector unions, and his statement that the market economy was 'in the public interest'. Mr Peter Hain, MP for Neath, said there was 'a very big question mark over our ability to win while appearing to be all things to all people'. 'I don't think you build the sort of committed constituency Labour needs to win an election when you don't stand for anything firm. There is a kind of trust gap,' he said. Tribune, the leftwing newspaper, said Mr Blair's modernising policies appeared designed to 'tinker at the sidelines' of the economy. It called for 'bold' policies to transform Britain.</p>

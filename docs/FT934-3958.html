			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Teachers urge SIB action on pensions The Association of Teachers and Lecturers yesterday called for the Securities and Investments Board to take immediate action to help up to 27,000 teachers who have opted out of their occupational pension scheme in the past five years, John Gapper writes. The union's call followed the disclosure that the SIB plans to launch an inquiry into possible unnecessary sales of personal pensions to up to 500,000 former members of occupational schemes. Mr Peter Smith, ATL general secretary, has written to Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, calling for insurance companies to be instructed to examine every pension policy issued to a teacher.</p>

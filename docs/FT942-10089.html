			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Industry needs common cause Sir, I have just finished a by-election campaign in Rotherham. The number one issue for local people, businessmen, and executives of steel and engineering companies was the parlous state of the UK manufacturing sector. At a time when every ounce of talent, co-operation and partnership is needed to save British manufacturing from its 'friends' in the City and their friends in government, it was sad to read the attack by the director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation upon the proposals for European employee consultation (Letters, May 9). To return after 15 years working in Europe to hear this age-old hostility to partnership is depressing and bad news for UK manufacturing, face to face with competitor nations which seek to harness the efforts of workers and the commitment of unions to the common good of the enterprise. You also reported an appeal by multinationals for new international regulation, in the form of a treaty, so that companies are not discriminated against as they invest in different countries ('Multinationals seek investment treaty', May 9). The growing internationalisation of investment, production and marketing is leading to more and more calls for such trans-frontier regulation. It is illogical to assume that there can be common supra-national rules for companies and for capital and expect, on the other hand, that the human beings and citizens who work for these companies are denied common rights of consultation across frontiers. Until the UK's manufacturers agree to make common cause with their employees and their representative organisations, the long-term future for UK industry will remain bleak.

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Rabin attacks UN chief on deportees ISRAELI Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin yesterday attacked a call by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, for the Security Council to take 'whatever measures are required' to force Israel to reverse the mass expulsion of Palestinians to Lebanon. In the latest of a series of tough statements on the issue - which threatens the progress of Middle East peace talks - Mr Rabin said Mr Boutros Ghali's call was 'an example of double standards. . . an almost unprecedented demand from the Security Council to act against Israel, something I cannot recall.' Mr Rabin has refused to overturn the expulsions, saying they were a justified response to a wave of killings by Islamic fundamentalists. But the Palestine Liberation Organisation says it will not resume peace negotiations until they are reversed. Mr Rabin said he hoped the US would veto any move in the Security Council to impose sanctions against Israel, as it has always done in the past. Mr William Harrop, the US ambassador in Tel Aviv, said the Clinton administration was 'most unlikely' to allow the imposition of sanctions. But he said Washington wanted a prior solution to the issue. Mr Nayef Hawatmeh, a radical Palestinian leader, said yesterday the US, Israel and Egypt were discussing a proposal for a phased return of the deportees over 24 months. Arab foreign ministers agreed yesterday to urge the UN Security Council to impose sanctions on Israel if it refuses to let the deportees return home, Reuter reports from Cairo. The statement, due to be issued later yesterday, also called on the Security Council to appoint an international force to protect Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied territories.

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Survey of Indonesia (7): Insider thrills and spills - The Jakarta stock exchange is 70 per cent foreign driven The Jakarta stock exchange has provided investors with an object lesson in the thrills - and spills - of emerging markets. Last year the exchange was a star performer: the composite index doubled, triggering a flood of company flotations and rights issues. But after hitting a three-year high in the first week of January, it went into a nosedive which wiped 25 per cent off share values. In recent weeks prices have begun to creep back up again, but the experience has caused analysts to look more warily at the market - and its smaller sister in Surabaya. The ostensible cause of the sell-off was the Federal Reserve Board's decision to raise US interest rates in February. But with a domestic crisis bubbling up in the state banking sector, and ethnic riots in Medan, there were other reasons for investors to be nervous. Analysts say that it is important to understand that unlike other south east Asian markets, Jakarta is not dominated by local Chinese traders. This means that there is less of the speculative investment seen on other regional exchanges. On the other hand, 70 per cent of the trading is driven by foreign investors, which means that Jakarta is vulnerable to whatever Wall Street or London fashion says about emerging markets. Jakarta's modest capitalisation of about Rp 40tr (Dollars 19.2bn) and the relatively small number of stocks traded (183) make for the poor liquidity widely considered to be one of the exchange's biggest drawbacks. The strong family ties linking shareholders of the biggest companies also mean that investors have to beware of insider trading. Nor is fraud unknown: last year, counterfeiters fed over a million forged share certificates on to the market, forcing suspension of trading in five listed companies. Some of the exchange's limitations are bureaucratic. A further curb is the limit of 49 per cent on foreign ownership of the listed stock of Indonesian companies. This rule is more stringent than it appears because many large Indonesian companies only list a small proportion of issued stock - as little as 10 per cent. So foreign investors are being excluded from a sizeable area of potential investment territory. Against that, however, the market is relatively open by south east Asian standards: there are no capital controls, and foreign stockbrokers can become members of the exchange by forming partnerships with local concerns (27 have). The exchange also has ambitious plans to automate operations and move to scrip-less trading later this year, which will greatly increase its trading capacity (currently limited to 5,000 manually entered deals a day), and reduce dealing costs. Nonetheless, it was a blow to the exchange when Indosat, the large state-owned telecommunications company, decided to go to Wall Street for its forthcoming privatisation. The recent crisis in the banking sector has sharpened the need for alternative sources of finance, and the government is keen to see the stock market take on a heavier share of the load. Much of the task of strengthening the exchange lies with Mr Bacelius Ruru, the chairman of Bapepam, the capital markets supervisory agency, which is part of the ministry of finance. He is trying to improve the market's reputation, and persuade the ministry to relax some of the more onerous regulations. Items on his agenda include more disclosure both of the finances of listed companies and of trading in their shares. Bapepam is a standard-setting body for company accounts; it is working with the accounting institutes to improve the rules. He is also trying to raise standards for initial offerings. Documents are vetted more closely, even if this holds up the flow of new issues. Mr Ruru has told the ministry that the 49 per cent rule should be removed - although so far with no result. He is in less of a hurry to remove the 15 multiple rule. 'It's a way to teach the market how to behave. People should float shares out of need, not greed.' Nonetheless, Mr Ruru says this will only be temporary 'We don't want our market to be different from the others.' Insider trading is a bigger problem. Bapepam does not have the powers to deal with it effectively: there have been no successful prosecutions, despite what brokers say are blatant cases where shares have moved sharply in advance of price-sensitive news. Part of the problem is cultural. As an official puts it: 'An exchange without insider trading is like a night club without girls.' However, Bapepam has tried to protect the independent shareholders in large companies with dominant family shareholders.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Huy Duc] </F>   [Text] At his press conference on 6 January 1994, Minister  Le Xuan Trinh answered a number of questions asked by reporters:    [Father Truong Ba Can, editor in chief of CONG GIAO VA DAN  TOC] Many publications in the city and at the central echelon  have proposed rebuilding the statute and rehabilitating the name  of Alexandre de Rhodes. Why hasn't the government said anything  about this?    [Trinh] The government has read those articles and is paying  attention to this. But because this is an historical and  scientific problem, we must study the matter and get the views  of more scientists. That is why the government has not yet  responded to this.    [Reporter for Vietnam TV] How will major cases of corruption  be handled? We welcome the fact that the government has  "allowed" Vietnam TV's leadership board to "retire." But why did  it take so long to deal with the negative acts of these people?    [Trinh] Corruption has been dealt with too slowly as  compared  with the needs and hopes of the masses. The premier, too, is  unhappy about this. But the government is not the only one  involved in handling a case. This must be coordinated with the  organs of control and the courts. Unfortunately, this  coordination has long been sluggish.    There has been corruption at Vietnam TV for a long time.  Actually, it would have been better if we had dealt with those  things sooner. But in dealing with cadres at that level and with  such an important sector, we have to get the ideas of the  Politburo and the Secretariat.    [Reporter for TUOI TRE] The public recognizes that the  government is resolved to fight corruption and smuggling, but in  order to do this, does the government have any new measures?  Recently, a number of vice ministers and chairmen of provincial  people's committees acted contrary to a number of the premier's  policies, including the smuggling of automobiles in Cao Bang and  the smuggling of "Po-mu" timber in Nghe An. Why hasn't the  premier dismissed or suspended those cadres involved in this  based on the authority given him by the government organization  law? Has he failed to carry out his responsibilities fully or  has he been unable to carry our his responsibilities?    [Trinh] Having effective measures is something that the  premier is very concerned about. First of all, the government  will implement a new organizational measures: An anti-corruption  committee headed by a minister will be established. Although a  special state anti-corruption commission will not be  established, the government and the Standing Committee of the  National Assembly are united, and each month the Standing  Committee of the National Assembly will hear reports on the  situation in fighting corruption in order to provide guidance to  the organs of control and courts. Also, the Standing Committee  of the National Assembly is requiring that the committees of the  National Assembly regard fighting corruption as one of their  tasks in order to monitor this regularly.    The Politburo, too, agrees that if a case involving a  provincial chairman, minister, vice minister, or cadre  subordinate to a management echelon of the Politburo arises, the  anti-corruption leadership collective (the Standing Committee of  the National Assembly, the Ministry of Interior, the organs of  control, and the courts) have the right to take whatever steps  are necessary in accord with the law and then report this to the  Politburo.    Last year, a number of the cases that occurred, such as the  smuggling of automobiles in Cao Bang and the smuggling of Po-mu  timber in Nghe An, should have been dealt with immediately. But  under the old mechanism, the views of others had to be obtained  first and so things were done slowly and this affected the  situation in fighting corruption. But in any event, these cases  have now been dealt with.    [TUOI TRE] On what basis will the 1994 administrative  reforms  be made?    [Trinh] Administrative reform is an urgent task. This will  be  carried on based on clearly determining the responsibilities of  the legislative, administrative, and judicial organizations. In  our country, the responsibilities of the legislative,  administrative, and judicial organizations still overlap. The  responsibilities of the central and local organizations must be  clearly determined, and there must be a clear distinction  between the responsibilities of the state management  organizations and those of the commercial production  organizations. The administrative apparatus must be reorganized  to make it smaller but stronger. Most countries have only 12-13  ministries, but we now have 30 ministries and equivalent-level  organizations and 30 other organizations. Thus, it's as if there  are 60 ministries directly subordinate to the government that  have dispersed administrative powers. Along with this, we must  build a standardized system of civil servants having clear  rights and responsibilities. The government has guided the  committee handling this work. This committee is receiving help  from the United Nations.    [TUOI TRE] As you have admitted, in Vietnam there is still  much confusion regarding the responsibilities of the  administrative, legislative, and judicial organizations.  Actually, there are also many unstable power relationships  between the premier and local leaders. In view of this, does the  government's reform program contain any proposals for revising a  number of the articles in the constitution and government  organization law?    [Trinh] In implementing things, a number of problems have  arisen. For example, the government organization law stipulates  that the ministry is to control the commercial units. But we now  realize that agricultural management must be separated from  commercial production management and that the concept of a  management ministry must be abandoned. Thus, we must experiment  and revise the laws.    Administrative reform is related to the problem of  organizing  local administration. For example, should there be precinct- and  district-level people's councils? Issues such as transferring  and dismissing chairmen of provincial and municipal people's  committees touch on the constitution, but these issues are being  studied.    [Hong Phuong, deputy secretary of the Municipal Reporters  Association] Recently, delineating and disbanding things have  become issues nationwide. Why isn't there a unified policy for  the entire country?    [Trinh] That is a major concern of ours. The government has  discussed this and agrees that the most effective measure is to  implement a policy of paying adequate compensation to the  people. There will be a number of foreign investment projects,  and much compensation will be paid to the people. This morning,  at a government meeting, Vice Premier Phan Van Khai said that  there have been cases in which the compensation paid to the  people has been reduced. The government is requiring that the  localities and sectors refrain from reducing the compensation of  these people.    [TUOI TRE] The constitution has stipulations on buying  assets  of the people. Why hasn't the government submitted a purchase  law instead of continuing to use that disbanding and  compensation form, which is not unified?    [Trinh] To date, no organization has submitted a draft  purchase law. In my view, the constitution stipulates this and  so there must be a law to provide guidance. [Trinh ends]    Minister Le Xuan Trinh also said that the premier is very  concerned about other issues raised in the press. TUOI TRE,  THANH NIEN, LAO DONG, and PHU NU have published stories about a  number of negative cases and losses at various corporations such  as Liksin, the Ben Thanh Tobacco Corporation, and the Hung Vuong  Refrigeration Corporation. The premier is directly guiding the  Municipal People's Committee which is reporting on and dealing  with these cases. In particular, the premier is very interested  in the series of stories on the customs office that have  appeared in TUOI TRE. The premier has ordered that the customs  office be reorganized. Minister Le Xuan Trinh also criticized a  number of newspapers that have published inaccurate stories.  Some newspapers have published corrections, but others have not  yet done so.</p>

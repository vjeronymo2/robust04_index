			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY HURT BY WEAK MANUFACTURING  </P> <P> American workers made modest productivity gains in the third quarter, but the  lackluster manufacturing sector posted its lowest output gain in three years  and continued to slow the overall economy, the government said Wednesday.  </P> <P> And for the first time this year, the quarter-to-quarter hourly wage gains made  by workers outpaced the growth in consumer inflation, the Labor Department  said.  </P> <P> The department said overall productivity in the non-farm sector of the economy  increased at a revised annual rate of 2.5% in the July-September period, more  than double the anemic 1.1% annual rate gain in the second quarter.  </P> <P> But in manufacturing, a sector weakened by slumping auto sales and other  problems, productivity increased at a revised annual rate of just 1% after  improving at an annual rate of 3.7% in the April-June period.  </P> <P> The poor manufacturing performance came as output rose just 1.2% and hours  worked increased a weak 0.2%, reflecting slackened demand for goods. The  increase in output was the smallest since a slight decline in the second  quarter of 1986.  </P> <P> Because of the poor productivity gain in manufacturing and a significant  increase in wages, unit labor costs, a key determinant of future price  inflation, rose at an annual rate of 4.9% after decreasing by 1% in the second  quarter. It was the largest increase in unit labor costs since the 1982  recession, the department said.  </P> <P> That increase will likely translate into either higher prices for consumers for  manufactured goods or lower profits for producers -- or both -- and also makes  it more difficult for U.S. manufacturers to compete in overseas markets.  </P> <P> "We're getting more upward wage pressure in manufacturing, and with the weak  productivity numbers, that pushes up costs," said Michael Evans, head of a  Washington forecasting firm.  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY  </P> <P> Non-farm business productivity, percent change from previous quarter,  seasonally adjusted annual rate. Third quarter 1989 Revised 2.5%.  </P> <P> Source: Labor Department  </P></p>

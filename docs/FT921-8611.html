			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Letter: Constraint on teachers' pay Sir, Your leader, 'Fair pay for teachers' (February 11), addresses only one part of the equation in offering competitive salaries to teachers. The main constraint in accommodating an increase of between 5.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent will be the financial resources available to a particular school. Under the local management of schools (LMS) system, individual schools are funded by a 'unit of resource' based on the number of pupils on the roll. In recent years, this has failed to keep in line with the teachers' pay awards, with the consequence that school budgets - delegated to in-dividual schools  -are inadequate. In attempting to come to terms with these budgets schools either have to reduce staff levels or accept a degree of deficit budgeting. As a result of this pay increase, we surely will be expecting to see more of the practice witnessed in Dorking where parents have been asked to contribute Pounds 30 a head to meet the wage bill.

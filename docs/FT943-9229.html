			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / Letters to the Editor: Wrong purchasing approach Sir, Your report, 'Whitehall could save Pounds 130m on consultancy' (August 5), highlights an important weakness in government purchasing. Matters have been getting worse rather than better. The Department of Trade and Industry recently abandoned its long-standing central computer database of consultants because 'departments know who to contact'. This inevitably means yet more concentration upon the generally expensive, en-trenched suppliers listed in your table. It is fashionable to attack the European bureaucracy. But purchasing consultancy ap-pears to be handled better in Brussels and Luxembourg, where most director-generals maintain computer databases and all projects are open to competitive tender. Significantly, the largest firms obtain a far smaller share of this business, and it is simpler for potential bidders to find out about projects being mooted than with UK departments. The Cabinet Office report does not appear to have addressed the increased cost of using committees (often of eminent retired industrialists) to assist departments in assessing tenders. In our experience, remuneration of these experts can exceed sums paid to a consultancy for doing a project.

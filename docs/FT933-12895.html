			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Agreement reached over BR pension plan THE GOVERNMENT and the trustees of the British Rail pension scheme reached agreement yesterday on a plan to protect payments to pensioners after privatisation if the scheme's investment income falls sharply. Announcement of the agreement came in time to defuse a potential revolt in the Lords over BR pensioners. Lord Peyton of Yeovil, the former Tory transport minister, had tabled an amendment to the privatisation legislation to safeguard pensioners' benefits. Earlier this month he led a successful revolt against the government when the Lords insisted that BR should be allowed to bid for franchises. The agreement was sought by the trustees of the scheme who warned that future pensions could be 'at risk' without a government guarantee. Under the agreement, the closed scheme to be set up for current and deferred pensioners will be protected by an absolute guarantee to provide pension payments uprated annually in line with the retail prices index. The closed scheme may not use more than 40 per cent of any future surplus to enhance benefits, with the remaining 60 per cent to be set aside as reserves. The government will also appoint a director of the trustee company set up to run the closed scheme whose consent will be required before any surplus is distributed to members. The director will also need to agree overall investment strategy and other matters which could have a big impact on the scheme's finances. For those BR employees who stay in the Joint Investment Scheme to be set up in connection with private-sector rail employers following privatisation, the government 'restates its commitment to ensuring that people retiring from BR do so on terms no less favourable than hitherto'. Earlier during yesterday's committee stage discussion of the bill the government won by five votes a move to alter the procedures for dealing with the pension schemes after privatisation in order to give pensioners the right to petition parliament. The proposal was rejected by 151 votes to 145.</p>

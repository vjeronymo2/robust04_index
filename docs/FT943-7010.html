			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Company News: Ralph Lauren sells stake for expansion Mr Ralph Lauren, designer of clothes which have come to symbolise a clean-cut, well-bred way of American life, has sold 28 per cent of his company to Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, for Dollars 135m. It is the first time the designer and his business partner, Mr Peter Strom, have turned to outside capital to fund expansion. Mr Lauren is expected to take some cash out of the transaction. New York-based Polo Ralph Lauren, Mr Lauren's company, earns revenues of about Dollars 3.9bn a year from men's leisure clothes, shirts and ties, as well as from licensing fragrances, furniture and interior decoration under Ralph Lauren labels. Goldman, which has advised Polo Ralph Lauren for six years, describes the stake as a 'passive' investment. It holds the shares in its affiliate GS Capital Partners, a Dollars 1bn investment fund started in 1992, owned 30 per cent by Goldman and 70 per cent by its clients. Goldman's investment leaves Mr Lauren with 65 per cent of the company, down from 90 per cent, and Mr Strom with 7 per cent, down from 10 per cent.</p>

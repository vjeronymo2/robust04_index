			<p><P> April 30, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CONTROVERSIAL ARTISTS, ART ABANDONED?;  </P> <P> ARTS: NEA CHIEF JOHN E. FROHNMAYER APPARENTLY STEPS AWAY FROM DISPUTED WORKS.  AT THE SAME TIME, HIS NO-SMUT OATH FOR FUNDING IS BEING QUESTIONED.  </P> <P> A pair of subtle developments in the political travails of the National  Endowment of the Arts last week illustrate the intensity and risk of the  federal arts agency's struggle for survival.  </P> <P> They involve questions about the willingness of NEA Chairman John E. Frohnmayer  to appear to renounce the work of two artists who have been in the vortex of  the yearlong arts endowment crisis.  </P> <P> At the same time, some of the NEA's most visible allies, including Rep. Sidney  Yates (D-Ill.), have begun to express concern over Frohnmayer's decision to  require artists and arts groups to execute an acknowledgement of what many  construe as an anti-smut loyalty oath to get endowment support.  </P> <P> On two occasions -- either occurring or disclosed last week -- Frohnmayer has  shown he is now willing to engage in an apparent abandonment of the work of the  late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS last year, and  multimedia artist David Wojnarowicz, who has AIDS and has devoted his art to a  political and social protest over the plight of its victims.  </P> <P> A Wojnarowicz show, "Tongues of Flame," has been the most recent focus of  controversy after a fundamentalist Christian group and conservative politicians  attacked images in it as obscene and sacrilegious.  </P> <P> Since before Frohnmayer's Senate confirmation last fall, politicians on both of  the ideological sides of the NEA controversy, journalists and arts supporters  have pressed him to state an opinion on the controversial Mapplethorpe exhibit  "The Perfect Moment." Frohnmayer has been pressed to say if it was artistically  meritorious and whether the NEA grant it got was a mistake. Frohnmayer has  never committed himself.  </P> <P> But last week, he seemed to abandon both Mapplethorpe and Wojnarowicz. In an  April 20 letter to Donald Wildmon, executive director of the American Family  Assn., based in Tupelo, Miss., Frohnmayer responded to Wildmon's objections to  Wojnarowicz. The Wildmon group two weeks ago distributed a mailing with  severely cropped Wojnarowicz images. The cropped details depicted sexual and  religious protest activity.  </P> <P> "The images are disgusting and offensive to me," Frohnmayer told Wildmon in his  letter, which was released by the NEA last week, "and undoubtedly to a large  majority of the population. I would hope that, with the procedures I am  implementing at the arts endowment, images such as these would not again be  funded."  </P> <P> Then last Thursday, in a contentious television appearance with Wildmon, in  which both men traded insults and cast themselves as serving Christianity, the  debate turned to Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> Wildmon demanded to know if Frohnmayer was troubled by the images. "I think  that these photos are offensive to many people," Frohnmayer said. "That's not  something I have funded."  </P> <P> Unsatisfied, Wildmon pressed on. Would Frohnmayer, he asked, fund Mapplethorpe  if the decision had been his? "Would I approve it as it is there?" Frohnmayer  responded, gesturing to a prop Wildmon held. "The answer is 'no.' "  </P> <P> Apparent abandonment of the two artists came as Yates and arts supporters  question the NEA's requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge to comply  with anti-obscenity language in the endowment's 1990 funding law.  </P> <P> The requirement has led to decisions by New York theater producer Joseph Papp  and Venice choreographer Ferne Ackerman to decline NEA grants. Many arts groups  are obliterating the wording or filing protests when they return the signed  acknowledgment forms.  </P> <P> But Yates and Washington arts attorney James Fitzpatrick contend the pledge may  amount to an anti-obscenity loyalty oath. At a hearing last week, Yates  questioned the need for the pledge, noting that other wording in the same form  threatens art groups with debarment, a government procedure developed to combat  gouging by defense contractors.  </P> <P> Debarred organizations lose their ability to obtain federal grants or contracts  from every agency of the government if they are found by any one agency to have  violated its procedures or legal strictures. To Yates and Fitzpatrick, though,  debarment of artists is especially threatening since an arts organization could  get a grant for an exhibit later accused of including a single obscene work --  then face the prospect of long-term ineligibility for any additional government  support.  </P> <P> "Quite frankly, I thought it important that the arts community know what the  law is," Frohnmayer replied to Yates at the hearing. But to Fitzpatrick and  other arts observers, the questions raised by all this have hardly been  resolved.  </P> <P> "I don't know why the NEA added this language," said Fitzpatrick, who is  president of the board of the Washington Project for the Arts -- itself a key  player in the controversy because it accepted the Mapplethorpe show last year  after the Corcoran Gallery of Art here canceled it. "That is not the process  that Congress intended," he said. "It creates more problems than it solves."  </P> <P> And as to apparently abandoning Mapplethorpe, Fitzpatrick said, "I don't know  on what grounds you could refuse to fund it." He said Mapplethorpe's work had  been scrutinized by dozens of curators and stands as among the most socially  telling -- if sometimes viscerally difficult -- of its time.  </P></p>

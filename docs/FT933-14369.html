			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Serra to be economy minister SPANISH prime minister Felipe Gonzalez yesterday gave his deputy premier Narcis Serra overall responsibility for economic policy and appointed Mr Pedro Solbes, a technocrat with an EC background, to head the finance ministry. The appointments, which follow last month's narrow election win by Mr Gonzalez's socialist party (PSOE), were part of a wide-ranging government reshuffle that brought eight new members into the 17-strong cabinet. Facing what amounts to Spain's worst recession for 30 years, the new economic team is unlikely to apply harsh measures to lower wage costs, cut government spending and deregulate the economy. Mr Gonzalez excluded representatives of the PSOE's left wing from the cabinet, gave minor cabinet jobs to six independents, three of them women, and kept Mr Javier Solana as foreign minister. Mr Solana is, like Mr Serra, a stalwart of the ruling party's social democrat wing and both ministers have served in all Mr Gonzalez's governments since 1982. The challenges facing the new government were underlined by CPI figures released yesterday. Year on year inflation was up 0.2 per cent to 4.9 per cent. The rise reflected the impact of the peseta's mid-May devaluation - the third in the space of nine months - on energy costs. Mirroring an excessive wage growth that has become one of the economy's chief weaknesses, underlying inflation, excluding food and energy prices, rose 0.4 in June to post a year on year figure of 5.9 per cent.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Company News: Strong yen blamed for 18.9% fall at Toray TORAY Industries, Japan's leading synthetic fibre maker, saw a decline in profits for the first half due to the higher yen, low industrial demand, and the prolonged slump in consumer spending. Non-consolidated pre-tax profits fell 18.9 per cent to Y20.3bn (Dollars 189.7m) while sales declined 7 per cent to Y275.9bn. After-tax profits fell 13.9 per cent to Y11bn. Toray said it had cut Y10.8bn in costs during the first half through curbing material costs. However, pre-tax profits were hurt by the yen's sharp rise against the dollar, which eroded its export value by Y15.5bn. Sales of fibres and textiles fell 13.8 per cent to Y143bn due to declines in consumer spending and lower demand from the auto, construction and fishing industries. Plastics and chemical sales fell 6.2 per cent to Y85.1bn. However, new businesses, including pharmaceuticals, electronics information equipment and construction materials saw firm sales. For the 12 months to March, Toray revised down its earlier projections, and now expects pre-tax profits to fall 17 per cent to Y40bn on a 5.1 per cent drop in sales to Y550bn.</p>

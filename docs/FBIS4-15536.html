			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Glazovskaya] </F>   [Text] Ashgabat, 11 April -- Turkmenistan has partially  resumed the supply of gas to Azerbaijan in response to  assurances from the Azerbaijani side that supplies of petroleum  products, equipment for oilfields, and engineering products to  Turkmenistan - envisaged under an agreement between the two  countries - will be resumed within a ten-day period.    To date, Azerbaijan owes Turkmenistan 74 million dollars for  gas supplies and is now being forced to take urgent steps to  avoid the economic sanctions stipulated in the  inter-governmental agreement.</p>

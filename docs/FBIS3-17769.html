			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Boris Krivoshey and </F> Aleksandr Krylovich]    [Text] Moscow, 29 Mar -- The Russian Ministry of Foreign  Affairs has advanced a new proposal aimed at achieving the  earliest possible settlement of the situation on the Korean  peninsula. Speaking at a news conference today, Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov announced that Russia is  prepared, and regards it as expedient, to conduct "informal  consultations" to prepare an international conference on this  problem. The Russian Foreign Ministry last week put forward an  initiative to hold such a conference with the participation of  Russia, China, the United States, Japan, the DPRK, and the ROK,  as well as representatives of the UN secretary general and the  director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  Aleksandr Panov noted that Russia's proposal is currently being  closely studied by all interested parties, and none of them has  so far responded to it negatively.    According to the Russian diplomat, consultations on  preparations for an international conference could begin in  Moscow in the near future. It is expected that each side could  put forward its stand at these consultations.    A. Panov stressed that the Russian side starts from the  premise that the conference, if it is held, should be thoroughly  prepared. Issues for discussion must be drawn up taking account  of the interests of both sides. In the view of the Russian  diplomat, the problem of "how to ensure the nonnuclear status of  the Korean peninsula" should be one of the foremost issues. The  issue of confirming the sovereignty and territorial integrity of  both Korean states, maintaining noninterference in their  internal affairs, and ensuring their freedom of choice of paths  of social development should also be discussed. The Russian  diplomat believes that a way out of the present situation can be  found within the framework of such a multifaceted approach,  which supplements steps that are already being taken.    A. Panov stressed that the Russian initiative has already  played a positive part. In his view, "the furore over this  problem has recently abated somewhat," and "an alternative that  can be worked on" has emerged.    Touching on the issue of the venue for an international  conference on the problem of the Korean peninsula, the Russian  diplomat said that so far proposals have come in for it to begin  work in Geneva, and then subsequently to be held by turns in  Pyongyang and Seoul.</p>

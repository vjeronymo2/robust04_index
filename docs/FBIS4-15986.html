			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["News Release"] </F>   [Text] Tallinn, April 12 -- The flux of Kurdish refugees  through Estonia, most probably with an intention to reach  Sweden, continues. The Boarderguard Board told ETA, on Tuesday  [12 April], that on Sunday an Estonian was detained in Narva who  tried to illegally import from Russia a six-member group of  Kurdish refugees. The Kurds escaped back to Russia, where they  were detained by a Russian borderguard patrol.    Acting head of the Estonian Detainment Institutions Board  Valeri Kravets told ETA, on Tuesday, that there were 137 Kurdish  refugees in Estonia at present on whom documents were being  prepared in order a decision could be made as to their  internment. During the two-month internment period, the  Migration Board has to decide whether to deport the Kurds or to  grant them a status of refugees, residence and working permits.    Kravets said that at Harku Prison there were 22 Kurds whose  future has not been decided. At Maardu, 8 Kurds are detained,  who have been in Estonia for more than three months and have  been granted another two months of internment time. Kravets  said it was not understandable why the solution of the problems  was dragged because the accommodation and feeding of the Kurds  costs a lot to Estonia.    Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar told a press conference on  Tuesday that government still had no money to build a permanent  internment camp. He added that it was however much more  important to set a better mechanism in order the Kurds will not  come to Estonia illegally, the possible solution being better  work of the borderguard. Those Kurdish refugees that have come  here illegally have to be sent back to where they came from, he  said.</p>

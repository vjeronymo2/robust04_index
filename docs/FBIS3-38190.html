			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by LES ECHO special correspondent Gilles Senges in </F> Finkenwerder, Germany: "Inspired by American Example, Airbus  Industrie Requests Introduction of Indirect Aid System in  Europe"]    [Text] Following the prohibition of the European system of  reimbursable loans to the aeronautics industry, Airbus Industrie  has requested that Europe promptly adopt the new regulations  imposed by the United States within the scope of GATT. Managing  Director Jean Pierson, who yesterday delivered the first A-321  built in Germany to Lufthansa, said: "Since the Americans are  sticking to their GATT accord, let us do as they are doing; let  us adopt a system of indirect aid." According to the chief of  the European consortium, this is a question of political will.  "Let us organize research and development budgets by  distributing tasks between Airbus member countries (France,  Germany, Britain, and Spain) in order to avoid overlap, and let  us adopt the U.S. system of research contracts, which for us at  least presents the advantage of not having to make  reimbursements."    In light of the increase in the civil aeronautics budget of  NASA, the main customer of U.S. manufacturers, by 30 percent to  $1.1 billion, and that its second-generation supersonic aircraft  efforts exceed Europe's by a factor of 100, Jean Pierson thinks  that the message is being heard.  <H5>  Message Heard </H5>   Following in the footsteps of French Industry Minister  Gerard  Longuet and Transportation Minister Bernard Bosson, German  Economy Minister Gunter Rexrodt has promised to take measures by  1995. "The conditions should be the same for everyone, and not  be detrimental to Europeans."    After their recourse to international financial markets for  the development of the A-321 (for an amount of nearly 3 billion  French francs [Fr]), the Airbus partners (Aerospatiale, Deutsche  Aerospace, Bristish Aerospace, and CASA) will finance the A319  program from their own funds (Fr1.7 billion). "However, we  cannot rest on our laurels. Now more than ever, we need our  governments' support to ensure our future and to remain  competitive," Jean Pierson warned.    "As long as the European manufacturer meets our cost and  performance criteria for the purchase of new aircraft,"  Lufthansa President Juergen Weber said, "we obviously will give  preference to Europe." The German carrier, which has almost all  Airbus versions in its fleet, currently is flying 78 European  aircraft representing a total investment of 8.5 billion Deutsche  marks, and it is expected to take delivery of another 33  aircraft. The only Airbus models absent from its inventory are  the A319 and the A330.</p>

Meanwhile, an Okinawa-based RC-135 strategic reconnaissance  plane committed an overall photographing and electronic  reconnaissance in the South Korean airspace on the northern half  of Korea.    That day, the South Korean puppets mobilized some 800 armed  bandits in a war exercise on the forefront in Chupa-ri, Chorwon  County, South Korean Kangwon Province. A 105-mm artillery group  of the puppet army fired about 90 shells at spots adjacent to  the demilitarized zone along the military demarcation line.</p>

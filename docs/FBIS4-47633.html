			<p>SUMMARY                                              In a renewed bid to close the gap between China's rapidly  expanding economy and sluggish growth in power production,  Beijing has stepped up its efforts to boost foreign investment in  the power industry, promised new state loans for power projects,  and reaffirmed an agenda of sweeping market reforms announced  last year.  However, continued administrative control of  investment return rates may discourage a rapid increase in  foreign investment.                                       END SUMMARY     Underscoring the power ministry's renewed drive to court foreign  investors, the 17-23 April issue of Beijing's English-language  paper China Daily reported that Minister of Power Industry Shi  Dazhen had begun an official visit to France, Spain, and Israel  to "bring in investment."  While in France, the article said, Shi  was expected to "sign an agreement" to extend a "10-year power  cooperation treaty" due to expire this year and to "explain  China's energy policies" to French government and business  leaders.  The article went on to describe Shi's visits to Spain  and Israel as "important" because Spain is the home of the  "European power union" and Israel has "ties" with financial  organizations "worldwide."  Revealing that Shi's trip was part of  a larger series of overseas visits planned to attract investment  or assistance for the struggling power sector, the article quoted  a ministry spokesman as saying that other delegations will be  dispatched to unnamed "Western nations" this year with "proposals  for cooperation."     Investment Gap     Shi's trip and other current initiatives are part of Beijing's  ongoing effort to remedy serious shortages in the power sector,  which power ministry officials have long warned is dangerously  underfunded.  Since Shi took office a year ago, PRC media have  increasingly stressed the urgency of bringing power production  into line with economic growth, claiming that the present 20  percent shortfall in power capacity not only curbs current  industrial output but also poses a serious obstacle to continued  economic development.     Revisiting this theme, the 17-23 China Daily article stated that  Beijing has "planned" for only 12 of the average 17 million  kilowatts of new capacity needed annually to sustain a 9 percent  economic growth rate until the year 2000.  Ten billion of the 66  billion yuan needed to pay for an increase of this size, the  article said, is "not available."  Although the article indicated  that this "capital shortage" would be eased later in the year, it  complained that the government had reduced funding for large  power plants in order to control inflation and quoted power  ministry officials as warning that this shortage would  "jeopardize" long-term economic growth.     Promotion of Market Reform     Consistent with his efforts over the past year in spearheading a  drive to increase funding and introduce sweeping reforms in the  power industry, Shi Dazhen was quoted in a 3 May China Daily  article as saying that "plans are under way" to "lift price  controls" on electricity, introduce a "shareholding system" into  the power industry, and launch a publicity campaign to encourage  energy conservation.     -- Price reform.  Seeking to correct the longstanding problem of  low state-set electricity prices that have resu1ted in massive  waste and have severely constrained power sector development, the  article reported Shi as reiterating his call of last December  (China Daily, 28 December 1993) to establish a "rational pricing  system" for the power industry in the "next three years."  Allowing electricity prices to "ref1ect market demand," Shi  asserted, is the "best way to attract domestic and overseas  investment."  Arguing that price reform would attract foreign  investment and financial assistance, the article said that an  "American expert" abstained in a 1992 World Bank vote on  investment in a power plant because electricity prices "failed to  reflect market demand."  The article went on to paint a grim  picture of acute power shortages and waste, noting that  electricity prices were set in 1958, and, "although adjusted for  the first time last year," are still "extremely low."     -- Institutional Reform.  Shi also reaffirmed his plan for a  radical restructuring of the power industry along market lines.  He called for "breaking free from the planned economy" and for  turning "al1" state-owned power enterprises into "shareholding  firms" that will "operate free of government interference" and  assume responsibility for profits and losses.  Elaborating on  this reform agenda in a keynote article appearing in Renmin Ribao  late last year, Shi had insisted that China must "take the road"  of "unconventional" development and that power enterprises must  be reorganized into "standardized joint-stock" companies--or  corporations--and must "experiment with newer and more dynamic  management forms" (19 December 1993).  The joint-stock system, he  said, would "clearly define property rights," provide "a legal  guarantee for the real separation of ownership from management  power," and "ensure the legitimate rights and interests of  investors."  Shi also indicated that the new system would allow  for a radical decentralization of decisionmaking power.  Some  power companies, he said, would be "managed by investors on their  own" and some power plants would be "run by other industries."  In addition, he  reaffirmed 1987 State Council guidelines--which  were apparently never implemented--that allow provincial and  transprovincial power grids to operate as commercial entities  responsible for profits and losses and enjoying autonomy in  raising and allocating funds for development.  The "key issue,"  he declared, "is to firmly establish the concept that electric  power is a commodity" and to create "a policy environment  ensuring fair competition."     Limit on Investment Returns     Although eager to attract foreign investment, Beijing has also  expressed concern over perceived foreign exploitation of power-  starved localities and has responded by setting administrative  limits on the rates of return that may inhibit the increased flow  of foreign funds.  A 7 May report in Zhongguo Xinwen She,  Beijing's news service for overseas Chinese, announced that the  State Council had fixed the "rate of return" for foreign  investment in joint venture power projects at "between 11 and 12  percent."  The State Council was "greatly concerned," it said,  because "some provinces and municipalities" had agreed to a rate  of return that was "too high" in order to "seek early success" in  negotiations with foreign parties.  Independent Hong Kong media  have confirmed high rates in some areas and investor concern over  arbitrary limits.  The well-connected Hong Kong daily Ming Pao  reported on 7 March that some southern provinces had accepted a  Hong Kong company's request for a "50 percent return" on its  investment in a power project.  A 6 May article in the prominent  English-language Hong Kong daily South China Morning Post  reported that unnamed foreign investors believe that a rate of  return of 15 to 18 percent would be "reasonable."     New Infusion of State Loans     While Beijing has undertaken high-profile measures to attract  foreign investment, it has also taken steps to beef up state  loans to the power industry and has signaled that state  investment, funneled through new institutions created by the  recent wave of banking reform, will continue to play the major  role in power sector development.  For example, a China Daily  article on 18 May reported that the recently established State  Development Bank will grant 7 billion yuan in loans to ease  "capital shortages" for large power projects.  Apparently  attempting to emphasize the state's commitment to the power  industry, the article said that the loans--only the "first batch"  for the year--would account for fully 36 percent of all bank  loans Beijing plans to grant this year.  Similarly, the article  reported that 40 percent of all power sector funding this year  will come from the state, whereas foreign investment is expected  to account for only 10 percent.     Implications     Under increasing pressure to provide adequate power for China's  booming economy, Beijing is straining to draw more capital into  the power sector and is using the energy crisis to prod powerful  bureaucrats into implementing radical market reforms.  Because of  the limited ability of state coffers to address China's rapidly  growing power needs, efforts to attract more foreign investors  are likely to expand.  However, these efforts may be undercut by  Beijing's continuing administrative control of investment return  rates.     (AUTHOR:  VOSS.

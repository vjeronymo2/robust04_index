			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FILM;  </P> <P> ANYTHING BUT ENFANT'S PLAY  </P> <P>  European movie makers have long had a thing for films about children, but not  necessarily for children.  </P> <P> Some might call it an obsession, all these cinematic love songs to growing up.  But the best directors realize that the simplicity of kids and their feelings  make for direct movies able to reflect the adult world in defining ways. See a  child's terror and joy in facing everyday life and begin to grasp the ineffable  anxiety and satisfactions of the adult.  </P> <P> Francois Truffaut ("The 400 Blows") understood this, and, more recently, Lasse  Hallstrom ("My Life as a Dog"), John Boorman ("Hope and Glory") and Jean-Loup  Hubert ("Le Grand Chemin") have shown they get it too.  </P> <P> Then there's Louis Malle's "Au Revoir les Enfants" (screening Friday at UC  Irvine), a thoroughly honest film based on a few days in the director's life  when he was 12. Like Truffaut's "The 400 Blows," it balances the pathos of  experience with a journalist's keen eye. Malle tells his story crisply and  fondly, and through the naturalness of its emotions, it breaks your heart.  </P> <P> The setting is a Catholic boys school in provincial France, a place of  stern-faced but kindly priests and fortress-like walls and burnished wood. The  young students study Latin and arithmetic in the spartan classrooms, vent  aggression during unruly recesses and get to know each other, slowly, in the  bunk room where they all sleep.  </P> <P> Against the seeming casualness of all this is the threat of Nazism. The school  is in occupied territory, and it's a little startling to see German jeeps drive  by or a Nazi soldier ask a priest to hear his confession. The boys feel the  influence and are affected by Nazi propaganda. Most of them have never met a  Jew, but some of them say things like "better the Krauts than the Jews or the  Communists" to each other in the hallways.  </P> <P> Malle focuses on Julien Quentin (Gaspard Manesse), a self-possessed 12-year-old  based on the director's own experiences, and Jean Bonnet (Raphael Fejto), a new  boy whom Julien initially rebuffs. When they first meet, Jean asks who he is  and Julien replies curtly, "I'm Julien Quentin. Don't mess with me."  </P> <P> Later, they develop a tenuous friendship. When Julien asks Jean if he's ever  scared, he answers, "All the time." It's an insightful moment that tells so  much of what it's like to be young and small, and it brings them closer.  </P> <P> We discover early on that Jean is Jewish and hiding out in the school with two  other Jewish boys. The priests know they'll be taken to the concentration camps  and must be protected. Julien begins to decode Jean's mystery, not realizing  the danger and only fascinated by the exotic presence of a Jew.  </P> <P> When the inevitable happens and Jean is found out by the Nazis, Julien  struggles with the notion of a world where a boy can be taken away by anonymous  men. His melancholy epiphany signals manhood and the start of a courageous  moral foundation.  </P> <P> The movie is so engrossing because it never slips from the boys' point of view.  Malle has coaxed touchingly unaffected performances out of all his young  actors, especially Manesse and Fejto, and has been graced by Renato Berta's  uncomplicated but purposeful cinematography.  </P> <P> Berta's camera stays with the children and their perspective -- we see the  students head-on, his camera finding their eyes. It's their vision that shows  us this world of looming adults, both intimidating and soothing, and unjust  events that confuse and frighten.  </P></p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Supplying parts to consolidate the market - Finelist, where a young team is leading the flotation Distributing automotive parts during a recession sounds a daunting prospect, but this harsh trading environment has nurtured one of the youngest executive teams to seek a listing in the current wave of flotations. Finelist, which will be floated next month with a market value of about Pounds 25m, is led by Mr Chris Swan, 35, executive chairman. Mr Sadhana Reddy, the finance director, is another corporate youngster at the age of 33. While a chartered accountant with Peat Marwick he advised Mr Swan when he took control in 1991, and joined Finelist in early 1992. However, more City experience comes in the shape of Mr Brian North, a former executive of Burton and Thorn EMI, who joined as non-executive deputy chairman in 1992. He is a director of various private and public companies, including Haden MacLellan and Baris Holdings. The group intends to appoint another non-executive director and an operations director. Finelist says it has made rapid progress in a fragmented market by stressing high levels of service to garages, computerising stock and financial controls and emphasising staff training and motivation. The company has 73 outlets, including 25 franchises, trading principally under the Autela name. About 18 months ago it had 48 outlets. Turnover has grown from Pounds 11.6m in 1990 to Pounds 16m in the year to June 30 1993, with operating profits increasing from Pounds 500,000 to Pounds 1.2m. The prospectus will forecast pre-tax profits almost doubling to Pounds 2m in the present year to June. The flotation will raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m of new money, which will be used for expansion. The group has an initial target of 120 outlets. Mr Swan, who will own between 15 per cent and 18 per cent of the equity after flotation, said: 'We are going to expand through acquisition. We could expand by another 20 sites without materially increasing overheads.' The first areas identified for expansion are along the M4 corridor, the east Midlands and the Borders. Last April the group entered west London by paying Pounds 500,000 for Willow Vale, a chain of five outlets. It hopes to expand around the M25 using the Willow Vale name, which has also been applied to LH Codd's four north Devon sites bought last July for Pounds 950,000. The Autela business was the subject of a management buy-out in 1989 from BBA Group, which had acquired it with the rest of Automotive Products in 1971. Mr Swan was part of the initial buy-out team and then took full control with a second buy-out, backed by 3i and NatWest Ventures, of the other directors. It offers free delivery of parts in under an hour to customers within seven miles of a branch. It also offers a no-quibble, 12-month guarantee of any component, backed by the manufacturer, whether or not the part was faulty. Mr Swan says: 'The trick is to make significant margin out of it to make it profitable. We're a service provider and we can charge for it. A garage owner gets his customer's car off the ramp and will pay accordingly.' Finelist's gross profit margins have increased from 13.8 per cent in 1990 to 18.6 per cent in 1993, and at the operating level from 4.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent. It has invested in a Tridex computer system, which provides branches with an electronic catalogue listing 208,000 component parts. Even inexperienced staff can, within seconds, establish the availability and customer-specific price of any part, and any related sales opportunities. The group does not use a central warehouse, relying on just-in-time delivery from the manufacturers and its own stocks. The average outlet would hold 30,000-40,000 parts, and can obtain components from anywhere in the group. It is this industry-wide trend towards computerised stock control, plus the advantageous terms on which Finelist can buy components from manufacturers, which convinces Mr Swan that the automotive distribution sector is ripe for consolidation. The group estimates that the UK has 2,400 outlets, a quarter of which are operated by the three national chains - Brown Brothers (part of Dana UK), Edmunds Walker (part of Unipart) and Partco, an unquoted Coventry-based group. Mr Swan believes many family-owned businesses are struggling to compete. They have to rely on paper catalogues to keep track of the increasing number of components in demand, which reflects the greater variety of models on the road. As well as making more small cash acquisitions, Mr Swan said the group would be prepared to issue paper for a larger acquisition before the end of year. BZW is acting as brokers to the flotation, which is being sponsored by NatWest Markets Corporate Finance.</p>

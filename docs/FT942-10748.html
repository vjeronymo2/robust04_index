			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / The Markets: Fed credibility on the line - Global Investor The US Federal Reserve could move as early as this morning to raise short-term interest rates, for if it fails to provide rapid reassurance to a very jittery market it may face a week of tumbling stock and bond prices and further weakening of the dollar. There can be no doubt that a Fed tightening is imminent. What remains unclear is whether the central bank will wait until the next meeting of its policy-making Open Market Committee, on Tuesday of next week, and how large a rate rise it will sanction. There is a powerful case for immediate, strong action. Last Friday's better-than-expected April employment figures prices, which so badly spooked the bond market, demonstrated that the US economy is growing vigorously - probably at a 3.5 to 4 per cent annual rate - and so far showing few signs of the more modest performance widely predicted for later this year. While inflation remains subdued for now, the current 3.75 per cent Fed funds rate is still a considerable way from the neutral rate the Fed is aiming for, which arguably lies in the 4.5 per cent range. The persistent rise in bond yields since February's initial tightening, and last Friday's jump - the biggest one day increase since the Gulf war - show that the market simply does not trust the bank's policy of incremental, 25 basis point increases in Fed funds as an inflation-fighting instrument. Its anxiety is being heightened by the Clinton administration's nomination of Mr Alan Blinder as Fed vice chairman, given his reputation (deserved or not) for softness on inflation. Fed tightening early this week could restore a measure of calm to the bond market, and would also clear the air ahead of this week's Dollars 29bn of Treasury auctions, starting with tomorrow's sale of three-year notes. Whenever the bank acts, the general expectation is that it will put at least 25 basis points on Fed funds and increase the discount rate for the first time in this cycle, with a 50 basis point rise. But a 50 basis point increase in both rates would send a much better anti-inflation signal to the markets. The politicians would hate it, and so might stocks, but a firm demonstration of resolve could lay the basis for an eventual rally at the long end of the bond market. It would also help underpin the dollar, at least in the short term. While longer-term structural factors (including a deepening current account deficit and outflow of investment funds) may explain much of the dollar's unexpected weakness, the recent plunge in the currency is due in no small measure to lack of confidence in US monetary policy. COMMODITIES The surge in international commodity prices on Friday also represented a vote of no confidence in the Fed's anti-inflation credentials as speculative funds poured into a broad range of assets, including precious metals, copper, coffee and oil. However, the bull run hid a range of differing fundamental factors in the various markets which suggest it is too soon in the current cycle to expect a sustained surge in across-the -board prices - though the long-term trend is upwards. Gold, in particular, would be vulnerable to a decisive tightening move by the Fed. Copper prices may stay firm thanks to the strength of the US economy and glimmerings of European recovery, but increased supply later in the year could have a depressing impact on the market. The coffee rally, which has taken prices up by nearly 40 per cent since the start of the year on supply constraints, may be due for a correction, though the outlook remains fundamentally strong. Oil, having rallied by more than Dollars 4 a barrel since mid-February, was further buoyed last week by fighting in the Yemen and output problems in the North Sea. The Yemen is not a big producer, and the markets should rapidly adjust to any supply disruptions. But indications of higher global demand in the second half of this year - underscored in a report last week from the International Energy Agency - should help underpin the market's rally. KODAK Shareholders in Eastman Kodak will gather this Wednesday for the company's annual meeting in much better spirits than for very many years. Mr George Fisher, chairman since December, has moved rapidly to reverse a decade of misguided diversification which has left the group with a heavy debt burden and lacklustre earnings growth. The first fruits of the new management style were put on display for Wall Street analysts last week when Mr Fisher announced plans to sell off three big businesses, including Sterling Drug, the pharmaceuticals business Kodak bought for Dollars 5.1bn in 1988. Fisher's plan, which squares with what the investment community has been urging Kodak to do for years, is to concentrate the company's resources on its core imaging business. That means both squeezing better earnings out of its conventional silver halide photographic business, through cost cutting and market share gains, and focusing more energy on digital photography, which some forecasts reckon could account for 25 per cent of the image market by the turn of the century. However, Kodak's new vigour does not make the stock a strong buy. The disposals look like being fairly neutral for earnings, and Kodak shares, which stand plump in the middle of their 52 week range, are not particularly cheap, with a prospective p/e ratio of 16. Mr Fisher is promising to boost the return on net assets from about 6 per cent last year to at least 12 per cent by 1999. He should be able to take plenty of fat out of the paternalistic company's cost structure, but Kodak's traditional film business faces increasing competition from branded rivals like Japan's Fuji and private label manufacturers such as 3M. And while Mr Fisher's high technology background - as former chief executive of Motorola - holds promise for the digital imaging business, there are no signs yet of this sector making a substantial contribution to group profits. KEMPER Kemper's agreement yesterday to open negotiations with General Electric on a Dollars 60 a share takeover bid looks good both for GE and the holders of Kemper shares - some 10 per cent of whom are based in Europe. GE, which has faced persistent rebuffs from Kemper's management, will finally get a chance to look at the company's books and determine whether its property portfolio is sufficiently cleaned up to merit a formal tender offer at this level. If so, a takeover will give GE a powerful leg up in the fund management business. Kemper, for its part, has managed to get GE to increase its offer from Dollars 55 a share to Dollars 60, and its management avoids what was likely to have been an embarrassing defeat at its annual meeting - due this Wednesday but now put off until August. GE, in an effort to get Kemper to open bid negotiations, had submitted an annual meeting resolution to put four of its nominees on the board in place of Kemper directors up for re-election, including Mr David Mathis, the chairman. Investors had a strong interest in voting for GE, since failure of the resolution would have probably sent Kemper's shares tumbling back towards the Dollars 40 level at which they were trading before GE first made a bid approach. That was because GE was unlikely to launch a hostile tender offer and there were no signs that GE's activity would flush out a rival offer. Kemper's agreement to talk just days ahead of the annual meeting mirrors the white flag displayed in similar circumstances three years ago by computer company NCR, which after months of stone-walling opened negotiations with hostile bidder AT&amp;T shortly before an annual meeting vote on the composition of its board. Like NCR's stone-walling, Kemper's two months of rebuffing GE has served shareholders well. Its submission now is a sensible acknowledgement that the time has come to talk. It also removes the possibility that Mr Mathis might have lost his job on Wednesday - hardly an outcome to strengthen Kemper's hand in the hard bargaining that may yet lie ahead.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------              TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 5/5/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                % change over period                      US   Japan   Germany   France   Italy      UK  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week               0.07    0.04     0.11     0.10     0.15    0.09 Month              0.32    0.19     0.48     0.51     0.69    0.44 Year               3.31    3.25     6.56     7.00    10.69    6.19  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              -0.14    0.09     0.32    -0.27    -0.09   -0.62 Month             -0.34    0.16    -0.19    -0.70     0.24   -0.98 Year              -0.18    9.08     6.94     7.27    19.21    5.30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week              -0.29   -0.62    -0.21    -1.56    -0.95   -1.23 Month             -0.15   -0.98    -1.85    -3.02    -1.24   -2.57 Year              -1.25    5.30     5.74     6.58    25.56    5.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week                0.7    -0.6     -0.7      0.3     -3.4    -0.7 Month               0.9     0.3      3.6      2.6      5.5     0.1 Year                4.2    -0.8     35.9     19.8     47.1    16.8  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            BEST PERFORMING STOCKS FROM FT-A WORLD INDICES                   IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO  5/5/94  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                               % change                                     Close    Week    Month     Year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Syntex Corp.

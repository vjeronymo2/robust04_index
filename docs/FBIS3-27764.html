Han said on Sunday, however, he did not know the exact  status  of Kim Chong-hwi, former senior secretary for Foreign and  National Security Affairs to President No Tae-u, in the United  States.    Kim, wanted in South Korea on suspicion of accepting bribes  in connection with the Yulgok military buildup program, was  reported to have applied for permanent U.S. residency.    Han made the remark to reporters at Kimpo International  Airport Sunday after he arrived from Washington to attend a  conference of heads of diplomatic missions.    With regard to the North Korean nuclear problem Han said the  issue will have to be referred to the U.N. Security Council if  North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  fail to reach any agreement on IAEA inspection of North Korean  nuclear facilities by Feb. 21.    Korean Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae, who also arrived  for the conference on Sunday, said that the Seoul government has  informed North Korea through China that Pyongyang has to allow  IAEA inspection by Feb. 21 when the IAEA convenes a meeting of  Board of Directors in Vienna.    "I have been meeting responsible Chinese officials from time  to time to discuss problems aimed at resolving the North Korean  nuclear problem," Hwang added.    On the planned visit to China by President Kim Yong-sam,  Hwang said the date is tentatively set for late March and  preparations for it are progressing smoothly, Hwang said.    Since President Kim is going to visit China as a state  guest,  he will be meeting his Chinese counterpart Jiang Zemin and other  top Chinese leaders, he said.    Commenting on the establishment of air routes to China,  Hwang  said the two countries will first set up a regular air route  between Seoul and Beijing before starting to negotiate for an  air route between Seoul and Shanghai.    Hwang said he hoped the air route question will be resolved  by the time President Kim visits China.</p>

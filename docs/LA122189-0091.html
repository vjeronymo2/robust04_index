			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: REGION;  </P> <P> FERGUSON CANDIDACY OKD  </P> <P> State election officials cleared the way Tuesday for Assemblyman Gil Ferguson  (R-Newport Beach) to run for a coveted state Senate seat in a special election  that was set for Feb. 6.  </P> <P> Other candidates for the seat vacated by the resignation of state Sen. William  Campbell include Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whitter), whose 52nd District also  includes the San Gabriel Valley communities of Diamond Bar, Hacienda Heights,  La Habra Heights, Rowland Heights, Walnut and part of West Covina.  </P> <P> Striking a compromise between warring Republican candidates, Gov. George  Deukmejian on Tuesday set the Feb. 6 date for the primary election and set  April 10 for the general election to replace Campbell.  </P> <P> Ferguson was assured a spot in the Feb. 6 primary on Tuesday when election  officials ruled that he had narrowly met a 30-day residency requirement when he  moved to Laguna Beach last month to be eligible to run.  </P></p>

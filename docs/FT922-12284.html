			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Economics Notebook: Time to find a free trade vision in the crystal ball The high season for crystal ball gazing is here again. Over the next four weeks, those two august guardians of the world economy - the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development - will publish new forecasts for global growth, inflation and trade. The good news is that both bodies will project a gradual recovery that should see the world economy growing in line with long-term trends in about 18 month's time. The bad news is that both have been singing the same tune for more than a year during which the point of recovery has been postponed and clear evidence of economic revival has remained elusive. There will be a strong sense of deja vu about the latest IMF forecast when published this week. A year ago, the fund projected world economic growth of 2.9 per cent in 1992 after an anaemic 1.2 per cent last year. The IMF is now expected to forecast world growth of about 3.5 per cent - but for 1993 - after 1.5 per cent in 1992. A similar story of postponed prosperity comes from the Paris-based OECD. It recently cut its internal growth projection for the industrialised world in 1992 to between 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent from 2.2 per cent predicted in December. But what significance should be attached to these forecasting errors? Will it always be a case of 'jam tomorrow' as far as economic recovery is concerned, or do special factors lie behind the delayed upturn? If economists agree on one thing, it is that it is very difficult to spot turning points in activity in advance. Since the late 1980s, this problem has been exaggerated by the effects of fast growing indebtedness and subsequent asset price deflation in, first, the English-speaking economies of the US, the UK and Australia and, now, Japan. But the forecasting failures have also highlighted mistaken policy choices. Virtually all countries consider that low inflation is a necessary pre-condition for sustained and balanced growth - and here the success achieved in pushing inflation lower is promising for the world economy. But it has also become clear that over-reliance on monetary policy to combat price rises has damaged economic activity. blunt instrument was acknowledged last week by one of the world's most committed inflation fighters: the Reserve Bank of New Zealand. It admitted that there was some validity in arguments that it should have eased monetary policy earlier than September last year. The bank, which has responsibility for getting annual inflation within a zero to 2 per cent band by the end of 1993, has already brought it below 1 per cent but at the cost of very low growth. Similar doubts can be heard in Canada, where inflation has fallen to around 2 per cent after a deep recession. The length and depth of Britain's recession also suggest that it was a mistake to hold bank base rates at 15 per cent for a full year until October 1990 while sterling was allowed to rise in value ahead of entry into the European exchange rate mechanism. Conversely, easier monetary policy cannot be guaranteed to deliver sound economic recovery on its own. The US Federal Reserve System has pushed interest rates to their lowest levels for nearly 30 years. But the recovery remains fragile and is likely to be weak compared with previous US experience, largely because of the huge and persistent US budget deficit that raises fears of future inflation among investors in US bonds. For these reasons, we can expect to hear a lot more about the need for better policy mixes in the months and years ahead. A debate on this issue is likely at next Sunday's meeting of ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Washington. Governments agree that one of the best ways of securing continuing prosperity in the long term is to curb public spending and reduce fiscal deficits. But reducing fiscal deficits is a difficult and politically unrewarding task at the best of times. At present, none of the major industrial countries - with the possible exception of Japan - has a particularly strong fiscal position. Yet fiscal sobriety is unlikely to help Japan in the G7 meeting. Instead, the authorities in Tokyo, who are struggling to control an increasingly worrying attack of asset price deflation, are likely to be under pressure to borrow more to boost their own economy and so prevent Japan's threatened recession crimping growth abroad. It is easy to see how the policy mix debate could turn into one about issues, which although important, will go only a part of the way to achieving stable economic growth. But there is one area - trade - where a bold stroke could deliver more. A new study* by two OECD economists claims that the removal of global trade barriers would yield annual economic gains of Dollars 475bn (Pounds 268bn) after 10 years, with Dollars 255bn accruing to the OECD member states and Dollars 220bn to developing and former communist countries. Completing the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations would bring gains of Dollars 195bn and more than Dollars 90bn respectively in the same time frame. The virtues of freer trade were underlined last week by Mr Nicholas Brady, the US Treasury Secretary. US exports to Mexico had increased from Dollars 10bn to Dollars 33bn a year in the past five years as the two countries lowered their barriers. Nor were the benefits confined to US states on the Mexican border: the third biggest beneficiary after Texas and California was Michigan. Mr Brady said the benefits of freer trade were 'so clear' one could hope that 'the individual counties would do the right thing'. It is view shared by virtually all G7 finance ministers. Unfortunately, they are not responsible for the Uruguay Round negotiations. *Trade Liberalisation: What's at Stake, by Ian Goldin and Dominique van der Mensbrugghe, available free after May 26, 1992 from OECD Development Centre, 94 rue Chardon-Lagache, Paris 75016.</p>

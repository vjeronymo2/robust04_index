She was speaking in Oslo immediately after Norwegian and EU  ministers had agreed here on the terms for Norway to join the  Union along with Austria, Finland and Sweden on January 1 next  year.    Brundtland announced an immediate start of campaigning to  persuade Norwegian voters to ratify EU membership in a  referendum later in the year.    Similar referendums are also planned in the other three  applicant countries, which reached agreement on EU membership  two weeks earlier on March 1.    Opposition to EU membership is strongest in Norway.  Norwegians have already rejected membership of what was then  the European Economic Community once before, in 1972, when a  referendum rejected a treaty of accession that saw Britain,  Denmark and Ireland join the Community.    According to latest polls, opponents still number 44 percent  of the population against 28 percent in favour. But the gap is  narrowing.    In a speech which was distributed here, Brundtland said  Norway had achieved all its objectives in the negotiations,  including special financial support for its cold climate  agriculture.    But diplomats conceded that the Norwegian Government would  have to persuade their electorate that they had lived up to  their pledge not to grant "a single extra fish" to foreign  fishing boats seeking to exploit Norwegian waters.    "I don't know how the agreement will be received on the  coasts of Norway," Fisheries Minister Jan Henry T. Olsen  admitted here at a press conference.    Oslo's accord with the EU had been held up for two weeks  because of a dispute with Spain over Spanish demands for access  to the fish-rich waters if Norway joined the Union.    Ultimately, Norway conceded about 6,000 tonnes of cod catch  quotas a year -- mainly to Spain and Portugal. [passage omitted]    Oslo was pressed into agreeing not to export whale products,  so that whale hunting will be limited to a handful of families  which traditionally have made their living from it.    Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Tore Godal said membership  of the EU was important for security. "Norway is still located  at a strategically important crossroads. By joining the EU and  participating in its common foreign and security policies, we  will ensure that relations between Norway and Russia become part  of Russia's relations with an integrated Europe, not merely  relations between a major power and a small neighbouring  country," Godal said.</p>

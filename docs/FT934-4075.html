			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Arts: An appealing Tosca - Opera The advent of Anna Tomowa-Sintow and Sergey Leiferkus as Tosca and Scarpia in the Royal Opera's umpteenth revival of Puccini's opera on Saturday brought a reminder that we were supposed to be hearing them as Yaroslavna and Prince Igor. Or, put another way, they had been engaged to sing in the first revival of Borodin's Prince Igor until Baroness Warnock intervened on behalf of the Arts Council and recommended the substitution of interesting rarities with popular runs. At a time when the Arts Council is preparing to abandon further responsibilities, it was particularly irksome to be reminded of this loss. But any opportunity to hear Tomowa-Sintow and Leiferkus - both making role debuts at Covent Garden - is always welcome. The Russian baritone, surely now at his peak, lifted what was already a well-sung performance on to an altogether higher plain: he is a mesmerising actor and every gesture counts - here his police chief oozed malevolence - but above all it is his vocal characterisation that makes his portrayals so compelling. His dark, burnished tone was always focused, the line musically moulded. Anna Tomowa-Sintow may not be an obvious Tosca, but this was an appealing performance. Though she looks a touch matronly, her voice remains beautiful and steady. Her 'Vissi d'arte' had a disarming honesty about it. Alberto Cupido's Cavaradossi is familiar to London audiences. He cuts a credible figure and sings generously; at times, though, pitch and tone got squeezed at the top. The smaller roles were carefully observed. Mark Beesley made a desperate Angelotti, and Eric Garrett - though prone to some overacting - an amusing Sacristan. None of the performers allowed this old-fashioned and traditional staging - Zeffirelli created the original for Maria Callas 29 years ago, and it was revised by John Cox in 1991 - to look tired. Edward Downes was making a welcome appearance in the pit. His reading was broad, securely paced, so musical that one almost forgot Prince Igor was missing. But Borodin's opera is still impatiently awaited, and bringing it back must now be put high on the Royal Opera's agenda. Further performances: December 7, 10, 13, 16 and 18</p>

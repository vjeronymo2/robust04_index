			<p><P> April 26, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. SCIENTISTS TO BE SHOWN FUSION TESTS  </P> <P> Two researchers who say they have mastered fusion, the process that powers the  sun and the stars, told Congress today that they will duplicate their  experiments for government scientists in hopes of quieting skeptics.  </P> <P> "We have 19 experiments being set up now," University of Utah chemist Stanley  Pons told the House Science Committee, including a demonstration of  room-temperature fusion for scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratory.  </P> <P> Pons said the federal scientists will monitor the experiment in Utah, then  dismantle it and take it to the national laboratory in New Mexico for further  tests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Silence Skepticism  </P> <P> Pons and his collaborator, Martin Fleischmann of the University of Southampton  in England, are making the arrangement to silence some of the skepticism about  their claim to have discovered a way to achieve fusion using ordinary lab  equipment assembled on a table top.  </P> <P> The two announced their discovery March 23, stunning nuclear physicists around  the world who have attempted to achieve fusion for 25 years using  multimillion-dollar machines.  </P> <P> The hearing was jammed with journalists, scientists and industrial  representatives eager to learn more about a reaction that some predict could  produce plentiful electric power with little environmental pollution or threat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gave Off Heat  </P> <P> Pons told the committee how he and Fleischmann had inserted electrodes of  platinum and palladium in a flask containing deuterium oxide, or heavy water.  Electrical current was applied to the platinum electrode, Pons said, forcing  deuterium atoms into the crystal lattice of the palladium.  </P> <P> He said that after the experiment ran for several hours, the deuterium became  compressed and fused.  </P></p>

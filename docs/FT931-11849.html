			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television This is a particularly meaty Monday night for documentaries, but for plenty of viewers the pick of the bunch may be World in Action's Don't Bank on Us (ITV, 8.30), an investigation into the abrupt decline in reputation experienced by Britain's banks. The programme, postponed from last week, examines allegations of over-charging. Looking beyond such parochial concerns, there is the first of a two-part Panorama, The Bitter-Enders (BBC 1, 9.30), in which David Dimbleby looks deep into the heart of South Africa's tragic and seemingly unstoppable violence. 'Bitter-enders', it appears, were the Afrikaners who turned their backs on peace at the close of the Boer War. Horizon; No Ordinary Genius (BBC 2, 8.00) concludes its portrait of the prodigiously talented physicist, Richard Feynman. Earlier, a well-made and enthralling series returns to the screen, A Secret World of Sex (BBC 2, 7.30). Tonight's episode is a reminder of a time, not long ago, when for a woman to have a child out of wedlock could be interpreted as deviation bordering on lunacy.</p>

The decree's single paragraph,  signed by Franco, reads: "Any modifications to the subsidiary  agreements and acts that may entail the revision of this  agreement, as well as any acts that, according to the terms of  Article No. 49, clause No. 1, of the federal Constitution, may  entail demands or burdensome commitments on the national economy  will be subject to the approval of the national Congress."    This paragraph was included at the request of Senator Dirceu  Carneiro (PSDB-SC [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Santa  Catarina]), who coordinated the agreement.    The agreement's main purpose is that the member states  "accept the application of safeguards for all nuclear materiel  used in all nuclear activities carried out within their  respective territory, under their jurisdiction or their control  at any site, with the sole purpose of assuring that the materiel  not be used to produce nuclear weapons or other explosive  nuclear devices."    The agreement contains 98 articles and refers to the  implementation of safeguards, the supply of information to the  agency, inspectors' privileges and immunity, a common accounting  and control system for nuclear materiel, subsidiary agreements,  and the scope of inspections, among other issues.    As for the subsidiary agreements, the most polemic subject  during the agreement's debate by the Senate Foreign Affairs  Committee, the agreement states: "Considering the accounting  and control system, the ABACC, the interested member states, and  the agency will reach detailed subsidiary agreements that will  allow the agency to efficiently fulfill its duties specified in  the current agreement."</p>

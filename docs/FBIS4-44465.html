			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fei Shuang (7378 7208): "China Active in </F> International Capital Market--World Credit Market Expanded  Rapidly Last Year"]    [Text] The latest figures, on 27 February, from the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  showed that in 1993 China strengthened its position as a main  player in the international capital market by giving the  fast-growing international market a pounding.    In 1993 China issued stock with a value of $1.2 billion, a  quarter of the value of all stocks issued in Asia. Last year the  value of stocks issued in Asia increased by 250 percent, from  $1.8 billion in 1992 to $4.5 billion.    At the same time, in consortium loans China is the largest  loan country in Asia, and the value of its total loans has  increased from $2.7 billion in 1992 to $3.6 billion. China has  almost a quarter of the value of all bank loans in Asia. In 1993  its bank loans in Asia grew 30 percent, to $15.4 billion.    China is also one of the main players in the bond market; in  1993 it raised $3 billion by issuing bonds. This made the funds  raised by China in the abovementioned three ways to toal $7.8  billion.    The OECD also said that in 1993 the amount of loans on the  world market grew by a third, to a record $811 billion. The  demand for bond issues in Asia and Latin America caused the  amount of capital raised on the markets of developing countries  to reach an unprecedented $84 billion. The OECD added that the  market activity could still be dynamic in the future.    The part of the OECD report on trends in financial markets  said that the cause of this amazing growth was that the amount  of loans of OECD countries grew $150 billion, as well as the  active seeking of loans on the capital market by the dynamic  Asian countries and the Latin American countries headed by  Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina.    The capital raised by OECD countries rose from $536 billion  in 1992 to $691 billion, accounting for 85 percent of world  loans, the lowest figure since 1985. Among the main debtor  countries in the OECD, America and Japan are still in first  place. A survey showed that the capital raised by America and  Japan increased respectively from $95 billion and $76 billion in  1992 to $125 billion and $85 billion. The capital raised by  Germany almost doubled -- from $28 billion in 1992 to $65  billion. Next were France, which raised $58 billion; Britain,  which raised $51 billion; and Canada, which raised $39 billion.    The capital raised by the developing countries has almost  doubled -- from $47.3 billion in 1992 to $84.5 billion. Their  share of the market has increased from 7.8 percent two years ago  to 10.4 percent.</p>

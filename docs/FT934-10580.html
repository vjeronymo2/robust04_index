			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / International Company News: IBM makes foray into hand-held devices INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is making its first foray into the nascent market for hand-held computer/communicator devices with the introduction of Simon, a hand-held cellular telephone-cum-computer. The device is to be sold in the US by BellSouth Cellular, one of the leading US cellular telephone service providers. Simon weighs just over a pound and looks much like an ordinary cellular telephone, with a touch-sensitive display instead of the usual dial pad. However, unlike earlier 'personal digital assistants', such as Apple's Newton, Simon is primarily a communications device. Its functions include: facsimile, paging, electronic mail, calendar and appointments diary, address book, calculator and pen-based note pad, as well as cellular telephone. Unlike Apple's Newton, which deciphers handwritten notes and turns them into text, Simon stores the image of a written note and sends it via the cellular network to a facsimile machine.</p>

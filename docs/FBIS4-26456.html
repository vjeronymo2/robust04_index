			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by ANHUI RIBAO contributing commentator: "Study </F> the New Fiscal and Taxation Systems and Seize the Initiative in  Providing Leadership"]    [Text] In our reform of the economic structure this year,  we will combine package reform with breakthroughs in key areas,  with reform of the fiscal and taxation systems constituting a  key content. Successfully carrying out fiscal and taxation  system reform is of great significance to accelerating the  establishment of a socialist market economic structure; further  straightening out interest relationships among various sectors;  enhancing the enthusiasm of people at various levels;  simultaneously increasing revenue and stimulating economic  development; and to upgrading Anhui's economic level and overall  strength. To ensure the smooth progress of reform, many areas  have conscientiously studied and publicized the new fiscal and  taxation systems. Although they have achieved some results in  this respect, we should be aware that work done thus far is  entirely insufficient. Quite a number of comrades, including  many leading comrades and those directly engaged in economic  work, have failed to attach sufficient importance to knowledge  of fiscal and taxation system reform. Instead of carefully and  thoroughly studying the new fiscal and taxation systems, they  only understand them in general terms, and are not clear about  how to handle problems encountered in the course of implementing  the new systems. Therefore, they have not taken the initiative  to adapt themselves to the new situation and to switch to a new  idea for economic development. This state of affairs is  entirely incompatible with the new situation.    Anhui is now at the critical phase of accelerating  development. Whether or not we can seize the opportunity,  advance by taking advantage of the situation, and keep the  development momentum, depends heavily on our ability to pass the  test of fiscal and taxation system reform. To Anhui, the  introduction of the new fiscal and taxation systems is both a  challenge and an opportunity, and is both pressure and a motive  force. Through implementing the new fiscal and taxation  systems, we should redirect the guiding thought for economic  work at different levels to optimizing structures and improving  efficiency, in order to create new conditions and a new motive  force for Anhui's economic development. Meanwhile, as the  factors of increased spending have risen this year, we should  handle the relationship among reform, development, and stability  well. This also requires that we concentrate on doing our  fiscal and taxation work well. Therefore, cadres at all levels,  particularly leading cadres, must enhance their understanding of  the importance of thoroughly studying the new fiscal and  taxation systems. They should know that this is an important  matter which has a bearing on Anhui's economic development as a  whole, and therefore, they should do it well. Efforts should be  made, through a thorough study of the new fiscal and taxation  systems, to enhance Anhui people's awareness of opportunities  and competition. We should make serious efforts to tackle  reform of the fiscal and taxation systems, accelerate economic  development, increase revenue and reduce expenditure, and ensure  that there will be a surplus in the balance between revenue and  expenditure this year; thereby laying the foundation for  economic development and an increase in tax revenues in the  future.    In strengthening the study of fiscal and taxation system  reform, it is necessary to conduct investigations in all  localities. Leading cadres at all levels and comrades from  various relevant departments should visit various localities,  trades, and enterprises to specifically study and analyze the  situation to obtain first-hand information. By combining  qualitative and quantitative analysis, they should get a good  picture of the local situation.    On the basis of  investigation and study, leading cadres and comrades of various  departments should actively work to meet the requirements of the  new fiscal and taxation systems, further straighten out their  development plans, and readjust the economic structure. In  particular, they should have a clear understanding of the  following points: First, they should stick to the concept of  development; keep in mind the importance of increasing tax  revenues and boosting economic development; vigorously cultivate  new trades for expanding the economy; promote the coordinated  development of first, secondary, and tertiary industries; open  up new avenues of financial resources; and make economic  development the reliable basis for expanding tax revenues.  Second, it is necessary to enhance awareness of efficiency,  firmly establish the standard -- "economic development is based  on efficiency, the improvement of efficiency is based on profits  and taxes, and the increase in profits and taxes can be  determined from the amount of profits and taxes delivered to the  state"; accelerate readjustment of the economic structure;  invest limited funds and resources in industries and products  which comply with state industrial policies, give quick returns,  and have high added value; and pay attention to efficiency in  economic development. Third, it is necessary to change the  concept of supporting enterprises by relying purely on reducing  taxes and transferring profits; improve the relationship between  the government and enterprises; and ensure that all taxes are  collected; at the same time, after localities have strengthened  their financial power, they should concentrate on supporting  enterprises. Fourth, it is necessary to give equal importance  to broadening sources of income and reducing expenditure, and  resolutely put a stop to extravagance and wastefulness.    Fiscal and taxation system reform is a specialized job and  involves a wide range of subjects. It will be difficult to  carry out if we do not work hard. All localities and  departments should, on the basis of preliminary studies, make  further efforts to conduct a comprehensive and systematic study  to tackle existing problems and to increase their understanding  of the reform. In particular, they should thoroughly study the  new situation and contradictions which have emerged in the  practice of the new systems. They should avoid being satisfied  with a general and conceptual understanding, and overcome the  tendency to simplify matters because they are difficult to  understand. Leading cadres should take the lead in engaging in  studies; personally conduct investigations and studies; and  seize the initiative in leading economic work. Fiscal and  taxation system reform involves various sectors and the vital  interests of the masses. When new policies and regulations are  promulgated, the relevant departments should see to it that they  are quickly implemented in grass-roots areas and enterprises.  They should promptly discover and sum up the work experiences  of various localities, and vigorously popularize them to promote  the smooth advance of fiscal and taxation system reform.</p>

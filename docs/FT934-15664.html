			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Pressure on Libya at UN over Lockerbie THE UNITED Nations Security Council will today begin formal discussions on a draft US, British and French resolution tightening sanctions against Libya which could go to a vote within days. British officials expressed confidence the resolution would be approved. This follows Libya's refusal to turn over for trial in a US or Scottish court two men accused of planting the bomb which destroyed a PanAm flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988 - and their failure to volunteer themselves for trial. A 15-strong team of international defence lawyers said after a two-day meeting in Tripoli with the two men that they saw legal impediments to their clients receiving a fair trial in Scotland. They expressed 'grave concern' that any trial there would be prejudiced by the extensive publicity surrounding the case. The meeting was part of a complex series of moves which British and other western diplomats claim is simply an elaborate attempt to buy time and perhaps stall imposition of sanctions.</p>

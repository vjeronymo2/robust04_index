			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Cut the strings on the parachute: Some UK executives receive large pay-offs on leaving companies, but pressure is mounting for reform When Mr Tim Redman became a non-executive director of UK regional brewer Greene King this summer, after 17 years as an executive director, he received a pay-off of Pounds 165,000. Greene King is chaired by Mr Simon Redman - Tim's cousin - and the company states in its annual report that the money was paid after the termination of his employment contract. Mr Simon Redman describes the pay-off as 'entirely appropriate'. But to some institutional shareholders it is another example of how companies are willing to pay out large sums to former directors. The issue of executive pay-offs has been brought into the spotlight recently as a succession of directors have received seven-figure sums when they they have left leading UK companies. Both the City of London and the government are becoming increasingly uneasy about 'golden parachutes', and are stepping up calls for large pay-offs to be curtailed. The principal cause of high pay-outs are so-called rolling contracts - employment contracts without a fixed term but with a lengthy notice period, often of up to three years. Directors who have such contracts usually receive large sums in compensation if their employment is terminated at any time. In recent months, companies which have agreed to large pay-offs to directors on long rolling contracts - for instance, the Pounds 2.02m paid to Mr Peter Davis by Anglo-Dutch publisher Reed Elsevier following his resignation as co-chairman - have been put under pressure by campaigns to reform this practice. One institutional shareholder, PosTel, has been largely responsible for bringing the issue to public attention. Its chief executive, Mr Alastair Ross Goobey, announced recently that he would be using PosTel's Pounds 25bn-worth of funds - which control about 1.5 per cent of the shares of each company quoted on the FT-SE All-Share index - to vote against the election and re-election of directors who have rolling contracts with notice periods of longer than two years. Mr Ross Goobey wants three-year rolling contracts to become a thing of the past. Currently the norm for directors of the largest UK quoted companies, they legally entitle a director to a pay-off the equivalent of three times basic salary. In particular he wants to end large payments to directors forced out following poor performance. He argues that moving 'to two-year rolling contracts is the first step in reducing the level of pay-offs'. Ideally, Mr Ross Goobey would like to see pay-offs to directors limited to one year's total remuneration. 'It is difficult to see any circumstances in which a director should get more than one year's money in a pay-off,' he said. Two months on from the launch of his campaign, there are signs of change. Even though three-year rolling contracts were effectively endorsed by the Cadbury Committee on corporate governance, whose code of practice took effect in July last year, evidence suggests that shorter rolling contracts - probably of two years - or fixed-term contracts could become the rule at leading UK companies. 'A trickle of companies changing their contracts has turned to a steady flow,' Mr Ross Goobey said. yesterday. PosTel's campaign appears to have the backing of Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Heseltine said recently: 'I would personally like to see a much stronger role of share owners acting to ensure these sort of practices (large pay-offs) are constrained.' The size of the problem is clear. A survey of the FT-SE Mid 250 index of the 250 largest quoted companies by Pirc, the UK corporate governance consultancy, found that compensation payments to former directors, disclosed in company accounts published in the year to June 30, totalled more than Pounds 19.4m. This included a Pounds 3.1m payment to Mr John Cahill when he resigned in February this year as chairman of British Aerospace, and Pounds 2.2m to Chris Greentree, former chief executive of oil company Lasmo, when he stepped down in January 1993. More recently, Mr John Bellak, former chairman of Severn Trent, was paid more than Pounds 512,626 in compensation for early retirement from the board of the privatised water company. The figure comprised Pounds 404,829 for 'early termination of his service contract' and Pounds 107,797 for future pension payments. Mr Bellak also received a salary package of Pounds 230,300. The scope for future pay-offs remains vast. Directors at 44 FT-SE 100 index companies have three-year rolling contracts, including 13 directors of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer group. Another 43 companies do not have any directors on contracts with rolling contracts longer than two years. Of the 44 companies with directors on three-year rolling contracts, several have recently paid compensation to former directors. For instance, when Dr Ernest Mario was ousted from his three-year rolling contract at pharmaceuticals group Glaxo in March 1993, he received a pay-off of Pounds 2.7m, to be paid over three years. Seven of the company's executive directors are still on three-year rolling contracts, which presents a potential liability to shareholders of about Pounds 11m. The figure represents three times the annual salary of all seven directors. PosTel plans to vote against the re-election of those directors on three-year rolling contracts up for re-election at Glaxo's annual general meeting later this year. A small but growing number of companies has heeded PosTel's warning. Four FT-SE 100 companies, including Ladbroke, the leisure group, have decided to put new directors on two-year rolling contracts, and nine other companies in the index have moved, or are planning to move, all their directors to acceptable contracts. The most striking example of the influence of PosTel and other institutional shareholders is the announcement by Guinness, the drinks group, last week that three of its executive directors had moved from three-year rolling contracts to three-year fixed-term contracts to be renewed annually. Guinness said the company's 'non-executive committee', which sets executive pay, had made the change after it had 'listened to shareholders', including 'one shareholder in particular'. Its most recently published report and accounts for the year ending December 31 1993 showed the company had agreed to pay Mr Crispin Davis, an executive director until his resignation last October, the sum of Pounds 670,000. Such pay-offs should no longer be made. Other examples of companies which have pruned their directors' three-year rolling contracts include British Gas and Argyll, the UK's third-largest food retailer, which announced its move at its annual meeting last month. At British Aerospace the three-year rolling contracts of three executive directors, including chief executive Dick Evans, are set to be cut soon. Textiles group Courtaulds is also considering PosTel's demand to shorten contracts. Mr Sipko Huismans, chief executive, was one of the first directors to have his re-election voted against by PosTel at the company's annual general meeting last month, though his re-election went ahead. While many UK companies have been swayed by PosTel, some companies and fund managers are critical of Mr Ross Goobey's stance. Some argue the campaign will do little to reduce the size of pay-offs. 'PosTel's move is like pushing a balloon in one point which then comes out in another point. Life may not be as simple as PosTel thinks,' one fund manager said. Companies such as Thorn EMI, where four directors including chairman Sir Colin Southgate are on three-year rolling contracts, say they will resist PosTel. Other opponents have tried to sidestep a possible confrontation. At BAT, for example, whose own Threadneedle Asset Management subsidiary has Pounds 30bn under management, six executive directors - five of whom have three-year rolling contracts - have had a clause inserted in their contracts by the company which says that they must search for another job if they are forced off the BAT board. If they do not, their compensation will be affected. Whether the clause is sufficient to ward off action by PosTel against the directors with three-year rolling contracts is unclear. For a small, but influential, group of fund managers and severance pay lawyers, PosTel's campaign does not go far enough. They argue that pruning one year off directors' contracts will do little to cut pay-offs, and that Mr Ross Goobey should concentrate on persuading companies to be tougher in compensation negotiations. 'The size of pay-offs should be the issue and not the length of contracts,' one director said. According to Ms Melanie Tether, a partner in City law firm Norton Rose who specialises in employment law, reducing a director's notice period from three to two years is likely to reduce the average pay-off from twice basic salary to one and a half times. While directors can claim up to three years' pay on a three-year rolling contract, they usually settle for less. 'Moving from three years to two years will not make a big difference to the size of payments as the third year is the one the company has the strongest case for not paying out,' she said, because most former directors should have found a job after two years. Ms Tether said institutions should try to persuade companies in which they have a significant stake to go through with 'one or two test cases' in which they show willingness to take former directors demanding substantial pay-offs to court. The threat of court action could be based on an executive's poor performance, for instance, or on his or her failure to seek new employment. At the moment, less than 5 per cent of executive pay-off negotiations in which she had been engaged had ended up in court, she said. The view that companies should be tougher in pay-off negotiations is supported by Mr Peter Brown of the Top Pay Research Group, an independent pay consultancy. 'PosTel's stance is entirely positive,' he said. 'But there should be more of an emphasis on mitigation - one or two cases will sort it out.' PosTel points out that most large companies refuse to use legal action to limit pay-offs, even to directors forced out for poor performance because it is both costly and time-cosuming. Mr Ross Goobey admits that his campaign is 'a bit of a blunderbuss - but then at least it is doing something about the issue . . . We shall monitor the effect of a general move to two-year contracts before deciding our next move.' For some, the public nature of Mr Ross Goobey's initiative is its most important characteristic, regardless of its effectiveness. 'The PosTel decision represents a major boost for proxy voting in the UK as it is the first time that a major institutional investor has publicly announced a voting policy which is specifically intended to change boardroom practice,' said Mr Stuart Bell, research director of Pirc. Mr Ross Goobey's influence in changing boardroom practices will be put to the test next month at a meeting of the investment committee of the Association of British Insurers. On the agenda for discussion is the possible damage that the campaign is doing to the relationship between companies and institutional shareholders. One committee member said: 'We want to try to contain the damage that has been done. There is general concern on our committee that we do not want to damage relationships with companies.' He said PosTel's move could lead to companies bucking the trend towards openness which started after the Cadbury report. 'A crusade in the press is not our style,' said a spokesman for Mercury Asset Management, the fund management group. 'We believe we can be just as effective by maintaining a healthy dialogue with the managers of the companies in which we invest.' There are, though, some signs of support for PosTel from other institutional shareholders. The National Association of Pension Funds, for instance, has said it is considering modifying its advice to members on contracts ahead of possible modifications to the Cadbury Code in 1995. And one other leading institutional shareholder said it had also started voting at annual general meetings against the re-election of those directors who sanction large pay-offs. A spokesman said: 'It's simple really - if someone succeeds, they are entitled to lots of money. But if they fail, they should not be made rich. We are striking at the directors who really count.'</p>

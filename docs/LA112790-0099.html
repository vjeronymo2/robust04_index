			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO;  </P> <P> COUNCIL CHOOSES CURTIS AS MAYOR  </P> <P> Councilman Robert A. Curtis was elected the fourth mayor of Mission Viejo  Monday night, and he pledged to lead the city into a new era of unity.  </P> <P> In his inaugural speech, Curtis said the last three years were marred by a  "fierce and continuous conflict that shook the very foundation of our fledgling  city."  </P> <P> Three new council members -- Sharon Cody, Robert Breton and Susan Withrow --  were sworn in by U.S. Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) during a ceremony at the  Oso Viejo Community Center.  </P> <P> Curtis was elected unanimously to serve a one-year term in office. Curtis in  February defeated a recall effort backed by nearly $500,000 in contributions by  the Mission Viejo Co. and other real estate interests. Cody, who supported the  anti-recall campaign and was the top vote-getter in the Nov. 6 election, was  elected vice mayor.  </P> <P> Three outgoing council members -- Christian W. Keena, Victoria C. Jaffe and  Norman P. Murray -- had supported the Curtis recall campaign, arguing that  Curtis' presence was disruptive to the council.  </P> <P> Curtis said Monday that he appreciates what it is to be a political minority,  and he pledged to respect "differing views" and to protect "dissenting voices."  </P> <P> Outlining his agenda for the 3-year-old city, Curtis said the city should  reconsider spending $1 million to renovate a building it recently bought for a  city hall. Curtis has favored an offer by the Mission Viejo Co. to donate 7.2  acres for a civic center in return for permission to build a 700-housing unit  development near the eastern boundary of the city.  </P> <P> "If Mission Viejo is to accept its leadership role in South Orange County, then  surely our seat of government should be a source of pride in keeping with that  pre-eminent status," Curtis said.  </P> <P> "I do not call for a Taj Mahal, but I do share voters' expectations that we  exercise foresight and prudent business practices to ensure that our civic  facilities meet future needs and engender pride among our residents."  </P> <P> The new council, he said, will also ask the city attorney whether it can  overturn a $15-million refuse hauling franchise awarded to Dewey's Rubbish  without a competitive bid.

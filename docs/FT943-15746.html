			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Survey of Italy (11): A jungle that must be cleared - David Lane on the prospects for further pension reforms Pensions are a fighting issue for Mr Sergio D'Antoni, general secretary of Italy's CISL trade union. He says, uncompromisingly, that the new regulations governing the country's state pension system that came into effect at the beginning of last year have put an end to the debate on pension reform. 'More changes would be wholly unacceptable.' Yet, as the dire state of public finances makes news and attention focuses on the yawning hole in the accounts of the INPS (Istituto Nazionale della Previdenza Sociale) national pension fund, reform is being mentioned by many. The recent court decision that awarded increases in second pensions, to lift them to minimum levels, spotlighted the awesome cost of pension provision and the awful condition of INPS' accounts. The cost of the court decision, which includes payment arrears from 1983, has been estimated at L32,500bn. The changes introduced by the Amato government, after decades of procrastination, now seem too little and too late. Until 1992 no government had been willing to tackle the spiny pension issue and risk disfavour with the electorate. Whether or not Mr D'Antoni wants the debate re-opened, this has happened, and proposals for further changes are being discussed. Gradualness is a feature of the Amato reform, which tried to ease the pain of extending retirement age by introducing the change over 10 years. The age for old age pensions was raised from 55 to 60 for women, and from 60 to 65 for men, in yearly steps every two years. The measure will thus only become fully effective at the beginning of 2002. Similarly, a gradual process lifts the number of years of pension fund contributions necessary to qualify for an old age pension from 15 to 20 years. The reform failed to address two matters that many consider critical. One is public sector pensions which, although not handled by INPS, are nevertheless a burden on public finances. Civil servants and local government officials can enjoy the pleasures of retirement after less than 30 years of employment. 'It is a jungle,' says Mr Bruno Trentin, the recently retired general secretary of the leftwing CGIL trade union. He considers that reform should first tackle public sector pensions. The other is the seniority pension (pensione di anzianita) which allows employees to retire on pension after 35 years of contributions to INPS. Clearly, any man or woman who started work at the age of 20 and has paid contributions continuously since then may retire at 55. 'Italy must eliminate the seniority pension,' says Mr Giovanni Palladino, head of the financial analysis division at Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation. He suggests raising the 35-year requirement to at least 42 years immediately, and believes that this will be done when the Amato government's pension reform is modified. 'There will be a tremendous uproar from the trade unions. But they should understand that the system must be changed for it to become viable and not be destroyed,' says Mr Palladino. Demographic factors are contributing to the erosion of INPS' viability. People retire earlier and are living longer. Figures from INPS show that the employees' fund has about 11.7m working contributors, while there are about 5.1m pensioners plus a further 2.7m dependents of deceased pensioners. In addition, there are 2.2m invalids drawing pensions from the employees' fund. INPS is a pay-as-you-go scheme, with contributions from active workers being used to pay current pensions. Every worker is therefore funding one pension being paid. Mr D'Antoni at CISL describes this as 'generational solidarity'. The call of solidarity is rather less among Italian shopkeepers, of whom 1.7m are presently paying contributions. They support 0.4m pensioners, 0.2m dependents of deceased pensioners and 0.2m invalids. However, the situation is very different for Italy's 0.9m active agricultural workers. They and other INPS contributors support 0.7m pensioners, 0.4m dependents of pensioners and 0.9m invalids. Generational solidarity is one feature of Italy's state pension scheme. Another is sectoral solidarity. INPS points out that funds generated by employees' contributions created substantial reserves in the 1960s. These were diverted to pay pensions to the self-employed - shopkeepers, tradesmen and agricultural smallholders - and to win their votes. These categories have contributed little but received a lot. INPS has also been called to pay for social policy measures decided by government. Instead of operating solely as the pension fund for which it was established, successive governments, with the consent of the trade unions which ran INPS until last year, used it as a social shock absorber. Since the economic crises of the 1970s, it has paid for early retirement programmes and unemployment pay, and has subsidised reduced contributions to encourage employment in depressed areas. INPS says that it disbursed L70,500bn last year in social assistance. Of this L25,000bn was paid to bring small pensions up to the minimum, L13,000bn to cover the deficit on agricultural workers' pensions, L9,000bn for subsidised reduced contributions, L8,000bn for reduced contributions for domestic workers, apprentices and trainees, L5,000bn for unemployment benefits, L5,000bn for benefits to the elderly without pensions, L3,500bn for early retirements and L2,000bn for other pensions. Required to range way beyond simply managing the funds of active workers to pay pensions to those who have been contributors, according to what they have paid in, INPS has serious problems in balancing its books. This year it expects to disburse L250,973bn, while receiving L178,823bn. The cash shortfall of L72,150bn (equal to about one half of the PSBR), will be covered by transfers from the treasury. With such figures making headlines in Italian newspapers, it is not surprising that the crash or collapse of INPS is being predicted and that there are calls for tough measures to correct the situation. In addition to making immediate changes to qualifying ages for old age and seniority pensions, another modification under consideration concerns the yield for calculating pension amounts. At present, this is 2 per cent of average annual wage in the final five years of employment, per year of contribution, giving 70 per cent for those with 35 years of contributions. Though the Amato reform has introduced changes to the number of years taken into account for the calculations, it has not touched the yield, which is generally thought to be generous. Confindustria's Mr Palladino considers that this should be cut to 1.5 per cent. Mr D'Antoni says that such a move would be devastating. Generational solidarity is being stretched as many middle-age employees wonder how much of the 27 per cent of their annual remuneration, paid to INPS as pension contributions, they will eventually enjoy. Yet if the government wants to show that it is serious about putting public sector accounts in order, it is difficult for it to avoid tackling this tough problem. Another round of pension reform will not be a vote winner at home, but it would win respect in international markets. Some trade unionists are not blind to the need for action. 'The system is unsustainable. Unless something is done, it will collapse by the year 2000,' predicts CGIL's Mr Trentin.</p>

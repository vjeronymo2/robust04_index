			<p>BFN     [Text] [Announcer Malgorzata Sienkiewicz] Lech Walesa has  accused the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] of breaking an  agreement reached during their meeting with Walesa at the Sejm.  This refers to the appointment of deputy ministers in the  so-called presidential ministries. In Walesa's opinion,  nominations should be given out after the reorganization of the  ministries.    [Correspondent Wojciech Nomejko] Several days after the  president's meeting with the SLD parliamentary floor group,  Danuta Waniek became deputy minister of national defense and  Zbigniew Sobotka became deputy minister of internal affairs.    [Begin recording] [Walesa] First, there was supposed to be  the organization, and the people were to come in afterward.  First, the structural reorganization plan, as Olechowski  proposed, and only then the deputy ministers. As we know, the  deputy ministers have already been appointed in both ministries.    [SLD Deputy Chairman Marek Borowski] Well, I think, as is  often the case, that the president's statement has been  distorted. The president certainly did not mean that. [end  recording]    [Nomejko] In Borowski's opinion, during the now famous  meeting, the matter was agreed upon in two areas. The first was  the coalition's participation in the presidential ministries,  which, according to the SLD deputy chairman, cannot be  questioned. The second was the reorganization of the  ministries, consisting of somebody coming into one of the top  posts in a ministry on his merits, somebody not connected to a  political grouping, who would not leave along with the  government in power. The minister of foreign affairs has  prepared a new statute and sent it to the Council of Ministers  for approval.    [Begin Borowski recording] In the other two ministries, the  ministers have to introduce such drafts because these are the  statutes of their ministries, to put it briefly. So, it is hard  to speak of a particular role of the SLD here. We support the  introduction of such drafts by these ministers, and this should  happen as quickly as possible. [end recording]    [Nomejko] According to press reports, there is a conflict  between the Polish Peasant Party and Foreign Minister Olechowski  over the reform of his ministry, which may lead to the head of  the Foreign Ministry handing in his resignation.    [Begin recording] [Michal Strak, head of the Office of the  Council of Ministers] The press, not for the first time and  probably not for the last, is not briefed very well on what is  happening inside the government, on what the prime minister is  doing, and on what I am doing. So we are dealing with yet  another press fact. They are concerned to show a lack of  cohesion again, another struggle at the top--which does not  exist, of course.    [Unidentified correspondent, addressing Foreign Minister  Olechowski] Is there a danger of your resigning?    [Olechowski] Only if you force me to. [end recording]    [Nomejko] In a week's time, the government will tackle the  comprehensive reform of the central administration along with  with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statute. After its likely  approval, Marek Siwiec will become deputy foreign minister.</p>

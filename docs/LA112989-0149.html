			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN MAKES A WISH COME TRUE;  </P> <P> CANCER: LA HABRA GIRL GETS HER CHANCE TO CHAT WITH THE FORMER PRESIDENT AS PART  OF A PROGRAM TO HELP ILL CHILDREN.  </P> <P> Eight-year-old Laurel Eernisse walked out of Ronald Reagan's Century City  office Tuesday beaming.  </P> <P> "I wouldn't mind if he was my grandpa," she said, elated after exchanging  stories, questions and jelly beans with the former President.  </P> <P> For Laurel, who has leukemia that is now in remission, the visit with Reagan  was a wish fulfilled. The Orange County chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation  had offered to grant the La Habra girl a wish a few weeks ago, and Laurel, who  watches the evening news almost every night, chose to meet Reagan.  </P> <P> The foundation, which fulfills the wishes of children who have terminal or  life-threatening illnesses, selected Laurel on the recommendation of her  physician and a social worker. Her cancer was discovered in March, but after  about four weeks of treatment, doctors found that her disease had gone in  remission. Her parents, Karin and David, said her prognosis is excellent.  </P> <P> Laurel had a list of questions on her mind to ask Reagan, who told her he was  proud to be the object of her wish.  </P> <P> Dressed in a violet shirt and white blouse, Laurel sat face-to-face with Reagan  and rattled off several inquiries, one of which was what were the best and  worst parts of being President.  </P> <P> "You had so many opportunities to help people," Reagan said as he sat next to  her on an armchair. "You have the ability to marshal forces if help is  required."  </P> <P> The worst, he said, were in the times of tragedy "when you had to report to  families that some member of their families wouldn't be coming home."  </P> <P> Then Reagan had a question for her. What did she want to be when she grew up?  </P> <P> She told Reagan that she wanted to be a veterinarian.  </P> <P> "My golly," Reagan said. "One day maybe I can get you to come and help my  horse."  </P> <P> For Laurel, the visit, albeit short, turned out to be what she wanted. She  described Reagan just as she had pictured him before the visit.  </P> <P> "He's very, very nice," she said. "Nicest man I ever met."  </P></p>

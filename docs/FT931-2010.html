			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / Survey of Information and Communications Technology (8): Prizes to the value of Pounds 20,000 - Competition: Business Software Challenge '90s BRITAIN'S young software writers have the chance to win prizes to the value of Pounds 20,000, plus a range of hardware and software, in this year's 'Business Software Challenge '90s,' the results of which will be covered later this year in the FT's quarterly review of business software, Software at Work. The competition is sponsored and funded by software vendor, Computer Associates, which founded it two years ago as a way of encouraging students to write applications to solve real business problems. Also giving their support are the British Computer Society, Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the Institute of Management. The competition is aimed at students in higher education, working individually or in teams, and recent graduates. They are invited to submit current work which solves a specific, defined, business problem. There is no definition of what applications are appropriate, but judges look for robust, working solutions and a clear explanation of the business benefits. The software should run on a commonly available computer, and integrate with other relevant software where applicable. Entrants must be able to demonstrate how their design addresses a particular problem. Entries close on August 27. Previous winners Winners in previous years have been responsible for a number of highly promising products, and some have gone on to full-time careers in software design. The 1992 winner was a system by Stephen Marshall at the University of Sheffield which helped medical staff make accurate diagnoses of patients suffering heart attacks. Prize-winners in the past have received help in taking their products to the appropriate marketplace. Computer Associates retains no rights of any sort, however, over the software submitted.

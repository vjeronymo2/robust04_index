			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Naszewski] </F>   [Text] Buenos Aires, 8 Jun (NA) -- The trade deficit  registered in the first four months of 1994 has really surprised  analysts. They knew it would be high. Domingo Cavallo  anticipated that this year's deficit would be bigger than the  1993 deficit, but when the figure -- $2.405 billion -- was  announced it caused concern because it shows the deficit for the  year will not just be "somewhat bigger" than last year; it will  much bigger than last year. The trade deficit for the whole of  last year totaled $3.7 billion, which is only a little more than  the deficit for the first four months of this year.    The most "optimistic" projection based on this figure is a  year-end deficit of around $5 billion -- the Economy Ministry  calculated it at $4.7 billion -- while "pessimistic projections"  estimate it at $8 billion, or even $10 billion if the current  feverish import drive continues while exports increase at a much  slower pace.    Very few people think the figures will reach those levels  because the Economy Ministry will probably do something to slow  the process. Cavallo's team is actively preparing a way to  achieve the effects of a currency devaluation without a  devaluation, or to improve the real foreign exchange situation  without changing the nominal exchange rate in an attempt to  rapidly enhance exports.    It is clear that the most reasonable path, within the series  of alternatives that the Economy Ministry is studying, is to  increase our exports, not to try to reduce imports. The  economic opening is conceptually based on the principle of  encouraging imports as well as exports in order to insert the  economy in the competitive international world market where each  country tries to produce only those consumer goods it can  produce in the most competitive way and import the rest from  other countries. The classic idea of specialization continues  to be amazingly logical, particularly now that transport and  communications are cheaper and more efficient.    Thus, it seems improbable that the Economy Ministry will do  much to slow the import drive unless it becomes absolutely  necessary to prevent problems worsening in the productive  structure or to slow down a potentially explosive trade deficit.    We can see that an increasingly large slice of our imports  are in capital goods, which clearly shows that the country is  allotting more and more resources to improving production and  growth. The latest figures on the import of capital goods are  those of the first quarter. They confirm that more than 30  percent of our imports consist of equipment, machinery, and  other capital goods used to reequip productive activities in  agriculture, industry, and services -- principally  communications.    This is consistent with data on internal savings and  investments, which is around 18 or 19 percent of the GDP,  compared to 14 percent at the end of the 1980's when  hyperinflation and stagnation pushed investment levels to its  lowest level in decades.    The trend confirms that Cavallo is not thinking of severely  restricting imports, unless the situation becomes intolerable.  He needs imports to sustain the economy's future growth. Thus,  the most logical path is to continue creating ways to increase  exports. Some mechanisms are already in place, besides tax  returns, among them reimbursements for exporting manufactured  products. The result is clear: During 1993, industries exported  28 percent more than in 1992.    The economic team is currently working on ways to reimburse  producers of agriculture products. We will have news in this  area shortly. In the proposal, products with higher added value  will benefit the most. The logic is simple. We must export  products that use relatively cheap and abundant national raw  materials with the highest possible level of industrialization.  One objective is to industrialize agriculture activities, a  goal that was many times proposed but never adequately  instrumented, partly due to prejudices over the "irrelevant"  idea of exporting food in a world where "the fashion" is to  export sophisticated manufactured goods. If Cavallo can  encourage agriculture industrialization the same way he has done  with industries, we will be able to say that the two-way  opening, the only possible path, has begun to work.</p>

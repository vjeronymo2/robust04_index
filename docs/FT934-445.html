			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Sport: The things they said I used to quite like turnips. But now my wife refuses to serve them. Graham Taylor, former England manager. There probably were three countries in the world who would have caused us logistical and security problems - Iran, Iraq, and England. Alan Rothenberg, chairman of the US World Cup organising committee counts his blessings. They will be remembered mostly as a dirty side. That is sad for them but they deserve it. Some of their play has been beyond the conventions we obey and I feel sad about the damage they have done to rugby's image. Will Carling, England captain, on the All Blacks. It is comic. We have millions and millions of athletes. Primo Nebiolo, head of the IAAF, on the threat by US athletes to boycott the Stuttgart World Championships over prize-money. Anybody good enough to win one already has one. Michael Johnson, US sprinter, on the IAAF's offer of a Mercedes for each winner. Pete Sampras on why he walks around court with his head down: I'm looking for money. I never thought the day would come when I would be paid to wear sports gear. Ryan Giggs on his Pounds 300,000 deal with Reebok. I used to think the construction industry was bent but I was shocked by what I saw in other football clubs. Football seems to be bent from top to bottom. Luton chairman David Kohler. As the manager of the national team you know that, apart from the chancellor, you'll probably be the most hated person in the country. Ossie Ardiles on why he does not want to manage England. They've been loyal to me. When I came here they said there would be no money and they've kept their promise. David Basset, manager of Sheffield United. What else am I going to do, be a nuclear scientist? Mike Tyson on his plan to resume boxing when he is released from prison. Parachuting has become almost too safe. We are taking the fun out of the sport. Kevin McCarthy, instructor.</p>

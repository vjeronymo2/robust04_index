			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Share sale lifts Ayala 90% in first quarter Ayala, the property-based Philippine conglomerate, has reported consolidated net profits for this year's first quarter of 752.6m pesos, an increase of 90 per cent on the year-ago figure. One-time gains, mostly from sales of some holdings in property affiliate Ayala Land, were behind much of the profits rise, said Mr Jaime Zobel de Ayala, company chairman and president. The shares sale, according to Mr Zobel, followed strong demand for an offering made by the property-development subsidiary at an international roadshow this year.</p>

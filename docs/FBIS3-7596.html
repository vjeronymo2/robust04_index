			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 30 KYODO -- The Tokyo High Court on  Wednesday [30 March] upheld a lower court ruling that rejected  residents' demands for a ban on night flights at the U.S. Yokota  air base but the high court increased the compensation to the  plaintiffs. It ruled that the residents be paid an additional  190 million yen in addition to the 330 million yen for past  suffering ordered by the lower court, bringing the total  compensation to 520 million yen.    Some 600 residents near the base on the outskirts of Tokyo  filed a suit demanding the Japanese Government ban flights at  the base between 9 PM And 7 AM, and pay compensation for their  suffering from noise both in the past and in the future.    In March 1989, the Hachioji branch of the Tokyo District  Court rejected the suit's demands for a ban on night flights and  compensation for future annoyance but ordered the government to  pay 330 million yen in compensation for past noise nuisance.  Both sides appealed the ruling.    The supreme court ruled in two earlier noise pollution suits  in February 1993 that the U.S. Forces are using the base in  accordance with the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty and the Japanese  Government has no jurisdiction over the management of the base,  rejecting a ban on the night flights and compensation for future  suffering.    In November last year, Japan and the United States agreed  that flights and ground activities at the base between 10 PM And  6 AM should be restricted to those which are essential to the  U.S. military's operations.    In the same month, the Tokyo high court presented a  compromise to the two sides in the present suit including a  proposal that flights not be permitted between 10 PM and 7 AM.  The government and the residents had talks over the court's  compromise proposal but failed to reach agreement.    Presiding Judge Kiyoshi Uetani said about 40 percent of the  noise from air drills occurs during the night or early morning.  The plaintiffs living near the base "have disturbed sleep and  daily life, and suffered from damage that may include physical  injury, including difficulty in hearing and ringing in the  ears," he said.    Uetani, however, rejected the demand for a ban on  operations,  saying the Japanese Government, the defendant, cannot control  activities of the U.S. military forces under Japan-U.S. security  arrangements.    Upon handing down the ruling, Uetani asked the plaintiffs  and  the defendant to abandon distrust of each other and to continue  negotiations. "It is hard to solve such a matter through law or  a trial," he said.    The Yokota base is one of the most important U.S. bases in  the Asia-Pacific region. It is about 40 kilometers from Tokyo,  covering about 7 million square meters. It includes the  headquarters of the U.S. military in Japan and has a  3,000-meter runway.</p>

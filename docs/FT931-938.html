			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Foreign companies operating in US may be asked to pay more in tax FOREIGN COMPANIES are bracing themselves for further US efforts to extract more tax money from them after a renewed onslaught in the Senate this week. Senator Byron Dorgan, a newly elected senator from North Dakota who is leading the attack, said tax avoidance by multinational companies, and especially foreign-based companies, was epidemic, and he called for a radical overhaul of the way tax is assessed on multinational businesses. 'I can only view this system as a system that is in collapse. We are losing,' Mr Dorgan said at Senate hearings this week, citing a study by the General Accounting Office that showed that between 1987 and 1990 around 72 per cent of foreign-owned companies paid no US income tax. 'We are being ripped off,' added Senator Carl Levin of Michigan. However, the same study showed that 59 per cent of US-owned companies also paid no tax over the same period, and Mr Natwar Gandhi, GAO's associate director for tax policy, said the current rules on multinational taxation, which have recently been modified, should be given a chance to work. Foreign companies and governments had relaxed somewhat after President Bill Clinton backed away from his campaign claims that he could raise an additional Dollars 45bn in the four years from 1993 to 1996 by making multinationals comply fully with the tax code. Mr Clinton's economic programme, outlined last month, contained a compliance initiative but more modestly claimed only Dollars 1.8bn of additional revenue over the same 1993-96 period. Senator Dorgan, however, said 'easily, at least Dollars 10bn a year disappears into the dark recesses of the compliance mess.' He called for the US to jettison the arm's length standard now internationally used to assess which country a multinational's income should be taxed in in favour of formulary apportionment, used by many US states. Companies would be taxed on a proportion of their worldwide income, assessed by weighting their sales, payroll and property in each jurisdiction. Senator Dorgan has formed an alliance with his fellow North Dakotan, Senator Kent Conrad, whose seat on the Senate finance committee gives him influence over taxation issues. Senator Daniel Moynihan, the committee's chairman, has promised to hold hearings on the subject, and some Washington tax lawyers believe there may be an effort to add legislation on foreign company taxation to the full budget bill later this year.</p>

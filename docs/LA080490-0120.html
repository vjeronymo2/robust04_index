Richard DeLise said.  </P> <P> Nearly an hour after the officer reported to police headquarters on Dec. 16  that the woman was drunk and had refused assistance, Mary Dennis, 59, was found  frozen to death on a bench at a city bus stop.  </P> <P> Police Commissioner Willie Williams said Ruczynski should have taken the woman  to a hospital and consulted his supervisors. The Fraternal Order of Police was  expected to appeal the suspension.  </P></p>

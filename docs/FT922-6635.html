			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / Foreign banks await securities scam fall-out WITH INDIA'S financial markets in disarray as a result of irregular securities trading, foreign banks are nervous that in the fall-out from the country's worst financial scandal they could face a further setback to their expansion plans. Foreign banks dominate the interbank securities market from which Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker, and others raised large sums for stock market speculation. These institutions face the charge that it was their more innovative and aggressive trading practices that produced the environment in which abuses flourished. The two oldest foreign banks - Standard Chartered, the British-based bank, and ANZ Grindlays, the former UK bank now Australian-owned, - are seen to have had inadequate controls over their securities dealing. Standard Chartered has announced provisions of Pounds 50m for losses in its operations. Grindlays is believed to be exposed on Rs5bn to Rs6bn (Pounds 97m-Pounds 116m) of transactions, though ultimate losses could be substantially less. Foreign banks, which account for 6 to 7 per cent of bank deposits, had hoped to be a big beneficiary of financial deregulation - both through setting up new investment banks and through more branch offices. Part of the suspicion of foreign banks stems from the different compulsions under which they act compared with the state-owned banks. The state banks - though this is now beginning to change - had as their primary function allocating credit at government direction. They were not too worried about their balance sheets. The foreign banks are increasingly profit-driven and in search of new opportunities to improve earnings in a tightly regulated banking system that provides little room to manoeuvre. The local state-owned banks used the interbank market to purchase securities in line with statutory liquidity requirements, laid down by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, that they hold a proportion of their deposits - until recently 38 per cent - with the Bank in government paper. Foreign banks, however, actively traded in the market. They swapped securities of differing interest rates and maturities to improve yields; they sought to prevent the depreciation of their portfolios when interest rates moved; and they looked to trading profits. They also introduced new instruments into the market - such as the banker's receipt, a promissory note issued by a bank to pledge delivery of securities. Fraudulent and uncovered banker's receipts lie at the heart of the scandal. Over the last 18 months nationalised banks have come under pressure to improve their balance sheets as a first step to financial reform. Interest rate changes became more frequent - with the beginnings of deregulation, rates were moving more in line with inflation. Both foreign and state-owned banks responded with increased trading. A new generation of brokers - of whom Mr Mehta is the symbol - entered the market pressing new techniques and cutting new deals. Mr Mehta is an approved Reserve Bank broker in the securities market. Many were not. A year ago the stock market took off on a boom that was to treble the value of the Bombay Stock Exchange index. The temptation grew to syphon funds from trade in government debt to make share purchases on the stock market. In this hothouse atmosphere, central bank supervision was inadequate and carelessness crept into trading. The Reserve Bank's own ledger of security transfers - maintained by hand - fell well behind. Banks failed to verify with each other the authenticity of banker's receipts. Smaller banks - most prominently the Bank of Karad, which now has problems meeting its obligations - issued receipts of a size out of proportion with their assets. Some foreign banks are patting themselves on the back that they have got away unscathed. 'Its a tribute to our systems and our procedures,' said one. But in such an unruly market those who escaped had luck on their side. Mr Manohar Jethnand Pherwani, head of the state-owned National Housing Bank, who resigned last week when investigators discovered that Rs7bn was missing, died yesterday of a heart attack. Once known as the 'Big Bull' of the Bombay bourse, he was credited with developing an equities mania among Indians.</p>

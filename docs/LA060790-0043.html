			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOO PROVIDES $5,000 TO CRIME FIGHTERS  </P> <P> City Councilman Michael Woo has provided $5,000 in city funds to be split among  10 Hollywood and Silverlake crime-fighting groups.  </P> <P> Each council member has a $10,000 discretionary fund each year to disburse as  they choose, without requiring a vote of the council.  </P> <P> Since Woo had half the money remaining with less than a month left in the  fiscal year, which ends June 30, he decided to spend it on groups that have  helped police cut crime in their neighborhoods, said Woo spokeswoman Julie  Jaskol. She said the money will be used for such things as Crime Watch  activities and anti-graffiti efforts.  </P> <P> Each of the following groups will receive United Streets of Hollywood,  Hollywood Business Watch, Ivar Hawks, Beat Keepers, Holly Drivers, Hollywood  Sentinels, Silver Lake Improvement Assn, Hollywood Heights Assn., Rampart  Rangers and the Selma Light Brigade.  </P> <P> "We give the money to groups that we know have a proven track record to use the  money well," Jaskol said. United Streets of Hollywood, Hollywood Business  Watch, Ivar Hawks, Beat Keepers, Holly Drivers, Hollywood Sentinels, Silver  Lake Improvement Assn, Hollywood Heights Assn., Rampart Rangers and the Selma  Light Brigade.  </P></p>

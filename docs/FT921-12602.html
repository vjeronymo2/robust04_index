			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Mortgage battle THE SURPRISE mortgage interest rate cuts by Abbey National, Halifax and Nationwide were followed by the other main societies this week. Only NatWest, among the clearing banks and centralised lenders, has yet followed them. But there is a fierce battle for first-time buyers and, borrowers should shop around. Newbury Building Society, for example, is offering a discounted mortgage for first-time buyers at 8.74 per cent. New borrowers who are not first-time buyers will also get a one percentage point discount for the first year on loans above Pounds 60,000. But remember to check how long the discounts last for. There could be little point in having a heavily-discounted rate for the first year only. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester lowered its standard mortgage interest rate by 0.2 percentage points more than the other societies, giving it a new variable mortgage rate of 10.75 per cent for most customers and 9.75 per cent for new borrowers after a one-year discount of one percentage point. The cuts are good news for borrowers, but societies are preparing to pare back their rates to savers. 'Frankly, savers have been having much too good a deal from building societies recently if you consider that their investments have a high real return and are virtually risk-free,' one society said privately this week. Meanwhile, if you are a Midland Bank mortgage customer, you might recently have had a letter from the bank asking what your attitude would be to the possible 'securitisation' of your loan. Mortgage securitisation is common in the United States but less so in the UK. A lender collects a group of good mortgages, puts them together into a bond, and sells it on the commercial money markets to a third party. The advantage to the lender is that he gets this particular amount of lending off his books, thereby strengthening his capital ratios and enabling him to go out and look for new business. All mortgage-lenders say that securitisation should not disturb the customer. The mortgage continues to be administered by the original lender, and payment and customer correspondence should continue as before. The interest rate is set by the original lender, not the owner of the securitised bond. So, most of the time there is no snag. But if you fall into arrears on your monthly payments and your mortgage is securitised, this could create problems and your lender might have less leeway to be understanding.</p>

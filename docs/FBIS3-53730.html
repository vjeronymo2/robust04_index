He managed to wrest a great deal from the U.S. Administration  in return for only a few things which the Syrian leadership  considers important but not of a priority nature. The Syrian  president carried with him to Geneva three main files, one on  Syria's regional role, another on the Syrian role in Lebanon,  and a third on the Golan Heights. Contrary to the U.S.  Administration's expectations, the file of the Golan and  Israel's withdrawal from it was the last and not the first to be  carried by President al-Asad to his Geneva meeting last Sunday  [16 January].    Excluding what the Arab and foreign newspapers published,  AL-BILAD managed to obtain the most important points discussed  by the two sides--points which were kept secret pending their  publication at a time appropriate for both the Americans and  Syrians. These points are:    -- A secret American approval of giving the Syrians a free  hand in Lebanon after obtaining a pledge from President al-Asad  to guarantee the security of Israel's northern borders and to  silence the katyushas forever.    -- Reactivation of the Syrian role in the region and giving  Syria a larger regional role after most of the Egyptian cards  have been exhausted.    -- Removal of Syria from the terrorist list following  Syrian-American talks to be held in Washington for this purpose,  including a Syrian pledge to liquidate and silence the  Palestinian factions opposing the peace process forever,  renounce terrorism, restrict Hizballah movement, and liquidate  the remnants of the Kurdish Workers Party revolutionaries in  Syria.    -- A clear and explicit Syrian declaration of its acceptance  of full peace and full normalization and the establishment of  normal relations with Israel. This will be followed by an  Israeli recognition of Syrian sovereignty over the Golan  Heights. Negotiations will then be held on the territory the  Israelis will hand over to the Syrians in the Golan, along with  security arrangements appropriate for the Israelis.    -- Resumption of the next round of talks in Washington on 24  January, to be followed by a meeting between the U.S. secretary  of state and the Syrian foreign minister. A U.S.-sponsored  meeting between Peres and al-Shar' might be held to sign the  agenda in the middle of next month.    -- Israel's full withdrawal from the occupied Lebanese  border  strip in accordance with the UN resolutions after obtaining a  written Syrian commitment to guarantee the security of northern  Israel and provide total security for total peace.    These are the most important points that were kept secret  about al-Asad-Clinton summit. The coming days may reveal more.</p>

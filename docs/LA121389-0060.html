			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> QUALITY TEAMS FILL GLENDALE TOURNAMENT  </P> <P> It's tournament time in Glendale, a great opportunity for Coach Brian  Beauchemin to schedule a few patsies for the Glendale College basketball team.  </P> <P> Beauchemin, however, has gone grinch on his Vaqueros.  </P> <P> The eight-team, double-elimination tournament begins tonight with seven of  participants sporting records over .500.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley (10-2), ranked 12th in Southern California by the JC Athletic  Bureau, plays fourth-ranked Compton (9-2) tonight at 6 p.m. and Glendale (6-5)  plays East Los Angeles (5-7) at 8 in first round games at Glendale College.  </P> <P> College of the Canyons (5-5) plays 10th-ranked Los Angeles Harbor (10-4) and  13-ranked Valley (6-3) meets sixth-ranked Cypress (8-1) in other first-round  games Thursday night.  </P> <P> "It's a well-stocked tournament," Beauchemin said. "I expect every game to be  knock down, drag out."  </P> <P> Antelope Valley is coming off a championship performance in last week's Golden  West tournament where the Marauders dealt Cypress its only defeat.  </P> <P> Antelope Valley is led by freshman point guard Dedan Thomas, the catalyst for  the Marauders' up-tempo offense. He averages 12.3 points and 10 assists a game.  </P> <P> Glendale is sparked by a quartet of sophomores that includes guard Bruce Heicke  (16 points per game) and forwards David Swanson (16), Justin Lord (15.5) and  Gary Fowler (14.5).  </P> <P> Sophomore guard Steve Valenzuela (18 points) and forwards Larry Albritton (17)  and Aaron Clark (17) are Canyons' top scorers.  </P> <P> Shelton Boykin, a transfer from Texas-El Paso, is the key player for Valley, a  team which features a number of talented sophomores, including Steve Ward,  Cliff Barnes and Shawn DeLaittre -- none of whom played for Valley last season.  </P> <P> "We haven't gelled," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. "We have a lot of  sophomores, but this is the first year they've played together."  </P> <P> Second-round games will be played Friday with the championship round to be  played Saturday.  </P></p>

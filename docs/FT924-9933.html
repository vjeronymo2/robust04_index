			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Arts: Blood Wedding - Opera Much effort, practically purposeful and precise, has gone into the premiere production of Blood Wedding, a Lorca opera by Nicola LeFanu and her librettist Deborah Levy. It was commissioned by the Women's Playhouse Trust, whose director, Jules Wright, is also the opera's producer. A good deal of determined money-gathering preceded the event - one admires the canny sense of priorities, all the more since it has enabled the opera to be staged with a lavishness unthinkable in most similar cases. The choice of theatre for the two-week run is also imaginative: the Jacob Street Studios, adjacent to to Tower Bridge, and normally a film studio whose vast arena has been transformed into an opera theatre. Fotini Dimou and the fashion designer Nicole Farhi are responsible for sets and costumes of, again, extraordinary sophistication for a new opera - at times Lorca's village appears to have been taken over by fashion-freaks from South Moulton Street, but the glam effect is certainly a contrast to the familiar fringe scratch-and-scrabble. A good small orchestra is conducted by Anne Manson; the capable cast, though light on voices of pleasing tone (apart from Quentin Hayes's rich-grained baritone as Leonardo), is led by Lynne Davies, Annemarie Sand, Cynthia Buchan and the countertenor Nicholas Clapton. The work itself has been offered a better-than-usual chance of arguing its merits. So if those merits fails to come across, if Blood Wedding establishes itself instead - as it did to me - as musically bloodless and utterly devoid of genuine dramatic imagination, it seems fair not to lay blame on the executants for this depressing state of affairs. The issues that post hoc one wants to raise are rather different ones: who on earth thought Blood Wedding - a play already so complete, and so 'musical', in its language and imagery - a good choice for operatic adaptation in the first place? (I don't know Andras Szollosy's Lorca opera, a big success at its 1964 Budapest premiere.) Did anyone test Levy's libretto to see whether it could function as simple, easily explicable narrative? (Without advance knowledge of the play I don't believe the audience can have the faintest notion of the pre-curtain-rise blood-letting or the actual method and moment of Leonardo's death.) Did anyone warn LeFanu that the length of her two acts, and in particular the agonisingly slow and unvaried pace of her second, would risk killing any build-up of momentum? (The recourse to endless arty refrains and repeated catchphrases gravely increases the risk.) Did anyone consider that some of the 'effective' devices of the wedding scene, in particular the alternation of pit sounds and those emitted by a wind-up gramophone, might lose their savour when drawn out at such length? Did anyone suggest to the producer that blank faces and demeanour are no help to dramatic involvement, and that word-audibility in opera is not something to take for granted? The pity is that there is a decent level of musicianly craftsmanship on which it reposes (identifying instrumental lines plausibly assorted to character and situation even if often modishly dated and secondhand, vocal ranges and timbres knowledgeably deployed) - yet this accrues no theatrical energy, because the craftsmanship itself seems so unrelated to the germination of an original theatrical vision. The musical language is the giveaway: melodramatic gesturing delivered in an all-purpose 1960s music-theatre bang-crash, love scenes of synthetic lyrical outpouring, and nothing in between to create any kind of fusion, cohesion or dramatic framework for the events heard and seen. One wishes all new operas well; one longs for them to succeed; but nothing is gained for the medium by soft-soaping one's conviction that, for all its glossy trappings, this Blood Wedding is anything other than a hopeless non-starter. Jacob Street Studios, Mill Street, London SE1; performances until November 7</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Further delay for Channel tunnel The Channel tunnel will not be fully opened for passenger trains until at least September, four months after the official opening on May 6. This will mean that the Pounds 10bn project will not be able to take full advantage of the peak summer season, deferring still further repayment of its debts. The ferry companies have leapt at the opportunity to boost their revenues by increasing sailings on cross-channel routes. Eurotunnel, operator of the 32-mile link, said the opening had been delayed by hundreds of relatively minor problems, including difficulties with ventilation, control equipment and the rolling stock. The company said yesterday that the September deadline did not represent a further delay, saying there had been confusion between the start date and the time when services reached full capacity. It still hoped to start a limited service to paying passengers very soon after the official opening. Last month Mr Andre Benard co-chairman of Eurotunnel, said the tunnel would start passenger services before the start of the summer season. He did not give a date for the introduction for a full service. Mr John Noulton, the company's director of public affairs, said yesterday: 'We will start passenger services as soon as possible after the official opening. They will build up during the summer and at the end of the summer will reach a full level of service.' In the face of continuing delays with passenger services, Eurotunnel is giving priority to starting its freight services, but even these may be delayed beyond the official opening. Mr Noulton said the company had underestimated the time it would take to complete commissioning tests. He denied that the banks had imposed any time limits on the testing programme or that there was any fundamental problem. He said: 'There are thousands of trivial problems but they were the expected difficulties. The main one was the availability of locomotives. We couldn't do all the tests or complete the training.' Freight and passengers trains have been running through the tunnel regularly in recent months as part of the testing. A planned rights issue to raise a further Pounds 500m plus a similar amount of debt is still due to go ahead before June. Eurotunnel's interim results will be announced on April 21.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MISS MANNERS: THE FINE ART OF WISHING ONE WELL  </P> <P> "At long last, I'm in love," confides a radiant friend. "It's everything I've  ever dreamed of, and more. I've never been so happy in my life."  </P> <P> Which of these is the polite response?  </P> <P> "These things never last."  </P> <P> "Well, I don't have anybody."  </P> <P> "I hope it's not you-know-who."  </P> <P> "What's that going to do to your career?"  </P> <P> "I suppose you won't have any time for your friends anymore."  </P> <P> "You just think you're in love."  </P> <P> The answer is an emphatic "None of the above." The correct answer is "How  wonderful -- I'm so happy for you!"  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Miss Manners is informed, happy announcements are nowadays  commonly met with gloom. At best, "Congratulations!" has been replaced by "Do  you know what you're getting into?" An expectant mother reports having her  joyous news greeted with "How horrible!"  </P> <P> Why is it so difficult to wish others well when something wonderful has  happened to them? Miss Manners believes that seeing people one cares about  finding happiness is, in itself, one of life's pleasures.  </P> <P> She notices that the dour responses fall into one of three categories, each of  them unacceptable in someone who is supposed to be a well-wisher.  </P> <P> First, there is the evaluation of the announcement purely in terms of the  situation of the hearers. Such people don't take even one moment for  registering pleasure at another's good fortune, because the only matter of  interest to them is their own. Apparently they believe that the sum of  happiness in the world is limited, and if anyone else has any -- even a dear  friend -- it takes away from their own. The result, if you consider this  carefully, is a friend who wishes you ill.  </P> <P> Or perhaps that person wouldn't grudge your pleasure if it didn't threaten his  or her own -- but considers that it must. In order for you to be on call  whenever your friend might happen to need you, your attention undistracted from  that person's wants, your life should contain no pleasant distractions. Weighed  against a tiny subtraction from that person's convenience, your greatest  happiness is nothing.  </P> <P> The second response is that of the sourpuss who doesn't believe in the human  heart: Love is bound to go wrong; even parenthood is bound to lead to grief.  Seeing your happiness, this sort of friend feels obligated to attempt to kill  it just in case it might later die of its own accord. The idea is to attempt to  ruin your happiness now, to save you possible disillusionment later.  </P> <P> Aside from not being a whole lot of fun, Miss Manners finds this a pitiable  attitude toward life. But even if this pessimism is based on horrid experience,  it does not excuse dampening others' happiness with dire predictions. If things  come to a bad end, there will be time enough to be sad -- injecting sadness  into happy times does not help.  </P> <P> The third response, all too common in a society largely populated by  busybodies, is to give advice. Nobody seems to have noticed that this is a  waste of time. People who are in love are notorious for not listening to the  advice of others.  </P> <P> Never mind that the quality of such advice is generally poor. Granted that  people don't necessarily know what is best for themselves; they are even less  likely to know what is best for others.  </P> <P> Even should advice that runs counter to your heart turn out later to be  correct, it will have been useless and unwelcome. Many a person who has smugly  shown up to take credit for having predicted a breakup finds even more  resentment in a friend's unhappiness than when the happiness was intact. No one  ever resents a friend's having wished him or her well, or having cherished  hopes.  </P> <P> It is perfectly possible to offer condolences when they are required, even if  one has offered enthusiastic congratulations when that was in order. Miss  Manners is only disillusioned to discover that more people seem to enjoy doing  the former than the latter.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b) Statement Disclosures <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)(1) Annual Percentage Yield Earned <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Ledger and collected balances.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Credit unions that accrue interest using the collected balance method may use either the ledger or collected balance methods to determine the balance used to determine the annual percentage yield earned. Ledger balance means the record of the balance in a member's account, as per the credit union's records. (The ledger balance may reflect additions and deposits for which the credit union has not yet received final payment). Collected balance means the record of balance in a member's account reflecting collected funds, that is, cash or checks deposited in the credit union which have been presented for payment and for which payment has actually been received. (See Regulation CC, 12 CFR 229.14). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(2) Amount of Dividends or Interest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Definition of earned.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``earned'' is defined to include dividends and interest either ``accrued'' or ``paid and credited.'' Credit unions may use either the ``ledger'' or the ``collected'' balance for either option. (See commentary to &sect;707.2(t).) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Accrued interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  Credit unions must state the amount of interest that accrued during the statement period, even if it was not credited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Terminology.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In disclosing dividends earned for the period, credit unions must use the term ``dividends'' or terminology such as: ``Dividends paid,'' to describe dividends that have been credited; ``Dividends accrued,'' to indicate that dividends are not yet credited. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Closed accounts.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> If a member closes an account between crediting periods and forfeits accrued dividends, the credit union may not show any figures for ``dividends earned'' or annual percentage yield earned for the period (other than zero, at the credit union's option). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Extraordinary dividends.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Extraordinary dividends are not a component of the annual percentage yield earned or the dividend rate, but are an addition to the member's account. The dollar amount of the extraordinary dividends paid, denoted as a separate, identified figure, must be disclosed on the periodic statement on which the extraordinary dividends are earned. A credit union may also disclose information regarding the calculation of the extraordinary dividends, and additional annual percentage yield earned and dividend rate figures taking into account the extraordinary dividend, so long as such information is accurate and not misleading. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> (b)(3) Fees Imposed <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Periodic statements must state fees disclosed under &sect;707.4(b) that were debited to the account during the statement period, even if assessed for an earlier period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Itemizing fees by type.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In itemizing fees imposed more than once in the period, credit unions may group fees if they are the same type. But, the description must make clear that the dollar figure represents more than a single fee, for example, ``total fees for checks written this period.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Examples of fees that may  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  be grouped together are: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Monthly maintenance with excess activity fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ii. ``Transfer'' fees, if different dollar amounts are imposed_such as $.50 for share deposits and $1.00 for withdrawals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> iii. Fees for electronic fund transfers with fees for other services, such as balance inquiry or maintenance fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Identifying fees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Statement details must enable the member to identify the specific fee. For example: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

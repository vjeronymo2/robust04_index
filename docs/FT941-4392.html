			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / People: Douglas Lee takes on Microgen UK Douglas Lee, executive chairman of Microgen Holdings, the computer services group based in the UK but with operations in six other west European countries, is taking over at the helm of the UK operating subsidiary, Microgen UK. That follows the resignation - after two years with the company  -of its managing director, Michael Lee, who is no relation to Douglas Lee. The parting of the ways follows a 1993 profit reduction of 37 per cent, and turnover down by 1 per cent, in the UK and Irish operations. For Microgen as a whole, but particularly in the UK, the group's traditional core business - the production of computer output microfilm (COM) - is facing a structural change, with greater challenges being posed by electronic means of generating, storing and distributing data. Douglas Lee acknowledges that the COM business, which represents 60 per cent of UK turnover (Pounds 25.6m last year), is not only a vital element of Microgen's future, but it is also one which is undergoing an important change of rhythm. The need for 24-hour, geographically widespread microfilm production is waning; those interested in using microfiche generally no longer require the speed of turnround that Microgen is geared up for. The tendency - and future  -of demand for microfiche services is much more as a long-term archival resource; and Lee is confident that that business has a healthy future, despite the threats from other means of data storage, such as CD-ROM. The consequence is that Douglas Lee - who will be running the UK operation until further notice - is faced with the difficult task of implementing an already developed plan to address the UK subsidiary's costs. Michael Lee's departure is, to some extent, a reflection of the tricky nature of that task. Still, Douglas Lee feels that the group's other key businesses - electronic printing and demand publishing - are set fair to face future competition. In any case, having been with the company since 1974 - when it was incorporated  -he is determined that both Microgen and he will 'be around for a long time yet'.</p>

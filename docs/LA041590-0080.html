			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHY NOT EASTERN?  </P> <P> Peter Greenberg takes a cheap shot at travel agents, accusing them of selling  away from Eastern Airlines to earn higher commissions because of higher fares  on other airlines. Given the operational and financial problems Eastern has  experienced since filing for bankruptcy, isn't it more likely that the concern  of the agents is for their clients' peace of mind and the financial soundness  of their travel dollar?  </P> <P> KEN HALL  </P> <P> Classic Hawaii  </P> <P> San Jose  </P> <P>  Peter S. Greenberg responds: I called 30 travel agents at random across the  United States and asked for low fares on Atlanta-Miami, Atlanta-New York City,  New York City-Miami routes. I gave specific travel dates that would have  qualified me for the lowest prices. Not one agent offered to sell me the  Eastern fare. Only one agent mentioned Eastern, but refused to sell me that  fare because of what she said were "liability" concerns, even when I offered to  pay by credit card -- which would have protected the agent.  </P> <P>  I do not as a practice indulge in travel agent bashing. I believe it is in the  best interests of reader travelers to use responsible travel agents, as well as  to protect themselves from price gouging by airlines, travel scams and  financial liability when acting in good faith.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> RESIDENTS NOT HAPPY ABOUT PROJECT PLANS  </P> <P> Residents of a neighborhood with names such as Happy, Jolly and Joyful aren't  lately, because of plans for a 140-unit condominium complex.  </P> <P> About 50 of them went to City Hall this week and persuaded planning  commissioners to scale down the redevelopment project on Joyful Lane and Happy  Drive, near Jolly Lane.  </P> <P> The development is a joint project of a Huntington Beach company and the city's  Redevelopment Agency.  </P> <P> Commissioners, who will reconsider a revised version of the proposal Oct. 2,  agreed with residents' criticisms that the planned complex would be too large  and that it targets young buyers for property designated for senior-citizen  housing. The 4-acre site is one of the last in the city zoned for low-cost,  senior housing.  </P> <P> Commissioners decided not to reject the project entirely, however, mainly  because it calls for more than half of the condominiums to be set aside for  moderate-income buyers, who could receive federal assistance for their down  payment. Those buyers, who must earn less than $50,000 per year, would qualify  for $2 million in federal subsidies the city has earmarked for the project.  </P> <P> As proposed, however, the housing assistance would be available only for  first-time buyers. Commissioners are calling for revised plans to make  available at least some of the financial aid for low-income seniors.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The reactions of other units located on the  territory of the former Yugoslavia have been negative in  contrast to that of Belgrade. Davorin (Zaberscak), counsellor  at the Croatian embassy in Moscow, commented on the new  situation for our radio station.    [Begin (Zaberscak) recording] The sanctions were adopted at  the United Nations and Russia's representative spoke in favor of  sanctions. Any country's parliament might make a decision on  discontinuing support for the decision, but this decision was  made at the international level. Sanctions can only be lifted  at the level at which they were adopted. We believe that until  Serbia and Montenegro recognize the borders of Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina as they were before the war, borders which  the international community and this country recognized, it will  be difficult to talk about lifting sanctions.</p>

Over 40 percent, or about 50,000, of the new firms were in  the service sector, said Cui Shanjiang, director of the Shanghai  Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC).    To facilitate enterprise development, SAIC simplified  registration procedures and granted a broader business scope for  new enterprises.    Overseas-funded enterprises also increased by 185 percent,  or  4,448, last year, with a total investment of 16.1 billion U.S.  dollars and registered capital of 8.36 billion U.S. dollars.    Most noticeable was the growth of private enterprises, which  reached 8,247 in 1993, up 95 percent over the year before.    Private enterprises are also branching out from processing,  commerce and restaurants to high-tech industries. Average  capital also jumped from about 70,000 yuan per business in the  past to 210,000 yuan now.    To date, 129,000 private establishments in industry and  commerce have been registered in Shanghai. Last year they  generated 1.115 billion yuan in gross output.</p>

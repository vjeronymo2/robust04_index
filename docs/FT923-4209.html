			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / French voters still undecided as official campaign begins OFFICIAL campaigning in the French referendum on European union began yesterday with the latest opinion polls showing many voters still undecided. Mr Laurent Fabius, first secretary of the ruling Socialist party, kicked off the media campaign for the Yes camp with an evening television appearance. The Gaullists divided their first broadcast between arguments for and against the treaty, reflecting divisions in their own ranks. The media campaign was overshadowed by a row over allocation of airtime, which the CSA broadcasting authority has divided out according to the number of seats in the National Assembly held by political parties. This has given the Yes campaigners, which consist of the leadership of mainstream parties on the right and left, 80 minutes over the next fortnight to the September 20 vote. A mere 11 minutes has been allotted to the anti-Maastricht camp, a fragmented group of rebel centre-right politicians, a small band of dissident Socialists, plus the extreme right wing and the Communists. Another half-hour has been allocated for combined campaigning which could be devoted to debates on both sides. Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, leader of the anti-Maastricht Socialist rebels, appealed to the CSA to apply the rules more fairly. In an attempt to beef up the No movement, he yesterday joined forces with Mr Charles Fiterman, a former Communist minister, agreed to campaign jointly. Latest opinion polls showed support for the treaty strengthening. A Louis Harris poll for the magazine VSD last night indicated 59 per cent  - of those expressing a choice - in favour, the biggest margin for more than a month. But 39 per cent did not make their preference known. A survey published by the CSA polling institute showed 54 per cent backing for Maastricht. Opposition to the treaty had grown through the summer to peak with a small majority against at the end of August. Since then the trend has started to creep back. Between a quarter and a third of electors are still undecided, in spite of being bombarded with arguments for and against Maastricht. French unions yesterday entered the campaign, showing themselves to be as divided over European union as the rest of the population. Mr Louis Viannet, secretary-general of the Communist-led CGT, France's largest union, said the treaty's tough economic criteria would create 'social explosions'. Mr Jean Kaspar, leader of the CFDT, loyal to the Socialists, said Maastricht could improve social conditions. The government's efforts to keep its own unpopularity out of the campaign suffered a setback when Mr Henri Emmanuelli, president of the National Assembly and former Socialist party treasurer, received a summons to appear before magistrates in Rennes next Monday. He is expected to face charges relating to allegedly irregular fundraising methods by the Socialist party. President Francois Mitterrand has repeatedly defended Mr Emmanuelli's reputation. Socialists have accused the judiciary of political motivation in the timing of this latest twist in a long-running inquiry into political corruption.

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Clinton poll rating cheers Democrats US Democrats yesterday had some good news in their struggle to retain control of the US Senate and House in hotly contested mid-term races across the country. A new Gallup poll showed President Bill Clinton's approval rating rebounding by 8 points to 48 per cent. However, it is unclear whether this will translate into support for Democrats on November 8. Many have been trying to avoid the president during their campaigning. In New York state, support is slipping for Mr George Pataki, running to unseat Governor Mario Cuomo. Before leaving for the Middle East Mr Clinton campaigned hard for the governor, who got another boost from the endorsement earlier this week of New York City's Republican mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is unhappy with his own party's candidate. In Massachusetts, Senator Ted Kennedy, in the tightest race of his 32-year Senate career, surged ahead of his rival Mr Mitt Romney after a television debate on Tuesday. Meanwhile in California, support has been ebbing for a controversial anti-immigration initiative, strongly supported by Republican Governor Pete Wilson and Congressman Michael Huffington. Both are in tight contests, Mr Wilson to keep his post and Mr Huffington to move to the Senate. Proposition 187, the so-called 'Save Our State' provision, will be on the California ballot. According to an independent poll by the San Francisco Field Institute, support for the measure has dropped from 64 per cent in July to 53 per cent. Immigration has become a 'hot button' political issue in California and Florida. But many voters appear to believe Proposition 187 goes too far. It would deny non-emergency healthcare and social services to illegal immigrants and prohibit their children from going to California schools. Mr Clinton has spoken out against the law, as has Mr Jack Kemp, a popular Republican conservative. Miss Janet Reno, attorney general, said yesterday it was probably unconstitutional. 'It doesn't make sense to turn school teachers and nurses into border patrol agents,' she said. 'It doesn't make sense to kick kids out of school or not give them immunisation.' Mr Huffington yesterday confirmed a published report that he had employed an illegal immigrant as a nanny for five years, even after he was sworn in as a congressman in 1993. Two appointees for attorney general in the early days of the Clinton administration were forced to withdraw because of similar accusations. This was good news for Senator Dianne Feinstein, Mr Huffington's opponent, who has been moving up on him in the polls. Yesterday a spokesman for the Republicans accused Mrs Feinstein of the same violation. It was denounced as 'an outright lie' by Mrs Feinstein's campaign manager.</p>

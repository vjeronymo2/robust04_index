			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Make a Key Breakthrough in Boosting </F> Agriculture With Science and Technology"]    [Text] Since the Agricultural Work Conference held by the  CPC Central Committee in March this year, various localities  have energetically gone into action, seriously implemented  relevant policies of the party, aroused in every possible way  the peasants' enthusiasm, raised funds, gathered materials,  increased input in agriculture, seized the time to do a good job  in spring plowing and sowing and in field management, and  strived to get a good harvest of summer crops and of crops of  the whole year.    However, we should be aware that the task of developing  agriculture remains quite arduous. In order to attain the goal  of stabilizing grain output, increasing cotton output, and  enriching the nonstaple food basket, it is necessary at present  to stress once more the importance and urgency of depending on  science and technology.    Last year, thanks to a series of measures adopted by the CPC  Central Committee and the State Council and the efforts of  various quarters, a relatively good harvest was reaped in  agriculture. While affirming achievements, we must be prepared  against undesirable events and must soberly pay attention to  severe challenges to agriculture in the future. The net annual  increase in China's population is nearly 15 million. This means  an annual increase of 6 million tonnes of grain can only  maintain the existing level of grain per capita, and the  increase in output since 1984 has all been consumed by the  increase in the population. Farmland and other natural  resources are decreasing day by day because of the development  of infrastructure in towns and cities, such as transportation  and the power industry. China's per capita area of farmland  ranks third from the bottom among 26 countries with populations  exceeding 50 million each. For quite a long time to come, these  increasing and decreasing trends will remain irreversible.  Also, in the course of becoming relatively well-off, people  will set higher demands on the quantity and quality of food and  industrial raw materials and, after reentry into GATT, there  will be keen competition between the domestic and foreign  markets. These are two facts which we have to face in the near  future. The "irreversible" and "have to face" mentioned above  will exert a tremendous pressure on agriculture, the primary  industry, and we should not be blindly optimistic about the  future. Moreover, in recent years, because of the enlarging  price scissors of manufactured goods and agricultural produce,  and the decreasing comparable benefits of agricultural  production, those of growing grain and cotton in particular, the  peasants' enthusiasm has not been great.    To a very great extent, this also has an adverse impact on  the further development of agriculture. Therefore, to attain  the goal of agricultural development in China in the 1990's, and  to promote the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [chixu  kuaisu jiankang fazhan] of the rural economy, we must, on the  one hand, seriously and properly grasp the implementation of  various rural policies of the CPC Central Committee and the  State Council and, on the other hand, attach importance to the  application of science and technology to agriculture, and  develop the rural productive forces by means of the progress of  science and technology in agriculture in a bid to ensure the  effective supply of agricultural produce.    History since the founding of the people's republic shows  that every step forward taken by agriculture and every upgrading  of agriculture in China were inseparable from progress in  science and technology. Let us recall what happed in the early  and middle 1980's. The state increased input into agriculture,  the peasants' enthusiasm was unprecedentedly high because of  rural reforms, the peasants strived to apply the knowledge,  technology, and research achievements accumulated for many years  by science and technology personnel, and the best combination of  various factors led to achievements in agriculture which  attracted worldwide attention. In a short span of several  years, the phenomenon of a serious shortage of agricultural  produce resulting from the 10 years of turmoil was eradicated  and various rationing coupons were abolished. Farmland  accounting for only 7 percent of the world's total was able to  support a population accounting for 22 percent of the world's  total. The steady progress of urban reforms was also ensured.  Such great achievements could not be separated from the  application of science and technology to agriculture.  "Depending first on policies and second on science and  technology" was the simplest and most profound conclusion at  that time. Historical experience is worthy of our serious  attention. To attain the goal of a sustained and steady growth  of agriculture and the rural economy, we still must stress the  necessity of depending on progress in science and technology and  on strengthening science and education to revitalize agriculture.    According to our national conditions, only by stressing  focal points and making the targets clear for the input of  science and technology, which is quite limited, can we achieve  maximum economic, social, and ecological benefits. Let us take  planting as an example. If an overall upgrading of species  increases output by 10 percent, it will mean an increase in the  output of grain of 45 million tonnes and of cotton of 400,000  tonnes; if the utilization ratio of chemical fertilizer is  raised by 10 percent, it will be equivalent to increasing the  output of chemical fertilizer by 12 million tonnes; as bollworm  was effectively prevented and controlled in the last few years,  the peasants were able to increase their income by 6 billion  yuan and the textile industry to increase its economic results  by several times; and if 10 to 20 percent of straw is used to  feed domestic animals and the manure of these animals is used to  make the fields fertile, a large quantity of animal feed will be  saved for breeding cows and sheep, the leather industry will be  developed, and organic matter will be added to the soil. All  the measures mentioned above will also be conducive to the  protection of the ecological environment. The input of science  and technology has the highest output rate. Therefore, while  speeding up work to spread applicable scientific research  results and advanced technology, the Ministry of Agriculture has  decided to lay emphasis on spreading four items of agricultural  technology -- properly grasping the system for selection,  cultivation, and reproduction (including systems of improved  varieties of seedlings, stock, poultry, and offspring) whose  function is to provide good species; raising the utilization  ratio of chemical fertilizer, mainly by applying the fertilizer  at a deep level; comprehensive prevention and cure for animals  and plants with the prevention and cure of "one worm and two  diseases" as the focus; and regenerating abandoned agricultural  resources by using straw to feed domestic animals and using the  animals' manure to fertilize the fields. Also, the ministry has  energetically worked to lay a foundation for science and  technology, strengthened research in basic science with emphasis  on key points, and strived to make major breakthroughs in  scientific research in order to maintain the staying power of  agricultural development.    To depend on progress in science and technology, we must  attach importance to the use and training of qualified  personnel. An important achievement in scientific research  often requires the arduous exploration of science and technology  personnel for 10 or even 20 years and the spreading of such an  achievement over a large area again requires the hard work of  tens of thousands of grassroots science and technology  personnel. Leadership at all levels must adopt all necessary  measures, attach importance to the building of the contingent  for spreading science and technology at the grass-roots level  and give full play to the role of the contingent, be good at  absorbing science and technology personnel of institutions of  higher learning to apply their advanced technology and research  results to various projects for increasing investment benefits,  make great efforts to support scientific research so that  science and technology personnel will constantly score new  achievements in their research, ensure the sustained growth of  agriculture, show concern for the living and working conditions  of science and technology workers, and dare to award those who  have made outstanding contributions. In this respect, township  and town enterprises and some enterprises using high and new  technology, which have survived and developed amid acute market  competition, have taken a step forward and have proved with  their economic results and development that this strategic view  is correct. We should attach importance to, and sum up, their  experience.    At present, the people of the whole country are studying the  Third Volume of The Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping.  We must seriously study a series of important instructions on  agriculture, science, and technology given by Comrade Deng  Xiaoping, and really understand the scientific conclusion that  "science and technology is the primary productive force" and the  guiding idea that in the final analysis, agriculture depends on  science and technology to solve its problems. In this way, we  shall be able to emancipate our minds, upgrade our concepts,  adopt effective measures to strengthen science and technology  work, really put the development of agriculture and the rural  economy into the orbit of depending on progress in science and  technology and improving the quality of laborers, ensure the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of agriculture and the  entire national economy, and make due contributions to making  the people of the whole country relatively well-off.</p>

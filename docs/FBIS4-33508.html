			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 5 Jun (EFE) -- An opinion poll that was  released in Lima on 5 June shows that Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori and former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar  would tie at presidential runoff elections if they were held  right now.    The metropolitan daily EXPRESO published the results of the  opinion poll conducted by Datum, a private company. The poll  shows that in the event of runoff elections, and should Fujimori  and Perez de Cuellar run for president, Fujimori would get 43.8  percent of the votes and Perez de Cuellar would get 42.8  percent. Datum feels that "technically" these figures should be  considered a "tie."    The opinion poll shows that during the first electoral round  neither candidate would obtain 50 percent plus one vote. The  current president would get 39.9 percent and the former UN  secretary general would get 32.2 percent.    Peruvian presidential and legislative elections are  scheduled  for April 1995.</p>

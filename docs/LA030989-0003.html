			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CRACKDOWN IN PARKS BRINGS 16 ARRESTS  </P> <P> Amid complaints from West Hollywood officials that drug dealing and alcohol  abuse are out of control in that city's two main parks, at least 16 people have  been arrested as part of a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department crackdown in  the parks in the last two weeks.  </P> <P> "We've been asked (by city officials) to clean up the parks, and that's what we  intend to do," said Capt. Rachel Burgess, who supervises the West Hollywood  sheriff's station.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials said 10 of the arrests occurred at West Hollywood Park,  where the city operates a temporary shelter for homeless people and where an  increasing number of the homeless have congregated in recent months. Another  six people were arrested at Plummer Park.  </P> <P> The crackdown so far has been aimed at stricter enforcement of a midnight-to-6  a.m. curfew, and the department will soon begin using plainclothes sheriff's  deputies in the parks, Burgess said.  </P></p>

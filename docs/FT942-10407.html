			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Interest rate increase attacked Israel's banking and business community yesterday attacked Monday's 0.5 percentage points rise in interest rates and warned the central bank's action would damp economic growth, harm exports and hinder private investment, writes Julian Ozanne. Israel's finance ministry, deeply critical of an earlier interest rate rise, made no public comment but officials said the minister was furious with the independent move by the Bank of Israel. The Bank of Israel raised its prime lending rate from 10.5 to 11 per cent to reach this year's annual inflation target of 8 per cent. Inflation last year was 11.3 per cent and bank officials said data from the first four months of this year showed inflation was running at about 10 per cent. Members of the Knesset (parliament) finance committee demanded the central bank lower interest rates by 1 per cent. They are preparing a law according to which all future interest-rate decisions will be taken jointly by the central bank and Finance Ministry. Mr Dan Tichon, a member of the committee, said: 'To prove it exists, the central bank is punishing the business sector and preventing continued growth by unjustified rises in interest rates.' Mr Dan Proper, chairman of the Israeli Manufacturer's Association, said yesterday the 8 per cent inflation target was unrealistic and would defeat the government's main aims of stimulating growth and fighting an unemployment rate of more than 10 per cent. 'There will be a negative impact on investment, on the rate of exchange and therefore on exports,' he said. 'We are going to lose the momentum of growth and not gain anything.' Mr Proper also hit out at Mr Jacob Frenkel, governor of the Bank of Israel, saying: 'The problem is that the Bank of Israel wants to show independence at the expense of the economy.'</p>

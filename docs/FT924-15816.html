			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / The Labour Party at Blackpool: Quotes of the day 'This morning a journalist asked me if Mr Lamont should go. 'No', I said, 'They should all go.'' Jack Cunningham 'Those Tory yuppies, didn't they make themselves a laughing stock? They voted Tory on election day then ripped the government apart on Black Wednesday.' Dennis Skinner 'The electoral system that would give Labour the greatest advantage would be a hybrid, with a proportional system up to Coventry and 'first past the post' north of that and in Wales. This would obviously be difficult to sell to any other party.' Clare Short 'A Liberal can tell you why our society needs a reformed democracy. But it is a socialist who explains why our democracy needs a reformed society.' Tony Blair</p>

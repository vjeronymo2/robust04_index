			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Chance for the marchers to break step: The latest moves to end Northern Ireland's sectarian violence Barely a week goes by in Northern Ireland without a date to be commemorated. Ancient battles, the deaths of martyrs and atrocities from the political violence of the more recent past are remembered with flags, speeches and vows to stand firm against violence from the opposite side of the sectarian divide. This weekend is no exception. Three hundred and six years ago a group of Protestant apprentices closed the gates of Derry, then the biggest city in Ulster, in the face of approaching troops loyal to the deposed Roman Catholic King James II. The siege was lifted in August 1689, and the Protestant Apprentice Boys mark that anniversary with an annual march through the centre of what is now a largely Catholic city. When Catholic civil-rights protesters were being clubbed from the streets in Derry 25 years ago by a sectarian police force, the annual Apprentice Boys march sparked two days of riots which brought British troops to the streets of Northern Ireland. At first welcomed by Catholics, the troops quickly came to be seen as an army of occupation bolstering Protestant political domination of the province. Ms Bernadette Devlin, later an MP, predicted from a Derry barricade at the time: 'We don't fight the army today, but the day will come.' The Apprentice Boys will be marching in Derry again this weekend and republicans will hold their own demonstrations to repeat their calls for the removal of British troops from the province - and to mark another infamous date in the nationalist calendar, the introduction of internment in August 1971. So has anything changed which makes this anniversary different? Cynics will say no. But the Republicans' worst-kept secret - the announcement this autumn of a prolonged IRA ceasefire in the wake of the Downing Street declaration - offers the first glimmer of hope in two decades that a resolution of the conflict might be in sight. For several months senior republican figures have been hinting that a prolonged IRA ceasefire is in the offing - the first since 1975. Senior officials in the Irish government, which has kept open channels of communication with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, are convinced that 'something will happen' in the next month. Sir Hugh Annesley, the chief constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, told the BBC this week that a prolonged IRA ceasefire could quickly lead to a sharp reduction in the troop presence on the streets. Both the Irish and British governments have been emphatic that a 'permanent' rather than a 'prolonged' IRA ceasefire will be necessary before Sinn Fein can be brought into political negotiations. The IRA refuses to engage in what it sees as a one-sided unilateral disarming of its units, but that does not rule out a phased response to military de-escalation measures as hinted at by the RUC chief. Senior Irish politicians believe that it is around such gestures, reciprocated in turn by either side, and eventually embracing the Loyalist paramilitaries, that a prolonged ceasefire might be built into a permanent one. This weekend the drums, pipes, flags and speeches will be redolent with the symbolism of the past. But perhaps the moves about to come will prove to have greater significance.</p>

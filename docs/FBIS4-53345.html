			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- A planned meeting between  President Kim Yong-sam and Buddhist leaders was called off on  Friday due to objection by some reformist Buddhist leaders.    The Culture and Sports Ministry had arranged the meeting as  part of the administrative move to mend discords between the  administration and the Buddhist circles caused by the recent  Chogye-sa incident.    "We had prepared for a meeting between President Kim and the  Rev. Wolha, the new Chogye order patriarch, and other Chogye  leaders at the suggestion of the Culture-Sports Ministry, but it  failed to take place due to objection by some reformist  leaders," a Chongwadae [presidential offices] official said.    He said Chongwadae planned to hold the meeting on next  Monday, two days before the Buddha's coming day, Wednesday.    "But, some reformist Chogye leaders demanded that prior to  the meeting, President Kim should make an apology and Home  Minister Choe Hyong-u resign in connection with the violence at  the Chogye temple," he said.    The official hinted that the administration would try to  realize the meeting again once the inhouse situation of the  Chogye order is put to an order.    Noting that dialogue is going on with Buddhist leaders in  various channels, the official said that when an atmosphere is  fostered through a dialogue, Buddhist leaders' meeting with the  president will be materialized as a matter of course.</p>

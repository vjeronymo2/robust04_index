			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Volvo to expand US heavy truck operations Volvo, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, is to invest Dollars 200m over the next five years to modernise and expand its US heavy truck operations. The company, the world's second largest producer of heavy trucks (16 tonnes gross vehicle weight and above) behind Mercedes-Benz of Germany, is to build a new cab assembly plant and a high-volume paint shop close to its existing truck assembly plant in Dublin, Virginia. Construction is to begin next month, and the plants are expected to begin operation in 1997. Volvo's US heavy truck operation, Volvo GM Heavy Truck, is 87 per cent-owned by the Swedish group and 13 per cent by General Motors of the US. Production capacity at the Dublin truck assembly plant is also to be increased by 20 per cent by the end of 1995, to 72 trucks a day from the present capacity of 60 a day. The Dublin facility is being developed as Volvo GM Heavy Truck's high-volume production operation in the US. The cab assembly plant will have an initial capacity of 70 cabs a day, but this will be increased to 110. The Dublin facility will also supply cabs to Volvo GM's other truck assembly plant in Orrville, Ohio. Volvo Truck's investment in the US production facilities is part of the ambitious modernisation of its heavy truck range, which began last year with the launch of its FH series of heavy trucks in Europe.</p>

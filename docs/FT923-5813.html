			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / International Company News: Overseas operations help ABN Amro climb 8.9% ABN AMRO, the largest bank in the Netherlands, reports first-half net profits grew by 8.9 per cent from Fl 801m to Fl 872m (Dollars 550m), powered by an expanding overseas operation. It also forecasts 'a slight increase' in full-year earnings over the Fl 1.54bn achieved in 1991. Mr Rob Hazelhoff, the chairman, said that a lower US dollar exchange rate would adversely affect the earnings of the increasingly important US operation in the second half. Gross profit advanced 7.6 per cent to Fl 2.01bn. Overseas gross earnings jumped sharply. In North America, profit soared by 68 per cent to Fl 413m. This more than compensated for stagnant earnings on the home market, which generated Fl 1.23bn of the gross, and a European decline, which was concentrated in France and Germany. UK earnings were up 'substantially', the bank said. ABN Amro's income advanced by 7.8 per cent to Fl 6.18bn while costs rose a similar rate to Fl 4.17bn, the result of overseas acquisitions. The cost increase in Holland was contained at 3.2 per cent and the number of staff was trimmed by 1,299 to 38,003. Interest income was up by 12.1 per cent to Fl 4.07bn, the result of better profit margins on guilder-denominated loans and higher overall lending volume, which expanded by 3.3 per cent at home to Fl 156.7bn and by 3.9 per cent abroad to Fl 104bn. Commission income rose 11.1 per cent to Fl 1.55bn, primarily on the international side. A decline in the contribution of its insurance business was compensated by earnings on payment transfers and other fees, but income from own-account securities trading was down sharply. The bank's international network continues to grow in importance not least through acquisitions in the US; it generated 38.4 per cent of the gross result during the first six months, against 32.8 per cent during the comparable period last year. Since last December, the balance sheet total has climbed Fl 30.5bn to Fl 445.5bn. Of this, the consolidations of the Chicago-based Talman Home Federal Savings and Loan and the London-based stockbroker Hoare Govett accounted for some Fl 12bn. ABN Amro has declared an unchanged interim dividend of Fl 1.40 per share, payable partly in ordinary shares at the stockholder's option.</p>

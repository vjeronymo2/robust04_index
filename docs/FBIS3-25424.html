			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Today" program] </F>   [Text] Democratic Party leader Dr. Zach de Beer says a  coalition with the National Party after the election is not on.  He was addressing a public meeting at Oudtshoorn. Richard  Ingram sent us this report:    There was a small but attentive multiracial audience for Dr.  de Beer at the Democratic Party's first multiracial meeting held  at the town in many a year, and it was held in Oudtshoorn Civic  Center, a place that was taboo for nonwhites for many a year.    In answer to a question, he said his party would work with  any parties to vote against the ANC [African National Congress]  if it was the majority party and threatened to do anything  harmful to South Africa. Answering another question in  Afrikaans, Dr. de Beer said a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] was  just not viable. He also addressed the latest concessions by  the ANC and the government to the Freedom Alliance on the draft  constitution in their effort to try and get the alliance to take  part in the coming election.    [De Beer] Ladies and gentlemen, the question of a double or  a single ballot paper is not just a plaything, a coin to be  tossed upon a table, to be gambled with. The question of a  double or a single system brief -- a ballot paper -- is a matter  of moral conviction. But there's no serious doubt that the  rights given in the constitution which is before us now, which  has been adopted by Parliament, are inadequate. They must be  increased, and they must not be increased because Frank Mdlalose  wants it or because Ferdi Hartzenberg wants it.</p>

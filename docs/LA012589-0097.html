			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DECRIES SOVIET AIR ATTACKS IN AFGHANISTAN;  </P> <P> CALLS BOMBING AN 'UNACCEPTABLE' VIOLATION OF PLEDGE OF NO OFFENSIVE MOVES  DURING PULLOUT  </P> <P> The U.S. government said Tuesday that the Soviet Union is conducting daily  bombing attacks in Afghanistan, an "unacceptable" violation of Moscow's promise  not to engage in offensive military operations during its troop withdrawal.  </P> <P> State Department spokesman Charles Redman said Soviet warplanes, based both in  Afghanistan and across the border in the Soviet Union, are bombing targets  "around the cities of Kandahar, Jalalabad and Kunduz." He said there are no  Soviet troops still garrisoned around any of the three cities, so the attacks  are not required for the safe evacuation of Soviet armed forces.  </P> <P> "This is a clear violation of Soviet assurances to us not to engage in  offensive operations during the withdrawal," Redman said. "This daily  bombardment is unacceptable."  </P> <P> Under the Geneva accords signed last year, the Soviet Union is required to  complete the withdrawal of its forces by Feb. 15.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Urges Americans to Leave  </P> <P> Meanwhile, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater urged all Americans,  except employees of the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, to leave Afghanistan because of  the deteriorating security situation in the country.  </P> <P> Moscow radio said the Islamic guerrillas seeking to topple the Soviet-backed  government in Kabul have blocked the main road between the Afghan capital and  the Soviet border, requiring a Soviet airlift to provide food and other needed  supplies to the city.  </P> <P> Kabul is suffering severe food and fuel shortages, news agencies reported.  Diplomats in the Afghan capital were quoted as saying people must wait in line  for hours for bread and cooking fuel.  </P> <P> "Because of fierce fighting with the extremists in the Salang Pass area, the  country's main highway linking Kabul with . . . the Soviet border is once again  paralyzed," Moscow Radio reported. "The armed opposition is preventing the  normal supply of foodstuffs to the city."  </P> <P> Redman said, however, that the rebels, known as the moujahedeen, have stopped  attacking the withdrawing Soviet forces, apparently to eliminate any excuse for  Moscow to delay its withdrawal.  </P> <P> "The moujahedeen have been exercising restraint in permitting unhampered Soviet  withdrawal from Afghanistan," Redman said. "We believe that similar restraint  would be appropriate on the part of the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> The U.S. government first accused Moscow of conducting air attacks in violation  of the Geneva accords late last year. At that time, however, the moujahedeen  were engaged in hit-and-run attacks on the withdrawing Soviet troops. Redman  raised the issue again Tuesday to underline the American position.  </P> <P> Michael H. Armacost, acting secretary of state, raised the Afghan issue with  Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin during a meeting at the State Department on  Monday.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has maintained that its operations are in response to attacks  by the moujahedeen on the Soviet-backed Kabul regime and, as such, are not  prohibited by the Geneva accords.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Kabul Combat Reduced  </P> <P> Western diplomats in Islamabad, Pakistan, quoted by United Press International,  confirmed that the rebels are maintaining a low profile to allow the remainder  of the Soviet soldiers to leave the country.  </P> <P> The envoys said that combat around Kabul has decreased in recent weeks.  However, diplomatic missions in the capital are making plans for a speedy  evacuation in case security breaks down after the departure of the Soviet  troops.  </P> <P> The West German Embassy closed down last week. A Western diplomat said three  Eastern European embassies are also preparing to close.  </P> <P> </P> <P> U.S. Embassy to Stay Open  </P> <P> Redman said the U.S. Embassy will remain open despite the Bush Administration's  warning to American civilians to leave the country.  </P> <P> "Our people have reason for being there," he said. But he added, "We're  monitoring the situation closely" and could order an evacuation if conditions  deteriorate. News agency accounts from Islamabad said Britain and the United  States were preparing contingency plans for getting their diplomats out.  </P> <P> The Associated Press reported from Kabul that most Americans and other citizens  of Western nations have said they plan to leave the country as soon as  possible.  </P></p>

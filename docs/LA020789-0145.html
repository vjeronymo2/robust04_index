			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 3 CREDITORS OF HEIDI'S FROGEN YOZURT TRY TO PUT CHAIN INTO INVOLUNTARY  BANKRUPTCY  </P> <P> Three creditors of Heidi's Frogen Yozurt Shoppes Inc. filed papers in federal  court Monday seeking to put the troubled dessert chain into involuntary  bankruptcy.  </P> <P> The creditors claim that they are owed a total of more than $106,075. They are:  Southwest Traders Inc., a Temecula distributor that says it is owed $51,634 for  yogurt, toppings and juices that it delivered; the Paper Co. of Anaheim, which  says it is owed $18,655 for bags, cups and other paper supplies, and Superior  Electrical Advertising Inc. of Long Beach, which seeks $35,786 for Heidi's  signs.  </P> <P> The creditors all contend that they were never paid for merchandise and  services provided to Laguna Hills-based Heidi's or to its handful of  company-owned stores.  </P> <P> "I truly believe if we sat by and did nothing, we were guaranteed to get  nothing," said Ken Smith, owner and president of Southwest Traders.  </P> <P> The bankruptcy petition, filed in Santa Ana under Chapter 7 of the U.S.  Bankruptcy Code, means that Heidi's has 20 days to tell the court whether it is  generally paying its debts as they come due.  </P> <P> If Heidi's denies that it is delinquent, the court will set a hearing date and  listen to evidence on that issue, explained William Lobel, a bankruptcy expert  with Irvine's Lobel, Winthrop &amp; Broker. Lobel, who is not connected with  the case, said a judge would then decide whether or not Heidi's is regularly  paying its debts.  </P> <P> Whatever the outcome of the hearing, Lobel said, Heidi's has the right to  convert to a Chapter 11, which provides protection from creditors while it  reorganizes.  </P> <P> Under a Chapter 7 filing, the company stops doing business and its assets are  liquidated. Under a Chapter 11 reorganization, Heidi's continues to operate the  business and can propose a plan to pay its creditors over time. That means the  company could come out of bankruptcy and eventually become healthy.  </P> <P> But the involuntary petition could complicate the pending sale of Heidi's to  Steve's Homemade Ice Cream of New York. Steve's has agreed to purchase the 86%  of Heidi's that is owned by Miller and Executive Vice President Brian Pallas.  </P> <P> Neither Miller nor Pallas could be reached for comment on the bankruptcy  petition.  </P> <P> In an interview Monday, Gary Stevens, Steve's vice chairman of the board, said  he does not believe that the involuntary bankruptcy petition will prevent the  sale, which he expects to close "within the next 2 to 3 days."  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, we'll move to have (the bankruptcy petition) removed  or settle with those creditors very quickly. . . . The company is not  insolvent, and I don't think there's a basis" for the petition.  </P> <P> One possible risk of Steve's buying Heidi's now is that the bankruptcy court  eventually could set the sale aside if the judge decides that Steve's did not  pay enough.  </P></p>

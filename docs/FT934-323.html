			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / German recession over, says economics minister Germany's recession is over and the country can look forward to a steady, strong recovery next year, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, said yesterday. 'At the end of the year, it is becoming clearer that the German economy has come out of the trough,' he said. Mr Rexrodt, who repeated his call for greater flexibility in working hours, said he expected the economy, which this year will have shrunk by 2 per cent, to grow between 0.5 per cent and 1 per cent in 1994. This supports recent estimates by the Bundesbank and reports issued yesterday by the RWI institute for economic forecasting at Essen and the Cologne-based IW institute. However, several German economic institutes and business groups have warned about continuing high unemployment, low investment and structural obstacles to competitiveness. The IW, which published its end-of-year poll of industry yesterday, warned that the recovery would not be sustainable if growth was not matched by higher investment and exports and tighter control on wages. Only a quarter of sectors polled expected a rise in production next year, citing declining export orders and high labour costs. However, the number of respondents expecting a fall in turnover - nearly half in last year's survey - fell to a third. No institute or business group foresees any improvement in the labour market. 'Hopes of a quick recovery which will noticeably benefit the labour market are premature,' said Mr Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German Federation of Chambers of Commerce. The economic institutes predict unemployment, at present 7.8 per cent of the west German labour force, may rise to between 8.2 and 9.5 per cent. The bright spot is east Germany. Growth, which reached 6 per cent this year  -after a contraction of 30 per cent between 1990 and 1992 - is expected to rise to 7.5 per cent. Japan's PM sees upturn, Page 3</p>

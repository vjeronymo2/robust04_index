			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Arts: Boris Christoff - Obituary The Bulgarian bass Boris Christoff has died in Rome at the age of 74. An imposing presence, a voice of granite, he strode the operatic stage with an authority that made him the ideal exponent of the roles of kings, tsars and elder statesmen. In the Russian repertory and Italian operas, especially those of Verdi, there was nobody to equal him in the decades immediately after the Second World War. After studying as a student of law, which he never liked, he was heard by the King of Bulgaria and given funds to study in Rome with the baritone, Riccardo Stracciari. The war years interrupted his vocal tuition and he was eventually held in a German camp for displaced persons, but in 1946 he made his stage debut as Colline in Puccini's La Boheme at Reggio Calabria, an appearance from which he was never to look back. A bass voice as well-focused, as authoritative as his comes once a generation, if that. His first performance of Musorgsky's Boris Godunov came in 1949 at Covent Garden. This was to be one of his two most celebrated portrayals, the other being Philip II in Verdi's Don Carlos (seen, most famously, in Visconti's 1958 production at the Royal Opera House). In both roles his personal magnetism was enormous, melodramatic almost in the Musorgsky, although his ability to balance the implacable outward strength of these two characters with a sensitive feel for their inner weaknesses made them rounded portraits in the fullest sense. It was as Boris Godunov that he made his American debut in 1956 in San Francisco. By this time his career had taken in most of the world's leading opera-houses in a repertoire that extended to the main Verdi bass roles, Wagner's King Mark, Hagen and Gurnemanz, Beethoven's Rocco, and many other parts in Russian operas. If most were dominating characters, that fitted his personality. One commentator remarked that he 'laughs like Mephistopheles and orders a drink with the tone of voice of Boris the Tsar'. Opera managements are said to have crossed him at their peril. The voice itself served him without fault or failing throughout his long career. Even in concert during the 1980s, it had lost none of its rock-hard steadiness. Recordings have captured its quality to fine effect and will display for posterity the range of his artistic sympathies. His Philip II, in particular, sings with quiet contemplation as well as a fearsome roar, while showing a detailed understanding of the words. His complete set of Musorgsky's songs is the work of a devoted song recitalist.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Watchers From Cologne"] </F>   [Text] Lower Saxony's Republikaner are now being watched  by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution  (BfV). This is the BfV's reaction to a court ruling that  prohibited colleagues from the Lower Saxony Office for the  Protection of the Constitution to watch Franz Schoenhuber's  rightist-populist party. The background: The red-green Lower  Saxony has a particularly restrictive constitutional protection  law. According to the ruling, the Land Office may use  intelligence service means against political parties only if  these parties struggle against the Basic Law in a "militant and  aggressive manner." The BfV is affected neither by the land law  nor by the negative ruling.</p>

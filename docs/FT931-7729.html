			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Letter: Talent going to waste Sir, Your article ('Sharing out the available work may top the political agenda', February 18) should provoke a wider debate. Why does the UK allow such wastage of managerial talent, particularly in the field of export financing, at a time when the country is desperate to improve its trade imbalance? As a formerly redundant banker, I will testify for the great numbers of bilingual, marketing-experienced bankers who would leap at the opportunity to provide their services part time within a DTI-sponsored scheme. This could be structured specifically to help small businesses coping with trade financing and other difficulties. R C Mitchell-Hegge, 29 Cloncurry Street, London SW6 6DR</p>

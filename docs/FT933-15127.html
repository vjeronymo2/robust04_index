			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Export rules need reform, judge says LORD JUSTICE SCOTT has written to business leaders, trade unions, government departments and members of the opposition seeking proposals for a reform of Britain's exports and licensing procedures. The judge makes clear that he is considering making recommendations on such a reform as part of the report arising from his arms-to-Iraq inquiry. Lord Justice Scott is understood to consider that present procedures are unsatisfactory, both in terms of government efficiency and democratic accountability. He is questioning whether it is right that the government's control over the removal of goods from the UK still should be set out in the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939. The Act was brought in during a time of war, but the Import and Export Control Act 1990 made it permanent. The judge argues that although the act has 'the merit of simplicity', it 'is not associated with any prescribed procedure for parliamentary scrutiny or control'. He says: 'It is understandable that in the terrible emergency of the outbreak of war, powers of this breadth which are not subject to any parliamentary scrutiny, let alone debate, should have been conferred on government.' He adds: 'It is less understandable that, in peacetime, such powers should be maintained . . . . It appears to me, however, that the powers now permanent . . . are totalitarian in concept and in effect.' Although the full report is not expected to be completed until early next year, responses to the judge's consultation paper are already being prepared for submission at the end of July. The Confederation of British Industry said yesterday that the paper was being 'taken seriously' and had been discussed by an ad hoc committee on export last month, although a formal reply had not yet been formulated. The Department of Trade and Industry said last night that it was still studying the judge's consultation document. Ms Elizabeth Symons, the general secretary of the Association of First Division Civil Servants, the trade union representing middle and high-ranking civil servants, welcomed the judge's initiative.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video; from the "NHK News 7" </F> program]    [Text] The Radio Regulatory Council, an advisory body to  the post and telecommunications minister, has submitted a report  on the future use of high-definition television [HDTV]. The  report proposes that licenses for HDTV broadcasting should be  granted to different stations for each day of the week beginning  this autumn, when test-broadcasting is scheduled to begin, and  that one of the satellite television channels should be  tentatively allocated for HDTV broadcasting after 1997, when  fully-fledged broadcasting is scheduled to begin.    The Post and Telecommunications Ministry plans to start  test-  broadcasting HDTV programs after the current round of  test-broadcasting ends this autumn. It also plans to start full  HDTV broadcasting after 1997 using a new satellite to replace  the current BS-3 satellite.    Licenses for HDTV broadcasting are currently granted only to  the Hi-Definition Television Promotion Association. Today's  report recommends that this should be revised so that all  television stations will be able to produce programs  independently. According to the report, licenses for  test-broadcasting will be granted to different stations for each  day of the week, and each station will be allocated more than  five hours of broadcasting time. NHK will also have more than  five hours of broadcasting everyday, providing a combined total  of more than 10 hours of HDTV broadcasting a day by NHK and  commercial stations. Commercial stations will be allowed to air  advertising.    The report says three of the eight channels on the new  broadcasting satellite will be allocated for current satellite  broadcasting channels. However, these channels will be used for  HDTV broadcasting when HDTV sets become more common. The other  five channels will be allocated for both HDTV and conventional  broadcasts -- one will be tentatively reserved for HDTV  broadcasts. The report says commercial stations can specialize  in sports, news or other areas of their choice, and they will be  allowed to air advertising and charge fees for their programs.    NHK and commercial stations will soon apply to the ministry  for licenses for HDTV test-broadcasting.</p>

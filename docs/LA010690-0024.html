			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NCAA OPENS INVESTIGATION OF BASKETBALL TEAM AT UTEP;  </P> <P> PROBE: REMARKS BY A VALLEY COLLEGE BASKETBALL PLAYER SUGGESTED VIOLATIONS IN  TEXAS SCHOOL'S PROGRAM.  </P> <P> Published comments by Valley College player Shelton Boykin and three other  former members of the Texas-El Paso basketball program have led the NCAA to  begin an investigation of the program, Texas-El Paso Athletic Director Brad  Hovious said Friday.  </P> <P> "We do not feel we are guilty of any wrongdoing, but the publicity generated by  these stories has caused the NCAA to begin a preliminary inquiry into this  matter," Hovious said. "The NCAA has not given us any specific allegations."  </P> <P> Remarks by Boykin in the Times' Valley edition Dec. 15 suggested possible rules  violations at UTEP.  </P> <P> "When we wanted to go out, we'd get a car," Boykin was quoted as saying. "They  were nice cars, Cadillacs, Mercedes, Jaguars. . . . The coaches didn't loan the  cars, but people around the area did. The coaches went by the books, but the  people, that's a different story."  </P> <P> Boykin, who played for UTEP as a freshman in the 1987-88 season, later claimed  he had been misunderstood.  </P> <P> "It was like, if you wanted a ride somewhere, there were some friends around --  just like we have friends out here -- that come pick us up and take us places,"  Boykin said after the Times story appeared.  </P> <P> Former UTEP assistant coach Nate Archibald and former players Jerry Jones and  Sean Harris alluded to similar violations in a story printed last year in  Newsday, a Long Island, N. Y., newspaper.  </P> <P> Newsday quoted the players, who left the basketball program without explanation  during the 1987-88 season, as saying they received cash and free use of cars  from "shoogs" -- sugar daddies.  </P> <P> The players later claimed that they were misquoted.  </P> <P> Hovious said he has investigated, but has found no wrongdoing.  </P> <P> The NCAA could find problems that he failed to discover, Hovious said, adding  that he doesn't know the scope of the investigation.  </P> <P> "This is kind of like the IRS . . . you've paid your tax but you don't know if  you'd paid it all," Hovious said.  </P> <P> NCAA investigators this week are expected to begin a stay of up to two weeks on  campus.  </P> <P> Sophomore forward David Van Dyke said the investigation would not hurt the  Miners, who are off to a 7-5 start. "Yeah, it comes at a bad time, but it  should end real quick," he said.  </P> <P> Calls to Coach Don Haskins' home and office were not answered.  </P> <P> The UTEP basketball program never has been on probation.  </P></p>

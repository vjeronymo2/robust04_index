			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chief of the National Security Agency under the  Belarussian [Belarusian] government Major-General Valeriy Pavlov  told INTERFAX Minsk had not yet voiced its view of the Russian  plans to build bases in Commonwealth republics.    But, Pavlov said the deployment of strategic units of a  foreign army in Belarus was out of question as it would  contradict the Belarussian decision to be a neutral and  nuclear-free country.    In Pavlov's view, the deployment in Belarus of Russian air  bases or antiaircraft units would keep Belarussian armymen in  good shape. The Belarussians would familiarize with advanced  know-how and be able to resolve their social problems.    According to Pavlov, Minsk would study in detail every  scenario for the creation of foreign army bases in Belarus.</p>

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Arts: Isabelle Vernet - Recital The musical year begins well when London's leading recital hall plays host to a debutant singer of rich, strong vocal talent and personality. I first encountered Isabelle Vernet at the 1990 Aix-en-Provence Festival; the following year she gained a host of British admirers during the Cardiff 'Singer of the World' Competition (of which she reached the finals); last year she sang at the Edinburgh Festival and at the Proms. On Monday, she came to the Wigmore Hall to offer her first London song recital: the most searching test, and one passed with honour, if not flying colours. The young French soprano, pupil of Regine Crespin, has a voice of striking warmth and individual colours: even in music which seldom called for full-tilt outpouring, one gained a clear impression of its size and lyric potential. She approaches the characterisation of each song with winning directness; she communicates her responses with appealing candour; she displays uncommon freshness in the act of singing. Miss Vernet had composed a programme - Faure, Poulenc, Hahn, Duparc, Satie, Ravel and Manuel Rosenthal - entirely in her native language. In it she showed a remarkable ability to convey intimacy without ever slipping into the preciousness and arty miniaturisation that are the bane of French-song performance. (Her account of Faure's 'En sourdine' attempted, indeed, a risky full-bloodedness of emotional identification.) The influence of her great and much-loved teacher is obvious in certain inflections of word-utterance; but it is an entirely positive influence, and therefore hardly to be regretted. In comic mode Miss Vernet sparkles: this likewise has benefited from the adoption of Crespin's elegant wit as its model. What at present she seems to lack is absolute security of technique: cleanliness of line, freedom from breathy impurity in the tone. Too often, she sang - with vitality and quick-spirited address - words rather than phrases; too often, little bulges and bumps tended to get in the way of that unforced legato steadiness which should form the basis of Faure and Duparc interpretation. There are not so many young French sopranos of this calibre before the public that one can afford to be sniffy of Miss Vernet's abundant gifts. Equally, one prays that those gifts will be developed and refined in the ways they so plainly require.</p>

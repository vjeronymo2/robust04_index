No one can dare confront the United States politically or  militarily after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Economic  relations issues are not simple because the forces that retain  enough power to resist the United States economically still  remain and because the stronghold in economy is economic power,  just as the last stronghold in international politics is  military power. These forces are none other than the European  Union and Asian countries. The United States' economic offensive  is now focused on the Asian region, including Japan. The weight  of U.S. trade with Asia is greater than with Europe. In  particular, there is a great trade U.S.-Japanese trade  imbalance. This is precisely the very important reason for the  United States to justify its offensive.    It was revealed that the United States pressured Japan to  drastically relax its restrictions after it invoked the Super  301 trade law -- defying public opinion of the world. In  addition, a "rumor" that the United States will apply its  domestic Anti-Monopoly Act to overseas countries spread. We  have suspicions about the true intention of the U.S.  indiscriminate offensive. We cannot but make precautions against  consequences arising from such an offensive. The U.S. demand for  Japan's relaxation of restrictions for 45 items includes some  items that infringe upon Japanese sovereignty. In other words,  this demand includes such requests as establishment of a  third-party inspection organization independent from the  government and participation of foreigners in examining  relaxation of restrictions. Even the order for expanding  facilities of airport storage facilities and for lowering the  airport utility rate is included in the request. One can hardly  judge whether this is a demand to ease trade barriers or an act  to interfere in the administration of other countries.    The U.S. policy to apply the Anti-Monopoly Act overseas,  which was put forward with "a new bayonet," is a retaliatory act  that has lost reason. It was noted that the United States is  going to apply this law so it affects not only the U.S. markets,  but also U.S. exports. Based on a literal interpretation, it  can be noted that all organizations that produce commodities  that are not competitive belong in this category. For example,  large business groups in the ROK must be immediately dissolved  if they want to continue trading with the United States. We do  not mean that we want to protect monopolizing acts of large  business groups, but we wonder if such a reorganization of world  trade is possible. Are U.S. business groups fully prepared for  this? The U.S. act means that the United States will lecture on  antimonopoly and will punish monopolies, while actually building  barriers for its own monopolies in domains of various services  and intellectual properties and collecting royalties on its  monopolized sale.    The effort to establish world trade through transactions  based on fair competition is a different issue from the U.S. act  of enforcing its domestic order onto the world. Frankly  speaking, we feel a great sense of danger and threat regarding  the U.S. intention to reorganize the world into a "U.S.-style."  When the Super 301 trade law was invoked, THE NEW YORK TIMES  published prudent advice to Clinton that efforts to reduce  domestic consumption should be made first, instead of adhering  to an indiscriminate offensive overseas, to eliminate deficits  in U.S. trade with Japan. It should be deservedly coped with if  Japan and other countries repeatedly carry out unfair acts,  including monopoly. Means and method, however, should not be  decided on the basis of a U.S. yardstick. Some unreasonable  steps that the United States has recently taken are regarded  merely as acts to cause trade disputes rather than cause an  increase in trade.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additionally, the FAA has determined that the 120-day compliance time for the proposed initial repetitive inspection is justified when an additional hazard is considered, which was not present in the Model L&hyph;1011 incident. The Model L&hyph;1011 incident resulted in a smoke and fire hazard, due to an electrical fault of a window heat wire bundle. The loss of the window heat function will not, in itself, result in an immediate safety of flight hazard. In the case of the Model 747 incident that prompted issuance of AD 92&hyph;27&hyph;12, the electrical fault resulted in the loss of numerous essential cockpit instruments necessary for continued safe flight and landing, in addition to the smoke and fire hazard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the FAA disagrees that service experience should be used to justify a reduction of the frequency of the repetitive inspection intervals for Model 747&hyph;100 series airplanes. While the FAA does not dispute the commenter's claim regarding lack of in-service chafing incidents on the Model 747&hyph;100, the FAA points out that the wire bundles above the P6 panel are installed on all Model 747&hyph;100, &hyph;200, and &hyph;300 series airplanes in accordance with the same type design data. As a result, the FAA cannot establish that the wire bundle installation on Model 747&hyph;100 series airplanes has specific design features that preclude these airplanes from the potential hazardous condition. The FAA does recognize, however, that some of the airplanes affected by the proposed AD may not exhibit the wire bundle chafing problem. For this reason, paragraph (b)(2)(i) of the proposed AD provides for termination of the repetitive inspections on airplanes that successfully pass a wire bundle clearance inspection and measurement procedure.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ATA, on behalf of one of its members, requests that proposed paragraph (c) only cite the original issue of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;24A2186, dated January 14, 1993, since Revision 1, dated May 20, 1993, contains several typographical errors. The FAA partially concurs. The FAA clarifies that Revision 1 erroneously refers to military specification MIL&hyph;I&hyph;42852 and MIL&hyph;I&hyph;46853 insulating tapes in several paragraphs. MIL&hyph;I&hyph;46852 tape is the correct military specification number and should be inserted wherever MIL&hyph;I&hyph;42852 or MIL&hyph;I&hyph;46853 is identified. The FAA points out that Revision 1 of the service bulletin contains descriptive information not found in the original release of the service bulletin, which may assist operators in performing the optional wire bundle modification. The FAA has included a statement in paragraph (c) of this AD to clarify that MIL&hyph;I&hyph;46852 tape shall be utilized wherever MIL&hyph;I&hyph;42852 tape or MIL&hyph;I&hyph;46853 tape is specified, for those operators that incorporate Revision 1 of the service bulletin. Therefore, with this information included in the AD, the FAA considers that the service bulletin references are appropriate in paragraph (c) of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 700 Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 184 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 1.5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $15,180, or $83 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Should an operator elect to accomplish the optional terminating action that would be provided by this AD action, the number of work hours required to accomplish it would be approximately 1 per airplane, and the cost of required parts would be approximately $32 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket.

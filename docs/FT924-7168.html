			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / De Klerk to face calls to resign Mr F W de Klerk returned from an overseas visit yesterday to face calls for his resignation over revelations of an official military intelligence plot to discredit the African National Congress (ANC), Patti Waldmeir writes. Mr de Klerk said in a television interview before leaving Britain on Monday night that only a 'few individuals' within the security forces could have been involved in such activities, although the judge who disclosed the plot made clear it was sanctioned by the army's top intelligence officer, Gen 'Witkop' Badenhorst. Yesterday the convicted murderer named as the main intelligence operative involved in the plan denied it had ever been put into place. The man, Mr Ferdi Barnard, has been convicted of two murders and theft.</p>

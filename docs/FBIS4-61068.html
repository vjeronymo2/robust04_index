			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Today's World" program] </F>   [Text] The DPRK has (?proposed to the United States) that  talks be held to conclude a peace agreement.    Station commentator (Aleksey Kondratyev) writes on this:    Today, the United States and the DPRK (?have been talking)  on  the [word indistinct] of the Armistice Agreement signed in 1953.  According to Pyongyang, (?the Korea cease-fire) agreement is  incompatible with today's situation. [passage indistinct]  (?Relevant authorities) of the United States and the DPRK have  been making informal contacts. They have even held high-level  talks as many as two times. The third round of talks will  discuss issues on normalizing the relations between the two  countries [words indistinct].    The United States has been delaying talks for the reason  that  Pyongyang has expressed its own position regarding inspections  of nuclear facilities. While Pyongyang refuses to accept  complete international inspections of its own nuclear  facilities, the United States persists in saying that it will  only be willing to resume talks when the complete inspections  are finished. [passage indistinct]    The United States has (?insisted) that the DPRK accept  international inspections of the nuclear sites in Yongbyon.  [passage indistinct]    Pyongyang is maintaining that the issue of inspections of  the  radiochemical laboratory should be raised only in the direct  talks between the DPRK and the United States. The United States  has also expressed its willingness to continue talks with the  DPRK, holding that the nuclear issue should be resolved in a  (?diplomatic) manner.    But, Washington is warning that international (?measures)  can  also be taken in case Pyongyang holds fast to an unconstructive  position regarding nuclear inspections. But, if such sanctions  are taken, the situation on the peninsula will (?become) more  dangerous. So, today's task lies in easing the tension on the  peninsula.    A measure to resolve the nuclear crisis in a peaceful way  should be (?worked out). An international conference  recommended by Russia will help (?make such a measure feasible).</p>

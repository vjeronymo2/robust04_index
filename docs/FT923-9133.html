			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Scrapping of 'needless' audits urged HUNDREDS of thousands of small companies should be freed from the requirement to be audited, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said yesterday. In a consultative document submitted to the Department of Trade and Industry and the Inland Revenue, the institute called for an end to compulsory audits for more than 250,000 companies with turnover of less than Pounds 36,600, the threshold for registration for value added tax. It said companies with turnover of less than Pounds 300,000 a year should also be exempt from auditing on a unanimous vote from their shareholders, although no regulated businesses or other 'public interest' companies should be exempted. Mr Chris Swinson, chairman of the institute's financial reporting and auditing group, said many people viewed statutory auditing as a 'needless and expensive burden for smaller companies'. He estimated that abolishing the audit could reduce a small company's payments to its accountant by 20 per cent to 50 per cent. There might be a case, he said, for requiring a qualified accountant to sign a 'compilation report' - short of a full audit - on the preparation of the accounts. The debate over auditing of small companies was rekindled this year when Mr John Redwood, then minister for corporate affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry, indicated that he was considering the case for abolition. The views of the institute, which represents 100,000 chartered accountants and helps to regulate the majority of registered auditors, are shared by a growing number of other bodies, including the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. The Inland Revenue and other government departments have opposed the removal of the audit because of concerns about the reliability of published financial information without some independent verification. The Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, which includes about 3,000 registered auditors among its members, has been a consistent opponent. It argues that the audit is a cost that accompanies the privileges of incorporation. Mr Swinson emphasised that there would still be the requirement for the directors of limited-liability companies to file accurate accounts at Companies House.</p>

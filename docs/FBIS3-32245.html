			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daly Valet; passages within quote in Creole -- </F> recorded]    [Excerpts] In a news conference, Senator Thomas Eddy  Dupiton denounced subversive maneuvers by some parliamentarians  to involve him in the assassination of Antoine Izmery. He said  he is the victim of machinations aimed at preventing him from  becoming the possible president of the Senate office. Sen.  Dupiton demanded overt evidence of his participation in any plot  aimed at physically eliminating Mr. Izmery. Let us listen to the  report by Daly Valet.    [Begin recording] [Valet] "On Saturday, 11 September 1993,  at  0925, several armed civilians burst into the Sacred Heart Church  in Turgeau where a mass was being celebrated to commemorate the  fifth anniversary of the Saint-Jean Bosco slaughter that caused  the deaths of 13 people in 1988. [passage omitted]    ``During this news conference, Sen. Dupiton presented  himself  as innocent, having had nothing to do with Antoine Izmery's  assassination. Sen. Dupiton accused Sen. Rony Mondestin of  participating in a plot that he said the United Nations is  hatching against him.    ``Furthermore, Sen. Dupiton insisted that Sen. Mondestin  provide an explanation regarding the assassination attempt on  Sen. Raoul Remy, [who was shot three times in Cap-Haitien].  According to Dupiton, Sen. Mondestin had threatened him, so he  is the chief plotter. All of these things will come to an end,  he said, because Colin Granderson must provide an explanation of  the UN report involving me in the assassination of Antoine  Izmery. These were Sen. Dupiton's statements.''    [Dupiton] I am speaking of Sen. Rony Mondestin, who was  identified by Sen. Raoul Remy as the one responsible for the  attempt on his life because Remy identified Mondestin's driver  and because Sen. Rony Mondestin had threatened the senator here  during a session, in the presence of the assembly of senators.    "He had told him: I will get you in Cap-Haitien; I will get  you in Cap-Haitien [repeats]; I will settle my disputes with you  when I get to Cap-Haitien. Well, you see that Remy fell when he  arrived in Cap-Haitien. Of course, Remy accused him personally,  and all the documents were brought to me as president of the  justice commission. Since then, he decided to give me a hard  time. But this matter will come to an end because the United  Nations must now explain where this report came from and what  special committee participated in the preparation of this  report, who was questioned, who saw people in my home." I  welcome all of this. I am waiting for Mr. Granderson's answer.    [Valet] "Sen. Ebrane Cadet sat at the conference table with  Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton. Cadet has already written to Colin  Granderson, current UN representative in Haiti, to ask for an  explanation of the referenced report and a copy of that report  because, according to Cadet, Dupiton's name is cited in it."  [passage omitted]    [Cadet] "We just wrote a letter to the United Nations, to  Butrus Butrus-Ghali so he can provide us with precise, clear,  explicit information not only on this case, but also on the case  relating to the assassination attempts on Sen. Pierre Raoul Remy  and Sen. Thomas Eddy Dupiton, because I would like to have all  this information so justice can be set in motion. It is time for  dishonesty to end in Haiti."    [Valet] "So, according to what you just said, if Sen.  Dupiton  is guilty, you would like the justice department to prosecute  him, would you not?"    [Cadet] "If Sen. Dupiton is guilty, the justice department  must prosecute him. If we could catch all other senators or all  other people involved in crimes in the country, we would be very  happy to institute legal proceedings against them." [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / International Company News: Eurocom to raise FFr660m EUROCOM, the French advertising agency which last summer became a leading player in European marketing services by buying RSCG, one of its chief competitors, has launched a FFr660m (Dollars 122m) convertible bond issue to finance the acquisition. The merger between Eurocom, which is controlled by Havas, the powerful French media group, and RSCG has been clouded by controversy. The two agencies, now called EURO RSCG, have for years fought fiercely in the French advertising market. Their merger was followed by a stream of senior staff departures and account losses. For Eurocom, the acquisition of RSCG - which is best known in France for the involvement of Mr Jacques Seguela, one of its founders, in President Francois Mitterand's publicity campaigns - forms part of its international expansion. This reflects the trend for the large French agencies, including Publicis and Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit, as well as Eurocom, to expand their interests outside France in the face of intense competition from the powerful US, UK and Japanese marketing services groups. Eurocom's largest shareholders, Havas and Parthena Investissement, part of the Suez industrial and financial group, have agreed to participate in the refinancing, as has Banque Nationale de Paris, the state-owned bank which is one of the biggest investors in RSCG. The merger of the two agencies has, according to Eurocom, created the single biggest advertising group in Europe and the sixth largest in the world. Eurocom, which has long dominated the French marketing scene, expects to have made net profits of FFr182m in 1991, a slight decrease of 5.7 per cent on the previous year. Eurocom said the fall in profits was due to the slowdown at Aegis, the London-based European media buying group in which it is an investor. Meanwhile, RSCG, which has been burdened by the debt incurred in its acquisitions during the 1980s, made an estimated net loss of FFr56m before provisions and extraordinary items last year, and an overall loss of around FFr280m.</p>

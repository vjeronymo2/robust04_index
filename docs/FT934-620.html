			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: US recalls a bumper year in corporate fundraising - Companies enjoyed low interest rates and high equity prices The US capital markets may not see anything like it again for many years. Driven by the lowest long-term interest rates for a quarter of a century, and equity dividend yields at the bottom of their historical range, US companies have engaged in an orgy of capital-raising and refinancing over the past 12 months. Although the US capital markets are likely to remain busy for the first quarter - and perhaps the first half - of next year, few expect 1994 to match 1993. Two forces have driven the surge in bond and equity issues this year. First, low long-term interest rates have prompted a wave of debt refinancing. This has been true both for investment grade and, even more notably, junk-rated issuers, many of whom have refinanced paper issued during the last junk bond boom of the late 1980s. Second, high equity prices have made it possible for a wide range of companies to issue shares, hastening the process of de-gearing under way since the start of the 1990s. Unless bond yields go much lower, both of these forces will be less in evidence next year. Given the favourable conditions in the capital markets, it is not surprising that bank lending has remained depressed. Total syndicated bank loans so far this year amount to Dollars 340bn, some Dollars 20bn less than last year, according to Loan Pricing Corporation in New York. This decline looks all the more marked given the sharp improvement in the financial health of the US's commercial banks. A moderate price war in bank lending has resulted - though it has not been on a par with the 1980s, when lending margins collapsed in the face of fierce competition. A typical single-A rated company could now borrow at 40 basis points over Libor, down from 50 basis points at the start of the year, says Loan Pricing. Also, covenants have been relaxed for some better credits. This amounts to a slight thaw, rather than an outright deluge. One sign that the banks are holding out against pressure to give in to borrowers was the resistance encountered by IBM last month when it tried to push down the fees on a Dollars 10bn financing. It was the second-biggest corporate financing ever arranged (General Motors had pulled off the largest earlier in the year). The company had to sweeten the fees offered on the deal after some banks balked at underwriting the transaction - though in general syndication later, it proved a big success. Two things could increase the demand for bank finance, though neither seems likely at this stage. First, if the Federal Reserve chooses to give interest rates a sharp push upwards, rather than adopting the gentle and gradual tightening which is widely expected, the capital markets could quickly become a hostile place. The second factor which would change the complexion of the US capital markets is a change in US corporations' need for capital. If the US economy continues to grow at the pace of the last quarter of this year, rather than slackening off, many companies are likely to build their inventory levels. Towards the end of the year, if the growth continues at a fast pace, there could also be demand for capital from companies looking to build new capacity. Banks have been natural providers of both these forms of financing in the past. Few banks, though, are expecting much of an upturn in demand for a while. Wall Street, meanwhile, is looking overseas for a continuation of the capital markets boom. With interest rates and bond yields falling internationally, the financing pattern that has characterised the US could be repeated elsewhere. 'They're a couple of years behind in that cycle,' says Mr David Komansky, executive vice president in charge of capital markets at Merrill Lynch. Most US investment banks, he says, have been building their capacity overseas to take advantage of the coming boom in international capital markets. If this is right, the next stage of the capital markets boom will be felt around the world, not just in the US.  --------------------------------------------------------           US CORPORATE BOND ISSUES (Dollars bn)  --------------------------------------------------------              Investment    Sub-investment    Total                grade            grade  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991           146.1             10.0        156.1 1992           183.7             38.2        221.9 1993*          222.6             53.2        275.8  -------------------------------------------------------- * To December 16 Source: Securities Data  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

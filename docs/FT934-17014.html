			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / As They Say in Europe: The confusing route to press freedom SPENDING a few days in the US always leads, at least in my case, to a renewed awareness of the prestige of newspapers and the written word. I was first struck by a story in the New York Times last weekend which opened with the words, 'On an April evening this year, three women stopped outside the student union building building at Pennsylvania State University and began throwing thousands of copies of a conservative-run newspaper into their car, plunging the campus into a debate over free speech and the limits of protest.' The problem had arisen over the paper's depiction of a female columnist on a rival publication wearing a bikini. In the cartoon she sits on a bed whose headboard reads, 'feminist at work.' A professor of women's studies at the university called the theft of the newspapers a legitimate response to the paper's campaign of harassment against women. The next day the same paper carried a front page story about the mandatory sexual consent workshops that are part of student life at Antioch College in Ohio. The code, in the words of its advocate, one Karen Hall, starts: 'If you want to take her blouse off you have to to ask.' It continues with a litany of injunctions (I will not communicate them in a respectable newspaper) that end always end with ' . . . you have to ask.' This awareness of the role of the law and the word in relations between the sexes in the US was further enhanced by a campaign launched by the powerful gun lobby, the National Rifle Association. It is putting advertisements in the Ladies' Home Journal. You do not actually see a picture of an M-16 nestling against publicity material for Calvin Klein's Obsession, just a plea to consider the nature of the right to own an M-16. In western Europe there is nothing to match the rich variety of American freedoms and debate, nothing like the argument over whether the theft of newspapers is a form of 'counterspeech.' And no young man believes that his assumed right to investigate the intricacies of his girlfriend's blouse might lead to his being blown away by a semi-automatic rifle as the woman asserts her right to say, 'No]' In Europe there are few strict laws on rights and wrongs: incitement to racial hatred is one example, but rarely does a legal debate ensue. Among the variations are the rigid British rules on reporting judicial matters: you can read that the 'murderer has been taken into custody' in the papers of almost any country. But in Britain one can go no farther than 'a man is helping police with their inquiries.' At times news stories become virtually incomprehensible as a result, since these 'inquiries' may take place years after the original incident. In the Mediterranean, it is not the word (and certainly not prisoner's rights) that is sacred but the picture. Picture book news is an essential part of Latin culture and accounts for the success of a magazine like Hola] In Spain people know how to read the pictures. They note that in British newspapers there are never pictures of mutilated corpses, nasty wounds, or grimacing heads poking out of the ends of stretchers. The grisly picture is an essential part of the Mediterranean story, the public's right to know. In the US the result is similar, for pictures enjoy the protection of legislation guaranteeing freedom of speech, even pornographic pictures are protected by the First Amendment even though they are decorated by scarcely a word of print. In Britain the concept of the 'inalienable right' seems to apply most importantly to the right to publish trivia. These include information on the identity and habits of cabinet ministers' mistresses, the long-forgotten misdemeanours of those who appear in television soap operas and speculation about what members of the royal family might have said in private. But the 'right of the public to know,' as it is called, does not apply to information on how decisions are reached to impose new forms of taxation or to the nature of the advice received by those who run the affairs of the nation. In the US if newspapers wish to find out about such matters there are no laws to stop them, in Germany they leak out through the amazingly diverse components of the power structure in that country. But there 'the right to know' seems to consist of the absolute right of German newspaper readers to know what journalists think, for the opinions of these important people are given pride of place on the front page of the better sort of paper. That presumably is a reaction to the earlier situation where the opinion of only one person appeared. So it is that what one nation regards as an absolutely essential element of a free society is prohibited or despised in another. How can those peoples who have so recently embarked on the road to freedom and democracy must be dazed and confused by the conflicting choice of routes on offer?

			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Falls in region vary as Japan worries about tax plans Japanese investors concentrated on the lack of agreement within the coalition government, yet again, on how to finance the planned income tax cut which is the centrepiece of its economic stimulus package, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average lost 287.03, or 1.4 per cent, to 20,014.40 as the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.36 to 1,601.44. Traders acknowledged that Friday's fall on Wall Street due to the rise in the Fed Funds rate was also discouraging some investors since foreigners, especially US fund managers, were among active buyers of Japanese stocks during the past few weeks. The Nikkei opened at the day's high of 20,254.93 and fell on arbitrage led selling, hitting a low of 20,012.20 in the early afternoon. Traders were cheered by support at the 20,000 level, but some of them feared that it could be breached if the government further delays its economic support package. Volume came to 300m shares, against 377m. Activity dropped sharply in the afternoon session as investors retreated to the sidelines due to the political situation. Declines outscored advances by 746 to 293, with 130 issues unchanged. In London, however, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index improved by 3.26 to 1,328.33. Some high-technology issues were firmer on the multimedia theme. Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial gained Y10 apiece at Y6,290 and Y1,680 respectively. However, Fujitsu, the most active issue of the day, dipped Y10 to Y1,050 on profit-taking and TDK shed Y140 to Y4,260. Continued profit-taking in banks by corporate investors depressed Industrial Bank of Japan by Y30 to Y3,100 and Sakura Bank by Y30 to Y1,490. Brokers were also lower, with Nomura Securities ending Y10 off at Y2,260. Issues newly introduced into the Nikkei 300 index rose ahead of the launch of the Nikkei 300 futures contract on the Osaka stock exchange next Monday. FamilyMart, the convenience store chain, put on Y30 at Y6,800 and Orix, the non-banking financial institution, firmed Y10 to Y3,570. In Osaka, the OSE average receded 81.44 to 21,700.92 in volume of 57m shares. Roundup The region's markets reacted by widely varying amounts to the rise in US interest rates, with those more heavily exposed to the dollar showing the steepest declines. Activity this week will also be influenced by closure for the Chinese new year on Thursday. Taiwan was already closed. However, India went its own way, upwards. HONG KONG's domestic investors joined overseas institutions in selling which took the Hang Seng index down by 743.30 to 11,414.27. Turnover was HKDollars 9.67bn. The Fed Funds rate rise, said brokers, had triggered an inevitable correction after a 60 per cent market gain in the fourth quarter of 1993, although selling intensified in the afternoon as Nomura, the Japanese broker, cut its weighting of Hong Kong stocks from 3 per cent to zero. Property shares were hard hit on the thought that local mortgage interest rates were now likely to rise. HSBC Holdings, the most active counter and strong last week, retreated HKDollars 7 to HKDollars 124. BANGKOK dropped 99, or 6.9 per cent, to 1,344.81, the worst fall in the region. Turnover rose from Bt9.5bn to Bt10.9bn. The big three banks, Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers and Krung Thai, were among the top 10 losers, with falls of Bt9 to Bt188, Bt8 to Bt108 and Bt3.50 to Bt57.50 respectively. BOMBAY went against the trend as the BSE index soared 224.24 to 4,141.81, helped, said Mr Nigel Spence of Lehman Brothers, by a flood of both foreign and domestic money and expectations of further economic liberalisation measures in the budget, due later this month. SEOUL was affected by the introduction of government measures to cool the market's recent rally, and the composite index slipped 27.72 to 914.88. The three most heavily capitalised stocks, Samsung Electronics, steel manufacturer Posco and Hyundai Motor, went the day's limit down at the opening, but recovered a little later. Samsung and Posco ended Won2,000 off at Won65,000 and Won58,500 respectively and Hyundai shed Won1,600 to Won39,200. MANILA was unsettled by a general strike called for tomorrow to protest at the recent increase in prices of oil, electricity and transport fares. The composite index declined 74.44 to 2,890.94 in turnover of 990.4m pesos, down from Friday's 2.5bn pesos. Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which lost 12.50 cents to Dollars 75.50 in New York trading on Friday, fell 40 pesos to 2,105 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR registered its largest one-day fall since January 12, the composite index losing 53.30 at 1,094.02. AUSTRALIA saw an early drop reduced by bargain hunting, leaving the All Ordinaries index down a net 51.7 at 2,281.1. Turnover was ADollars 600.2m. BHP shed 34 cents at ADollars 18.92 and News Corp 32 cents at ADollars 10.08.  ---------------------------------------- ASIA - DAY'S MOVE  ---------------------------------------- Bangkok                    -6.8% Hong Kong                  -6.1% Kuala Lumpur               -4.6% Seoul                      -2.9% Manila                     -2.5% Australia                  -2.2% Singapore                  -1.9% New Zealand                -1.9% Bombay                     +5.7%  ----------------------------------------</p>

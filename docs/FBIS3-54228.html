			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Anat Peleg] </F>   [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's meeting with about  2,800 high school seniors at the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv  ended some 30 minutes ago. His entrance, as well as his  remarks, was met with mixed reactions: applause along with boos.    We are tomorrow's soldiers, the students said, asking the  prime minister how al-Asad's Sunday [16 January] news conference  in Geneva affected his view of the essence of peace with Syria.  The prime minister replied that President al-Asad's remarks did  not meet his expectations. I was disappointed with the fact  that President Clinton alone replied to the question on the  nature of peace, Rabin said, but we will pursue the negotiations  with Syria because we want to be able to look your parents  straight in the eye. Under the Labor party platform, we are  committed to act toward peace.    To the students' surprise, he dissociated himself from his  pre-election statement that the Golan is an inseparable part of  the State of Israel:    [Begin Rabin recording] You say that before the elections, I  promised that the Golan Heights is an inseparable part of  Israel. Show me where it was that I promised this before the  elections! What did I say? [applause and boos] Never mind,  never mind. [end recording]    He added: We have discussed territorial compromise, and we  will act to achieve it. What are the red lines that warrant  Israel's backing out of its agreement with the PLO? In his  reply, Rabin warned of the implications of such a step:    [Begin Rabin recording] When a legally elected government  signs an agreement but does not abide by it, you should know  that the next day, Arab countries would see it as a license not  to abide by their agreements with us. [applause] Nothing is  more serious than that. [end recording]    The young people wanted to know how the prime minister will  react to soldiers' disobeying orders to evacuate settlers in the  territories. Rabin replied that disobedience motivated by  political considerations would be the end of the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces].    He chose to conclude with praise for the unique dedication  and loyalty of Israeli youths, who go through compulsory army  service duty as if they were volunteering.</p>

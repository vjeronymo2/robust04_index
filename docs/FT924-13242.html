			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: The hidden agenda The European Community, in spite of the peace, stability and prosperity which it has given to all of its members, is repeatedly called into question. The special European Council meeting in Birmingham today will have as its main theme the principle of subsidiarity. According to this principle, decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the citizen. The EC should act only when individual and separate action is not sufficient. The principle is one which has been followed for years in the area of EC legislation that I know best - the environment - and rational and ordered discussion of it is something that the European Commission should, and does, welcome. But there are signs that the subsidiarity argument is being used as a smoke screen for another, more sinister, purpose. In France, Germany, Britain and elsewhere political figures such as President Francois Mitterrand, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Prime Minister John Major are rounding on the Commission, in public at least, in their search for a scapegoat. They are seeking to blame the Commission for the apparent gulf that has appeared, in virtually all member states of the EC, between the elected politicians and their electorates. The real aim is to weaken the Commission and thus slow moves towards the union to which they all profess to aspire. Of course, these attacks are nothing new. The Commission is used to accusations of being a bloated, centralised, power-hungry bureaucracy. These tend to occur especially at times of economic difficulty or recession, as is now the case. A dispassionate examination of the facts shows that such an argument does not hold water. The Commission employs some 14,000 civil servants, fewer than the city of Birmingham or Edinburgh, both of which are hosting European Council meetings this year. Many of the Commission's staff are employed in the linguistic service as translators and interpreters. Moreover, the Commission does not have direct legislative powers. European laws are not adopted by the Commission but by the Council of Ministers which is formed of the ministers of the democratically elected governments of the member states. The Commission does have the exclusive right to propose legislation but that power, important as it is, must be put in context. In 1991, only 6 per cent, or 30 of the 535 proposals, were put forward by the Commission on its own initiative; the others were the result of decisions already taken or requests from ministers. This is hardly the conduct of an overweening bureaucracy drunk with power. Nor is that image of the Commission confirmed if we look at the way in which it drafts its proposals. In the first place large numbers of experts from national civil services on detachment to the Commission work side by side with permanent EC officials on the drafting of proposals. At each stage of the preparation drafts are discussed, not only with the sectors concerned (industry, consumers and so on), but also with working groups composed of experts from all the national civil services. The politicians seeking to denigrate the Commission today know this, but prefer to indulge in these tactics rather than explain the benefits which for more than 30 years the EC has brought to its member states. They know that, without the Commission, an EC made up of states so diverse in size, in history and in culture would have been impossible. They know that an independent Commission guarantees the necessary impartiality between the states both in proposed legislation and in the application thereof. They know that the one thing that the Maastricht treaty does not do is to increase the powers of the Commission. The democratically elected parliament and the council of elected ministers alone emerge with enhanced powers. Why then do the critics persist? Are they afraid of the truth? Or are they trying to hide their own weaknesses resulting from too long a period in power or from party or coalition problems? Europe's people are sending a clear message to their political leaders but, as yet, they are not receiving a clear reply. Of course, the EC must be more open, more accountable - but the true nature and benefits of the EC must be painstakingly explained to its citizens. That is what the politicians should be doing, rather than reacting with ill-judged and false accusations, with which they hope to pacify those fanatics who would seek to haul Europe back into the past and destroy the achievements of the past 40 years.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] (NA-DYN) -- The Argentine government and Iberia  reached an agreement yesterday [17 March] on the future of  Aerolineas Argentinas (ARSA) whereby the Spanish airline's  shareholding is increased to 85 percent.    At a joint press conference attended by ARSA and Iberia  executives, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo said that the  Spanish airline has made a 500 million dollar capital injection  of which 100 million will go to reserves and the remaining 400  million towards settling accrued debts.    The Argentine government in turn will hang on to 15 percent  of the share packet of which 10 percent has been assigned to the  employee shareholding programme.    The government will also authorize ARSA and any other  airline  that operates in Argentina to run its own aircraft servicing  facilities and will restrict the availability of non-regular  flights.    There will be no restriction on the number of flights on  domestic routes.    ARSA will continue as a national flag carrier, a condition  which the government has undertaken to defend should any  protests arise from countries with which it has bilateral  aerocommercial agreements and who object that Iberia owns more  than 49 percent of ARSA.    At the same time the government is able to maintain its  rights to veto even though its shareholding could sink below the  five percent stipulated in the privatization process.    ARSA however no longer has the power to veto route  management  decisions or the investment plan.    After three years and four months of intrigue and failed  discussions, yesterday's deal ironically takes the whole  privatization process back to its first stage. The new share  distribution is exactly the same as the original distribution  made when ARSA was first privatized. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SPIDER-MAN SNARES COMIC BOOK HONORS  </P> <P> Dick Tracy has a gang of funny-faced bad guys on the run in movie theaters and  Bart Simpson rules television airwaves and T-shirt sales, but the summer  belongs to Spider-Man for comic book fans.  </P> <P> Less than two weeks after its release in June, the first issue of a new Marvel  Comics series, titled simply "Spider-Man," became the best-selling comic in  U.S. history.  </P> <P> And the wisecracking web-slinger snared "favorite character" honors in the  annual Comics Buyer's Guide readers poll. The wall-crawler defeated Batman,  last summer's box office sensation and titleholder since 1985.  </P> <P> Spidey's success has Hollywood sniffing around for a movie deal.  </P> <P> "When it comes right down to it, I can be pretty awesome if I want,"  Spider-Man, also known as Peter Parker, said in an introspective moment in the  first comic in the new series, "Spider-Man No. 1."  </P> <P> He debuted in 1962 as an unpopular teen-ager whose life changed when he was  bitten by a radioactive spider. Today, he's a graduate student in biophysics  who shares a New York loft with his glamorous actress-model wife.  </P> <P> "He's changing with the times, but still contains a lot of the stuff that  attracted (people) to the character in the first place," said Spider-Man's  editor, Jim Salicrup.  </P> <P> Canadian cartoon artist Todd McFarlane, 29, gets much of the credit for the new  comic book series' success. Previously, he drew for "Amazing Spider-Man," the  title of the original comic book series. In 1988, he redesigned the costume to  add a "creepier" feel.  </P> <P> The new series' first run of 2.35 million copies sold out, so Marvel is  printing another 400,000, said Pamela Rutt, a spokeswoman for the country's  largest comic book publisher.  </P></p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (10): Success follows a difficult birth - Brazil / Privatisation EDUARDO MODIANO, the head of Brazil's privatisation programme, has reason to feel proud. Rarely has a programme had such an inauspicious beginning: the auction of the Usiminas steel mill was mired in angry riots and legal controversy. Six months and 30 legal processes later the programme is running so smoothly that union leaders in three state steel companies have asked for a speeding up so they can compete with the privatised companies. Now on his eighth sale, Mr Modiano is focusing on increasing foreign participation. So far this has been conspicuous by its absence, partly frightened off by the Usiminas debacle and the instability of the Brazilian economy, and partly deterred by the programme's rules. Of the Dollars 1.71bn raised so far only 1.9 per cent has been in the form of foreign debt paper - most of the rest coming from privatisation certificates (which financial institutions were forced to buy in 1990-91) and domestic debt swapped at face value. Consequently, Mr Modiano has been stripping away restrictions to foreign capital. A two-year lock-in period for shares in privatised companies has been abolished allowing foreigners to trade or sell shares the next day. Restrictions on remittances and dividends have been removed and the period the capital must stay in Brazil has been reduced from 12 years to six. The 40 per cent lid on voting capital remains but Mr Modiano points out that the Congress is due to vote on a project ending regulatory discrim-ination between foreign and Brazilian capital. 'Once that is accepted the 40 per cent limit becomes redundant,' he says. He is also lobbying hard to end the fixed 25 per cent discount on foreign debt which he believes is the main deterrent to foreign participation, holders of MYDFAs (the main foreign debt instrument) preferring to wait for the hoped-for Brady type renegotiation of the commercial debt this year. Mr Modiano is battling with the Central Bank to replace this discount with an auction system. He argues: 'At the start of the programme we envisaged Dollars 80bn available in privatisation currencies but this restriction has kept out Dollars 45bn (the quantity of MYDFAs).' Mr Modiano is eager for this to be revised before the petrochemical companies go on sale because he believes there will be much foreign interest. Meanwhile, the two-sale-a-month schedule has been slowed down 'to meet with the capacity of the market'. Though the first seven parastatals all fetched more than the minimum price, since February one sale has been delayed and two cancelled because of lack of buyers. Mr Modiano is resisting demands to sell off the entire steel sector by the end of this year. 'We can't sell five big steel companies each of around Dollars 1bn in five months. We have to move with demand.' This year he will sell two steel mills - Acesita and Tubarao. The programme will not be completed during the present government's term. Brazil has a huge state sector with more than 150 state-controlled companies and several hundred more in which it has a minority interest. Mr Modiano plans to sell at least 14 more companies to raise Dollars 3.4bn this year. The programme now includes 32 companies and has been broadened to include Embraer, the state aerospace company, and Lloyd Brasileiro, the state shipping company, as well as RFFSA, the deeply indebted state railway. But the sector which arouses most interest is telecommunications and many foreign investors have eyes only for Telebras. A constitutional amendment to end the state monopoly in infrastructure is due to go before Congress.</p>

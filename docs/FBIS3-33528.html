Andre Santini, chairman of the Production and Exchange  Commission of the French National Assembly, spoke on behalf of  the mission representing various French legislative groups and  commented on the his pleasant interview with Cuban President  Fidel Castro.    It was interesting for us to meet with one of the most  important figures in contemporary history, and we will always  cherish this moment, said Santini, who is also a former  minister. He described as pleasant and very cordial the  conversation he held with the president who, he explained, was  very interested in the French legislature and in exchanging  viewpoints on the most important current world events.    During their stay in Cuba, the legislators also met with  Vice  President Carlos Lage, Ricardo Alarcon, president of the  People's Government National Assembly, and the ministers of  foreign relations, education, and public health, among other  officials.    Santini said they have seen a country that resists in spite  of the prevailing difficult conditions and that is ready to  accept change without giving up its political ideology. He  noted that the delegation will present a report to the National  Assembly and the French prime minister calling for an increase  in the current line of credit of $120 million that Paris has  available to Cuba, recognizing that there are good possibilities  for foreign investments in Cuba.    Some international media say Cuba will fail and that the  people here are starving to death, but we have not seen anything  like that during our visit, Santini emphasized.    The French parliamentary delegation will return to its  country tomorrow, Saturday, after completing its final  activities in Cuba.</p>

			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DISSIDENTS WINNING IN HUNGARY  </P> <P> The center-right Hungarian Democratic Forum, an anti-communist party launched  by dissidents 18 months ago, emerged the apparent winner in the nation's first  free multi-party elections in more than four decades, returns showed today.  </P> <P> Voters in the first round of parliamentary elections Sunday rejected the  old-line Communist Party, which received little more than 3% of the vote.  </P> <P> The Hungarian Socialist Party, consisting of the bulk of the former Communist  Party and renamed and reoriented last fall on a parliamentary pro-democracy  line, did only a little better with about 10%.  </P> <P> With 54% of the votes counted for the 152 county seats, the Forum garnered  24.53%, followed by its chief rival, the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats  with 20.63%.  </P> <P> The old Hungarian Socialist Workers Party -- consisting of the unrepentant  communists -- held 3.69%, an indication that it may not even be represented in  the Parliament it totally controlled for decades. The cutoff for a party to be  represented in Parliament is 4%.  </P></p>

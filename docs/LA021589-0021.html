			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY MAY LIFT ITS BAN, LEASE OLIVE VIEW LAND TO RAISE MONEY  </P> <P> Los Angeles County's self-imposed moratorium on developing vacant land at Olive  View Medical Center in Sylmar could be ending soon, according to a report  released Tuesday to the Board of Supervisors.  </P> <P> County officials have estimated that leasing a small portion of the hospital's  property to a private developer could generate $20 million in revenue for the  cash-strapped county during the next 20 years. A 34-acre site west of the  medical center would be leased for light industrial or commercial and retail  use.  </P> <P> "From an economic standpoint, we feel the favorable market conditions in the  Sylmar area support proceeding with the project," wrote Chief Administrative  Officer Richard B. Dixon.  </P> <P> More than four years have elapsed since the county last proposed making money  off empty land at the medical center. But the plan to lease space to a  water-slide amusement park outraged community activists. They persuaded  Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the area, to kill the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Promise From County  </P> <P> Residents also extracted a promise from the county that no development plans  would be unveiled until Olive View had been operating for two years. It was  agreed that this would allow time to see how the new medical center, which  opened in the spring of 1987, would affect surrounding neighborhoods. At the  time, residents said they were especially concerned about the increased traffic  the hospital would generate.  </P> <P> The county is conducting traffic studies, updating its appraisals of the  hospital property and preparing drawings of a typical business park. If the  results are positive, county officials hope to hold public hearings on the  proposal to lease land. In May, the county could circulate its proposal among  developers.  </P> <P> If the proposal is approved by the board, the county anticipates selecting a  developer by March, 1990, and signing a lease four months later.  </P> <P> Hannah Dyke, a founder of Olive View Neighborhood Watch, said it would be  premature to predict the community's reaction to revised development plans.  </P> <P> But she added: "We'll be extremely concerned about the traffic. We will be  concerned about the provision for people who ride horses in the area and what  type of development they will put in."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Angry About Plans  </P> <P> Chuck O'Connell, an officer of the group, said he was angry that the county had  made preliminary plans without consulting the community.  </P> <P> "I'm really surprised and disappointed," he said. "We'll have to get cracking  again to have them not step on the community again."  </P> <P> The Olive View update was requested last week by Supervisor Pete Schabarum, who  expressed frustration that the land had remained vacant for so long. He  complained that the county was losing a money-making opportunity.  </P> <P> After reading the report, Schabarum remained unsatisfied. He complained Tuesday  that the county had not considered selling a large chunk of land to a home  builder and had considered leasing only 34 acres. County officials estimated  that there are as many as 600 empty acres on the Olive View grounds, with some  reserved for potential hospital expansion.  </P> <P> "That property is just in limbo," Schabarum said. "Nobody wants to deal with  it."  </P> <P> Dixon promised Schabarum that his office would explore selling some of the  property or leasing more land.  </P> <P> Antonovich sat quietly at the meeting while Schabarum talked. But Antonovich's  chief deputy, Tom Silver, said later that the supervisor was keeping an open  mind on the property's fate.  </P> <P> "We really haven't formulated any view," Silver said. "We are still looking at  the reports as they come down."  </P> <P> When asked if Antonovich favored some type of development, Silver responded:  "All things being equal, we should get some revenue out of it."  </P></p>

			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BZW scrip scheme benefits BAT THE BUDGET did no favours to the corporate financiers at BZW who yesterday unveiled an ingenious scheme which will allow BAT Industries to offer shareholders a scrip dividend worth 50 per cent more than its final cash payment. By promising to tackle the problem of surplus advance corporation tax next year, the Chancellor limited the shelf life of a product which will be closely examined throughout the City - even if it can only be of use to a small minority Mr Amir Eilon of BZW, said the problem with paying dividends in shares for most classes of shareholders was that it was not very tax-efficient. Because ACT is not payable on scrip issues, pension funds could not reclaim a credit, and ordinary shareholders were liable to pay Capital Gains Tax on the proceeds from selling the scrip shares. These considerations have meant that take-up rates of scrip issues have only been 4-5 per cent by value. The problem with scrip dividends for most companies is that, by expanding the share base, they dilute the net asset value and earnings per share. The numbers stack up favourably for only a few companies, such as BAT, which has a high tax charge - because large overseas earnings produce an unrelieved ACT problem - and which is confident it can employ cash efficiently the dividend cash saved. BZW said BAT, which had a year-end tax rate of 41.5 per cent, could save up to Pounds 97m of ACT and up to Pounds 330m in cash by paying the dividend in scrip. The group's net asset value could be enhanced by as much as 6.2 per cent and earnings per share would be undiluted so long as the group earned a return on assets in excess of 9.3 per cent. In fact, BAT's return on assets from its tobacco businesses is about 20 per cent. Last year's earnings per share of 58.7p would be increased to 60.9p if there was a 50 per cent take-up of the scrip issue, and 63.5p if there was a full take-up. What other companies could benefit from this sort of scheme - and why has none done so before? BZW said possible candidates would have to pass through two 'filters' - having both the ACT problem, and the ability to use the money released profitably. Mr Eilon said only a 'large handful' of FT-SE 100 companies fulfilled both criteria, and BZW had approached several of them. He expected others to follow in BAT's footsteps, although time was limited - the Chancellor said he would solve the problem of unrelieved ACT by introducing Foreign Income Dividends next year. Another important element in the deal is BZW's offer of the cash alternative. It will buy the 33.9p scrip at 32.2p - the 5 per cent discount being to help cover the stockbroker's market risk in taking an unspecified number of shares onto its books. Most institutions which wish to sell will be able to obtain better terms in the market themselves, but BZW's underwriting provides crucial liquidity at a modest price for other shareholders. BZW said there was no 'magic ingredient' in the scheme - 'just an awful lot of hard work'. There might be some surprise that the Inland Revenue passed the scheme, but Mr Eilon said he believed this was because it was with the grain of current government thinking. One institutional shareholder, Standard Life, said it was 'pretty indifferent' about the proposal, which had nothing in it for gross funds - institutions such as pension funds which pay no tax. BZW said said it was confident that other institutional shareholders would provide the 75 per cent majority needed at May's AGM. Income funds are allowed to treat the scrip issue as income, but retail investors in Personal Equity Plans may encounter some difficulties, if the rules of their scheme oblige managers to take dividends rather than scrip. BZW said BAT was trying to ensure that its corporate PEP could take the scrip, but said the position of other PEPs would vary according to the rules of the individual schemes.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet by </F> unidentified press correspondents aboard the airplane carrying  him home from Moscow on 18 June -- Kiet's remarks are recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] Could you discuss the significance  of your visit and its most successful aspects?    [Vo Van Kiet] My visit was to help create conditions for  renewed cooperation between Vietnam and these countries. We  renewed and restored all the relations we had in the periods  from 1992 to early 1993 and from 1993 to early 1994. Vietnam  and these countries signed a number of agreements. We signed  with the Russian Federation a new treaty to replace the old one,  which had been signed with the former Soviet Union. We  successfully surmounted this hurdle. The new treaty, though  based on the same old friendly spirit, does not follow the old  pattern of doing business. The two sides now will conduct  business in accordance with the new principles of relations.  This will create new advantages for us to expand our friendly  cooperation. During this visit, our businessmen and officials  from various sectors were able to get in touch with the real  situation. Through their exchanges of views and observations,  they saw with their own eyes many potentials more substantively.  This was a good opportunity for us to rebuild our relations.    [Correspondent] How far did Vietnam and these countries  discuss those difficulties that obstructed their relations? And  is there any prospect that those treaties and agreements already  signed between Vietnam and these countries during your visit  will soon be implemented?    [Vo Van Kiet] They raised their demands with us and also  resolved those issues we raised with them such as the question  of debt liquidation, the transportation issue, and the question  of ensuring synchronization for the working apparatus of both  sides. All these issues will be resolved on a step-by-step  basis. For instance, Kazakhstan, a land-locked country, asked us  for cooperation in ground and air transportation. But we were  only interested in railroad cooperation.    This time the two sides [Vietnam and Russia] signed a new  treaty to replace the old one signed with the former Soviet  Union. From now all, all new agreements will be based on the new  principles laid down in this treaty.    Based on the spirit of this new treaty, we will review  various old agreements to adjust and revise inappropriate  provisions. Both sides will continue to discuss issues  concerning the avoidance of double taxation and measures to  promote investment protection while strengthening cooperation in  the implementation of the treaty.    [Correspondent] Will the establishment of direct  relationships between Vietnam and the CIS states be more  advantageous than the relationship between Vietnam and those  republics of the former Soviet Union in the past?    [Vo Van Kiet] In the past, we made contact with various  Soviet Republics through the former Soviet Union, now we have  established direct relationships with the CIS states as well as  with the Russian Federation. This has created favorable  conditions for us to directly get in touch and closely cooperate  with these independent states.    Dear friends: the Prime Minister also answered many other  questions asked by newsmen, including those issues related to  Vietnamese workers abroad, measures and orientations for  cooperation with these friendly states to reorganize Vietnamese  workers and provide jobs for them, plans to help and create  favorable conditions for them to return home at the end of their  contracts, and appropriate measures to deal with those  Vietnamese workers who violate the law of the host countries.</p>

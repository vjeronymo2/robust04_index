			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: PWA loss widens to CDollars 44m PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, yesterday unveiled a sharply higher second-quarter loss. However, the group said its financial restructuring was falling into place and its operating performance had improved. Net loss before restructuring costs was CDollars 44.3m (USDollars 34.7m), against a loss of CDollars 33.8m a year earlier. However, including charges totalling CDollars 85.7m, the final loss came out at CDollars 130.6m, or CDollars 2.73, compared with a deficit of CDollars 34.4m, or 74 cents. The year-earlier loss included CDollars 24.8m special gain. For the first half, the group's final loss was CDollars 237.7m, or CDollars 4.97 a share, against one of CDollars 108.3m, or CDollars 2.30, a year earlier. Second-quarter operating revenues rose 3 per cent to CDollars 727m. In the first half they rose 1 per cent to CDollars 1.4bn. Domestic capacity was trimmed by 11.5 per cent, raising the domestic yield by 9.6 per cent, while international traffic was higher. Total traffic was up 1.3 per cent and the yield per passenger mile improved slightly. Operating expenses were more closely controlled. PWA said the latest CDollars 85.7m restructuring charge included a provision for a CDollars 37.5m foreign exchange loss. All foreign debt is now being translated at current exchange rates. The balance covered debt rescheduling and moves to complete a CDollars 246m equity injection by American Airlines in Canadian. This deal is being held up by a court dispute over Canadian's joint interest with rival Air Canada in the Gemini reservation system. Canadian must dispose of this before the American Airlines deal can go through. Mr Rhys Eyton, chairman, said more than 70 per cent of senior creditors had signed the debt restructuring agreement and the rest should accept in the next few weeks. 'We're working towards a satisfactory resolution of the Gemini issue,' he said. The centrepiece of the restructuring is conversion of CDollars 700m of debt into equity. The whole plan is due to go before shareholders and debenture holders by mid-September. However, two companies have demanded immediate repayment of CDollars 109m of subordinated debt. In all, PWA wants to restructure more than CDollars 3bn of debt.</p>

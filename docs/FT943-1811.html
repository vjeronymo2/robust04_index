			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Powers for an effective Euro parliament Sir, In your excellent editorial, 'Agenda for Euro-reform' (September 20), you quite rightly questioned whether the 1996 intergovernmental (Maastricht revision) conference is the right occasion for an increase in the powers of the European parliament. The 1987 Single European Act increased the parliament's powers to amend Commission proposals - a power which on the whole has been sensibly used to improve a host of Single Market Directives. As you point out, it is too early to say whether the parliament will use its powers of veto under the Maastricht co-decision procedure equally sensibly. We and some other European MPs have long argued that before the parliament is given more power it must demonstrate that it is using its existing powers constructively. Too many colleagues seem to believe that the parliament should be in alliance with the Commission 'against' the Council of Ministers. It should not. Too many colleagues fail to put in an appearance at committees in Brussels or plenaries in Strasbourg. Absenteeism is an embarrassment. Too many colleagues (more than 50 per cent) are new to the parliament, so there is a lack of experience and continuity in the parliament's work. Only in the UK was it the will of the electorate which decided the changes. Elsewhere, it is the people who draw up party lists in smoke-filled rooms. The debate on Europe has so far been generalised. It is time for specifics. Here are two: The unelected Commission can adopt or reject the European parliament's amendments. This is a legislative power which it should not have. A second, however, is that the parliament could be more effective if granted the power to dismiss individual Commissioners who do not perform adequately. The present power to dismiss the whole Commission is like the nuclear deterrent  -never to be used.

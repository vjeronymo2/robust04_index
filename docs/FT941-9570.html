			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting boosts Euroc results Euroc, the Swedish building materials group, lifted profits after financial items to SKr235m (Dollars 29.1m) in 1993 from SKr145m a year earlier. The company said that it had managed the 62 per cent increase in spite of a downturn in its main markets, greater price competition, and costs linked to capacity reduction measures. Euroc said that it benefited from cost-cutting, higher productivity, increased exports, and a better performance in many African markets. However, the results were affected by a SKr120m charge linked to the company's efforts to cut capacity. The group had continued to be hit by the sharp downturn in construction activity in the Nordic region. The company said that deliveries of its products to Sweden and Finland fell by between 15 and 30 per cent. To strengthen its position, the group agreed to buy two cement companies from the Finnish groups Metra and Partek at the end of last year.</p>

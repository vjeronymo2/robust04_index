			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Winners of city renewal funds named: Pounds 2bn private-sector top-up sought MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, yesterday announced the 20 run-down urban areas which will share Pounds 750m of government City Challenge funding over five years from 1993. He said he expects the private sector to contribute more than Pounds 2bn in partnership projects in the areas, taking the total investment to nearly Pounds 3bn. The 20 'winners', chosen in a competition judged by ministers on the basis of bids put forward by all but three of the 57 urban programme authorities, complement the 15 which gained funding under the first round of City Challenge. A majority of the 57 urban programme areas now have funding under the scheme. But the losers are concerned because the Pounds 750m comes off existing regeneration budgets. Each winner gains Pounds 37.5m for a regeneration project in a particular depressed area, in partnership with the private and voluntary sectors. The 20 winning authorities are: Barnsley, Birmingham, Blackburn, Bolton, Brent, Derby, Hackney, Hartlepool, Kensington and Chelsea, Kirklees, Lambeth, Leicester, Newham, North Tyneside, Sandwell, Sefton, Stockton, Sunderland, Walsall and Wigan. In addition, Birmingham, Haringey, Plymouth and Stockton will gain 'task forces' - small groups of civil servants charged with 'bringing residents in their areas back into the economic mainstream.' Virtually all of the 20 City Challenge authorities are Labour controlled, and Mr Howard pointedly complimented them on their efforts. 'One of the successes of City Challenge is the change it has wrought to the attitude of councils controlled by Labour,' he said. Mr Howard described the City Challenge programme as a 'revolution in urban policy' which had 'transformed the way in which local authorities and their partners have approached the task of urban regeneration'. Privately, many Labour council leaders agree with him, recognising the benefits of forging new links with business and voluntary bodies in their areas. But Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, objected to the creaming of funds for City Challenge. He said funding for the urban programme had been cut by Pounds 14.3m in the current financial year, and the programme was now Pounds 121m less than it was in 1985-6. 'For the price of commissioning the Trident submarine . . . all those bidding for City Challenge funds could have been granted the necessary financial support to transform the inner-city areas and urban blight,' he said.</p>

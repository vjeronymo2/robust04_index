			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / UK Company News: British Midland growth British Midland Airways, the UK's second largest scheduled airline, yesterday further extended its network of international partnerships by forging a ticket code-sharing agreement with Austrian Airlines, writes Paul Betts. Under the deal, the Austrian flag carrier will offer seats on British Midland services to Belfast, Dublin, Glasgow and Edinburgh, Teesside and Leeds Bradford via London's Heathrow airport. In turn, British Midland passengers will be able to make twice daily connections into Austrian's hub in Vienna. Code sharing allows two airlines to use their respective ticket codes on each other's flights. The British Midland-Austrian agreement will start on July 1 and travellers will be issued with connecting flight boarding passes and advance seat selection at their point of departure.</p>

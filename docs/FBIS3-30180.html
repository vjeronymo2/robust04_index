The former army general, who was sworn in earlier today for  another five-year term as prime minister, has also said he would  capitalize on his election victory by taking on a higher  international profile. Mr. Rabuka told a news conference in  Suva he believed the time had come for him to visit countries  other than those in the Asia-Pacific region. Noting that Fiji's  traditional authority, the Great Council of Chiefs, supported  the island's re-entry into the Commonwealth, Mr. Rabuka said  this was one issue he would look at in his portfolio as foreign  minister.    Fiji's membership of the Commonwealth lapsed in 1987 after  the first of two military coups led by Mr Rabuka, which  overthrew an Indian-dominated government. India is opposed to  Fiji returning to the Commonwealth because of its  racially-biased constitution which has ensured ethnic Indians  are a minority in Parliament, but Mr Rabuka said he would like  ethnic Indians to be included in a government within the next  five years. At the same time he renewed his commitment to  review Fiji's constitution by 1997.</p>

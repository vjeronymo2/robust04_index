			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Tales from the Earth: Priest who was brought to life after 3000 years - A new series on the stories uncovered by archaeology NATSEF AMUN was a priest in the great temple of Amun at Karnak, near Luxor in upper Egypt, in the reign of Ramesses XI (1113-1085 BC). He lived a pure priestly life, taking two baths a day and two at night, and shaving his head and body daily. He did not wear animal products of wool and leather, but had linen robes and papyrus shoes like espadrilles. He died, and was mummified, with his tongue sticking out. The mummy men worked quickly - we know because his eyes were still in his head - to remove the vital organs and dry his body before packing it with spices and wrapping him in more than 40 layers of cloth, both fine linen and dishrags. Then they gave him garlands of red berries and lotus flowers and put him in an anthropoid (body-shaped) double coffin and buried him. Three thousand years later he has come back to life with a full medical dossier, thanks to the Manchester Mummy Project. On display at the Manchester Museum until May 23, when he returns to his permanent home in Leeds Museum, Natsef Amun crossed the Pennines to see the Mancunian consultants, who specialise in describing mummies and their ailments. Prognoses are impossible, since these patients are centuries dead. Like all visits to a new doctor, the first questions about the patient were who he was and how he lived. The hieroglyphs on his coffin gave his name and occupation, as the worthies of the Leeds Literary and Philosophical Society discovered in 1828 when they translated the texts and made a first examination of him soon after he reached Leeds (via Trieste, Paris and the Egyptian Hall in Piccadilly). They wrote up their investigation in a 60-page Account of an Egyptian Mummy. As a priest of Amun, Natsef Amun's job was to be the scribe/accountant in charge of the corn offered to, and eaten by, the sacred cattle that were to be sacrifices for the god's daily feast. The priests ate the steak and other good food which the god naturally could not eat himself. The medical confirmed this comfortable, privileged life. A body scan revealed no degenerative diseases apart from arthritis in the neck and an early stage of hip osteoarthritis, which today would mark him as a candidate for a hip replacement. The scan also showed that his brain had been removed in the usual fashion during mummification. Then the organs were put in urns, called Canopic jars, or wrapped in small packages for replacing in the body cavities. Natsef Amun's surviving organs, including his kidneys, were lost in 1941 when the Leeds Museum was bombed. To look at him internally the doctors used an endoscope, a tube that reaches parts they could not reach. Top of the agenda was to determine why his tongue stuck out. Did he have throat cancer? Endoscopy suggested he did not. Had a bee stung him? Possibly. Or was it much worse - had he been strangled? Scientists could not rule that out. After 3,000 years it is hard to certify the precise cause of death. The endoscope also takes tissue samples. They probed the chest, hoping that the mummifiers had left some bits behind even though his organs had gone. As mummification is a process of drying the body by packing it with natron (a natural compound of sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate named after the Wadi Natrun north west of Cairo), today doctors can restore tissue samples by rehydrating them and fixing them so that they do not rot. Natsef Amun's samples gave his blood group and his DNA. That can tell the person's sex - if it is not clear otherwise - and family connections, and help to identify viral and bacterial diseases. Next, the Manchester team removed his eye and optical nerve - a medical triumph, as the eyes do not survive usually - and found hints of neuritis. His surviving teeth were in good condition. With little sugar in the diet, cavities were rare in ancient Egypt, but worn teeth were common as sand got into the flour when it was ground in stone mortars. But he did have gum disease, and his teeth were badly worn. There were interesting discoveries around the groin. Natsef Amun would have been circumcised on becoming a priest, but that could not be checked as his penis was broken and lost. But there were signs of incipient elephantiasis (swelling of the legs and scrotum) and atheroma, the blood vessel disease that can lead to cramps, strokes, heart attacks and gangrene. But as the Egyptian diet was low in cholesterol, it was not serious. He died in middle age, says 'Fingers' Fledge, the retired fingerprints expert of Greater Manchester police, and his hands showed that he had not been a manual worker. What did he look like? The scientific team used a scanner to build up a 3D computerised X-ray image and fed that into a numerically controlled milling machine, cutting a block of polystyrene. That gave his skull. Richard Neave, Manchester's master of facial reconstruction who has recreated Lindow Man, the body found in an Irish peat bog, Philip of Macedon and an unknown man killed in the Kings Cross Underground fire, got to work with modelling clay to show flesh thickness, and soon produced a well built man, in his mid-40s, with a shaven head, and his tongue in its proper place. At Manchester, bringing mummies back to life is a skill that goes back to 1908. The Manchester Mummy Project has now dealt with many mummies, and as the home of the International Mummy Data Base, the team helps researchers find out more about life in early Egypt and how diseases occur and recur. Support has come from the Wellcome Trust, the British Academy, Kodak, and Keymark, which makes the endoscopes. However, it costs about Pounds 100,000 to bring a mummy back to life, and the Mancunians are always looking for sponsors. 'The mummies have their own bank account,' says Dr Rosalie David, leader of the project and Egyptologist at the Manchester Museum, 'and we hold concerts for them.'</p>

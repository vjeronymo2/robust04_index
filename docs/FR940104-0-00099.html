This information shall be provided to REA as requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.361 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Type and term of loans. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The final maturity of loans for purposes under this subpart shall be determined by REA based on the expected life of needed capital improvements, expected cost recovery periods, the expected life of program benefits, the certainty of these benefits, and matching costs and benefits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) REA will normally consider final maturities for DSM loans of up to 5 years. Longer loan terms, not to exceed 10 years, for loans for these purposes will be considered if the borrower can satisfactorily demonstrate to the Administrator an acceptable basis for doing so and can demonstrate that the loan will be feasible and secure pursuant to &sect;&sect;1710.112 and 1710.113, respectively, for the longer period. As used in this paragraph, renewable energy resource equipment and facilities are not considered a DSM purpose. Maturities for such loans will be limited to the expected useful life of the equipment and facilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1710.362 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Loan approval. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The amount and scope of loans approved by REA under this subpart are subject to the discretion of REA. Applications will be evaluated on the merits of the proposals as outlined in the plans specified in this subpart.

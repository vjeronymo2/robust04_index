			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: L'Oreal and Nestle move closer after FFr8.8bn deal L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetics group, yesterday announced that it is to pay FFr8.8bn (Dollars 1.53bn) for four of its distribution companies that are controlled by Nestle and Mrs Liliane Bettencourt, daughter of L'Oreal's founder. The transactions, which will yield FFr4.8bn in cash to Nestle, appear to increase the likelihood that the Swiss foods group could win control of L'Oreal. In April, L'Oreal announced that Nestle and Mrs Bettencourt had agreed to its wish to take over the distribution companies, based in the US, Canada, Switzerland and Spain. In aggregate, Nestle's interest in these companies was slightly over 50 per cent. The rest was held by Gesparal, a holding company set up 20 years ago to enable the Swiss group to take a 25 per cent stake in L'Oreal. Mrs Bettencourt's 51 per cent stake in L'Oreal was put into Gesparal and Nestle was sold a 49 per cent stake in the new holding company. Under an agreement between the two Gesparal shareholders, each gave the other first refusal on their shares, leading to occasional speculation that Nestle would take over the cosmetics group. The agreement expired in March, but Nestle claimed that the contract provided for the right of first refusal for both sides to continue for many years. For its part, L'Oreal reiterated that Mrs Bettencourt had always indicated that she would 'retain majority control during her lifetime'. The distribution companies are to be sold to L'Oreal at a price based on the aggregate value of their sales in the year to April 30 1994, subject to the approval of an EGM due to be held in the autumn. Gesparal will take its compensation in the form of 3.27m new L'Oreal shares at FFr1,225, thus raising its stake in L'Oreal from 51.04 per cent to 53.65 per cent. Once the Gesparal transaction is completed, Nestle will be paid its share, FFr4.78bn, in cash. Mr Edouard de Boisgelin, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said the deal should have a positive impact on earnings and would strengthen L'Oreal's presence in international markets.</p>

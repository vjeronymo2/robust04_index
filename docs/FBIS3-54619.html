			<p>Language: <F P=105> Tamil </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By S.N.R. Pillai] </F>   [Text] The Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front  [EPRLF] has declared that it is not going to take part in the  Eastern Province local elections, which are against the will of  the people. At the same time, the party also has announced that  it will not support any group contesting the elections. The  EPRLF statement also calls for boycotting the elections, which  are primarily aimed at dividing the North and East and  prolonging the war.    It has also been pointed out that the attempts to hold  elections in the east in an atmosphere rife with human rights  violations and military intervention are meant as distraction  from the ethnic conflict, making the Eastern Province a  Sinhalese-dominated one, hoodwinking the world with a suggestion  of the existence of a democratic system there, and encouraging  the Army. Moreover, we believe that this election is the  outcome of a decision made with a militaristic view to  obliterate a national ethnic group rather than a political  decision of a democratic country.</p>

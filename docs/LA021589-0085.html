			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROMISE OR PERIL?;  </P> <P> MIXED RECORD RAISES DOUBT OVER PRIVATIZED LOW-INCOME HOUSING  </P> <P> When it comes to housing poor people, one city's vision of progress can be  another's nightmare.  </P> <P> As officials in Los Angeles promote a plan to put Jordan Downs, one of the  city's more rundown public housing projects, into private hands, officials in  Boston are trying to figure out how to repair damage done to a low-income  housing project in the many years it has been in the hands of private owners  there.  </P> <P> Without adequate heat or hot water, the site of a recent fire that injured two  children, Geneva Avenue Apartments was described recently by a Boston Housing  Court judge as "a warehouse for wretched human souls" and has been portrayed by  Boston newspapers as one of the city's worst examples of slum housing.  </P> <P> Almost 3,000 miles apart, the two projects illustrate the promise and perils of  privatization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Free Enterprise  </P> <P> An idea that came of age during the Reagan era, privatization assumes that free  enterprise can do a better job than government bureaucracy, even when it comes  to providing decent shelter at bargain basement prices. About half of the  nation's 4 million subsidized apartments are in private hands.  </P> <P> At Jordan Downs, Los Angeles officials argue that, given the right incentives,  a real estate developer can make the 700 apartments safer and sounder than the  city's Housing Authority has been able to do in its 34 years of ownership.  Officials concede that marketing a public housing project in a gang-infested  neighborhood in Watts won't be easy, but they say they can do it.  </P> <P> The privatization of low-income housing is not always a panacea, however, as  life at Boston's Geneva Avenue Apartments and some other privately run projects  illustrate. For over a year, Geneva Avenue tenants have been trying to persuade  the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to take the complex away  from its owner, a Southern California real estate investor, because of living  conditions at the 60-unit building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boston Difficulties  </P> <P> The owner, Allan Bird, has acknowledged that the project is in bad shape, but  he said he is making improvements. He said living conditions deteriorated  during a 2 1/2-year period in which he was trying to sell the apartments to  another investor. Bird contended that terms of the sale placed responsibility  for upkeep in the hands of the buyer, but that HUD ultimately declined to  approve the sale and now is holding him responsible for conditions.  </P> <P> With HUD insuring its mortgage, Geneva Avenue was supposed to offer investors  enough incentives, including tax credits, to make it worth their while to run a  comfortable apartment complex for poor people. The same basic package of  incentives has been used to lure private investors into the low-income housing  market around the country. The results have been mixed.  </P> <P> "The record of management of low-income projects by private owners goes from  fantastic to mediocre to terrible," said Sara Johnson, an expert with the  National Housing Trust in Washington.  </P> <P> One recent study revealed that about 43% of HUD-insured privately owned  low-income housing is in danger of mortgage default. "As a general rule, a  default is a sign of financial failure that carries over to poor upkeep and  maintenance," said Larry Yates, an official of the National Low Income Housing  Coalition.  </P> <P> When low-income housing passes into private hands, the responsibility for  making sure that landlords provide decent living conditions usually falls to  HUD, a chronically understaffed agency, where the best of intentions cannot  always get the job done.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foreclosure Attempt  </P> <P> A year ago, HUD's staff in Boston made an attempt to foreclose on the Geneva  Avenue Apartments. Instead of complying with the foreclosure request, HUD  officials in Washington arranged for the owner of the apartments to get a  $1-million rehabilitation loan.  </P> <P> The Geneva Avenue situation is not atypical of HUD's relationship with  privately owned projects that have fallen on hard times, said an official of a  national organization that lobbies for low-income housing. "HUD doesn't want to  wind up owning these projects. The financial burden would be enormous if HUD  took over all the distressed low-income housing currently in private hands. As  a result, the agency tends to go easy on the owners," said the official, who  asked not to be named.  </P> <P> When investors do take care of low-income property, they are often motivated by  the prospect of one day opening up their apartments to higher-income tenants.  For the owners of subsidized housing, that day comes when the five to 20-year  life span of HUD rent subsidies runs out.  </P> <P> The country's critical shortage of low-income housing could well get worse with  so many of these subsidies due to expire soon. According to Yates, 37% of  HUD-insured housing units are likely to move onto the open market and out of  reach of low-income tenants in the next few years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Task for Congress  </P> <P> The prospect raises a difficult problem for backers of privatization: How to  prevent private investors from taking housing off the low-income market without  destroying much of the financial appeal of the investments. Congress is  currently grappling with the issue.  </P> <P> "It's a major problem, and, frankly, I don't know what we're going to do about  it," said Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), who chairs the Senate's housing and  urban affairs subcommittee.  </P> <P> For low-income tenants who are lucky enough to be in stable, well-maintained  privately owned apartment complexes, life can be comfortable and secure, in  part because of rules that tend to be stricter than tenants of many public  housing projects are accustomed to.  </P> <P> "You've got to have careful tenant selection. You have to have the right to  reject tenants who have criminal records or bad credit records. And you have to  make tenants accountable for their apartments. You can't let a family of five  squeeze into a two-bedroom unit," said a Los Angeles real estate developer who  has built and operated several low-income projects.  </P> <P> But strict management by private owners sometimes means that tenants are  treated "arbitrarily and unfairly" and denied the hearings and procedures of  due process that public housing projects must provide, argues Jim Grow, a  lawyer for the National Housing Law Project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plans in L.A.  </P> <P> In Los Angeles, the plan for Jordan Downs would have a developer pay $10  million to $20 million to purchase the project and spend an additional $14  million to fix it up and boost security. The developer would hope to recoup the  investment through tax credits and rent subsidies.  </P> <P> Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, a former Los Angeles congresswoman who has been hired  by the Housing Authority to help arrange the Jordan Downs sale, said the  developer will be held strictly accountable for running the project and will  not be allowed to charge market-rate rents anytime soon.  </P> <P> "The developer will have to sign a covenant making him responsible for the  property. He won't be able to syndicate it (dividing ownership among a number  of investors) or hide behind a management company," Burke said. Moreover, she  said the deed would require that Jordan Downs "remain available to low-income  tenants for a period of time."  </P> <P> Asked how long, Burke replied, "That's something we're going to have to  discuss."  </P> <P> Considering the price and the proposed conditions, Burke admitted that Jordan  Downs may prove to be a hard sell.  </P> <P> "It's going to require quite a big commitment. I frankly don't know if there's  going to be a tremendous amount of interest in the project. We'll have to see."  </P></p>

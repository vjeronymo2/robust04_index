			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Russian </F> Federation State Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks,  and Finances, by political observer Vil Dorofeyev; place, date  not given: "Must We Live Without a Budget Until the Summer?" --  first paragraph is introduction]    [Text] Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Russian  Federation State Duma Committee for the Budget, Taxes, Banks,  and Finances, answers questions from political observer Vil  Dorofeyev.    [Dorofeyev] We are coming to the end of the first quarter of  1994. But as far as I know, a draft budget has not even been  examined at sessions of your State Duma committee.    [Zadornov] The country is "crawling" into the second quarter  without an approved budget. Six weeks have been set aside for  the review procedure in the Federal Assembly's lower chamber,  but you should add another two weeks to enable the Federation  Council and the president to carry out the same work. Which  means that, even in the most favorable conditions, a draft  budget cannot be approved before the end of May. But this is  the most optimistic scenario. As you know from press reports,  the draft budget is the object of much fierce fighting within  the Russian Government. The story of 1992-1993 is being  repeated, when a delay in submitting this extremely important  document for the country to parliament meant that it had to be  examined in double-quick time, which subsequently resulted in  major amendments to and disruption of all the work that was  required both to prepare and to implement the draft budget.    [Dorofeyev] This seems to be yet another negative tradition  in post-Soviet Russia. What is its primary cause?    [Zadornov] Ignorance on the part of the executive of the law  on the budget structure and the budget process in the Russian  Federation. Some may retort that last year's budget and this  year's were submitted to parliament behind schedule owing to  objective factors of our internal political life. But there is  nothing more pernicious than ignorance of the law in the name of  day-to-day expediency. Unfortunately, precedents such as these  become implanted in the mentality of state figures and are  transformed into negative habits.    [Dorofeyev] In other countries the budget is the basis of  everything. What about our country?    [Zadornov] The budget should also play the same role in  Russia. Since there are no more state plans, there is only an  economic forecast for the current year prepared by the  government. The budget is therefore a fundamental document which  determines the country's economic policy. In my view, the lack  of a draft budget at the proper time is in many ways indicative  of the fact that the present government also lacks a considered  and consistent policy.    [Dorofeyev] Let us assume that you are not familiar with the  main points of the future budget. But in your view, what should  the fundamental principle of this document be?    [Zadornov] First of all I would like to get an answer to a  question that is fundamental in my view: What is the  government's current policy? I would like the draft budget to  shed light on the overall approach to economic policy and I  would certainly like it to envision groundwork for the future.  For example, priorities in the structural restructuring of  industry and priority social programs. In order to make it  clear which sectors or groups of enterprises are known to be  unprofitable and likely to go bankrupt. As a result of this, we  can realistically anticipate how much unemployment to expect and  how much money the government will need to spend in order to  alleviate the negative consequences of these processes.    Second, I would like the present budget to be realistic.  Just look at the budget transformations we witnessed in 1992  and 1993. Initially a very tough budget was approved. At the  same time it was stated that inflation would be between 3 and 5  percent by the end of the year. But already by the following  month, and two months later at the most, the government itself  started to ignore the budget it had approved. And then we had a  chain reaction on our hands.    What disturbs me most in the draft of the present budget?  The promise that yet again we will witness 3-5 percent  inflation by the end of the year. I would prefer to see a  slightly larger budget deficit in the draft, provided there are  specific indications that it is required to implement social  programs.    [Dorofeyev] Does it not seem to you that the budget deficit  is a bit of a bugbear? America lives with a budget deficit.    [Zadornov] Not just the United States. Last year the  British budget deficit amounted to almost 9 percent of GDP. The  Italian and French deficits are at least 5 percent of GDP.  Although countries which have expressed a desire to join the  European Currency Union have been presented with the condition  that they must limit the size of their current budget deficit.  With the exception of two or three states, no country in West  Europe can be said to belong in this category. Because a budget  deficit is a big problem for any state and it cannot be resolved  in a year.    [Dorofeyev] On 3 March we were shown a government session on  television. A number of fat volumes were lying on the premier's  table. The newsreader announced that the draft budget had  basically been approved by the government. And then the press  flashed reports that the Ministry of Defense, the agrarian  lobby, and many others were unhappy with the agreed budget.    [Zadornov] You know, in any country the budget is a document  that cannot please everyone. Because there will always be  differences of opinion between the budget planners and the  demands, submissions, and proposals of ministries, departments,  and social groups. The latter group always asks for more  whereas the former allocates less. But the fact that the draft  budget had basically been approved by the government 3 March  demonstrates something quite different: Nobody in the  government was able to suggest any serious, comprehensive  alternatives to the agreed version of the budget. Even though  the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense, in  particular the State Committee for the Defense Sectors of  Industry, have major differences of opinion about this draft of  the budget.    But I am interested in the position of the government  chairman as the conductor of economic policy as a whole. The  financial element is undoubtedly important, and the size of the  planned budget deficit and the inflation rate are equally  important indicators which act as guidelines. But they should  be factored into the very economic policy which provides answers  to the questions: What will the country live on for the  specific year in question? On export sectors? Which ones  exactly? How will income be distributed? How big will the Army  be and how will Army cutbacks be implemented? How will we begin  to implement the mine closure program, for example, which the  government has planned to carry out before the year 2000?    You must understand that I am using a few examples to  demonstrate that this document should contain answers to issues  relating to the development of the economy as a whole and the  development of its most important sectors, while at the same  time it should enshrine mechanisms for redistributing financial  and labor resources. In other words, the budget should not be  approached from rigid positions.    [Dorofeyev] If you had to work on the draft, what guiding  principles would you use to agree on an acceptable budget for  the country?    [Zadornov] In the current year, unfortunately, there is  little that can be changed. But if I were to take part in  preparing next year's budget, I would put the accent on cutting  expenditures, which is an important objective in itself, and on  relieving tax pressure. It is already clear that we have  already completely exhausted the policy which has been pursued  over the past two years, that of increasing the tax scale and  beefing up the ruthless penalties for late payment of taxes. We  must therefore avoid any abrupt changes in course and switch  gradually and carefully to a policy of reducing the tax burden.  I would reduce the tax on profit, for example, if profits were  to be used for investment purposes.    A second aspect of this problem is the fact that some  enterprises, particularly those engaged in foreign economic  activity, have avoided paying taxes. It is unlikely that  administrative or fiscal measures will achieve anything in this  instance. We apparently require some sort of social contract  between the State Taxation Service, the Ministry of Finance, and  the tax police -- basically, between government as a whole and  business. I think that directors of major enterprises and  businessmen have a very good idea about the tax threshold which  would be acceptable to them in the present circumstances. If we  agree to this threshold, or even to a figure slightly above it,  then I believe that by cutting taxes we would gain rather than  lose because the total volume of revenue would increase.    Finally, the problem of the regions. Some of them have  special tax arrangements whereby they do not consider it  incumbent upon them to pay federal taxes. The whole tax-break  system is far from sound. Tax breaks as a whole represent  colossal sums. Someone has to make the political decision to  make all components of the Federation equal in terms of budget  and taxation arrangements. All should pay taxes into the  federal budget and pay them on equal terms.    [Dorofeyev] Let us come back to the "94 budget." This  budget stipulates, for example, that only 0.3 percent of GDP has  been earmarked for cultural needs, and a slightly larger sum is  to be spent on science. Is this right?    [Zadornov] No. But this is a problem of priorities. I  believe that culture, science, and education form one of these  priorities. This is the foundation of the country's future.  Our "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] bloc would also add  children's health care to the list. Here too, we believe, these  priorities should not be dependent on overall shortfalls in  revenue; they should be protected by specific statute.    [Dorofeyev] But who will determine the priority approach and  how?    [Zadornov] This is a question of state policy. It is the  state's business to formulate clear and lucid criteria and a  procedure which enables these criteria to be discussed in  society and the appropriate state organs. Incidentally, in  discussing the draft budget our committee intends to listen to  and take account of the opinion of all committees and  commissions. We do not have much time, but we will hold fairly  wide-ranging parliamentary hearings into this problem.</p>

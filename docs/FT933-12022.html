			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Increase in human 'mad cow disease' REPORTED outbreaks of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, the human form of 'mad cow disease', have risen by 50 per cent in two years, government figures released yesterday show. The number of reported cases rose from 32 in April 1991 to 37 in April last year, and to 48 in April this year. Doctors think the rise was not 'statistically significant' and put it down to increased reporting of cases.</p>

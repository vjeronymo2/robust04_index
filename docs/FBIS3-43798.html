Apart from the issues he discussed, the president announced the  resignation of the present government headed by Faustin Birindwa  and mentioned the names of Professor Mulumba Lukoyi and Etienne  Tshisekedi as candidates for the post of prime minister as  proposed by their respective political groups.    However, the list is not limited, stated Kipolongo  Mukambilwa  yesterday evening. In fact, a third candidate, (Kabangu Musa),  has just been announced by his party, the National Union for  Progress [Union Nationale pour le Progres], Unapro. It claims  to be a party from the new political class supporting neither of  the two main rival political groups -- presidential camp or the  Sacred Union of the opposition. Unapro nominated its candidate  at the end of its extraordinary session held today to examine  all the consequences of the address by President Mobutu  yesterday. The meeting was chaired by Jose Konga Bakombo,  national chairman of the party.</p>

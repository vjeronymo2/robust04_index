			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Shifting up the economic gears: America The US economy is not booming, but it is in much better shape than is generally appreciated. The near-stalling of growth in the first quarter was an aberration, reflecting a confluence of special factors including a plunge in defence outlays, an east coast blizzard and temporary retrenchment by consumers after a spending spree at the end of 1992. Figures for gross domestic product this week are likely to confirm that the economy expanded at an annual rate of close to 3 per cent in the second quarter. It may do better still in the second half, assuming congressional negotiators quickly reach agreement on a deficit-cutting economic plan, thus putting an end to debilitating uncertainty about future tax rates. One reason for optimism is the marked improvement in the financial health of banks, businesses and families following the decline in short- and long-term interest rates to the lowest levels in two decades. According to federal regulators, more than two-thirds of US banks are now 'well-capitalised', double the proportion at the end of 1991; only one in 10 is now reckoned to be short of capital. Bank share prices have soared and the sector is earning near-record profits. Companies and individuals have retired or refinanced large quantities of debt, reducing debt service burdens to the relatively manageable levels of the mid-1980s. By the standards of previous decades, balance sheets are still quite strained, but the economy seems to be wriggling free from the financial vice that stymied growth during most of the Bush presidency. The inability of Congress and the White House to provide the customary post-recession fiscal stimulus, meanwhile, is proving a blessing in disguise. Most postwar US recoveries have been led by consumer and government spending. This time the corporate sector is making the running. Capital investment is surging following an increase in corporate profits of about 35 per cent since the recession and the most encouraging productivity trends in more than a decade. Business equipment investment grew at an annual rate of 18 per cent in real terms in the first quarter, after an increase of more than 12 per cent during 1992; another healthy gain seems likely in the second quarter. The sharp fall in computer prices makes the figures slightly suspect: it is hard to believe that the volume of expenditure on computers and related equipment has really doubled since early 1991. But there can be no doubt that corporate America is moving swiftly to reap efficiency gains from advances in information-processing technologies. Other types of capital investment are also strong; even commercial real estate markets are showing signs of stabilising. And although the conventional measures of consumer confidence are still falling, consumers have returned to the shopping malls. Retail sales grew at an annual rate of about 5 per cent in real terms in the second quarter. The most encouraging sign was a surge in spending on large discretionary items, such as cars and furniture. Vehicle sales have recently been running at an annual rate of about 14.5m units, the highest rate since before the recession. There are, of course, still plenty of negative forces at work. Under Mr Clinton the contraction of defence industries is accelerating, with serious adverse consequences for many sectors and regions. Ironically, if the administration succeeds in pushing through radical healthcare reform, it may inflict a blow of similar magnitude to the service sector. Healthcare is one of the few parts of the economy where employment has grown steadily in recent years. The weakness of the international economy is an added headache: although exports remain remarkably resilient, they are no longer capable of providing extra lift as in the late 1980s. And while Mr Clinton's election victory was initially greeted with euphoria, the transfer of executive power from Republicans to Democrats has involved added economic uncertainty. Companies accustomed to the Republicans' broadly free-market approach are having to adjust to a different climate in Washington. They know income and corporate taxes are going up, but not when or by how much. They are also deeply concerned that payroll taxes will rise substantially to finance healthcare reform and, perhaps, new training requirements. All this has hindered job creation. Employment has only just regained its pre-recession peak, and a quarter of the 2m new jobs created in the past two years are temporary positions - an unheard of proportion during a recovery phase. On balance, however, the pluses greatly outweigh the minuses. As Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, stressed in congressional testimony last week, the global pace of economic change is accelerating. Capital equipment is becoming redundant faster than ever before; in some markets, products that were at the cutting edge of technology five years ago are now unsaleable. In a fast-changing world, America's entrepreneurial spirit and flexible labour markets constitute a powerful comparative advantage. Mr Greenspan used words such as 'vibrant' and 'dynamic' to describe the type of economy that seems to be emerging from the restructuring chrysalis of the early 1990s. If he was exaggerating, it was only by a whisker.</p>

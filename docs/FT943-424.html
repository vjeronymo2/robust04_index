			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / More skeletons in the closet: As the extent of its troubles are revealed, David Buchan and Andrew Jack examine the malaise at Credit Lyonnais For the second time in six months, Credit Lyonnais, the embattled French banking group, has been forced to call in its owner, the French state, for help. This week, it set aside further heavy provisions against bad debts, reporting a first half net loss of FFr4.5bn (Pounds 540m), proportionately worse than the 1993 annual loss of FFr6.9bn. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais chairman, conceded that the millstone of the late 1980s and early 1990s - when the bank had made an uncontrolled plunge into bad property lending, speculative film finance, and high-risk and low-yielding investments in other state companies - was too heavy for the bank to support alone. Unless buoyed up again by the state, the ship of Credit Lyonnais would almost certainly sink below the plimsoll line of the internationally agreed solvency ratio of 8 per cent, and would almost equally certainly have great difficulty in rising into profit in the near future. The new rescue, like the one in March, is likely to be in the form of a further capital injection and extra loan guarantees by the state. Even with this summer's FFr4.9bn capital increase by the government and other state-owned shareholders, the first-half loss has depressed the bank's solvency ratio of shareholder funds to loan commitments to 8.1 per cent, dangerously near the minimum. The state has now agreed that it would recapitalise the bank if the latter incurred any further loss in the second half of this year, Mr Peyrelevade said. The chairman said the government had also agreed that, if this year's overall loss threatened to exceed last year's FFr6.9bn level, the state would step in to take further bad loans and risks off the bank's balance sheet. In March some FFr40bn in doubtful property loans were put in a special state-backed company, whose potential losses are underwritten by the state to the tune of FFr14bn. So the French government is already lumbered with a rescue package whose potential cost nearly equals that of the FFr25bn by which it is hoping to cut the 1995 budget deficit for the entire country. In addition, some analysts are still sceptical that Mr Peyrelevade has announced anything like the provisions he will have to make to cover the legacy of the past. 'We feel that the process of going through the books by the management is not yet rigorous enough, and the full provisions are not yet reflected in these results,' Ms Susan Sternglass of Goldman Sachs said yesterday. With last week's reports suggesting the bank may need to make further provisions of up to FFr25bn, the government may yet be called on to make up much of the additional shortfall. Cynics would say that Mr Peyrelevade has played a game of high-stakes poker with his shareholder, and won handsomely. Certainly, it looked like poker. Three days before Credit Lyonnais was initially scheduled to report its first-half results, Mr Peyrelevade went to see the French Treasury which was expecting a pro forma meeting with the bank chairman. But he apparently surprised and dismayed the Treasury officials by telling them he could not finalise the bank's accounts, because the need to make vastly higher provisions had just emerged. The new auditors would only certify the accounts if the state promised new help, he added. After a week of bargaining, the government gave in, and promised the help. Cynics, again, would say that Mr Peyrelevade was exploiting the fact that the French government could not possibly let the country's biggest bank go under, with a balance sheet of nearly FFr2,000bn, equivalent to a quarter of its gross domestic product. Precisely the same concerns of systemic risk weigh, too, with those in the European Commission charged with the general task of vetting state aid. They are aware that a crash by Europe's biggest banking network would reverberate throughout the EU. A few French private banks moaned about state aid last March to Credit Lyonnais, but they have kept quiet since, aware of how the group's problems have helped drag down their share prices. In contrast to the airline sector, where there is always British Airways to cry foul at aid to Air France, Credit Lyonnais's banking competitors have stayed silent. But Mr Peyrelevade has his price to pay, too, in personal pride and group assets. This week he conceded 'a double error' of judgment when he took over the banking group last November after the disastrous mismanagement of his predecessor, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer. He said he had been wrong in thinking that 'the latent risks (arising from the Haberer-era activities) could be absorbed by Credit Lyonnais's current (banking) profits. But these profits in 1994 look like being FFr2bn less than we estimated'. The other error was to think that provisions against these risks could be 'staggered', a hope that Mr Peyrelevade said the bank's new auditors had disabused him of. Mr Peyrelevade also talked this week for the first time of selling off parts, admittedly peripheral parts, of his group's core banking empire in addition to the sales of its industrial holdings already in train. In the first seven months of this year, Credit Lyonnais has shed FFr6.8bn in non-bank assets. Mr Peyrelevade's target of selling FFr20bn of Credit Lyonnais's FFr50bn industrial holdings now looks like a minimum. The smooth withdrawal of such a big investor from the French market will not be easy, with France still lacking capitalised pension funds to take up the slack. But the Credit Lyonnais affair highlights other structural failings in French banking groups, and in their regulation by the state. Defending himself against the accusation that, for tactical reasons, he deliberately kept the government in the dark until the last moment about the bank's persistent problems, Mr Peyrelevade said: 'We told them (the government) everything we knew, when we knew it.' He had taken the long-overdue step early this year of instituting a centralised risk-control committee for the Credit Lyonnais group to ensure better future control. But he is still finding it difficult to keep track of all the past skeletons falling out of the cupboards. There are some specific reasons for this. One is Altus, a high-risk investment house which is part of the group. Mr Jean-Francois Henin, who ran Altus from 1990-93, prided himself on the fact that he had multiplied its balance sheet many times over without increasing its staff. The result was a chaotic back office, out of which dubious dossiers are still tumbling. Credit Lyonnais said this week it was busily engaged in getting out of as many of Altus's contracts as possible. Another factor is its Societe de Banque Occidentale subsidiary's continuing problems with recouping loans made to Mr Bernard Tapie, the deeply indebted businessman-politician. But perhaps the biggest reason for the accelerating clean-out of Credit Lyonnais is the way in which the bank's branch managers and its new auditors were responding to what Mr Peyrelevade termed 'the new climate'. They were bringing to the surface all the bad loans and dud investments of the past. Certainly, the push for more rigorous control appears to be coming from them rather than from external regulators such as the Bank of France and its Banking Commission, which were criticised by this summer's parliamentary inquiry for being slow in diagnosing and acting on Credit Lyonnais's problems. Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the Bank of France governor, told MPs in May that he had not wanted to present the problem publicly before announcing a solution. He said that the authorities had felt it important 'not to announce the fire before revealing the fire extinguisher'. Mr Trichet said he smelt smoke in September 1992 when he was director of the Treasury. But it was almost a year later before the Bank of France, as the organisation formally responsible for banking supervision, wrote to the government demanding that it rescue its bank. As for the Banking Commission, it said it had started getting suspicious in 1991 after seeing Credit Lyonnais's balance sheet increase by 30 per cent over the previous two years, with a 200 per cent rise in industrial holdings. However, the Credit Lyonnais affair raises doubt about the capacity of the commission's 350 staff to keep track of hydra-headed institutions such as Credit Lyonnais with 550 subsidiaries. The commission put 10 people on to Credit Lyonnais, starting with its subsidiaries. But they seem to have hit an information problem with CLBN, the bank's Rotterdam subsidiary which, among other ventures, bankrolled the ambitions of some dubious Italian financiers to buy MGM in Hollywood. Such is the legacy of these ventures that they still accounted for a tenth of the new FFr10.1bn provisions announced this week. Credit Lyonnais has now retained the expensive services of Mr Henry Kissinger to help it find a buyer for MGM. Neither French nor Dutch regulators will elaborate on their exchanges about CLBN, except that the Dutch central bank sought in 1989, and eventually got, extra guarantees from Credit Lyonnais in Paris on CLBN loans, while the French banking commission did try to get some information from its Dutch counterparts. Mr Jean-Louis Butsch, head of the Banking Commission, implied to the parliamentary in-quiry that this was not very satisfactory. It was, he noted, only at the start of 1993, when the European Union's Second Banking Directive came into force, that 'professional secrecy vis-a-vis our EU counterparts was lifted'. Another effect of that directive has been to transfer prudential supervision of a bank's branches to its country of origin. But that would not have helped at CLBN which, as a separately incorporated subsidiary, stays under Dutch control. Mr Butsch's team has moved from one troubled subsidiary to another since November 1991, finally advancing on Credit Lyonnais's headquarters on the Boulevard des Italiens a year later for a six-month investigation. Even then, however, the 1992-93 deterioration in the economy required the team to make return visits to subsidiaries. In general terms, the Banking Commission still sees no need to change its regulatory procedures. But commercial banking sources said yesterday it might have to respond to the example set by Credit Lyonnais's new auditors, by publishing tougher and clearer general guidelines on provisions for other French banks and their auditors to follow. Out of Credit Lyonnais's problems may yet come another useful precedent for other banks to follow. With first-half operating results down by 25 per cent from the same period of 1993, the group appears to have a significant problem in raising profitability on its core banking business. It shares with other French banks working conditions still largely governed by legislation dating from the 1930s. These treat bank employees like civil servants, more or less guaranteeing them progressive promotion and firmly setting their working hours. The managements of the main banks tried to change this in 1989, but their common front against the banking unions crumbled when Mr Haberer's Credit Lyonnais broke ranks. 'Peyrelevade now has the chance to use the shock of Credit Lyonnais's problems to change our over-staffing and old-fashioned working rules, and to provide better services,' said a commercial banker yesterday. In Mr Peyrelevade's quest to reduce operating expenses, most of the headlines have gone to the 1,000 job cuts he is making this year in the group's French network. But he has also negotiated a small experiment with his unions to let Credit Lyonnais branches in Toulouse stay open in the evenings and on Saturday mornings. With so much else about Credit Lyonnais that is execrable, this is one area where it may prove exemplary.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CREDIT LYONNAIS: HIGH RISK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Credit Lyonnais' major assets sales so far in 1994 By value (FFr bn) and percentage of stake sold  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     (FFr)           (%)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FNAC (books and record chain)       2.00bn         65.0 UAF (life insurance)                1.16bn         16.0 Essilor (specialist glass)          -               2.7 TFI (television station)            -               6.0 Pinault-Printemps (retailing)       -               4.0 Meridien hotels                     190m approx     9.4  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total asset sales                   6.8bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PROVISIONS BY PROFIT CENTRES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- (Ffr bn)                 First half    Second half    First half                                1993           1993          1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Domestic banking                2.0            2.9           2.6 International banking           2.5            3.9           2.7 Others                          0.0            0.1             0 Country risk                   -0.9           -1.0          -0.6 Dutch subsidiary CLBN           0.8            3.0           1.1 Banking subsidiaries            1.4            2.1           3.4 Investment portfolio            1.2           -0.2           0.9  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Total                           7.0           10.8          10.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

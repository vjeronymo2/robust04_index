			<p><P> March 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CELLIST ABDUCTED FROM CAMPUS  </P> <P> A 23-year-old UCLA student who plays cello in the El Camino College Symphony  was abducted Sunday from the Gardena campus where she had gone for a rehearsal,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Lynne Marie Carlucci of Torrance was forced into her car in a parking lot on  the campus at 16007 Crenshaw Blvd. and driven away by two men who appeared to  be in their 20s, witnesses said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators said she is 5-feet-3, 120 pounds,  with shoulder-length blond hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a  knee-length blue dress, deputies said. Her car is a faded red 1985 Nissan  Sentra two-door with California license plate number 1LRC307, said Deputy  Rafael Estrada.  </P> <P> Her father, Don Carlucci, said she was to play the cello with the El Camino  Symphony at 3 p.m. and then celebrate her 23rd birthday, which fell on Tuesday,  with her family.  </P> <P> Her father said she had just finished her junior year as an environmental  geography student at UCLA and that she lives with a sister and a roommate. He  described her as "on the quiet side, very intelligent and very likable and  friendly."  </P> <P> "It has been eight hours since she was abducted, you would think they would  have located the car," a worried Carlucci added.  </P> <P> One of the kidnapers was wearing a blue jacket, deputies said. Both abductors  were described as being about 140 to 150 pounds.  </P></p>

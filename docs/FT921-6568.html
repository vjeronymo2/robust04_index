			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BMW link with Rolls-Royce BMW, the German executive and luxury car maker, is to supply airbag systems to Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, in its first formal link with the UK luxury car maker, writes Kevin Done. The company said it was also discussing co-operation in the development and supply of other component systems, such as electric seat mechanisms and electronic automatic gearbox controls. BMW insisted, however, that no negotiations had taken place 'up to now' for it to take either a minority or majority stake in Rolls-Royce Motor Cars. The UK luxury car maker, a subsidiary of Vickers, suffered a loss of about Pounds 60m last year under the impact of a 48 per cent drop in sales.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (11): Out of the backroom, into the boardroom - Executive Information Systems / If the computer is really such a wonderful tool for business, asks Claire Gooding, why has it been kept behind the scenes for so long? UNTIL recent years, relatively few top executives had the incentive to have a computer terminal or PC on their desks. Those who did were in an enlightened minority, despite the vigorous efforts of the suppliers of software packages known as executive information systems (EIS). The first generation of EIS products grew out of more general decision support software for forecasting and modelling. The main problem they tackled was that of having too much information, not too little. Computer systems tended to deliver fat, inflexible reports, through which few executives were prepared to plough to find the relevant facts. The EIS promised a slick, flexible alternative, a way of looking at facts on the screen and drawing information from all the existing data systems in a company's computers. The graphical representations of data were flexible, allowing 'drill down '  -the refining of information down to its source facts - and other manipulations. There were two 'extras' which distinguished the EIS from its humbler counterpart, the management information system (MIS). One was the ease of use: it was presumed that no top executive would ever have the time to master a keyboard. The other was its links with various systems, not only the internal accounting and production systems but external links, to databases and online information services. In its 'unique selling propositions,' the EIS trod a path that the rest of the computer industry was to follow. Comshare, the market leader, and other suppliers including Holos, Acuity and Pilot could offer speedy development and flexible reactions to changes, presented in a graphical form, even when the basic data came from the mainframe. At the heart of the EIS was its flexibility - the ability to turn data inside out, manipulate it, look at different views of it, and perform 'what if' exercises. The rest of the computer industry has now caught up with what made the EIS so special a few years ago. Rapid applications development and graphical user interfaces have gone along way towards making applications more flexible and easier to use. But EIS also foreshadowed another development: business process re-engineering. When implementing an EIS, consultants soon discovered that the real effort went into defining a company's real needs. Even managers who believed in the benefits of an EIS found it difficult to answer the basic question 'what do you want from a system?' To enable an executive to grasp the essentials swiftly, somebody somewhere has to do a lot of groundwork. The exercise of deciding who needs what information, why, from whom, when, and how often, throw into relief the relationships, and particularly the redundant processes in a company. It can even re-focus an organisation to look at its basic purpose and profitability. Better information systems often mean human redundancies: ICI Fibres, for example, reduced its head office staff from hundreds to a handful. Managing director Scott Davidson keeps in touch with the dozen or so staff now based in Brussels via his laptop computer. The ICI Fibres Business Information System is a model of how an EIS can evolve. Consultants Executive Information Systems have nursed the system through various incarnations, working closely with managers from ICI Fibres and ICI Acrylics. The system was initially written in PC Express, and later refined using a mixture of Lightship and Lotus 123. Once everyone was satisfied with the prototype, the final system took shape in the Focus 4GL from Information Builders. The EIS suppliers have shifted their ground a little in recent times, perhaps aware that their territory is being encroached by less specialist software. In practice, few executives use external links regularly, and the main value of EIS has been that corporate users 'all sing from the same hymn sheet'. Predictably, the data fed into EIS models is internal, such as sales and accounts information. EIS has proved to be not a periscope, looking at the outside world, but a microscope, illuminating internal data. So, argue the EIS suppliers, the acronym should now stand for 'Enterprise Information Systems.' The benefits of a system in which everyone shares should be felt outside the boardroom. Remote computing, also known as 'teleworking' seems to have brought a new element into the pattern, giving access to the mainframe, and to colleagues. VAG, the UK importer of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles and parts, is one company that has used an EIS as an 'enterprise' rather than an 'executive' system. Part of the Volkswagen Group in Germany, VAG is a marketing and distribution organisation based in Miltion Keynes. It retails through 300 or so franchised dealer outlets employing nearly 10,0000 people, and accounting for turnover exceeding Pounds 1bn in the UK. A re-examination of productivity and resources in 1991 convinced VAG that it simply did not have the right information available to enable it to sell its cars in the fiercely competitive 1990s. At the time the company was organised in traditional divisions: sales and marketing, parts and services, each with its own field force. Steve Underwood, then a manager of information systems, described the problem: 'In essence the divisions were companies in their own right. There was very litte interaction between the people selling vehicles and people selling parts and service.' The re-organisation focused on getting closer to dealers. Twenty district managers were to take responsibility for every area of operation in their local 'patch,' working from home. 'Suddenly the district manager had to be a generalist, with a tremendous amount of knowledge about all parts of the business,' says Steve Underwood. He was responsible for setting up a technical solution, an EIS that would collect all the available information from existing parts, vehicle, and finance systems on the mainframe, and deliver the information to the district manager in a useable format. As with most EIS solutions, this meant a new layer of technology, drawing on what was alreadu in place. Pilot Software's LightShip was chosen as the front-end, to give users easy access via 'point and click' windows but also because of its extensive links with databases and other software products. The managers use IBM L40 laptops with modems, connected to an OS/2 computer. This extracts data from the DB/2 mainframe database via an SQL server, using LightShip's high-speed Lens 'middleware' to search and deliver information at high speed. Robert Couldwell, a VAG district manager based in south London, readily points out the benefits of the system, although he was new to computers and home-working back in 1991. 'To motivate dealers to achieve sales targets you need information. That used to rely on lots of telephoning and hard-copy reports delivered by post,' he says. 'Now I keep in touch with market share, parts performance, and can check up on the latest figures when I get home at night.' He stays in touch with the office and colleagues through electronic mail, and when negotiating sales targets with dealers, the laptop goes with him. 'From the dealer's point of view, the laptop doesn't lie. It's fact, not conjecture, if you can show the development of market share over the last three years by each model. That's powerful.' VAG is among the companies who have made their historical information work for them, but this is still the exception rather than the rule. When West London Training Enterprise Council surveyed 719 companies in its area, ranging from the smallest to the largest, the most common applications were still the back-room functions of accounting and office automation. Its most disturbing finding was that business managers are top of the league table in the matter of IT skills deficiency. EIS suppliers, it seems, still have to convince the world at large that the computer belongs in the boardroom. VAG's experience suggests that it might be more useful on the road, or at home.</p>

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Rio slums crackdown Brazil's armed forces sealed off seven of Rio de Janeiro's shanty towns over the weekend in a move one military commander described as 'psychological intimidation' of the city's drug traffickers, Angus Foster writes from Sao Paulo. The exercises, which involved more than 1,000 troops and police, were the biggest since the federal government last month gave the military control over rounding up Rio's drug kings. The city's police force, widely corrupted by drug money, had lost control of Rio's several hundred shanty towns to the traffickers. The armed forces' movements encountered almost no resistance and were largely welcomed by residents. The government decided to use troops partly because of a massacre of 13 shanty town residents by police last month.</p>

			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dawson surprises with 15% rise but cautious on upturn DAWSON INTERNATIONAL, the Edinburgh-based textile and clothing group, yesterday announced results which were slightly better than expected and said order books were higher than a year ago. But the company, which had seen profits decline every year since 1988, remained cautious about an economic upturn in its main UK and US markets. Dawson reported a 15 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 30.1m in the year to March 28. The increase was helped by Pounds 1.1m of currency gains on the dollar, a Pounds 700,000 exceptional profit on an insurance claim and a lower interest charge. Turnover increased 6.6 per cent to Pounds 415m (Pounds 389.3m), helped by Pounds 12.7m of currency gains. At the interim stage Dawson reported a 6 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 16.2m on turnover of Pounds 217m (Pounds 214m). Mr Miller said the second half improvement was helped by a recovery in cashmere fibre and yarn sales and stabilised cashmere prices. In the US, a mild winter affected sales of JE Morgan's thermal underwear and volumes declined 6 per cent although the company said market share improved. Interest charges fell to Pounds 5.54m (Pounds 6.85m) due to reduced working capital, cash generation of Pounds 27.9m and falling US interest rates. Capital expenditure fell from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 9.43m while depreciation increased to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.2m). Net borrowings at the end of the period were halved at Pounds 23.9m, against Pounds 51.7m, giving gearing of 13.4 per cent, compared with 29.6 per cent. Earnings per share advanced 7.5 per cent to 11.4p (10.6p). The company is recommending an unchanged final dividend of 7.1p to make a maintained total of 9p. COMMENT After three years of decline, can Dawson's long-suffering shareholders finally look forward to some growth? Judging by yesterday's 5p rise in the share price to 219p, against a falling market, the answer is yes. Analysts were not only surprised by the profits, admittedly against last year's depressed results, but also by the sharp fall in gearing, suggesting costs and working capital are well set for recovery. But profit forecasts for this year of Pounds 33m put the shares on more than 17 times. Although acceptable, the rating suggests the market is already factoring in rises in consumer confidence and confirmed autumn orders which, as the company warned, are by no means in the bag.</p>

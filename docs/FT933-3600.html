			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Observer: Grub Street Observer is surprised to learn that the starting salary for a cook at the New York Times' staff cafeteria, at Dollars 697 a week, is rather more than that for a journalist at the FT's competitor, the Wall Street Journal. This intriguing disparity has been uncovered by the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, the union which represents 2,000 employees at Dow Jones, publishers of the Wall Street Journal. The IAPE is negotiating a new three-year pay contract with Dow Jones management. It suggests the disparity between the cooks' and the reporters' salaries supports its proposal to the company's shareholders that any increase in the chief executive's remuneration package should be no more than that received by employees.</p>

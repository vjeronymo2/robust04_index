Owing to the stoppage of production, two  unclaimed 50-tonne tank cars filled with chlorine have been  standing for about a month on the branch line leading to the  plant. Although the tank cars are being kept under guard, a  tragedy could occur at any moment. Another 50 tonnes of  chlorine have been poured into a container on the plant site.  Owing to the critical situation, all the inhabitants of the  settlement have been issued with gas masks.</p>

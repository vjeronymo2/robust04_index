			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Keller for market valued at Pounds 60m Keller, the former engineering subsidiary of GKN, is planning to come to the market next year in a flotation valuing the company at Pounds 60m. The specialist underground foundations business, acquired from GKN three years ago in a Pounds 26m management buy-out, aims to use the flotation to finance overseas expansion. Projects in North America and continental Europe already account for more than 80 per cent of Keller's profits and the group wants to increase its share of the international construction market, particularly in Germany. Kleinwort Benson, which is handling the flotation, expects a market launch in the spring, although the size of the share issue has not been decided. Mr Jim Hamilton, head of corporate finance at Kleinwort Benson, said yesterday that fresh finance would enable Keller to exploit construction opportunities in east Germany, where large-scale infrastructure modernisation is under way. The company is also understood to be considering an acquisition in the US, where it has a base near Chicago. Strong international demand helped Keller to increase profits last year to Pounds 7.3m, up 65 per cent in the three years since the buy-out.</p>

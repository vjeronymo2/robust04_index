			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, April 27 (AFP) -- The eastern Bosnian  enclave of Gorazde could become a Moslem ghetto as two thirds of  its territory is occupied by Bosnian Serb troops who have  imposed a stranglehold on the region, UN officias said. The UN  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) cannot condone the  creation of another Moslem ghetto in eastern Bosnia like  Srebrenica," UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said. "That is  unacceptable, and that is the issue we should be looking  carefully at." He said the enclave's civilian population of  about 50,000 is going to need "a permanent life support system"  as the Serbs appear bent on making the region unlivable for the  Moslems. He said one example of the Serb resolve was their  destruction of the town's water processing plant during  three-weeks of shelling that only stopped after NATO threatened  airstrikes.    Several relief officials here speaking on condition of  anonymity said plans were "actively" underway for the possible  evacuation of 20,000 people from the enclave. Meanwhile,  Kessler said that UN efforts to provide assistance to the town  residents have been hampered by Serb delaying tactics.    Eric Chaperon, the UN Protection Force spokesman, said that  the the Serbs on Tuesday prevented a UN convoy carrying building  material from reaching the town. Kessler said the convoy should  reach Gorazde Thursday adding that "the delays imposed by the  Serbs are a violation of freedom of movement." He said that in  order to survive, the enclave's residents would need "at least  one convoy a day" and that refugees must be allowed to return to  their homes.</p>

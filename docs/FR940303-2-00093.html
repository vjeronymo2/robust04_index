			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c. Trust_any Trust Agreement before it is finally accepted generally should: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Give the trustee the powers necessary to execute the note and mortgage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Specifically authorize the execution of the Regulatory Agreement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Contain nothing inconsistent with the Regulatory Agreement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Prohibit the transfer of beneficial interest prior to completion of the project without the prior written consent of the Secretary and prohibit the transfer of such interest subsequent to completion of the project unless the new beneficiary assumes and agrees to be bound by the Regulatory Agreement; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Require that the Secretary be advised ten (10) days prior to any proposed transfers of beneficial interests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> G. The HUD field counsel have not been consistent in requiring HUD to be named in the Financing Statements as a secured party or as its interests may appear; consequently, the requirement that HUD be so named is now being standardized. This should be clarified through appropriate language in the Security Agreement. The purpose is to clarify that, under certain circumstances, HUD may assert some rights in the personalty arising under the Regulatory Agreement which would precede an assignment of the mortgage. This is desirable in the event HUD exercises some of its remedies under the Regulatory Agreement in cases where the mortgage has not been assigned to HUD. It will not be necessary for HUD to consent to every UCC termination, renewal, assignment, etc. until HUD's rights as a secured party are established. HUD is being named ``as its interests appear'' so that, for example, where HUD obtains a court order, HUD will be able to establish a paramount interest in the Project income stream, and other personalty pursuant to the Regulatory Agreement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Q. UCC searches: The UCC search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search firm, the counsel to the Mortgagor or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> T. Evidence of zoning compliance: The evidence of zoning compliance will vary depending on the circumstances. The evidence should establish that the building, if constructed according to plans and circumstances, will comply with all zoning requirements. The evidence may be in the form of a letter or certificate from the appropriate local official stating that, if the building is constructed according to the plans and specifications submitted for review, the building will comply with all zoning requirements. In refinancing cases where no construction is involved, the evidence may be in the form of a letter certifying that the existing building(s) is (are) in compliance with outstanding zoning requirements or, if not, the nonconforming variance, etc., is acceptable. If the locality has no zoning ordinance, a letter should be submitted from the chief executive stating such. In those circumstances, it may be necessary to obtain a letter from the local planning body of the county in which the project is located, that the proposed development is compatible with the county's comprehensive plan. If the zoning approval is based upon a variance or other special action, the closing may have to be delayed until the time for appeals has run. In extremely complex cases, an opinion may need to be obtained from legal counsel specializing in local zoning matters. Such letter must be attached as an exhibit and referenced in the appropriate paragraphs of the Opinion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> W. Survey: The survey must be signed, sealed and dated within 90 days of the closing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> LL. Bond documents: This does not include all documents involved in the typical bond financing. It does include those principal documents such as the Prospectus, the Indenture, a sample Bond, etc. Moreover, all documents executed by the Mortgagor or which establish or describe any obligations of the Mortgagor must be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OO. Docket search: The Docket search can be conducted by either the title insurance company, a reputable document search firm, the counsel to the Mortgagor or any other attorney licensed in the jurisdiction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

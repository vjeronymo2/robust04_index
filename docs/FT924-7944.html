			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / The Autumn Statement - Details: Shortfall to be met by Exchequer grant - National Insurance A SHORTFALL in the National Insurance Fund will be met by an Exchequer grant rather than by increasing the standard rates of contributions for either employees or employers, which remain at 9 per cent and 10.4 per cent respectively, Mr Peter Lilley, secretary of state for social security, said in a statement yesterday. He added: 'This legislation will also introduce the 1 per cent additional rebate for appropriate personal pension holders aged 30 and over. In line with the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, the lower earnings limit for class 1 contributions is to be raised to Pounds 56 a week, which is the nearest whole pound to the basic retirement pension rate for a single person from April 1993. The upper earnings limit is to be raised to Pounds 420 a week, which is slightly less than 7 1/2 times the new basic pension rate as provided by the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act. These new earnings limits will replace the current ones of Pounds 54 and Pounds 405. Under the current structure, employees whose earnings reach the lower earnings limit will continue to pay an initial contribution of 2 per cent of that limit, and standard rate contributions of 9 per cent on that portion of their earnings which exceeds the lower but not the upper earnings limit. 'For employers, the reduced contribution rates of 4.6 per cent, 6.6 per cent and 8.6 per cent for the lower paid will continue. However, the thresholds for these rates will be raised so that from April 1993 they apply to weekly earnings which fall below the ceilings of Pounds 95, Pounds 140, and Pounds 195 respectively, compared with Pounds 90, Pounds 135 and Pounds 190 at present. Neither the employee nor his employer will have to pay any contributions if earnings are less than Pounds 56 a week. Those whose earnings do not exceed Pounds 405 (the former upper earnings limit) will pay 14 pence a week less in contributions than at present. This is because a further Pounds 2 of their weekly earnings will be subject to a deduction of 2 per cent rather than 9 per cent. For employees with earnings above Pounds 405 a week, the maximum possible increase will be Pounds 1.21 a week. Employers' contributions will generally be unchanged, although some will pay less where employees' earnings which were above the former thresholds fall below the new thresholds. There will be no increase for employers of the higher paid since there is no upper earnings limit for employers' contributions. The statutory review of the contracted-out rebate for employees and employers, the result of which was announced in February, resulted in a reduction in the rebate from April 1993. Al-though the main rates of contributions remain unchanged, the effect of the reduced rebate is that many employees will pay a little more. Those with earnings between Pounds 110 and Pounds 405 (the former upper earnings limit) will pay up to 59 pence a week more. Those who earn more than Pounds 405 will pay contributions on the next Pounds 15 of earnings from next April (ie up to Pounds 420 a week, the proposed upper earnings limit), a maximum increase of Pounds 1.67 a week. Contracted-out employees who earn Pounds 110 or less will pay the same or slightly less. Because of the fall in the rebate, employers will generally pay more, although some will pay less where employees' earnings which were above the former thresholds fall below the new thresholds. The flat-rate class 2 contribution will be raised by 20 pence to Pounds 5.55 a week. There will be no increase in the rate of class 4 contributions, currently 6.3 per cent. The annual limits of profits between which class 4 contributions are paid will be raised to Pounds 6,340 and Pounds 21,840 from Pounds 6,120 and Pounds 21,060 respectively.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------      EFFECT OF PROPOSED CHANGES ON INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY (TABLE B2)                         SELF-EMPLOYED (Liability for both class 2 and class 4 contributions)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Annual profits or gains              Yearly contribution       Change                                                (1993-94)   on 1992-93                                 (classes 2 and 4) Pounds       Pounds Pounds 3030*-Pounds 3140                            nil**     -278.20 Pounds 3140 - Pounds 6120 Current LPL            288.60        +10.40  Pounds 6340 Proposed LPL                        288.60         -3.46 Pounds 10000                                     519.18         -3.46 Pounds 21060 Current UPL                        1215.96         -3.46 Pounds 21840 Proposed UPL                       1265.10        +45.68  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LPL: Lower Profits Limit for Class 4 Contribs; UPL: Upper Profits Limit for Class 4 Contribs * Self-employed people who earn less than Pounds 3140 and who have been granted a small earnings exception will not have to pay any Class 2 contributions in 1993-94; **Provided that a small earnings exception is granted.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

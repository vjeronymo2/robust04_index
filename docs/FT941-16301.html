			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Horrified by unfairness of others Sir, The unfairness of insurance companies' practices has been widely publicised following the recent Consumers' Association 'Which?' survey. It is said many motor insurers happy to insure a motorist's Cavalier 1.6L refuse to insure his Escort XR3i. Speaking as a registered insurance broker, I must remember to ask the Consumers' Association to investigate greengrocers' shops. It is totally unfair that they only sell fruit and vegetables. I was horrified when my local greengrocer, who calls himself a retailer, recently refused to sell me some pots and pans. T P W Dowlen, Hollybank House, Hook Heath Avenue, Woking, Surrey GU22 0HN</p>

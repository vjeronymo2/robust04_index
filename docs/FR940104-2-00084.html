			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Studies of cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders are beset by a number of methodologic problems, including exposure measures, the wide variety of ``standardized'' test instruments used, and the inability to detect or correct for other influences on test results such as emotional state, non-neurologic disease, metabolic conditions, fatigue, medications, or style of the examiner. Because of their failure to adequately control for these confounding factors, these studies lack credibility in assessing the relationship of herbicide exposure to these conditions. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that there is no credible evidence for an association between cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were no significant studies available to analyze whether an association exists between herbicide exposure and motor/coordination dysfunction. Accordingly, the Secretary has found that there is no credible evidence for an association between motor/coordination dysfunction and herbicide exposure, and he has determined that a positive association does not exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Metabolic and digestive disorders (diabetes mellitus, hepatic enzyme abnormality, lipid abnormalities, and ulcers) were also categorized by NAS as health outcomes with inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether an association exists. Although NAS found no biologic basis to suspect an association between herbicide exposure and diabetes, abnormal glucose tolerance tests have been reported in three studies (Sweeney M.H., Fingerhut M.A., Arezzo J.C., Hornung R.W., Connally L.B. In press. Peripheral neuropathy after occupational exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD).; Air Force Health Study. 1991. An Epidemiologic Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following Exposure to Herbicides. Serum Dioxin Analysis of 1987 Examination Results. Brooks AFB, TX: USAF School of Aerospace Medicine. 9 vols.; Pazderova-Vejlupkova J., Lukas E., Nemcova M., Pickova J., Jirasek L., 1991. The development and prognosis of chronic intoxication by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in men. Archives of Environmental Health 36:5&hyph;11). While this suggests such an association, the evidence is inconclusive and its credibility is questionable because an abnormal glucose tolerance test is not an absolute indicator of diabetes and none of these studies allowed for the confounding role of obesity. Two other studies found no association (Moses M., Lilis R., Crow K.D., Thornton J., Fischbein A., Anderson H.A., Selikoff I.J., 1984. Health status of workers with past exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the manufacture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid: Comparison of findings with and without chloracne. American Journal of Industrial Medicine 5:161&hyph;182; Suskind and Hertzberg, 1984), and a number of studies have shown no increased death rates from diabetes (Bertazzi et al., 1989; Cook R.R., Bond G.G., Olson R.A., Ott M.G., 1987. Update of the mortality experience of workers exposed to chlorinated dioxins. Chemosphere 16:2111&hyph;2116; Henneberger P.K., Ferris B.G. Jr., Monson R.R., 1989. Mortality among pulp and paper workers in Berlin, New Hampshire. British Journal of Industrial Medicine 46:658&hyph;664). Accordingly, the Secretary has found that the credible evidence against an association between diabetes and herbicide exposure outweighs the credible evidence for such an association, and he has determined that a positive associations does not exist. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

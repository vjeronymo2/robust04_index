			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): News of US rate cut lifts Continent late in the day THE CUT in US interest rates and the firm opening on Wall Street lifted the Continent yesterday near the end of a generally lacklustre session. Most bourses will be closed today for the May Day holiday. Amsterdam was shut yesterday for the Queen's Birthday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw some buying of blue chips at the lower levels, but in general trading was lacklustre as dealers unwound their positions before today's holiday. Prices were marked up in the post-bourse, however, after the US Federal Reserve cut the discount rate. At the close, the DAX index fell 14.49 to 1,605.79 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, declined 9.52 to 680.76. Volume shrank to DM4.1bn from DM5.9bn. Strikes by the IG Metall metal workers' union to press for higher wages depressed the car sector. Daimler lost DM9 to DM698 while Volkswagen fell DM4.70 to DM371. Deutsche Bank fell DM5.70 to DM643.80. The bank said that it would ask shareholders to approve a DM75m rise in authorised capital to be used for placement in the US prior to the stock's listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Continental, the tyre manufacturer, fell DM4.50 to DM211.50 before Friday's supervisory board meeting, at which Pirelli is expected to seek two board seats to reflect its shareholding in the German company. MILAN concentrated on shares linked to the Mondadori publishing group, following an accord late on Monday between Mr Carlo De Benedetti and Mr Silvio Berlusconi to divide its assets. Mondadori savings shares were suspended briefly because of excessive demand. They closed at L12,900, up L1,300 or 11.2 per cent. The magazine L'Espresso soared L1,800 or 8.6 per cent to L22,800. Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding company, closed up L50 at L2,600. Trading was estimated at close to Monday's thin L131bn. The MIB index rose one point to 1,121; the Comit index was unavailable. PARIS finished only slightly above its session low in a session dominated by index-related business as futures and options contracts expired. Half of the total turnover of about FFr2.1bn was said to have been index-related, and to have taken place in the last hour of trading. The CAC 40 index touched a low of 1,772.51 before closing 18.17 or 1 per cent down at 1,779.18. Among the CAC 40 stocks, UAP, the insurer which held an analysts' meeting on Monday, dropped FFr23 or 4.1 per cent to FFr540 with 113,550 shares exchanged; and L'Oreal fell FFr15 or 2.7 per cent to FFr547. Michelin continued to rise in active trading, adding another 70 centimes to FFr95.10 on 680,550 shares. CGI Informatique, the software company, lost FFr14.80 or 4.3 per cent to FFr333.20 after its figures disappointed analysts at the previous day's meeting. Suez eased FFr2.10 to FFr337.90 on 197,150 shares. The financial holding company said that it would convert its investment certificates, which have been suspended at FFr300, into ordinary shares. BRUSSELS recouped part of its early losses as Wall Street opened higher. The Bel20 index ended 10.64 lower at 1,188.35 in turnover of BFr1.2bn. US-related stocks showed the strongest recovery: retailer Delhaize bounced back from a low of BFr7,530 to close at BFr7,670, down BFr140. MADRID reduced its morning losses, as the general index ended 0.73 lower at 275.74. Hidrola fell Pta11 to Pta556 in heavy volume of 957,686 shares, while Iberduero, which is expected to merge with Hidrola, gained Pta5 to Pta714 on 1.04m shares. ZURICH ended above its day's low, as the Credit Suisse index closed at 549.6, down 1.2. Trading was thin before today's holiday. STOCKHOLM drifted lower in a shortened session ahead of the May Day holiday. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 5.7 to 1,046.2 in volume of SKr213m after Monday's SKr188m. OSLO closed mostly lower, as the news of the US interest rate cut came after the close. The all-share index dropped 2.47 to 479.09 in moderate turnover of NKr388m. Norsk Hydro shed NKr3 to NKr182 and Saga Petroleum free shares also lost NKr3, closing at NKr105. ISTANBUL dropped another 6 per cent as economic worries grew. The 75-share index, which fell 6.4 per cent on Monday, lost 225.61 to 3,554.25.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1112.21  1111.29  1110.75  1109.95  1110.66  1109.73  1113.97  1111.29  -----------------------------------------------------------------------           Day's High   1114.86     Day's Low   1107.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Apr 29      Apr 26     Apr 25     Apr 24     Apr 23 1120.75     1115.94    1122.55    1119.18    1122.04 Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

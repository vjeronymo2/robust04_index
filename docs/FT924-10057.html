			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Russian airports to be joint-stock companies THE Russian government plans to separate ownership of the country's airports from airlines in a move to promote more efficiency without going as far as privatising the sector. The plan is to turn 70 airports into joint-stock companies which would remain in state hands and attract some outside investors in the longer-term. This will enable airlines, which will remain subdivisions of Aeroflot, to concentrate on running commercial businesses and allow airports to raise their own revenues and enforce separate regulations. Mr Leonid Shcheglov, president of the Aeroport Association, which represents the airports, was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying it proposed to hand 30 per cent of shares in the airports to central state bodies, 30 per cent to local authorities and 40 per cent to workers and other investors. It was not immediately clear how the plan would affect two foreign airlines' agreements to provide modern terminal facilities and set up joint airlines with Russian partners. Mr Bob Hughes, financial controller for Air Russia, a British Airways' joint venture which hopes to start flights at Moscow's Domodedovo airport next summer, said it was too early to comment on the implications. Lufthansa, with a similar arrangement at Moscow's main Sheremetievo airport, was also unable to comment. However, Interfax news agency said that Sheremetievo would for three years remain part of a joint-stock company called Aeroflot-Russian International Airlines, which accounted for 90 per cent of Aeroflot's international flights - suggesting that, in reality, little would change. Mr Vladimir Khadannikov, general director of Avtovaz, which makes Lada cars, was elected chairman of a council of industrialists which met yesterday for the first time.</p>

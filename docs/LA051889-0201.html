			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXXON CHIEF REJECTS ANGRY STOCKHOLDERS' CALL TO QUIT  </P> <P> Exxon Corp. Chairman Lawrence Rawl, faced at the oil giant's annual meeting  today with angry shareholders and protesters calling Exxon a corporate  criminal, rejected demands that he resign over his handling of the Alaskan oil  spill.  </P> <P> Rawl told stockholders that, in the wake of the tanker grounding that caused  North America's worst oil spill, Exxon has ordered random drug and alcohol  tests for employees in sensitive jobs, "including me." He also pledged the  company will complete its cleanup of Alaska's Prince William Sound by September  or earlier.  </P> <P> "The answer is no, I won't (resign)," Rawl told 2,000 shareholders in a packed  hotel room for an annual meeting dominated by the oil spill issue. "It's  anti-productive to even consider that."  </P> <P> Protesters chanting "Make Exxon pay" confronted shareholders outside the hotel  where the meeting was held. Some wore pig costumes and some stood on stilts so  that stockholders could read signs with slogans such as "Exxon is organized  crime" and "Exxon is human error."  </P> <P> Along a long driveway leading to the hotel, demonstrators planted mock  tombstones bearing the names of Alaska bays and inlets fouled by the nearly 11  million gallons of crude oil spilled into Prince William Sound by the tanker  Exxon Valdez on March 24.  </P> <P> Environmentalists and Alaska residents who own stock in Exxon pressed corporate  management to speed cleanup efforts. Ed Rothschild, a spokesman for a coalition  of five consumer and environmental groups, stepped to the microphone to call  for Rawl's resignation.  </P> <P> Rawl responded that his stepping down would be the "worst thing we could do  now," and only divert the corporation's attention from the cleanup effort in  Alaska.  </P> <P> "What do you want me to say that is going to make you happy? To say I am going  to make it disappear out there? Because I can't," Rawl said.  </P></p>

			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Observer: Black deed Conrad Black, chairman of the Daily Telegraph, has a way with words. Peter Jay, Britain's former ambassador to the US and former Robert Maxwell employee, told yesterday's Wall Street Journal how once, when walking next to Henry Kissinger, he was 'more or less knocked to the ground physically' by Black trying to get between them. According to the WSJ, Black describes Jay's account as 'a wild bowdlerisation'. Thomas Bowdler, it will be recalled, made his name by publishing an edition of Shakespeare with the dirty bits left out. Which raises the question - what was really going on between Black and Kissinger?</p>

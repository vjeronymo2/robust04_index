			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BRANDO'S LAWYER SEEKING CHARGE OF  MANSLAUGHTER  </P> <P> Christian Brando's defense lawyer has asked a court to reduce the murder charge  against him to manslaughter. Another motion, filed this week in Superior Court,  seeks to suppress a tape-recorded police interview with Brando, son of actor  Marlon Brando.  </P> <P> Attorney Robert Shapiro will argue the motions before Superior Court Judge  Robert Thomas on Sept. 14, said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the district  attorney. Brando, 32, pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder in the May 16  shooting of Dag Drollet, 26, the boyfriend of Christian's half-sister,  Cheyenne. Drollet was found dead at Marlon Brando's estate in the Santa Monica  Mountains. Trial is set for Oct. 1.  </P> <P> Shapiro argued unsuccessfully during a preliminary hearing that the murder  charge should be reduced to manslaughter because there was no evidence that  Brando intended to kill Drollet. However, prosecutors have cited reports that  Drollet was clutching a TV remote control device and other items when his body  was discovered.  </P></p>

This developed as Southern Command chief Major General  Thelmo  Cunanan endorsed an investigation of the relatives of the  victims in the 26 December bombing of the cathedral to find out  if they have knowledge in the "retaliatory" attacks on the  mosques.    "Let us join together to identify (those involved) and bring  them into the open to expose their evil agenda and let them  answer their ungodly and barbaric acts," MILF spokesman Mohagher  Iqbal said in a press statement on Tuesday.    But Iqbal warned the government to avoid "witchhunting as  what had happened in the Buluan massacre," an incident that also  almost sparked a Muslim-Christian conflict.    Iqbal was referring to the 13 December ambush-massacre in  which 10 bus passengers were killed and 10 others wounded in  Buluan, Maguindanao which the military blamed to a certain MILF  Kumander [Commander] Ustadz Dua Mantio.    "Kumander Dua was made the sacrificial lamb for a crime he  was never involved in," Iqbal said, adding that Dua was found  innocent of the charges in an MILF initiated investigation.    Iqbal said the Davao City bombings were "befitting only to  barbarians, ungodly and bloodthirsty" who "deserve the highest  condemnation of every sane, upright and God-believing individual  or group."    The MILF spokesman also appealed to the people of Davao City  and nearby areas to "observe sobriety, patience and perseverance  in the face of this machination to drive a wedge between our  peoples."    In the same statement, Iqbal reaffirmed the MILF support to  the on-going peace talks between its rival Moro National  Liberation Front and the government, which he considered a hope  leading to the implementation of the 1976 Tripoli Agreement.    "If any group cannot contribute to this forward move (peace  talks), at least it must stop rocking the boat of peace and  autonomy," Iqbal said.</p>

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROCKET MAKER LAUNCHES DEAL WITH NASA  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. said Wednesday that it has received a  $140.6-million contract to provide rocket launch services to NASA.  </P> <P> The Huntington Beach-based company will provide services for the launch of  three of its Delta II rockets for the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration during the next five years.  </P> <P> The contract also includes options to provide services for 12 additional  launches, which could extend the contract to 1998.  </P> <P> "We see this as a logical step in the development of the Delta program," said  Donald Tutwiler, a McDonnell Douglas executive for the Delta program.  Previously, McDonnell Douglas supplied its Delta rocket to NASA while the space  agency provided the launch services. Now the rocket maker will also supply  launch services for NASA.  </P> <P> The contract calls for the launch of the first satellite, Geotail, aboard the  Delta II rocket. The next two launches, of the Wind and Polar satellites, will  be launched on a more powerful version of the Delta II.  </P> <P> The Geotail and Wind satellites are scheduled to be launched from Cape  Canaveral, Fla., in July, 1992, and December, 1992, respectively. Polar will be  launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., in June, 1993.  </P></p>

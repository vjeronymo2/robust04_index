			<p>920509 FT  09 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged RATES in the sterling money market were mostly unchanged yesterday, despite the pound's strong performance on the foreign exchange markets. On Thursday, both sterling futures and interbank rates had reflected the strong performance by the pound on the foreign exchange markets. But yesterday, the market reverted to the view that 10 per cent base rate will stay throughout the summer, following the Bank of England's 1/2 point cut earlier this week. Trade in sterling futures was extremely quiet with volume for the September short sterling contract at around 8000 lots. The September contract ended at 90.27, implying that base rates five months from now will be 9.73 per cent. Period rates in the interbank market were also mostly unchanged. The 3-month rate again ended at 10 1/8 - 1/16 per cent, while the one-year rate was only marginally lower at 10 1/16 -10 per cent. 'That bare difference between the period rates reflects the market view that there is little chance of a base rate change soon,' said a market analyst. In the discount market, traders found it difficult to remove a shortage of Pounds 2.35bn, the largest ever forecast by the Bank of England. In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 2m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 50m of Band-3 Bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds 44m of Band-4 Bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent and Pounds 600m of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts on 28 and 29 May at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. Later the Bank bought Pounds 33m of Band-3 Bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, Pounds 3m of Band-4 Bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent, and Pounds 800m for resale to the market in equal amounts on 28 and 29 May at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank bought Pounds 650m of Band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 34m of Band-2 and Pounds 2m of Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 134m of Band-3 Treasury bills and Pounds 5m of Bank bills at 9 21/32 per cent, and Pounds 68m of Band-4 Bank bills at 9 19/32 per cent. The overnight rate ended at around 9 3/4 per cent. Ireland became the third EMS-member country this week to cut interest rates after the Central Bank of Ireland cut both its overnight and short term facility lending rates. The overnight rate was cut to 7 1/4 per cent from 7 1/2 per cent, and the short-term facility rate was reduced to 10 1/2 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali  has denied the statements attributed to him regarding the  occupied Syrian Golan, published by the London-based newspaper  AL-HAYAH yesterday [as heard], saying that these statements were  untrue and distorted.    In a statement to the Jordanian News Agency yesterday, Dr.  al-Majali added: Jordan rejects any attempts to confuse its  strategic relations with sisterly Syria. Jordan regards Syria  with absolute faith in common objectives and destiny to reach a  just and comprehensive peace that will safeguard the rights of  all of us, and ensure the implementation of UN Security Council  Resolutions 242 and 338, on which the peace process is based.</p>

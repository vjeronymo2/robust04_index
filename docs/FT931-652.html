			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Ministers look at ways to cut invalidity cash SOCIAL SECURITY ministers are looking at ways of cutting the more than Pounds 5bn a year spent on invalidity benefit as part of this year's White-hall spending negotiations - making it a likely first casualty of the government's fundamental review of public spending. Invalidity benefit claimants have more than doubled since 1979 to 1.38m, and the Department of Social Security suspects that the actual number of people unable to work through illness has not risen in proportion. Options include taxing the benefit, ending or restricting its availability to people above the retirement age, or tightening further the qualification procedures. Taxation of invalidity benefit has already been hinted at by the government. Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is keeping pressure on spending ministers and has said that the first results of the public expenditure review will be available this summer, in time to have an impact on spending from April 1994. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has called a 'brain-storming' weekend summit of his ministerial team next month for a strategic review of his department's work. He plans a series of briefing papers on the benefit system, including the impact of demographic changes on their costs, in order to prepare the ground for possible policy changes after the next general election. The spending review could see a further substantial shift towards individuals 'opting out' of the state benefit system and making private provision. The Treasury yesterday did not rule out the possibility of its Pounds 254bn 'control total' for spending in 1994-95 being lowered during this year's negotiations. Meanwhile, Labour also appears to be moving towards backing radical changes to the welfare state. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, warned a weekend conference in London that the problem of pensioner poverty could not be tackled by raising the basic state retirement pension. He pointed out that almost 70 per cent of people now retiring had an occupational pension worth, on average, the same as the state retirement pension. And an increasing number retired with a state earnings-related pension. If the state retirement pension remained pegged to prices, it would continue to fall as a percentage of average earnings, he said. Even to hold it at its present level in relation to average earnings would be very costly.</p>

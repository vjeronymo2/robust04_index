			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Hurd places exports top of Asia agenda Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, yesterday placed the promotion of British exports to Asia at the top of his agenda when he brought a delegation of British businessmen to his meeting with Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Thai prime minister, at the start of an Asian tour. Britain is the biggest European investor in Thailand, but both Mr Hurd and his entourage of chief executives acknowledged that UK manufacturers had allowed Japan to dominate trade and investment with the region. They said they would try to win contracts in the defence, telecommunications and civil engineering sectors to redress the balance. 'Those of us who've been coming to Bangkok for some years are always astounded by the progress,' said Mr Richard Turner, group marketing director for Rolls Royce. 'I think that we in Britain have probably not paid enough attention to it in the past.' In his new role as midwife to British business contracts, Mr Hurd attended the signing in Bangkok of an agreement between Balfour Beatty, the construction arm of BICC, and Thailand's Sahaviriya group, to establish a Pounds 3m (Dollars 4.65m) joint venture to bid for infrastructure projects in Thailand and other Asian countries. The construction of everything from road tunnels and airports to factories and power stations in the region will be worth billions of dollars to such companies in the next few years. A feasibility study is now underway for a proposed rail link between Nong Khai in north-eastern Thailand and Vientiane, the capital of Laos. Mr Hurd also announced the establishment of the Thai-British Business Group, a forum to bring together business executives from the two countries. Although many companies from Britain and elsewhere in Europe have been slow to take advantage of the rapid growth of south-east Asian economies, there are signs of improvement. Last year UK exports to Thailand rose 38 per cent to Pounds 660m, while imports from Thailand rose 20 per cent to Pounds 770m. Mr Hurd noted that some Thai companies - including the Landmark group which recently bought the Royal Lancaster Hotel in London - had invested in Britain, and he urged Thai investors to follow Japan in looking at Britain as a gateway to Europe. Today Mr Hurd is scheduled to go to Vietnam.</p>

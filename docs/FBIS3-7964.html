This senseless act has struck a fierce blow to the  Palestinian-Israeli peace process, the Foreign Ministry said in  a statement and added that it was in the interest of the people  of Palestine and Israel to do everything in order to avoid that  this incident leads to the increase of tension and escalation of  the conflict.    Consistent to the principles of the peaceful resolution of  conflicts as the only way to effectively solve problems in the  international community, the F.R.Y. underscores the importance  of continuing peace talks between Israel and the PLO with the  aim of establishing a just and stable peace in the Middle East,  the statement said.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Restructuring sets Prior on recovery path Benefits of the restructuring over the past two years have begun to show through at Prior, the property group and architectural ironmonger. The company yesterday reported an advance in pre-tax profits from Pounds 347,000 to Pounds 1.95m for the year to March 31, bolstered by a credit of Pounds 2.05m after costs in respect of the release of bank indebtedness. Mr James Prior, chairman, said the year under review had been one of transformation for the company. This, he said, was not only the result of the successful completion of negotiations with the company's banks in 1993, but also of two share issues within the past year which had raised a total of Pounds 6.89m. The funds raised had enabled Prior to eliminate debt and release it from any remaining liability in respect of the four subsidiaries in administrative receivership. In addition, they provided partial funding for the purchase of Bouverie House and a portfolio of properties from Hanson. Following the purchases, net assets amounted to Pounds 9.3m, Mr Prior said. The group now had Pounds 3m on deposit to fund further acquisitions, an annual rent roll in excess of Pounds 2m, and potential tax losses to offset against future profits, he added. Turnover fell from Pounds 1.21m to Pounds 1.2m and earnings came out at 1.23p (0.61p) per share.</p>

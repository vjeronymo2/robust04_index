			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Head of US arm of O&amp;Y threatens to resign THE battle over control of the US subsidiary of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian property company, has intensified following a threat by Mr John Zuccotti, head of the US operation, to resign unless the subsidiary gets an 'independent' board and corporate governance issues are clarified. In an affidavit filed with the US bankruptcy court, Mr Zuccotti said that 'without that clarity, I cannot function as a chief executive officer and exercise my fiduciary responsibilities to all the creditors and the equity (holders).' 'Nor,' he continued, 'do I believe that anyone else can'. Mr Zuccotti added that the current situation made it impossible to continue negotiating with creditors to restructure the US subsidiary's debt. Mr Zuccotti's declaration turns up the heat in a rumbling dispute between administrators of the distressed Canadian parent company's assets, and creditors of the US subsidiary, which has so far avoided bankruptcy. These creditors are a mixture of US and foreign banks, who have Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds 3.44bn) of loans outstanding to O&amp;Y USA. Coopers &amp; Lybrand was appointed to act as administrator of the assets of the Toronto-based property colossus, Olympia &amp; York Developments, which include a majority stake in the US subsidiary. Since then, Coopers has been seeking the right to hire and fire members of a governing board, which is to advise Mr Zuccotti on the running of O&amp;Y USA.</p>

			<p><P> November 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: DESSERTS FOR THE CALORIE-CONSCIOUS  </P> <P> Although the holiday season isn't typically a time for undertaking a diet,  there are those who continue to count calories even at this time of year. There  are a few who will decide to forget the diet until after the holidays pass,  then try to make up for lost time (and gained inches). Others may try skipping  dessert. But is this a realistic option considering the festive mood of the  holidays?  </P> <P> Probably not. That's why desserts that give dieters a clear conscience are in  order. All the seasonal favorites here, including chocolate treats and pumpkin  pie, have been trimmed to meet the health needs of today's waistline watcher.  </P> <P> The chocolate recipes in particular were designed to meet specific criteria.  They adhere to the American Heart Assn. dietary guidelines that recommend the  fat content be kept at 30% of the total day's calories. Each offers a maximum  of 180 calories, per serving, 20 milligrams or less cholesterol and five grams  or less fat.  </P> <P> The Apricot-Glazed Cheese Pie has an oatmeal crust that adds just the right  texture to the orange-flavored cheese filling. Neither has any sugar added. The  pumpkin pie will not only appeal to dieters but to non-dieters as well. It gets  its smooth texture from unflavored gelatin and owes its traditional taste to  pumpkin pie mix.  </P> <P> TRIMMED PUMPKIN PIE  </P> <P> 1 (30-ounce) can pumpkin pie mix  </P> <P> 1 egg, lightly beaten  </P> <P> 4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin  </P> <P> 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup whipped topping  </P> <P> 1/4 cup graham cracker crumbs  </P> <P> 8 gingersnap cookies, cut into halves  </P> <P> Combine pie mix, egg, gelatin and nutmeg in medium saucepan. Cook over medium  heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Chill until partially set,  about 1 to 2 hours. Add vanilla and fold in whipped topping.  </P> <P> Spray 9-inch pie plate with nonstick vegetable coating spray and spoon in  filling. Sprinkle evenly with graham cracker crumbs and chill until firm.  Before serving, insert overlapping cookie halves at intervals around edge of  plate. Makes 6 to 8 servings.  </P> <P> APRICOT-WHOLE WHEAT CREPES  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups low-fat milk  </P> <P> 3/4 cup whole wheat flour  </P> <P> 3 eggs  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons melted butter or margarine  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  </P> <P> Oil  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups orange juice  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons cornstarch  </P> <P> 1/2 cup seedless raisins  </P> <P> 1/2 cup chopped walnuts  </P> <P> 1 (16-ounce) can apricot halves, drained  </P> <P> Vanilla yogurt  </P> <P> Combine milk, flour, eggs, butter and cinnamon in blender or food processor.

Gunmen believed to be from the separatist Liberation Tigers  of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) dragged out Kanagaratnam Jeevaratnam from  his home in eastern Sittandy late Tuesday, shot him dead and  dumped his body in the town, officials said.    "There was also a note by the side (of the body) warning  that  others who try to contest will also get the same treatment," a  local official in the east said, adding it was "definitely" the  work of the LTTE.    Jeevaratnam was planning to stand as an independent  candidate  in the local government elections due to be held shortly.  However, exact dates of balloting have not yet been announced.    Nominations for the local government polls were being  received from Wednesday in the eastern districts of Trincomalee,  Batticaloa and Ampara and northern Vavuniya. Nominations close  on January 12.    The LTTE has called on Tamil parties to boycott the polls  and  had put up posters in the east, threatening those who  participated in the polls with death.    Since the parliamentary elections of February 1989, there  has  been no balloting in the northeast due to the ongoing war  between government troops and LTTE guerrillas.    The LTTE is fighting for a separate state in the northeast  for Sri Lanka's two million minority Tamils who are concentrated  in the region. Thousands have died in the LTTE-led independence  campaign.</p>

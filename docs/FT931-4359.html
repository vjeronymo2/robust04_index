			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Major braced for further Maastricht defeats THE GOVERNMENT is braced for as many as five further defeats on Labour amendments to the Maastricht bill in the wake of Monday's setback, a cabinet minister conceded yesterday. Although none of the amendments would halt British ratification of the treaty, they would undoubtedly undermine further the government's authority and sap morale among loyalist pro-Maastricht MPs. Amid fresh Conservative party rows over Maastricht following Monday's defeat, when Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory rebels scored a 22-vote victory over the government, the minister said: 'The ship can take on some water. So long as it stays on course, that is what matters.' The 'Positive Europeans' group of Tory MPs last night wrote to the chairman of the party's backbench 1922 committee complaining about executive members who have voted against the government. However, Mr John Major has taken a strategic decision not to antagonise Tory Euro-rebels, believing many are fighting over what they see as genuine points of principle. He is anxious to maintain Conservative unity in the long term, not least in nine months' time when the Maastricht legislation should be passed. Amid chaotic scenes, Labour MPs disrupted Commons' business last night with procedural votes in pre-emptive retaliation against the threat of the government trying to extend today's resumed debate on Maastricht into Friday or beyond. Labour has said that all its MPs will remain at Westminster if proceedings do continue into the weekend, even at the expense of the party's Scottish conference in Inverness. Ministers, who are playing down the significance of Monday's vote, appear ready to leave the arm-twisting of Tory rebels to loyalist backbench colleagues who are expected to resume their criticisms at a 1922 committee meeting today. In practice, surveys of Conservative constituency association chairmen - showing many supportive of the rebels - reveal there is little the prime minister can do to contain the revolt. Leaders of the Euro-sceptics were unbowed yesterday, saying they could support at least some of Labour's amendments, including one on the social chapter. Although there is evidence of some splits among the rebels, tactics are also being kept secret. The government's vulnerability has, meanwhile, markedly raised morale on the Labour benches, following its victory on Monday. But Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, yesterday made clear that the opposition would do nothing to prevent eventual ratification of the accord. Battle for the 'franc fort', Page 22</p>

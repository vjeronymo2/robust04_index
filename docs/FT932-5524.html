			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Talk tough to Tokyo IF IN DOUBT, blame the Japanese. This seems to be the motto which both the US Treasury team and the European Commission have emblazoned across their collective chests as they attend this week's meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Why is the US recovery so sluggish, and European growth non-existent? It's the Japanese trade surplus, stupid. Japan officials should not be surprised that their trade surplus was treated as a principal obstacle to global growth at yesterday's meeting, however much they might resent their being treated as a scapegoat and however much they might balk at calls for further yen appreciation. For US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen, worried by the halting performance of the US economy and fighting congressional protectionists, Japan's surplus is an easy, probably unavoidable, target. Nor is it just US officials who find the Japanese surplus to be a convenient diversion. This is also true for the European Community, whose economics commissioner, Henning Christophersen, also told Japan to stimulate its economy. For the source of Europe's problems lies closer to home, demonstrated by the fact that Bundesbank president Helmut Schlesinger simultaneously announced that Europe would remain trapped in the Buba's high interest rate grip for some time. Yet Lloyd Bentsen does have a good point, a rather more sophisticated one than was the norm from previous US Treasury secretaries. Japan's trade and current account surpluses are a problem, Mr Bentsen said, not because they suggest that trade is unfair but because they are a sign that Japan's domestic economy remains depressed. The surplus continues to rise, he explained, because Japanese domestic demand is growing even more slowly than income, thus depressing demand for US imports, undermining the US recovery and depressing global growth. Mr Bentsen's analysis, while stretching things a little, is broadly right. Japan's trade surplus is currently high and rising because Japanese imports are depressed. Japanese export volumes have risen by 9 per cent since the beginning of 1990 but Japanese imports have fallen by 6 per cent. Little wonder that Japan's trade surplus continues to grow, despite the yen's rise to record highs. The best way for Japan to stave off protectionist pressures from the US and Europe is to get its stagnant domestic economy moving again. The fiscal stimulus package must be implemented as quickly as possible; short-term interest rates should be cut to stimulate monetary growth; and public funds should be used to help commercial banks rid their balance sheet of bad debts faster than at present. If Japan wants a quieter life, it should complain less, listen harder and act faster.</p>

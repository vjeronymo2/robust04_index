			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / People: Scottish Office servant to head Whisky Association The Scotch Whisky Association, which spends most of its time lobbying the British and other governments on behalf of the Scotch whisky industry, is appointing Hugh Morison, a senior civil servant at the Scottish Office, as its new director-general. He will succeed Bill Bewsher, who has been director general for 21 years, when he retires at the end of the year. Morison, 49, is currently under-secretary at the Scottish Office Industry Department, concerned mainly with assisting Scottish companies. As with other officials who have made their way up the Scottish Office, he has worked in several of its departments. But, he says, he has got a 'real buzz' recently from dealing with the private sector. He decided to join the SWA when he learned that, in his next Scottish Office post, he would not deal with economic issues. Morison is a Scot though he was born in Bognor Regis: 'My family was part of the Scottish diaspora.' He was a non-executive director of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based engineering company, under the scheme whereby civil servants and private sector companies are encouraged to become better acquainted. Bewsher, his predecessor, has combined the doggedness of a lobbyist with a gift for getting on with almost everyone, from the gentry (of which he is a member) downwards. While Bewsher has run the SWA, it has won cases in the European Court of Justice against France, Italy, Denmark, Ireland and Greece over discriminatory treatment of whisky. In 1987 it achieved a GATT ruling against Japan's highly protectionist spirits regime. The whisky industry, he argues, needs someone 'who knows at first hand the machinery of government'.</p>

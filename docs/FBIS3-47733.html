			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Communique" by the spokesman of the National Army of </F> Democratic Kampuchea dated 12 January; place not given -- read  by announcer]    [Text] Press communique by the spokesman of the National  Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] condemning the two-headed  government, which is a foreign lackey, for using a MiG warplane  and rockets to attack the houses of the inhabitants at Chreh  village, Reang Khvay commune, Leach Disrtrict, Pursat Province:    1. On 8 January at 1100, a MiG warplane fired many rockets  on the houses of the inhabitants in Chreh village, Reang Khvay  commune, Leach District, Pursat Province. As a result, many  houses were damaged, and a number of cattle were killed.    2. The NADK wishes to join our nation and people in  vehemently denouncing and condemning the criminal activities  against the aforementioned people committed by the two-headed  government whose masters are the communist Vietnamese and an  alliance.    3. The action by the two-headed government constitutes a  continuation of the communist Vietnamese aggressors' policy of  eradicating the Cambodian race and an action against the king  and the Cambodian nation and people, who have repeatedly called  for national reconciliation to restore peace in accordance with  the five-point initiative of his majesty.    For more than six months, the two-headed government group  has  done nothing but stubbornly continue the war to destroy the  nation and people at will. Also, it has given Vietnam a free  hand to ship its people to Cambodia -- the Vietnamese in the  country now number nearly 4 million -- and to cut off and seize  part of Cambodia's maritime territory and some of the country's  islands. Their crimes are extremely serious. The people in  both the rural and urban areas and those living abroad are  judging their crimes and sentencing them.    No force is more vigorous than the people's force.  Aggressors, old and new alike, have already tested the  Cambodian people's force. The latter have no intention  whatsoever to eliminate anybody; they only want to achieve  national reconciliation in compliance with the five-point plan  of the king so that the nation can regain peace and the people  can have the opportunity to earn a living, look after their  families, and rebuild a Cambodia with genuine independence,  unity, and territorial integrity as in the epoch preceding 1970.    [Dated] 12 January 1994    [Signed] NADK spokesman</p>

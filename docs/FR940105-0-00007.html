			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC will continue to monitor implementation of the rule and will modify the rule in response to industry experience, advances in technology, or other considerations to ensure that the rule is achieving the general performance objectives set forth in 10 CFR Part 26. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Comment. The random testing rate should be flexible and based on performance, such as the positive rate of random testing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twelve commenters recommended that the Commission allow some form of performance-based approach to determine the random testing rate. Under such a system, the random testing rate would vary over time. This would depend on each licensee's or, alternatively, the industry's positive random test results from a previous period. One licensee, for example, suggested that each licensee's random testing rate should be based upon that particular licensee's previous 12-month testing results. Under this approach, a licensee would be subject to a minimum 50-percent random testing rate if it experienced a positive rate of greater than 0.50 percent during the previous 12 months. That licensee could reduce its random rate to 25 percent if it subsequently had a 12-month positive rate between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent or to as low as 10 percent if its positive rate for the previous year was less than 0.25 percent. Three other licensees recommended similar schemes whereby a licensee's random rate would be determined by its own record of positive test results. One of these recommendations based the rate on the results of the previous 2 years rather than those of the previous 12 months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NUMARC proposed that the industry-wide random testing rate be determined by the industry-wide random testing results from the previous period. This recommendation was endorsed by five licensees. Under NUMARC's proposed approach, the industry would be allowed by regulation to adjust its random testing rate based on testing results from the previous reporting period. All licensees would be required to test at a 100-percent random rate if the industry-wide positive rate were greater than 1.0 percent in the previous period, at a 50-percent random rate if the positive rate was between 0.50 percent and 1.0 percent, at a 25-percent random rate if the positive rate was between 0.25 percent and 0.50 percent, and at a 10-percent random rate if the positive rate was less than 0.25 percent. Two of the eleven licensees favoring a performance-based testing system provided a general recommendation that did not specify whether the random testing rate should be based on the positive testing results of each individual licensee, or on the results of the industry as a whole. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters noted various potential advantages of adopting a performance-based approach to setting the random testing rate. One stated that adopting such an approach would be consistent with the NRC's initiative to identify performance-based programs that would be beneficial to the industry. Another listed cost savings, equity in that each licensee's random rate would be commensurate with its program performance, and an incentive for licensees to maximize program conformance with the FFD rule as advantages of such an approach. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> NRC Response <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During development of 10 CFR part 26 in 1989, the Commission considered a variation of the flexible, performance-based random rate similar to the approaches recommended by these commenters. (See, for example, the NRC's response to Comment 7.4.2 in NUREG&hyph;1354, ``Fitness for Duty in the Nuclear Power Industry: Responses to Public Comments.'') At that time, the Commission decided against adopting a performance-based rate for various reasons. As stated above, positive random testing results are not the only indicator of detection and deterrence effectiveness or of overall random testing program performance to allow the testing rate to vary with testing results. Adopting a performance-based approach would tend to discourage the initiatives that the Commission is encouraging in 10 CFR 26.24(b) and in Section 2.1 of Appendix A to Part 26. In &sect;26.24(b), the NRC allows licensees to implement programs with more stringent standards, for example, lower screening and confirmation cutoff levels and a broader panel of drugs than those specified in the rule. In Section 2.1 of Appendix A, licensees are permitted to test for any illegal drugs during a for-cause test or analysis of specimens suspected of being adulterated or diluted. Program performance data for the first three years of FFD program implementation have shown that those licensees using screening cutoff levels for marijuana that are lower than the maximum allowed 100 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) have had a higher percentage of confirmed positive results than those screening at 100 ng/ml. (See NUREG/CR&hyph;5758, Vols. 1&hyph;3.) Licensees that employ special measures to detect attempts to dilute specimens or flush metabolites from the body report that their positive rate is about doubled. This result is similar to data presented to the Department of Health and Human Services' Drug Testing Advisory Board on June 10, 1993, and reported in ``The National Report on Substance Abuse'' on June 18, 1993. (The study is currently undergoing peer review before publication.) Adopting a performance-based approach that allowed licensees to reduce their random testing rates as positive testing results declined would likely discourage licensees from adopting lower screening cutoff levels and taking measures to detect attempts by users to avoid detection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Lastly, a performance-based approach would require the collection and analysis of performance data to provide the bases for adjustments to the random testing rate. Such data is not currently collected by the licensees or the NRC. Previous efforts known to the NRC staff to identify and analyze the many candidate performance indicators for measuring the effectiveness of random testing have been inconclusive, primarily because of the numerous variables. Furthermore, assuming that the proper performance indicators can be developed, it would appear that the collection and analysis of data to support a performance-based approach would add a considerable administrative burden to both licensees and the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For all these reasons and until further experience is gained that would support a performance-based approach, the Commission declines to adopt such an approach to setting the random testing rate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

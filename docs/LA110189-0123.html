			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SALES OF NEW DETACHED HOMES DROP;  </P> <P> HOUSING: IN A TWO-TIERED MARKET, CONDOMINIUMS ARE MOVING FASTER IN SOUTH COUNTY  THAN THEY DID LAST YEAR, WHILE HIGH-PRICED HOMES COMPETE FOR A DWINDLING NUMBER  OF BUYERS.  </P> <P> Are sales of new homes really slowing down in Orange County?  </P> <P> That depends, according to a new survey released Tuesday, which shows  condominium sales are actually up this year over last. It is sales of detached  houses -- most of them very big and very expensive -- that are in the doldrums  this year.  </P> <P> Consider these figures from the Costa Mesa consulting firm Market Profiles:  More than 3,600 condos and other types of attached housing had been sold  through the first nine months of 1989 in the southern half of Orange County,  where most new homes are built. That's up 300 sales, or 9.1%, from last year's  3,300.  </P> <P> Detached houses, though, are another story. Builders sold only 3,100 new houses  in the area south of the Costa Mesa Freeway through the first nine months of  the year, compared to 4,000 last year. That's a 22.5% decline. Almost a third  of the houses sold this year were priced at more than $450,000.  </P> <P> The market for used houses has also slowed, several other real estate surveys  have recently indicated. And that means that people who once sold their  existing homes and used the equity to buy a new house are no longer able to do  so as easily. Yet land is so scarce and expensive in the county that many  builders can't turn a profit without charging astronomical prices for the  houses they build.  </P> <P> Consequently, many buyers who might not have considered a condominium a few  years ago now find it is all they can afford in Orange County, said Kelly  McDermott of Market Profiles, accounting for the rise in condo sales.  </P> <P> All this has finally begun to affect housing prices.  </P> <P> Market Profiles reported Tuesday that the average price of a new home in the  county fell for the first time in nearly a year during the summer.  </P> <P> For condominiums it was only a slight drop: The third-quarter price fell only  0.4% from the second quarter, a drop of $837 to an average of $193,089. For  houses the drop was a little steeper: 1.7%, or $6,769, to $381,787.  </P> <P> And because of the slower sales, inventories of homes rose during the quarter  by 350 units, or nearly one-third. That meant there were nearly 1,500 unsold  units during the third quarter, most of them detached houses.  </P> <P> Market Profiles said this year should be considered more a period of market  correction than the first sign of a drastic decline. Last year was an  extraordinarily busy year for home sales, fueled by factors including buyer  fears that slow-growth initiatives would choke off the supply of new housing.  </P> <P> Yet what's less well known, said McDermott, is that 1987 was actually a  stronger sales year than 1988 for new homes. Homes just sold at a steadier pace  in 1987 compared to 1988, when buyers snapped up every house that came on the  market almost within hours, and it "seemed as if the market was much hotter  than it was," said McDermott.  </P> <P> The figures: Through the third quarter of 1987, 8,300 units were sold, compared  to 7,400 in 1988. This year it's 6,700.  </P> <P> "So 1988 suffers in comparison with 1987, and 1989 suffers in comparison with  both years," said McDermott.  </P> <P> Last year, however, was a much better year for sales of detached houses. But  the condo sales coming on strong this year are another sign that the market is  going through a broad change, according to Market Profiles.  </P> <P> What's ahead for the next year or so?  </P> <P> A little stronger sales than this year, said Market Profiles, for several  reasons.  </P> <P> The huge price increases of last year -- when the price of a house went up 26%  between the end of 1987 and the end of 1988 -- should slow. And there will  still be a lot of young, affluent couples with growing families in the market  for big houses, McDermott said, who may be tempted to buy because prices won't  have risen as much.  </P> <P> In addition, builders will probably construct less expensive condos for  first-time home buyers in response to a perceived demand for that type of  housing. There are no condos inexpensive enough for the first-time buyer being  built now, McDermott said.  </P> <P> "Builders are going to have to pay a lot more attention to quality and to the  type of home the public wants," said McDermott. "Last year you could (price) up  anything and it would sell.  </P> <P> "Next year," McDermott said, "the sales people are really going to have to sell  those homes rather than just being available to take orders."  </P> <P> SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY HOME SALES  </P> <P> Here are quarterly sales and average prices for new homes sold in southern  Orange County from 1987 to the present:  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.88IN:2.00IN:2.22IN:2.00IN:2.22IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="5"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Attached  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL SPN="2" CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Detached  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Quarter  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Sales  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Avg.

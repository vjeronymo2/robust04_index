			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Legal &amp; General Mr David Prosser deserves full credit for turning Legal &amp; General around since taking over as chief executive in the autumn of 1991. Recent new business figures have been up with the pack after three dismal years. Costs have been reduced and L&amp;G's mixed record on compliance - witness the recent record fine imposed by Lautro - is being addressed. True, the profits recovery evident in yesterday's full year figures owes more to the cyclical upswing in general insurance rates. By reserving fully against mortgage indemnity losses and buying extensive reinsurance cover, though, L&amp;G has limited its downside risk. If that allows its management to concentrate on the long-term savings business, so much the better. There is certainly no shortage of challenges. How L&amp;G will cope with the tough new regulatory regime promised by the Securities and Investments Board is difficult to judge. Since endowment mortgages account for a relatively large slice of sales, full disclosure of commissions is a real threat. That said, L&amp;G may be big enough and have a strong enough brand to diversify into alternative savings products such as unit trusts. The company's respectable investment performance in recent years is another reason for optimism. Yet it remains a racing certainty that tougher regulation will result in fewer life assurance contracts being sold across the industry. Until L&amp;G proves itself a winner, its shares are likely to suffer with the rest of the sector whatever the attractions in terms of yield.</p>

			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALL HAIL SALEM TEIKYO UNIVERSITY: MOSHI-MOSHI MEETS WEST VIRGINIA;  </P> <P> EAST-WEST: THE JAPANESE PURCHASE A STAKE IN U.S. HIGHER EDUCATION. A  HALF-JAPANESE, HALF-AMERICAN STUDENT BODY MERGES IN THE MOUNTAIN STATE.  </P> <P> The circular announces a seminar at the local college, not the topic you might  expect for what appears to be a typical Appalachian mountain hamlet: "Japanese  and Americans: Likes/Dislikes, Values, Customs, Differences."  </P> <P> Ever since last July, when Salem College announced a merger with Japan's Teikyo  University, things unexpected have become the norm. Now, the town (population  2,200), along with the renamed Salem Teikyo University, prepares for the April  arrival of its first wave of Japanese matriculants.  </P> <P> The school currently has only 400 students, so enrollment of about 200 Japanese  will have a substantial, immediate impact. More important, unlike a typical  study-abroad program, Salem and Teikyo have become as one.  </P> <P> On the surface, the deal was a desperately needed financial shot in the arm for  Salem, having been in a decades-long struggle for survival. The college, with  no endowment, was "traditionally the poorest private college in West Virginia  and all of Appalachia," said Dr. Ronald Ohl, who headed the old school and is  now president of Salem Teikyo University.  </P> <P> The Japanese university will eventually pump $20 million into Salem Teikyo,  enabling the school to pay off its debts, with enough left over for a healthy  $7.5 million endowment. If all goes according to plan, the reconstituted  university will have a 1995 student body of 1,000, half American, half  Japanese.  </P> <P> For Teikyo, a relatively new (1966) Tokyo-based university, the merger is part  of an ambitious plan to develop relationships with a number of foreign  universities. In the United States, Iowa-based Westmar College was  "reorganized, not merged" in early March to become Teikyo Westmar University.  And in Denver, Teikyo purchased one of Regis College's seven campuses for a  reported $7 million -- it has been renamed as Teikyo Loretto Heights -- to  begin a joint program in Pacific studies. Both colleges will welcome several  hundred Japanese students this spring.  </P> <P> Teikyo's role at Salem, however, is far deeper. Teikyo University Foundation  has taken title to the college's physical assets; the board of trustees now  numbers three Japanese and two Americans.  </P> <P> The architect of these programs is Teikyo University President Shoichi Okinaga,  an aggressive proponent of kokusai, the movement for internationalizing the  Japanese higher-educational system, begun about 15 year ago.  </P> <P> One of the main goals is to establish a presence in the United States. Okinaga  began the process about two years ago, contacting about 30 U.S. colleges and  universities. Salem immediately expressed interest. Okinaga cited the main  attractions of West Virginia: a low crime rate, "the warmth of its people" and  a surfeit of available space.  </P> <P> Space is important, say Japanese educational experts. Private universities in  Japan, especially those in Tokyo, are hamstrung by lack of room to build new  classrooms and libraries.  </P> <P> There is also the delicate matter of how much profit Teikyo expects from its  U.S. ventures. Gail Chambers, a University of Rochester researcher currently  studying U.S.-Japanese educational operations, says "the economic motive is  present" in every case she has examined.  </P> <P> Whatever Teikyo's motives, a number of influential U.S. figures, including Sen.  Jay Rockefeller (D-W.V.), are more than pleased. Rockefeller, who studied in  Japan and speaks some Japanese, promoted Salem's advantages to the Teikyo  representatives as the deal was being negotiated. He has credited Okinaga with  "furthering international understanding through educational opportunity."  Rockefeller, West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton and Okinaga will receive  honorary degrees from the university at commencement exercises this spring.  </P> <P> At the same time, as is the case with most high-profile Japanese investments,  some Americans are suspicious -- of the merger and of Teikyo's intentions.  Clyde V. Prestowitz Jr., a former U.S. trade official and author of the book  "Trading Places: How We Allowed Japan to Take the Lead," said that while he  agrees that educational exchanges have value, "you don't have to buy a college  to send students abroad." An aide to Sen. John H. Heinz III (R-Pa.), who has  also been critical of the U.S. trade relationship with Japan, said the merger  "is significant in a symbolic sense, like the purchase of Rockefeller Center."  </P> <P> But President Ohl, who once studied philosophy under Reinhold Niebhur and Paul  Tillich, sees experiments like Salem as the antidote for such skepticism. "The  only way you're going to counter fear, in either country, is by learning to  work with each other," he said.  </P> <P> To ensure as much cultural integration as possible, all students will have to  share common dormitories, although incoming Japanese will be sectioned-off  during an initial semester of intensive English instruction.  </P> <P> Next month, Salem Teikyo will embark on a three-semester system, characteristic  of Japanese universities. The school will also introduce a modular program --  students focused exclusively on one subject area for three weeks at a time.  "The curriculum is designed to break down barriers that usually exist in  study-abroad programs," Ohl said.  </P> <P> Emi Hirano, one of a handful of Japanese already on campus, said her incoming  classmates might be in for a bit of shock. "I couldn't believe it, this place  is nothing but hills," said Hirano, a freshman. The school's equestrian  program, of all things, was what won her affection. "In Tokyo," she said, "it  is too expensive to own a horse."  </P> <P> What encourages Ohl is how well Hirano and the other Japanese students seem to  be getting along with the Americans. "One of the Japanese girls even has an  American boyfriend," he said, somewhat proudly. But Hirano knows that the  social dynamics could quickly change when the first large contingent of  students begins to arrive from Japan. "I hope the U.S. kids don't become  afraid," she said.  </P> <P> Ohl said he anticipated some student resentment, in part because academic  standards have stiffened. The average SAT score at Salem is an undistinguished  700; the goal is to raise that as much as 400 points over the next four years.  </P> <P> "Unfortunately," Ohl acknowledged, "many of those already here will not feel  comfortable with the new standards, or with the increasing  internationalization. That should change with future classes."  </P> <P> In town, the joke making the rounds a few months ago had to do with the way one  pronounces Teikyo -- "as in take-you," said one Salem wag. Mayor Donna Stewart  has worked hard, asking people to be patient: "The biggest fear I have is that  people will not take the time to understand people who don't speak English  well." Expectations that the coming of the Japanese will trigger a boom in the  local real-estate market have not yet materialized; informed sources report  more talk than sales activity.  </P> <P> In fact, townspeople seem less concerned than some Washington pundits. Retiree  Harry Oberstadt, who fought in the South Pacific in World War II, asked, "We're  sending our kids over there and everywhere else, so why shouldn't they come  here?"  </P></p>

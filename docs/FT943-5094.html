			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Mortgage figures highlight uncertainty The uncertainty over the recovery in the mortgage market was highlighted yesterday with the publication of seasonally adjusted figures showing new gross and net mortgage lending in July lower than in June. Figures released by the Bank of England painted a similarly bleak picture for new loans approved - which are seen as an important forward indicator as they are reflected in lending undertaken in the following few weeks. The approvals in July fell compared with approvals in June. However, the monthly statistics - which include banks, building societies and centralised lenders operating through intermediaries rather than through branch networks - did suggest some slight advance over the position last summer. New gross lending in July totalled Pounds 4.54bn, some 3.5 per cent lower than the Pounds 4.71bn undertaken in June, though just higher than the Pounds 4.57bn carried out in July last year. New net lending - which deducts from the gross lending the loans redeemed by the borrowers - came to Pounds 1.52bn in July, compared with Pounds 1.79bn in June and Pounds 1.37bn in July 1993. Within the generally flat levels of lending, the figures also reveal a strengthening of building societies' market share at the expense of banks. Last summer the banks were competing aggressively in the market, particularly with fixed-rate mortgages. But societies have since been regaining market share, both through their own fixed-rate loans and, more recently, through ranges of 'cashback' offers and discounted variable rate mortgages. Within the overall figure of 79,000 loans approved to a value of Pounds 4.32bn in July, societies accounted for 49,000 and Pounds 2.89bn of the total. In terms of values of loans approved, societies have increased their market share by almost 15 per cent from the Pounds 2.52bn they accounted for in July last year. In the same month, they accounted for 45,000 of the total 79,000 loans approved. The totals for loans approved in July this year are both lower than the comparable figures of 84,000 and Pounds 4.92bn for June.</p>

The future of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a  Croat-Bosniak federation, a possible confederation between  Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina -- these are the topics of our  conversation with President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency  Alija Izetbegovic. Mr. Izetbegovic, good evening.    [Izetbegovic] Good evening to you.    [Ladisic] There have been no, or at least there have been  very few reactions from Sarajevo to the Washington preliminary  agreement. How would you personally comment on it?    [Izetbegovic] I think that this was a good agreement. Of  course, I was in touch with Haris Silajdzic while the  negotiations were in progress in Washington. I spoke with him  two or three times a day. The preliminary agreement that was  reached there was reached with my full agreement. If you ask me  about my comment, it is positive.    [Ladisic] Did you speak with the people in Sarajevo, with  your closest associates, with commanders of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army? What are their comments on the  preliminary Washington agreement?    [Izetbegovic] I followed the press, I heard some statements.  I can say that the news on the agreement was met with support,  globally speaking. Of course, there are skeptics, while some  witty people have labelled it as a marriage of convenience, not  a marriage of love. But I wonder now whether there are some  political marriages that are not of convenience, and people say  that marriages of convenience are sometimes more stable. People  believe that both sides have done well out of this and I share  that opinion.    [Ladisic] It has been said quite frequently that the  Washington agreement was extorted from you and President  Tudjman. Was the agreement really signed out of political  interests, or is it an agreement signed due to the pressure and  threats coming from the U.S. Government or some Islamic  countries?    [Izetbegovic] Of course, our interests are at work here. But  I could not say that it was extorted. I would like to remind  you that I put forward a similar, identical proposal last  summer. I think that it was mentioned in your press. My  proposal then was a joint Muslim-Croat state between the Sava  and the sea, without any borders, perhaps with cantons.  Therefore, this agreement was not extorted as far as I am  concerned. Of course, we saw our interests in that.    [Ladisic] What remains now is to sign this historic  agreement, as we see it here in Croatia, namely on the  Croat-Bosniak federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a  confederation of that Bosnia-Herzegovina with the Republic of  Croatia. Does this represent a just end to the war in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] I would be very happy if this were the end of  the war. Maybe it is the end of the war. I hope it is the end  of the war. I want to believe that this is the end of the war  in Muslim and Croat-populated areas. But the end to the war now  depends on the Serb side. You used an attribute -- a just end  -- I would say that this is a just end to the war. However, as  I said, the end of the war on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina now depends on the Serb side.    [Ladisic] Before we reach this issue concerning relations  with the Serb side in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I would like to ask  you: Central Bosnia, Mostar, access to the sea, these were the  central issues; have these issues been resolved by the  preliminary agreement or do you still deem them as issues that  could jeopardize the entire accord?    [Izetbegovic] This has not been completely resolved. To our  knowledge, the resolution of these problems is forthcoming, they  might be discussing this today, but I do not believe this could  bring the agreement into question. You mentioned three problems  -- Mostar, central Bosnia, the sea. I think Mostar has been  temporarily resolved with the European Union's [EU]  administration, therefore, the EU would be in temporary control  of the city, I believe that this solution is good although it is  certainly not a final solution.    The issue of access to the sea -- I believe this has been  solved through the concept of the federation by which the  federation has an outlet to the sea via Neum and has the right  to use the port at Ploce. Reciprocal arrangements have been  made in this case that envisage free flow of goods and people  from Croatia through the territory of the federation and, of  course, the free flow of goods and people from the federation to  Ploce. This would resemble a situation where there are no  borders.    So, I think this issue has been resolved, but what remains  is  the extremely delicate issue of central Bosnia. As far as I can  gather, there are some ideas according to which this should be  resolved within the central Bosnian canton, some subcantons, in  any case, I believe that this remains the most delicate issue  and this will be discussed today and tomorrow, so I think we  will know more tomorrow evening. That is what I expect.    [Ladisic] Speaking of central Bosnia, please tell us  something about what you believe to be the core issue in central  Bosnia -- is the issue in question demarcation?    [Izetbegovic] You know, there is a complete ethnic balance  here. Moreover, the population is mixed to the point of being  topsy-turvy. Subsequently, some towns with a predominantly  Muslim population have come closer to Herzegovina and, in  contrast, areas with a predominantly Croat population like  Busovaca and Novi Travnik have become closer to the Zenica  region, therefore there has been a jumble. This could have been  the motive for the conflict between us and the Croats, but the  main reason why I proposed a joint state this summer was because  I felt we would be fighting over central Bosnia -- fighting  hopelessly and without any results. I wanted to avoid this  conflict. Of course, this problem has resurfaced in a new  constellation of circumstances, in a new atmosphere, so I expect  us to find some kind of solution. As I said, solutions have  been proposed in the form of sub-cantons. This might be a  solution, but let us wait a day or two -- our negotiators are  twisting their brains over this issue in Vienna right now.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, you have said that the  crisis was most difficult in central Bosnia and Mostar where  most of the combat took place. Are you optimistic, bearing in  mind that the cease-fire has been in place in those areas for  more than a week?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, I am optimistic. Two days ago I was still  a bit wary and then I saw a TV report showing the withdrawal of  heavy weapons. You probably saw that report too. It was then  that I was certain that both sides were serious in their  intentions. Of course, we mostly worried about the Croat side.  At that moment I understood that the Croat side too wanted the  agreement to be implemented and that is why I am optimistic.    [Ladisic] How would you assess the cooperation between the  two army commanders? It seems that General Rasim Delic and  General Ante Roso played a key role in connection with this  cease-fire agreement.    [Izetbegovic] I think that we were fortunate to have two  reasonable men in this role. I believe that they respect each  other as men and as soldiers, and I believe that they had no  hidden agenda. I believe we have been fortunate that the two of  them discussed the delicate military problem. Many unresolved  issues remain in this field. You know that we still have to  resolve the issue of a future joint army, joint commands; how to  unify units which have been fighting each other until recently.  I believe that Generals Delic and Roso will be able to resolve  this problem with our full support of course.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, after a long time we have  an  opportunity to discuss the reasons for the clashes, particularly  in central Bosnia and in Mostar. The leader of the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Mate Boban, resigned and many in the world  saw this as a major Croat concession in their negotiations with  the Muslims.    [Izetbegovic] I believe that Boban's resignation was  necessary in this case. I have to be blunt when I tell you that  our public is justified when it considers him to be an author  and initiator of ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina. On the  other hand you said that he was the leader of Bosnian Croats.  Many of our Bosnian Croats do not think that he was the leader  of Bosnian Croats; maybe he was the leader of one-third of  Bosnian Croats. When I take into account the sentiments of  Croats in central Bosnia, northern Bosnia, Posavina, or Tuzla, I  could not say that he has any support and that he could win any  kind of elections. Anyway, he was not elected leader of Bosnian  Croats, he did not pass the test of elections.    [Ladisic] But, President Izetbegovic, do you see a problem  in  statements such as: There are no Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which was said by Arif Pasalic; or, We should have reached an  agreement with the Serbs, which was said by Ejup Ganic; or, The  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army must have a naval base in Neum, which  was said by Semso Tankovic, chairman of the Party of Democratic  Action for Croatia. These statements triggered off very  tempestuous reactions in Croatia and, I believe, among the  Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Izetbegovic] First of all, a distinction ought to be made  between statements and deeds. When I spoke earlier about Mate  Boban, I spoke about his deeds, about his actions, not his  statements. There have been very many statements which I may  have not liked, but they did not inflict any direct damage on  anyone. As regards statements that you have just mentioned, I  am completely sure about one thing: Ganic never said that we  needed an alliance with the Serbs. You have to check on that.  Please look for it somewhere. I have never heard such a  statement, although I know very well what Ganic says, as we are  very close associates. I know what he thinks, and therefore I  know what he might say. The other two statements are probably  authentic. However, we forbade our soldiers, not only because  of Pasalic's statement, but also because of others, to make  political statements. They are not going to do that any more.  As far as Semso Tankovic's statement is concerned, he is a  citizen of Croatia, it is true that he is a Bosnian by birth, a  very good friend and associate of mine, but I do not think that  his statement that we need to have some kind of naval base in  Neum is a dangerous one. That would be a navy of the future  federation. This should be perceived in that way.    [Ladisic] I believe that this occasion gives us an  opportunity to openly show many cards. As regards Mr. Ganic's  statement, it was taken from the foreign press. But, generally  speaking, do you think that the time for normalization has come  and that we should turn toward the future and that we should try  to build this trust together?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, if somebody asked what I ought to tell  both ours and the Croatian public, even though you did not  explicitly ask me to do that, but this is how I understand your  question, then I would say that we should all look toward the  future, rather than look back into the past. The past is  teeming with bad things, particularly dating from recent times,  while the future offers a ray of light. I think that we should  turn toward the future, and look with optimism toward our future.    [Ladisic] If the agreement is signed, Croatia expects  support  for the reintegration of its occupied areas and political,  security, and economic aid from the West. What has been  promised to you, President Izetbegovic, what do you expect from  this federation in Bosnia and the confederation with Croatia?    [Izetbegovic] I must tell you that this agreement is a  result  of our interests -- they did not have to bribe us or pay us to  conclude it. However, they told us, the most authoritative  instances -- they told both us and Croatian officials, I believe  they told President Tudjman -- that Bosnia-Herzegovina and  Croatia will have an open door to all forms of European  integration. Step by step, of course, but this door will remain  open and we will receive lavish support for the reconstruction  of the war-ravaged parts of the country. We will receive  financial aid. They were unequivocal in this. Of course, we  Bosnians were told that Western forces would come and help out  in the implementation of what has been agreed.    [Ladisic] Croatian President Tudjman said the Croat-Bosnian  [Muslim] agreement was not a military alliance aimed against the  Serbs. Do you see a solution and an end to the war without the  military defeat of the Serb army in Bosnia-Herzegovina and a  return of the occupied territories to Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] I could join President Tudjman in his  assessment that this is not aimed against the Serbs. This  statement is well- grounded and appropriate. And speaking of  this -- the military defeat of the Serbs and the recovery of our  territories -- the military defeat of the Serbs is desireable  but not essential for the establishment of peace. However, the  return of occupied territories is both desirable and essential.  This is a condition we will not give up.    [Ladisic] Has the world guaranteed in any way that these  Serb-occupied territories could be recovered?    [Izetbegovic] There have been no direct guarantees. You  know, however, that the draft federation agreement prescribes in  one of its first articles that the federation is to be created  on territories populated by a predominantly Croat and Muslim  population. This was done in the presence of the Americans,  with the knowledge of the west Europeans -- everybody welcomed  this agreement in principle -- that is to say, that this  envisages the return of all territories, Muslim and Croat.  Therefore, this is not explicit, but it is implicit.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, the federation agreement  has  also been offered to the Serb side these days, what do you  expect from this offer -- will the Serbs accept it, if not, if  partition takes place and Bosnia-Herzegovina is divided, how  could things be divided and what could the Serbs keep for  themselves?    [Izetbegovic] The agreement -- we have done this on numerous  occasions and I believe the Croats have done so as well -- the  agreement is also open to the Serbs. Silajdzic is in Russia  today and I think he is discussing this problem. Redman was in  Belgrade yesterday and I believe his talks with Milosevic  centered on this -- I cannot say for sure, I will be seeing him  today, he is expected in Sarajevo today. In any case, we are  not contemplating that the Serbs could snatch away part of  Bosnia and attach it to Serbia. We are not even dreaming of  reviewing such an idea. We are in favor of a single  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, would you agree to a single  Bosnia-Herzegovina if the Serbs consented to remaining in  Bosnia-Herzegovina but made this conditional on the creation of  a confederation between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia?    [Izetbegovic] I believe I can give a brief reply to that:  Out of the question.    [Ladisic] Does that mean that the creation of a new  Yugoslavia under pressure from the world powers would also be  out of the question?    [Izetbegovic] I think there is too much speculation  surrounding the world powers' ideas on the creation of a new  Yugoslavia. As far as I could deduce from my contacts, such an  idea is not being entertained by serious, responsible people in  the west. I am not saying that certain individuals are not in  favor of such a thing, but I believe that such an idea is not  being voiced as a realistic possibility -- I have not heard  anything to this effect so far, in any form. There has been  talk about certain forms of cooperation between the states  created on the ruins of the old Yugoslavia -- economic  cooperation -- but nobody had even hinted at the creation of  some state entity.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, one of my last questions.  Please, if I failed to ask you something, feel free to say. How  do you see the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Are we any closer  to the final peace? What do you consider to be the biggest  problem, and what do you look at with most optimism?    [Izetbegovic] I can say with certainty that with this  agreement with the Croats here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and with  the agreement between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia as states  -- these agreements have not yet been signed, ratified -- we are  on the right path to achieve it, we have definitely made a giant  step toward peace. However, the behavior of the Serb side  remains an open issue. I cannot forecast their behavior no  matter how hard I try, and therefore I could not answer whether  peace is a matter of a month or two. However, I have a sort of  premonition that by the end of late autumn peace will return to  these areas. This is more of premonition than a rational  assessment.    [Ladisic] President Izetbegovic, thank you for participating  in our Croatian TV program.</p>

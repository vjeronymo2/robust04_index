			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Tough middle age for lifetime jobs: Charles Leadbeater examines the pressures facing Japanese employment during recession I was going to call 1992 our annus horribilis,' remarked one of the Bank of Japan's senior officials, 'but I think we had better reserve that term for 1993.' It is certainly how this year will be remembered by 35 hapless older managers at Pioneer, the manufacturer of compact discs and video recorders. They have been offered an ignominious choice: accept early retirement or face the sack. Until this year, they would have counted themselves among the beneficiaries of the Japanese system of lifetime employment at large companies, which guarantees male, full-time workers continuous work until retirement at 60. The system is an exchange of loyalty for trust. After years of dedicated grind in the company cause, workers trust their employers to take care of them until retirement, even if they do barely productive jobs in their twilight years. Pioneer's move has shocked its own staff and many other companies, because it casts doubt on whether that bargain still holds good. Moreover, it is not alone in taking a tougher line with older managers. Nippon Carbon, the ceramics group, recently introduced a system under which section chiefs and general managers lose their titles once they reach the age of 57. With the title goes about a third of their pay packet. Yamaichi, the securities company, has dispatched 200 senior managers to relatively unglamorous jobs in its retail securities business. Mitsukoshi, the department store, is slimming its managerial workforce to give younger managers more influence. Other companies, particularly in the steel and electronics industries, are taking similar actions. Taken together, these moves have prompted concern that the severity of Japan's economic downturn may put its lifetime employment system under threat. But how great is that threat? Employers are under mounting pressure to reduce wage bills. Most Japanese companies are facing their third successive year of falling profits, despite cutting costs such as advertising and investment. Labour costs, which make up about 43 per cent of fixed costs for the average company, are an obvious target, particularly as many employers say they are overstaffed. According to the Bank of Japan's quarterly survey of business attitudes, conducted in November and published last month, there was a gap of 8 percentage points between the number of companies reporting an excess of labour over those reporting a shortage. Two years ago there was a gap, in favour of labour shortages, of 46 percentage points. The financial pressures upon Japanese companies have fuelled speculation that they may be on the verge of adopting more western methods of management, by aggressively cutting labour costs to raise profitability. As yet it is little more than speculation. For the most striking characteristic of the Japanese labour market during this downturn has been its resilience. In the recession of the mid-1980s, caused by the yen's appreciation, the unemployment rate rose to 3 per cent. Nine months into this downturn, unemployment has stayed constant at just over 2 per cent. The ratio of job offers to job seekers has fallen to 0.96, which means that for every 100 job seekers there are only 96 job offers. However, this is still well above the ratio's low of 0.6 in the mid-1980s. In the current downturn, 75 industries have applied for government subsidies to help them pay the wages of laid-off workers. In the recession of the mid-1980s, about 161 industries applied for such subsidies. Employers are strongly resisting reductions in their staff. Japan's low birth rate means the workforce is likely to grow by less than 1 per cent for the rest of the decade. Employers fear that, if they lay off workers now, they will face a labour shortage once the economy recovers. In an attempt to retain workers, many Japanese companies are going to extreme lengths. Nikko Securities estimates that between July and September last year 900,000 manufacturing workers, about 6 per cent of the workforce, became 'unemployed within their company'. Most are being paid to stay at home, others are doing jobs of little value within their offices or factories. Many older workers are being shuffled off to subsidiaries and suppliers. A European banker recalls how the president of a leading Japanese bank described its plans to cut employment costs without sacking anyone: 'The president explained that the bank was fortunate because it had plenty of clients who were facing a labour shortage who were only too happy to take extra staff. What that probably means is that each of the clients was told to take some of the bank's 55-year-old managers or they would not have their overdraft extended.' It is only when companies have exhausted all the alternatives - reduced overtime, cut part-time workers, frozen recruitment, transferred staff to subsidiaries, paid them for months to stay home - that they consider more radical action. Even then, moves such as Pioneer's do not mark the start of Japan's conversion to western approaches to cost cutting. The company's 35 managers represent less than 0.5 per cent of the company's workforce, and the scale of the cuts pales in comparison with the redundancies announced by some US and European companies. In December, for example, IBM, the US computer group, announced it would cut its workforce by 25,000 or 8 per cent of the total. General Motors, the US car manufacturer, and Daimler Benz, the German engineering group, have also announced big cuts. In addition, most Japanese companies regard Pioneer's move as an aberration. Nippon Steel's response was typical: 'Our policy is to protect employment. We do not fire anyone, we transfer them to new business areas.' Mr Jason James, equity analyst at James Capel, explained: 'It is very bad for a company's image to fire people, because for Japanese companies sackings are still taken as a sign that the company is in trouble.' Yet the downturn is unlikely to leave the lifetime employment system unscathed. It will undergo reform rather than revolution. The system itself is not under threat, but companies are demanding more in return for the security they provide, particularly for older, white-collar workers. In past recessions, blue-collar workers bore the main burden of adjustment. Now, early retirement programmes for managers, which were rare a decade ago, are becoming commonplace. Clarion, which makes loudspeakers for audio systems, plans to eliminate 300 jobs by March primarily by encouraging early retirement among production managers in their 40s and 50s. Sanyo Electric last month adopted what could well become a model for other companies in the hard-pressed electronics sector. Between the ages of 50 and 54, employees now have three options: remain a Sanyo employee and accept they may be compulsorily redeployed; leave Sanyo to join an affiliate at a lower salary but with a higher retirement allowance; or accept training and finance from the company to help set up their own businesses. Such schemes have two main aims. They reduce the ranks of highly paid middle managers within large companies, and provide opportunities for younger managers. They also send a powerful signal to younger workers: security of employment after 50 will increasingly depend on their performance and cannot be taken for granted. The foundations of the lifetime employment system may yet be shaken by a sharp decline into outright recession. Such a decline, brought on by a renewed collapse of the fragile Tokyo stock market, cannot be ruled out. Electronics companies, which face a prolonged slump in demand, would be particularly vulnerable. However, most companies are expecting that last year's emergency Y10,700bn (Pounds 55bn) public spending package will help revive industry. The government forecasts that the economy will recover in the third quarter of this year and achieve 3.3 per cent growth in the year to March 1994. As a result, most companies should probably be able to avoid deep cuts in their workforces. That would allow the lifetime employment system to survive, albeit in amended form. But for some poorly-performing managers, the victims of that amendment, the promise of lifelong security may prove increasingly illusory.</p>

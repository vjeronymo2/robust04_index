			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / DTI drops opposition to pension white paper A white paper on occupational pensions reform is to be released next week following resolution of a dispute between two government departments on the potential cost to employers of the reforms. Industry sources said the Department of Trade and Industry had intervened to block the release last week of the Department of Social Security's white paper, which proposes legislation which for the first time would require pension schemes to meet minimum solvency standards. The paper is expected to propose that from April 1997 all schemes have enough assets to meet minimum solvency standards. Those that do not will have until April 2002 to add additional funds. A DSS study of 500 company pension schemes found that 86 per cent would meet the proposed minimum solvency test. But the 14 per cent of schemes which do not meet the proposed standards include a significant number of large pension funds. The DTI became concerned over the costs to industry - the study showed that meeting the new solvency standards would cost industry between Pounds 1bn and Pounds 2bn because employers had not been putting enough cash into their schemes. The department was also concerned that the effect of the minimum solvency standards would be to encourage pension schemes to sell equities and buy UK gilts, hitting stockmarkets. The white paper follows recommendations from a government-appointed panel, the Pension Law Reform Committee, chaired by Professor Roy Goode. The Goode Committee had recommended that each scheme be required at all times to have 'cash equivalents' - at least enough assets to provide each member with his or her full benefits earned retrospectively if the scheme were wound up immediately. The industry objected, arguing that this would force schemes to dump equities for lower-yielding gilts and drive up the costs to employers of providing pensions. The Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries proposed a compromise which would allow schemes to take greater account of returns on equities when calculating 'cash equivalents'. Whitehall sources said that the DTI had backed down after it became convinced that the Goode Committee solvency standard had been watered down so far that any further weakening would in effect mean abandoning the measure. Research for the DSS also suggests that the UK stockmarkets would be unaffected by changes in investment strategy as fund managers adapt to the new standard. The research suggests that fund managers are likely to reduce holdings of foreign equities and increase their purchases of UK index-linked gilts.</p>

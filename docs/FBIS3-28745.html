			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday  emphasised that Taiwan's President Li Teng-hui would be paying a  private visit to Thailand that carried no official endorsement  from the Government. President Li, who was reported to have  left the Philippines for Indonesia yesterday, is expected to  arrive in Thailand on Monday on the last leg of a regional tour  that Beijing strongly opposes.    Squadron Leader Prasong said the Taiwanese president  arranged  the trip to Thailand through the private sector and that there  were no plans for him to meet Prime Minister Chuan Likphai or  other Cabinet ministers. The Foreign Minister reaffirmed  Bangkok's one-China policy but he pointed out that this did not  exclude economic relations. Thailand and Taiwan are co-members  of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.    Sqn Ldr Prasong made the points after meeting China's  Ambassador-designate Jing Guihua, who made a second trip to the  Foreign Ministry yesterday, to make sure that the Foreign  Minister had received Peking's protest note.    The envoy had delivered Peking's protest to Permanent  Secretary for Foreign Affairs Pracha Khunakasem on Tuesday, when  the Foreign Minister was absent.    The envoy presented his credentials to His Majesty the King  yesterday afternoon, after meeting Sqn Ldr Prasong.    "I informed him [the Chinese envoy] that the Thai Government  did not issue the invitation, and that the Foreign Ministry had  received no communication on the matter," Sqn Ldr Prasong sald.    "They [the Taiwanese] contacted the private sector," he  said.  Thailand broke off diplomatic relations with Taiwan when it  normalised relations with China on July 1, 1975.    "We respect the agreement and we have a one-China policy,"  Sqn Ldr Prasong said. Thailand did not intervene in the  political problems between China and Taiwan which were "their  internal affair". But economic relations were a different  matter, especially when Thailand and Taiwan were co-members of  APEC. Exchanges of visits for talks on economics and trade were  "possible".    China is also a member of the 15-nation grouping, which  rallies all six member states of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) and their main trading partners. In a  statement issued on Monday, Beijing warned regional states of  possible damage to "friendly relations" between them and China  if they endorse "in whatever name or form" Mr Li's visits.    Taiwan is a major investor in the region. According to  informed sources, the Taiwanese president is accompanied by  First Lady Cheng Wen-hui. Foreign Minister Fredrick Chien,  economic planning agency chief Vincent Siew, deputy secretary to  the president Tai Jui-ming and Nationalist Party  secretary-general Hsu Hsui-teh.    Chinese President and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin is  reported to be planning visits to Thailand and other ASEAN  member states in the second half of this year.</p>

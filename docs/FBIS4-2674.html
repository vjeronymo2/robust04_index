			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, 12 Apr (XINHUA) -- Mongolian Minister  of External Relations Tserenpiliyn Gombosuren, who just returned  from a formal visit to China, pointed out that developing  relations with the PRC is one of the most important policies of  the Mongolian Government.    Gombosuren made the above remarks during an interview this  evening with a reporter of the Mongolian Television Station.    He said establishing good relations with China and Russia is  an important step for Mongolia to improve its external  environment in order to survive and develop.    He also said: Taiwan is a part of China and is not an  independent political entity. Mongolia develops economic,  trade, and cultural relations with Taiwan just in the way it  develops relations with other Chinese provinces and cities. He  emphatically pointed out that this is a long-held stand of the  Mongolian Government.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Indonesian </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Nusantara Aircraft Industry (IPTN) needs about  500 billion rupiahs in order to expand its plant in Bandung by  500 hectares. However, making that project a reality is hampered  by the problem of procuring land. A BISNIS source at IPTN  revealed that the funding would be used to expand the plant area  and to procure equipment and general facilities, including  employee housing. "Due to growth in the demand for aircraft and  in the number of employees the present site is no longer  sufficient," he said here yesterday.    However, he believes that making the project a reality will  be hampered by the difficulty of finding 500 hectares of land in  Bandung. IPTN Inc Director of Planning Yuliswar said that  Minister of Research and Technology J. B. Habibie has requested  the 500 hectares. As of now, he said, IPTN management has only  gotten about 300. He denied that it is difficult to find land  because of land speculation. "Procuring land is not a problem.  It's true there's a problem of price. The price of land in  Bandung is certainly higher."    B.J. Habibie, Managing Director of IPTN Inc, has expressed  his concern about increased land speculation. He said that the  problem is how to find additional sites for IPTN Inc expansion  in Bandung because of speculation. "That's why I'm asking  provincial heads to stop it. Speculation clearly hampers  investment and economic development," he said at the end of last  year.    Even though land speculation throws a shadow over the site  problem, Yusliswar is optimistic that it can be solved. The IPTN  Inc expansion will occupy an area adjacent to the old site.  "This project will be carried out in stages, in line with  production of the N-250 aircraft, due to start in 1995," he told  BISNIS and REPUBLIKA yesterday.    Plans are for a first-year production capacity of six N-250  aircraft. Capacity will be increased to 52 per year in line with  growth in demand. Due to additional capacity and the number of  employees, now 15,000, the present 70-hectare site is no longer  sufficient.    Yuliswar also revealed that although the allocation of PMP  [Government Capital Participation] funds for BUMNIS [Strategic  Industry State-Owned Corporations] is decreasing, the government  has guaranteed that R&amp;D funds and initial working capital  will  be made available to develop the N-250. "I don't know exactly  how much. It will clearly support IPTN Inc's production  operations, especially for first deliveries of the N-250 in  1997," he said. He did not say whether funds for changing the  aircraft's design are included in the R&amp;D funds which the  government has guaranteed.    At the same time, Hari Laksono, Director of the Universal  Maintenance Center (UMC-IPTN), said that as part of the effort  to increase local content, IPTN Inc is pioneering the production  of aircraft engine components.</p>

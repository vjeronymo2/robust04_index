			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 10 Apr (NOTIMEX) -- Peruvian President Alberto  Fujimori today guaranteed that the rules of the game will be  "clear" for next year's general elections and said that he has  still not decided on whether he will run for reelection.    "I speak as President of the Republic Alberto Fujimori, not  as a candidate," the president said in an interview in Sunday's  "Counterpoint" political program aired on Channel Two. "The  electoral atmosphere is premature and many things are said that  deep down are demagogic," Fujimori replied when asked why the  opposition was so distrustful of fraud.    Fujimori stressed that during his tenure three elections  have  been held (legislative, municipal, and the referendum on the new  Constitution). "These elections have been open, unquestionable,  and approved by international observers and we will continue  down this line," Fujimori assured. The president said that  "there must be guarantees that here in Peru free elections will  be held, with the presence of international observers" and added  that "the people are the only ones who should decide."    According to Fujimori, Javier Perez de Cuellar is "an  outstanding citizen who has given Peru a good name with his  work" as UN secretary general. Several conservative opposition  sectors have said that their possible candidate, capable of  defeating Fujimori, is the former UN general secretary. Even  though Perez de Cuellar has not confirmed his candidacy for the  1995 elections, the Peruvian president "welcomed the virtual  candidate."    Fujimori stressed that elections can be held in Peru because  "now there is democracy and security" and he refused the  adjective "authoritarian" to describe his regime.    A national poll released today confirmed that there are  significant differences regarding the approval of Fujimori's  term and citizens' choice in the next election. According to a  poll by Imasen, in Lima and the provinces 57.7 percent of the  population back the president's term, with 31.8 percent  disapproving. If the elections were held tomorrow and the  candidates were Fujimori and Perez de Cuellar, the president  would get 35.1 percent of the votes and Perez de Cuellar 32.9  percent. The study disclosed that the distance between the  president and the former UN secretary general is lessening and  in the provinces the president leads by a much smaller margin.    In a runoff election, Perez de Cuellar would win in Lima  with  45.7 percent of support, and Fujimori receiving 44.1 percent. In  the country's interior, the former diplomat would win in 10 of  the 11 cities polled.    Fujimori said "that human rights in Peru are guaranteed" and  added that the subversive elements are tried effectively, in  accordance with his government's anti-terrorist legislation.  The Peruvian president said that the Maoist Shining Path group  is "totally weakened" and that the desertion of its members who  are still in the country is "massive."    The fight against terrorism will continue with the same  force, without neglecting the fight against drug trafficking.  "Without the national pacification, democracy could not have  been built as we are doing," Fujimori stressed.</p>

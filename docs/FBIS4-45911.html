			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Development of Fast Breeder Reactor Must Be Stopped at </F> Once"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  denounces the South Korean puppets' move to develop a fast  breeder reactor under the nuclear umbrella of the United States,  secure larger quantities of plutonium and manufacture nuclear  weapons with it, as an unpardonable archcrime against the nation.    The news analyst says:    The white paper on the development of a fast breeder reactor  by the South Korean puppets, which was recently issued by the  South Korean National Democratic Front, shows how desperately  the South Korean puppets work to develop nuclear weapons.    The South Korean puppets claim that the fast breeder reactor  is the "most efficient source of energy" and its development is  needed for "economic value." Their third-rate trick, however,  cannot work.    They are desperately working to develop this type of reactor  because they scheme to produce large quantities of nuclear  weapon- grade plutonium and increase the amount of its  stockpiling through legitimate import of plutonium under the  pretext of feeding the fast breeder reactor.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique must close down the  pressurized heavy water reactor and the multi-purpose reactor  and immediately stop the development of a fast breeder reactor  before it meets with a bitterer denunciation and rejection at  home and abroad as a nuclear maniac.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article: "Effectively Broaden Economic Cooperation and </F> Relations With Foreign Countries"]    [Text] After we began implementing the policy of broadening  economic cooperation and relations with other countries as well  as international organizations having good intentions toward our  country -- regardless of the differences in political and social  systems, by late 1993 it was reported that foreign and Lao  business ventures had invested in 421 projects in our country  with a total capital of U.S. $585 million. Of the said amount of  investment, more than U.S. $91 million has come from domestic  financial sources. The said investment was reported to be  carried out in three sectors, namely, agriculture, industry, and  services. Of the three sectors, 187 projects with a capital of  U.S. $265 million are in the service sector; 159 projects with a  capital of U.S. $217 million are in the industry sector; and 75  projects with a capital of more than U.S. $103 million are in  the agriculture sector. Compared with the previous years, the  amount of investment capital in the aforementioned fields has  increased markedly.    We can see that all this reflects an important achievement  our party and government have made in implementing the policy of  broadening economic cooperation and relations with foreign  countries. It appears that the implementation of this policy has  been effectively carried out with some modifications, thus  attracting more and more foreign business interests to invest in  Laos. Under the terms of this policy, the equitable sharing of  legitimate benefits will be fully ensured for all the parties  concerned. Most of these investment projects are in the fields  of agriculture and forestry, electricity production, and  infrastructure for export-oriented goods production. In addition  to affirming the merit of our policy of broadening economic  cooperation and relations with foreign countries, the  achievement of attracting more foreign investment to our country  also serves to enhance the role and prestige of our party and  government in the international arena.    Nonetheless, it can be said that most of the foreign  investment in our country is mainly concentrated in the service  sector. With regard to this trend, many commentators, especially  our economic experts, have cautioned that our efforts to attract  foreign investment to transform the natural and semi-natural  economy into a goods production economy in our country starting  from agricultural and forestry development may be misdirected.  Superficially speaking, this assumption has a certain degree of  rationality in it. However, we must learn more lessons on this  from the neighboring countries.    In the meantime, we cannot afford to be too theoretically  rigid in our economic principles. Everyone must agree that the  building of our country along the correct policy of the party  and government requires a large amount of investment. Therefore,  given the present economic, social, and cultural circumstances  and the status of our country, it is appropriate that we try to  attract foreign investors to bring capital into our country for  investment here. At the same time, we must always keep in mind  that proper facilities must be available to serve the service  business operations in our country, such as trading and tourism.  A network of needed infrastructure, such as roads,  telecommunications facilities, means of transport, hotel  accommodation, services, and financial outlets must be set up.  Many economic experts and public figures frequently point out  that a number of investment projects in Laos proposed by foreign  businessmen have been delayed. This is because the requests to  implement some investment projects here are often submitted to  our authorities by brokers, who subsequently sell the permits  granted to them to foreign investors for profit. Such practices  naturally result in delays in the implementation of the projects  concerned, thus causing losses to both our country and the  foreign investors, and discouraging prospective foreign  enterprises from making investment here. In addition, the  implementation of some investment projects has not been carried  out in earnest, thereby causing numerous difficulties to our  management sector. On average, most [foreign investment]  projects, be they small, medium, or large, have been smoothly  and effectively executed on the basis of mutual trust, equality,  friendship, and mutual benefits.    At the moment, preparations are being made for the launching  of a number of major investment projects, such as the  construction of hydroelectric, cement, and other plants. Relying  on past experience, our authorities and cadres concerned are  energetically and comprehensively carrying out the necessary  work to ensure that all management loopholes are completely  plugged so that no losses will ensue to the investors and our  country.    To continue broadening our economic cooperation and  relations  with foreign countries effectively, we must first pay special  attention to our management work to ensure that the party's and  government's policy on promoting foreign investment in various  forms of lasting cooperation for mutual benefits is effectively  implemented, especially in the fields of agriculture and  forestry, hydropower production, and infrastructure construction  for export- oriented goods production, thereby creating more  financial resources for our national development.    To effectively achieve this goal, we must adopt more  essential regulations to be included in the law on foreign  investment and implement necessary policies with a view to  creating favorable conditions for foreign investors. In  addition, we must issue more documents with accurate investment  data for use by foreign business enterprises. Our service  management style must also be improved in order to promote  competent businessmen and eliminate brokers. We must rigorously  encourage all the services concerned to provide needed  conditions to foreign investors.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A WORLD OF MIXED-UP MEDIA IN EGOYAN'S 'SPEAKING PARTS'  </P> <P> In Atom Egoyan's "Speaking Parts" (at the Monica 4-Plex), people don't touch;  they watch each other on video.  </P> <P> The ideas suggest Steve Soderbergh's "sex, lies, and videotape," but here,  Egoyan carries them further. Lost in a strange metallic world of hotel  corridors, universal TV hookups and conference rooms, video stores and empty  boudoirs, his characters struggle soporifically in a voyeuristic web. Orgies  are filmed; even a local cemetery has a mausoleum stocked with video screens  and tapes of the dead.  </P> <P> It's a viscid, gelatinously shiny realm in which all movement is gluey and  detached, in which the only on-screen sex occurs through a video-phone hookup.  Every scene is darkened, as if to accommodate a TV set. Characters watch each  other and themselves on VCRs and, when they dream, they start hallucinating  about video images that are watching them back.  </P> <P> For Soderbergh, videotape could filter out lies; for Egoyan, it breeds them.  The movie's paragon of evil is a producer-director (David Hemblen) who destroys  the genuine emotion in the script he's bought by insisting on a spurious TV  talk show scene. He's a malign talking head on huge screen hookups, dictating  and destroying by remote control. Through this electronic maze, no one feels or  really touches until the very last second -- and that moment is played more  like a melancholy coda to a portrait of a world gone askew.  </P> <P> Faking it is part of the film's subject, also the trap into which it  occasionally falls. In interviews, Egoyan -- like Soderbergh, a great favorite  of Wim Wenders -- has criticized the "misuse" of film or video as "instruments  to enshrine sentiment," and said: "Nothing is more artificial than traditional  realism." Yet enshrining sentiment -- sentimentality, actually -- is exactly  what he's used his instruments for here. And his spare, flashily cryptic  dialogue is closer to the artificiality of bad movie naturalism than to the  high allusive literacy he probably wants.  </P> <P> Egoyan's style is too cool and detached to appear overtly sentimental, but his  material is impregnated with a kind of syrupy self-pity: pared-down soap opera.  A very bad commercial TV-movie could have emerged from "Speaking Parts' " plot  line. The discarded writer is a woman, Clara -- played with fine, naked-nerve  emotionalism by Gabrielle Rose -- whose brother died after saving her life with  a lung transplant. Clara replaces him with a young actor, Lance (Michael  McManus), whom she hires to play the brother in her teleplay; Lance is a hotel  employee adored from afar by a young chambermaid (Egoyan's girlfriend, Arsine  Khanjian), who collects all his non-speaking parts on videotape.  </P> <P> The women feel and respond; the men are cold voyeurs. And all of them -- these  beautiful youngsters wandering disconsolately through corridors of dread in the  post-video emotional holocaust -- are ruled by a Big Video Daddy and Mama: the  producer and the hotel head housekeeper. This whole idea is deeply sentimental.  And since Egoyan seems prey to the same vices he attacks -- or, more  accurately, nibbles at -- one wonders if the manipulative, detached video store  owner (played by Tony Nardi, who suggests a younger Peter Coyote) is an ironic  self-portrait. In the end, "Parts" seems a narcissistic movie. It may be only  partial self-kidding that Egoyan's company is called Ego Film Arts Inc.  </P> <P> Still and all, "Speaking Parts" (Times-rated Mature for partial nudity, video  sex and language) is subtle, thoughtful stuff for serious filmgoers. It's full  of ideas, disturbing metaphors for today's society, and it's subtly made by a  promising filmmaker with an intelligent vision. It's also a drowsy, despairing  film, in which we and the characters seem to be viewing everything through the  other side of an aquarium wall. Egoyan builds up to a paroxysm in which every  kind of film or video stock is intercut wildly together: an orgasm of mixed  media. But, though Egoyan's characters may never crystallize into flesh and  blood, that's part of his point. Video sex is the crucial coupling in his  vague, nightmare world, the deadly climax of the Video Age.  </P></p>

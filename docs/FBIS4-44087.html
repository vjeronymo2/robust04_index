			<p>BFN     [Text] Corfu, Greece, June 24 (AFP) -- French Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur had his first meeting here Friday [24  June] with Italy's new premier, Silvio Berlusconi.    French diplomats said the meeting had "gone well." It dealt  with the contest to name a successor to European Commission  president Jacques Delors, and with France's military  intervention in Rwanda.    They said Balladur had been "agreeably surprised" by the  performance of the Italian Government formed by Berlusconi in  April, but shared general concern at the presence in his  coalition cabinet of five neofascist members.    Berlusconi called the meeting "very cordial," and said he  had  raised the possibility of another meeting between the two men.    Earlier on the sidelines of the summit, Berlusconi had talks  with British Prime Minister John Major. The two men agreed to  meet again soon, but did not announce a date.</p>

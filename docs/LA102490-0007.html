			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA COUNTY SUPPORTS ALLIANCE  </P> <P> Ventura County officials agreed Tuesday to support an effort by near-bankrupt  Butte County to form an alliance of financially distressed counties in the  state.  </P> <P> Butte County circulated a letter earlier this month to the state's 58 counties  proposing that they join forces to share information and devise a political  strategy to get more money from the Legislature for county governments.  </P> <P> "We're not bankrupt, but we need to lend our support to those counties that  are," Supervisor Maggie Erickson said.  </P> <P> Although not bankrupt, Ventura County has had serious budget problems. State  funding cuts of about $10 million last summer made it tough to budget money for  local programs.  </P> <P> "We're on the same eventual path as Butte County, but there are counties that  are much closer," said Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative  officer. "Eventually every county will be there unless things change."  </P> <P> The letter, sent by Butte County Supervisor Ed McLaughlin, said participants  will be asked to attend a meeting to "plan a political strategy as how best to  achieve a restructuring of the ineffective relationship that now exists between  California and its counties."

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO PEPPERDINE PLAYERS SELECTED IN BASEBALL DRAFT;  </P> <P> PRO BASEBALL: MONTREAL PICKS SHORTSTOP MARTIN AND THE NEW YORK YANKEES SELECT  RIGHT FIELDER LEACH.  </P> <P> The telephones didn't stop ringing at the homes of Pepperdine University  baseball players Chris Martin and Jalal Leach.  </P> <P> Martin was flooded with congratulatory calls after being selected in the second  round of the amateur draft this week by the Montreal Expos. Leach, however,  mostly fielded calls of condolence after being selected by the New York Yankees  in the seventh round.  </P> <P> Martin, a senior shortstop, and Leach, a junior right fielder, were projected  as third-round draftees by Baseball America.  </P> <P> "Going in the seventh round is definitely lower than I expected," said Leach,  who played at San Marin High in Novato, Calif. "I expected to go in the first  four rounds, but for some reason I slipped down to the seventh. I can't explain  it, but it's very disappointing."  </P> <P> Yankee scout Bill Schmidt called Leach to tell him about the good news, but  Leach said he was expecting to be called earlier in the morning by either the  Expos or Seattle Mariners. The Expos and Mariners had shown the most interest  in Leach the last month of the season.  </P> <P> Being drafted in the seventh round might mean Leach, 21, will return to  Pepperdine for his senior season.  </P> <P> "Unless the Yankees offer me the signing bonus I feel that I'm worth, I'll be  back at school," he said. "I was all ready to sign and start my professional  baseball career. But since I didn't go in an upper round, I now have to  reconsider things."  </P> <P> Leach wouldn't disclose how much money the Yankees would need to offer him.  </P> <P> Martin, a graduate of Hamilton High, was selected in the 25th round of last  year's draft by the Yankees. Unhappy, Martin decided to finish his college  eligibility in hopes of improving his stock with the scouts.  </P> <P> Although college juniors normally have more signing leverage than seniors, the  gamble paid off for Martin.  </P> <P> "I am very happy with the way the draft turned out," Martin said. "When  Montreal called me with the news, I had just awakened. It was a nice wake-up  call."  </P> <P> Martin, 22, said he didn't have any expectations on the amount of money he'll  receive for signing, but as a second-round choice he knows it will be a  substantial amount.  </P> <P> Last year, bonuses for the 23 first-round selections signed by major league  teams averaged $183,000.  </P> <P> Martin said he expects to sign within the next week and report to rookie league  camp later this month.  </P> <P> The draft caps a rocky month for the two Pepperdine players. The Waves failed  to win the West Coast Conference title for the first time in seven years. Their  record of 37-23 wasn't good enough to earn them a bid in the NCAA tournament  for the first time since 1984.  </P> <P> Martin, a walk-on who ended up being a three-year starter, was voted to the  first-team in the WCC and was a second-team all-American in Baseball America.  He batted .358 and had 65 runs batted in and 14 home runs. Scouts are impressed  with his speed and defensive skills. He is 6-foot and 170 pounds.  </P> <P> Leach, second-team all-WCC and a two-year starter, led Pepperdine in hitting  with a .363 average. He had 37 RBI's and five home runs. At 6-1 and 200 pounds,  scouts like his size and batting power.  </P> <P> "I've never been able to figure out the draft," Pepperdine Coach Andy Lopez  said. "The most curious things always happen. I did expect Jalal to go higher,  but maybe now we'll get him back for another season. That would be fine with  me."  </P> <P> The draft ended Wednesday, but Major League Baseball only releases first-round  selections. Pepperdine seniors Mike Truscke (catcher) and Britt Craven  (pitcher) had potential to be drafted in the lower rounds.  </P></p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading UNCERTAINTY over the full effects of changes in advance corporation tax following the Budget, along with fading hopes of a cut in interest rates in both the UK and Germany, led to a nervous trading session in the derivatives market, writes Joel Kibazo. In the futures, initial selling of the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index, which opened at 2,887, saw it dip to 2,874 by 9am. This turned out to be the low of the day, for good healthy buying soon brought about a recovery in the contract, sending it forward to trade at 2,897 by 10am. March then drifted back to the 2,885 level, where it hovered for the next few hours as strong two-way business was conducted. With a dull Wall Street having no significant effect during the afternoon, March closed at 2,886, a 3-point discount to the underlying cash market. Turnover was good and it had reached 14,214 lots by the close. In traded options, volume improved to 35,367 contracts. The Euro FT-SE 100 option was particularly busy after a leading securities house was reported to have sold the April 2,875 straddle. It saw a total of 6,890 lots, while 11,506 contracts were dealt in the FT-SE 100 option. Lasmo was the most active stock option, with 2,001 trades registered, followed by J. Sainsbury with 1,956 lots and Barclays with 1,082 contracts.</p>

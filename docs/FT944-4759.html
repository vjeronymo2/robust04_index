			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Shareholders flex a muscle on top pay: A look at the options as Whitehall ponders ways of restraining directors' salaries Ministers and officials who are looking at ways of limiting directors' salaries at public companies should pay a visit to Arlen, a tiny electrical manufacturer and distributor based in Kent. Mr Greville Howard, the new managing director of Arlen, is planning to introduce changes to the company's articles of association so that any directors' contract longer than six months will have to be approved by shareholders. Mr Howard said: 'If a director wants a contract longer than six months and some particular pay level then he is going to have to get their approval.' Arlen's move, likely to be implemented at its next annual general meeting, will be food for thought in Whitehall. After recent public anger at pay rises such as the 75 per cent awarded last month to Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, Mr John Major has asked ministers and officials to come up with ways of giving shareholders greater influence over top executives' pay. The prime minister believes that doing this will allay public suspicion that the government is unwilling to do anything to stop directors receiving big pay rises while continuing to clamp down on workforce pay. Arlen is an exception. Most companies are unwilling to give shareholders a veto on directors' pay. The issue has now been referred to the cabinet's industrial and consumer affairs committee, after Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, made clear his opposition. The practical implications of any proposed changes, including the need for legislation, are being explored by an interdepartmental working party of Treasury and DTI officials. Top of the agenda is a possible change in company law to give shareholders the right at company annual meetings to vote specifically on directors' salary packages. One idea is that shareholders would be given a summary of the main points of directors' contracts and asked to approve them if they have changed substantially from the previous year. At the moment the only means by which shareholders can publicly register their disapproval is by voting against the acceptance of a company's annual report and accounts or by voting against the election or re-election of non-executive directors, who usually set the pay of executive directors. A fund manager of a large pension fund said: 'Neither of these are very satisfactory. Non-executives only come up for re-election every three years and getting rid of them would undoubtedly cause problems for the company.' Mr Stuart Bell of PIRC, the corporate governance consultancy, agreed. He said shareholders protesting against directors' pay by voting against the annual report or re-election of non-executive directors was 'the sledge-hammer and nut syndrome'. PIRC supports giving shareholders a formal mechanism for voting against directors' pay, as does the UK Shareholders' Association, a group which represents individual shareholders. Its chairman, Mr Donald Butcher, said: 'If the government's idea is to encourage greater transparency so that shareholders have a better understanding of how much directors' are paid and also the means by which to vote against it, then that can only be a good thing.' Mr Butcher and others want to ensure that the summary of remuneration given to shareholders includes several areas which often escape attention: The cost to companies of directors' pensions entitlement. Big salary increases to directors just before they retire can result in substantial pension costs for the company and therefore the shareholders. The value of share options awarded to directors. Disclosure of options held by directors has improved recently because of accounting rule changes, but some fund managers want to see companies having to estimate a current monetary value of the options held by directors. Experts stress, however, that persuading the government to force companies to give shareholders greater information on pay, as well as the chance to vote specifically on the issue each year, is only the half the battle. Mr Butcher said: 'Motivating both institutional and private shareholders to use their votes is the real battle.' Only a small percentage of institutional fund managers in the UK routinely vote at companies' AGMs. The answer may lie in corporate governance developments in the US. A ruling by the US Department of Labour means that US pension funds may now have to exercise their votes in overseas companies in which they hold shares. Letters, Page 20</p>

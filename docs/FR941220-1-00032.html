			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The present statutory standard for BAT under 1412(b)(5) represents a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change from the provision prior to 1986, which required EPA to judge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> feasibility on the basis of ``best technologies generally available'' (BTGA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The 1986 Amendments to the SDWA changed BTGA to BAT and added the requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that BAT must be tested for efficacy under field conditions, not just under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory conditions. The legislative history explains that Congress removed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the term ``generally'' to assure that MCLs ``reflect the full extent of current technology capability'' (S. Rep. No. 56, 99th Cong., 1st Session at 6 (1985)). EPA has concluded that the statutory term ``best available technology'' is a broader standard than ``best technology generally available'' and that this standard allows EPA to select a technology that is not necessarily in widespread use, as long as its performance has been validated in a reliable manner. In addition, EPA believes that the technology selected need not necessarily have been field tested for each specific contaminant but, rather, that the operating conditions may be projected for a specific contaminant using a field tested technology from laboratory or pilot systems data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the statutory directive for setting the MCLs, EPA derives the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCLs based on an evaluation of (1) the availability and performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various technologies for removing the contaminant, and (2) the costs of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applying those technologies. Other technology factors considered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the MCL include the ability of laboratories to measure accurately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and consistently the level of the contaminant with available analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's initial step in deriving the MCL is to make an engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment of technologies that are capable of removing a contaminant from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drinking water. EPA reviews the available data to determine technologies that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have the highest removal efficiencies, are compatible with other water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment processes, and are not limited to a particular geographic region.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the removal capabilities of the various technologies, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculates the level of each contaminant that is achievable by their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application to large systems with relatively clean raw water sources. (See H.R. Rep. 1185, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. at 13 (1974); 132 Cong. Rec. S6287,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 21, 1986, statement of Sen. Durenberger.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When considering costs to control contaminants, EPA analyzes whether the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technology is reasonably affordable by regional and large metropolitan PWSs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (See H.R. Rep. No. 93&hyph;1185 at 18 (1974) and 132 Cong. Rec. S6287 (May 21,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986) (statement of Sen. Durenberger)). EPA also evaluates the total national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance costs, considering the number of systems that will have to install  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment in order to comply with the MCL. The resulting total national costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vary depending upon the concentration level chosen as the MCL. The more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stringent the MCL, the greater the number of systems that may have to install  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> BAT to achieve compliance and the higher the national cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The feasibility of setting the MCL at a precise level is also influenced by laboratory ability to measure the contaminant reliably. Because compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the MCL is determined by analysis with approved analytical techniques,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ability to analyze consistently and accurately for a contaminant at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MCL is important for enforcing a regulatory standard. Thus, the feasibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of meeting a particular level is affected by the ability of analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods to determine with sufficient precision and accuracy whether such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level is actually being achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Treatment Technologies and Costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the July 25, 1990 proposal, EPA identified two technologies as BATs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under Section 1412 of the SDWA for sulfate: Reverse osmosis (RO) and ion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exchange (IE). EPA believes that the costs of these technologies to large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems are reasonable, and that these technologies are compatible with other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water treatment processes in different regions of the U.S. These technologies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the costs of using them are described as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

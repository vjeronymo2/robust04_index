			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL ISLANDS SHUT DOWN ON 1 HIT BY WESTLAKE'S EBY  </P> <P> Channel Islands High threw some of the Marmonte League's top hitters at  Westlake's Mike Eby on Friday, but the left-hander countered with near-perfect  control in the Warriors' 1-0 win at Westlake.  </P> <P> Eby (4-0) limited Channel Islands, which entered the game with a .350 batting  average, to one hit as Westlake improved its league-leading record to 5-0.  Westlake's 11-0 start is the best in school history.  </P> <P> Eby, a 6-foot-2, 190-pound senior, needed just 60 pitches and allowed only Rich  Tepezano (double) and Ventura Juarez (walk) to reach base. Eby's fastball peaks  at 80 m.p.h., but two-thirds of his 60 pitches were strikes and he threw more  than two balls to only Juarez.  </P> <P> "He doesn't have overpowering stuff, but he spots the ball really well,"  Channel Islands Coach Don Cardinal said. "He sets the tempo and stays within  himself."  </P> <P> Channel Islands' aggressive, first-pitch batting strategy didn't hurt Eby,  either. Eight times, Eby needed only one pitch to retire a batter. He also had  a streak in which seven were retired on eight pitches.  </P> <P> "That makes things real easy and real fun," said Eby, who lowered his  earned-run average to 0.77.  </P> <P> Yet he seldom had time to relax.  </P> <P> Channel Islands' Manuel Padilla (2-2), a senior right-hander, limited Westlake  to singles by Mike Lieberthal and James Jones and an unearned run.  </P> <P> "I don't want to take any credit away from Manny, but we just can't buy a hit  right now," Coach Rich Herrera said.  </P> <P> Westlake scored in the second inning. Todd Preston walked, stole second, and  reached third on a passed ball. Preston scored one out later, when Keenan  McAluney hit a high hopper that third baseman Angel Aragon fielded but followed  with a wild throw to first.  </P> <P> Channel Islands (7-5, 1-3) threatened to score in the sixth when Juarez walked  and pinch-runner Lamont Pearson was sacrificed to second. But Eby retired the  next two hitters on four pitches.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed BZ/BA/PO: "Following the Arrest of Romano </F> Dolce. Swiss Authorities Deceived. Canton of Zurich Wants To  Take Action."]    [Text] Como/Zurich, 23 May (ATS) -- The Deputy Public  Prosecutor of Como (Italy), Romano Dolce, arrested last Friday,  has probably duped the Swiss authorities for years. To hide his  own fraudulent activities, he sent them wrong or incomplete  information. The canton of Zurich wants to clear up the affair.    Marcel Bertschi, the Zurich public prosecutor, told ATS  [Swiss Press Agency] on Monday that his office intends taking  action, confirming a report in the Swiss-German weekly newspaper  SONNTAGSZEITUNG. However, a spokesman for the Federal Justice  and Police Department said that Italy has yet to ask Switzerland  for international judicial cooperation.  <H5>  Swiss Involvement </H5>   Romano Dolce, aged 59, was arrested in Como by the town's  police. He was well-known in Switzerland. He was in fact in  charge of the investigation into the illegal trafficking of  uranium, plutonium, and red mercury between Switzerland and  Italy and between the countries of eastern Europe and Italy.    Together with five other people, including his secretary, an  officer in the "Guardia di Finanza" (the financial police), Mr.  Dolce stands accused of having participated in the illegal  trafficking of arms, explosives, and radioactive material.  According to the Como police, the network has branches in  Switzerland and eastern Europe.  <H5>  Swiss Authorities Duped </H5>   Following his arrest, the Italian authorities explained to  the press how Romano Dolce had duped his Swiss colleagues to  cover his own tracks.    In 1991, for example, the magistrate had submitted false  documents to the Swiss Justice Department concerning supposed  trading in uranium, which led to the arrest of a Swiss  businessman who was found carrying a sample of uranium. In  fact, this maneuver had concealed a larger operation, diverting  the attention of the Swiss authorities away from deals in which  Romano Dolce was involved.    Also in 1991, according to SONNTAGSZEITUNG, the magistrate  had similarly tipped off the Zurich police about a deal  involving 30 kg of uranium. In 1992, in Como, he arrested a  Swiss man carrying a sample of plutonium. The same year, a  Swiss-Italian uranium traffic was uncovered, again on a tip-off  from Romano Dolce. The material in question in fact turned out  to be totally inoffensive.    For the time being, Romano Dolce remains under arrest. He  has been put at the disposal of Brescia [Italy] magistrates  since the Como prosecutor's office is not empowered to examine  its own magistrate. The five people who stand accused with Mr.  Dolce include the Italian Aldo Anghessa (aged 50), currently  held in the La Stampa prison in Lugano.</p>

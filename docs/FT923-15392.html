			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Hammersmith Odeon in takeover deal Changing tune: Hammersmith Odeon, one of London's most famous popular music venues, will be transformed later this year in a Pounds 4m takeover deal. Rank Organisation has sold the building to Apollo Leisure and the venue, which celebrates its diamond anniversary this year, closes at the end of July. It will be refurbished before reopening under its new name, the Hammersmith Apollo. The entertainment company also owns London's Apollo Victoria Theatre and has an interest in The Dominion. Mr Paul Gregg, managing director, said yesterday: 'We intend to broaden its appeal beyond a concert venue. It can accommodate more than just rock concerts, although we want to carry on attracting the major artistes.' The group has a chain of theatres, cinemas, hotels, bingo and social clubs as well as concert venues.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average firmer as Seoul continues to improve The Nikkei 225 average saw an early loss erased and then added narrowly to Monday's gain shortly before the close. Activity was limited, as most investors remained absent, writes Robert Patton in Tokyo. The 225 average, after trading down for most of the day, edged up slightly at the finish to gain 34.81 at 19,340.47. Profit-taking, anticipated because of Monday's substantial move, never materialised. In early trading, block sales through Nikko Securities collided with index-linked buying, causing the market to slide to the day's low of 19,242.85 in the first 40 minutes of the morning. Within an hour the market rallied to a high of 19,342.85 but failed to follow through. The Topix index of all first section stocks inched up 3.63 to 1,535.49 and the capital weighted Nikkei 300 crept forward 0.83 to 283.35. First section volume, up from Monday's 206m shares, was an estimated 234m. Gainers maintained a slight lead over losers by 512 to 465, with 206 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 5.69 to 1,269.91. Most consumer electronics companies extended Monday's gains. JVC rose Y70 to Y1,430, Pioneer Y40 to Y2,830 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y10 to Y5,810, but Sony dipped Y10 to Y5,510. Sega Enterprises climbed for the eighth consecutive session, closing at Y5,570, up Y60. Nintendo also added to Monday's gain, firming Y10 to Y5,810. In Osaka the OSE average advanced 45.28 to 21,320.58 in volume of 38.2m shares. Roundup The Pacific Rim markets turned in a set of mixed per-formances. Asia Equity, however, offered evidence that the region's equity markets could put in a good year-end showing. According to precedent, claimed the broker, December and January had consistently produced the best monthly performances in a given year. One of the drags on the region this year, the number of rights issues and IPOs issued in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, was now expected to tail off, said Asia Equity, with far fewer cash calls likely, probably until the end of the first quarter of 1995. SEOUL extended its uptrend to a third straight session, on renewed demand for blue chips after their recent falls, and the composite index moved 9.98 higher to 1,075.01 in spite of Won15bn worth of sell orders by the stock market stabilisation fund. Samsung Electronics went the day's limit up, appreciating Won3,000 to Won118,500, while Kepco moved ahead Won800 to Won29,800. HONG KONG finished modestly firmer in thin trade, with sharp early losses reversed on the strength of rebounding index futures. The Hang Seng index put on 30.12 at 8,332.65, having fallen by 132 points at one stage. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.6bn from Monday's HKDollars 2.75bn. TAIPEI was unable to sustain Monday's gain as investors decided to take profits. The weighted index was down 40.75 at 6,709.47 but after a 6,674.50 low. Turnover was heavy at TDollars 87.7bn. Profit-taking was mainly in financials, which had risen for the three previous sessions - Farmers Bank lost TDollars 3.50 at TDollars 58 and Chang Hwa Bank TDollars 6 at TDollars 194. MANILA strengthened as blue chips were actively sought, and the composite index posted a rise of 32.92 at 2,655.63. Brokers commented that buying was stimulated by the release of good economic indicators in recent days. The commercial-industrial sector index saw the session's biggest gain with a rise of 48.3 to 3,919.3. KUALA LUMPUR was lower for the fourth trading day in a row amid foreign selling, particularly from Hong Kong, of Tenaga Nasional and Telekom Malaysia. The composite index ended 10.20 or 1.1 per cent down at 953.68. Telekom declined 40 cents to MDollars 17.20, still affected by rumours of a share placement, and Tenaga finished 30 cents cheaper at MDollars 10.20. SINGAPORE made little progress, with early gains pared on lack of trading interest, and the Straits Times Industrial index closed 1.50 up at 2,187.07, after reaching an intraday high of 2,196.31. SYDNEY retreated as worries resurfaced regarding the direction of commodity prices and interest rates. The All Ordinaries index shed 6.3 to 1,891.2 in volume estimated at 206.5m shares. KARACHI eased slightly amid thin volume on the first day of the new account. The KSE 100 index lost 12.81 at 2,127.44. Declining issues led advances by 200 to 109. BOMBAY was 1 per cent lower after selling by domestic and foreign mutual funds, anxious to book profits, which took the BSE-30 index 43.86 down to 4,040.37. Brokers noted that prices had fallen throughout the session, a day after the government announced the minimum bidding price of 42m shares in six state-owned companies. COLOMBO fell for the second day running, the All Share index slipping 14.05 to 1,056.93 on retail selling, with local and foreign institutions on the sidelines due to political and economic uncertainties. JAKARTA was marked down at the close, the official index dropping 4.19 to 466.39, amid worries over forthcoming new issues after the sharp fall of Indal Aluminium on its debut on Monday.</p>

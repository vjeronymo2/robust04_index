			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Union attacks Railtrack services claim The RMT transport union last night attacked a claim by Railtrack that 40 per cent of Britain's railway network will be open for services during Monday's one-day strike by signal workers. A 40 per cent service would be a considerable improvement over the 30 per cent operated during recent stoppages. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, accused the state-owned company which runs the railway track and signals network, of being 'desperately engaged in a campaign to try and talk up any return to work in a bid to demoralise members'. Railtrack said yesterday that it would run services during Monday's strike on the east-coast main line between London and Edinburgh for the first time during a strike since the signal workers' dispute started nearly 11 weeks ago. There will also be strike-day services for the first time linking London with Leeds and Sheffield. The company also said that nearly 16 per cent of signal workers turned up to work on Tuesday, the second of two strike days this week, including as many as 10 per cent of RMT signalling members. The RMT said only about 1 per cent of its 4,000 signal members had worked through the dispute on Tuesday. Mr Knapp insisted: 'Railtrack's claims for the numbers returning to work are no more than wishful thinking.' He added: 'If they put the same energy into devising a sensible pay offer for my members as they are manufacturing these figures the dispute could be over tomorrow.' The RMT released an undated memorandum from Railtrack headquarters to zonal directors of the company that shows supervisors will be re-rostered from their rest days or working nights to operate the boxes from Monday's one-day strike onwards. The instruction, which is unsigned, says the changes proposed for mobile operations supervisors will last for 'the duration of the industrial action'. Mr Knapp said yesterday that Railtrack's budget provided for a 5.1 per cent return on assets in this financial year which meant profits of Pounds 332m. He said the 5.7 per cent offered in June and withdrawn when the government said it would breach its public-sector pay guidelines would have cost Pounds 4.9m. 'Railtrack clearly can afford to meet the claim,' he said.</p>

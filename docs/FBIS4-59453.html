			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed talk] </F>   [Text] O sons of our lofty Yemeni people: The forces of  apostasy and secessionism know that their dens and houses in  beloved Aden are only a stone's throw from the rifles of the  forces of unity and legitimacy. However, the unity forces's  concern and ethical and religious commitments make them  dutybound to safeguard the lives of innocent people. The  grudges and bloody whims of these secessionist forces as well as  their Communist missiles will make our people and army of unity  and legitimacy more concerned about our fathers, mothers, and  sons in beloved Aden, al-Dali', and other areas.    Therefore, we would like to reassure our people in beloved  Aden and in other areas that the army of unity and legitimacy  does not harbor grudges or seek liquidation. This army will put  before everything the welfare of all fathers, mothers, and  defenseless children wherever they are in Yemen. Their unity  army, which fully abides by the values of Islam, will only  behead, with its iron hand, the separatists who tampered with  Aden and with all (?lofty) southern governorates and their good  people for approximately 30 years. It is a blessed advance  toward a new Yemen which is free of secessionist butchers, God  willing.    We only ask that our brother citizens in the beloved  Governorates of Aden and Lahij remain calm, do not cooperate  with the gang of apostasy and separation, and do not respond to  their separatists.</p>

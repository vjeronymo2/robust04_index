			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Nervous uncertainty hits Lib Dems PERHAPS it was the sweltering heat from the television lights, or perhaps it was the sudden uncertainty about what the next few days could bring, but there was a curious lack of celebration at the Liberal Democrats' headquarters last night. In a book-lined room high in the elegant building of the National Liberal Club, almost within sight of Big Ben, party activists and journalists milled around. Party officials swallowed their disappointment at not gaining a larger share of the vote, but seemed almost uneasy that that they may be about to take on the role of power-brokers. 'We have achieved the objective of increasing our representation in what could be a pivotal parliament,' said one official. He would not elaborate on which way his party might be prepared to tip the balance. Mr Des Wilson, campaign organiser - the strains of the campaign adding an edge to his antipodean lilt - was equally reluctant to talk about power-sharing, preferring to concentrate on his party's performance. 'It would be very difficult for one party to go it alone with the present figures,' he said. 'But I'd rather wait until tomorrow before saying any more.' 'But I think you've got to see it in context. Only two years ago we had only 6 per cent in the opinion polls but tonight we've got about one-in-five votes and at least 25 seats predicted. That's a real achievement. 'The challenge at one stage was to get through this election in what I can call a state of survival, but in fact we have come through it very strongly and could end up as the biggest third party presence since the war.' He ascribed the Lib Dems' success to 'an extraordinarily happy campaign'. Two decisions, he said, had contributed to the party's success. One was the decision, taken two years ago, to run a positive campaign, stressing the party's strengths, and to concentrate resources into campaigning in 40 crucial seats. A hush fell as the results for Torbay - one of the target seats the Lib Dems might just have gained - were announced. The hush continued as the news came through that the Conservatives had held it. The atmosphere was broken by booing as Mrs Margaret Thatcher appeared on screen. It was going to be a long and nervous night. Always the bridesmaid, but never the bride, said one observer. Last night, the Lib Dems were coming to terms with the fact that they might just be a very important bridesmaid indeed.</p>

Good evening, Mr. Terreblanche. I should perhaps  mention here that we had invited General Constand Viljoen and  Dr. Ferdie Hartzenberg of the Conservative Party. They had  initially agreed to appear, but later withdrew. Thank you for  keeping your word, Mr. Terreblanche, and coming to the studio.    Mr. Terreblanche, these are dangerous times we are living  in.  You know that as well as I do. I would, therefore, like us to  be very direct tonight, so that people can be informed. My  first question is: What do the clothes you are wearing mean?  You always wear them in public these days. Why do you go  around in a cap trimmed with gold and a camouflage uniform?    [Terreblanche] The fact is, this is the official dress of  the  AWB's Victory Commando. In the beginning we wore khaki to  identify ourselves as a movement with a distinct identity. A  few months ago this became our official dress, especially  designed for our commandos. I should mention that it is not our  general wear, but there is no reason why, when one appears on  the Agenda program, one has to be dressed in a suit. This is  the way we dress when we hold our staff meetings, when we are in  camp...    [Du Preez] Clothes make a statement. What does your outfit  say?    [Terreblanche] If these clothes could speak, they would say  there are men in South Africa, the overwhelming majority of the  Afrikanerdom, who are preparing for war, a war which is being  forced upon us. We do not want to find ourselves in the  position of the whites in the rest of Africa, the white  colonialists who were caught...    [Du Preez] But as recently as January when you were  negotiating you appeared in those clothes at the negotiations.    [Terreblanche] I have never negotiated. I have held  discussions with members of the government.    [Du Preez] But you must have been hoping there would be  peace, a settlement...    [Terreblanche, interrupting] Yes, of course. But I never  negotiated with the enemy, the African National Congress [ANC]  and the South African Communist Party [SACP]...    [Du Preez] But was General Viljoen not negotiating on your  behalf?    [Terreblanche] No, not at all.    [Du Preez] But are you not a member of the Afrikaner  National  Front [AVF]?    [Terreblanche] I am a member of the AVF, but the AWB has  always reserved the right not to be part of the negotiations.  You must understand that there are naturally small, very small  differences within the AVF, because the AVF is made up of 19  different organizations...    [Du Preez, interrupting] Are the differences really so very  small, or are they growing?    [Terreblanche] If you would allow me to continue, I will  show  you how small these differences are. The most important thing  is that the issue which brought us together remains the first,  the primary task of the AVF, and that is the achievement of a  homeland for the Afrikaner Boer nation. Some believe that this  can be achieved through negotiations. I am convinced that  negotiations with a communist can never bring peace, because  communists all over the world, in all their negotiations, have  always showed they cannot honor their word.    [Du Preez] Did you tell that to Gen. Viljoen? Did you say to  him, look, General, you are going to negotiate on my behalf, and  on my party's behalf, and I am part of your movement, but you  are negotiating with communists, and therefore you are not  negotiating on my behalf? [as heard]    [Terreblanche] Gen. Viljoen is very much aware that the AWB  does not believe in negotiations. That has been the case since  we met, and that is how we became part of the National Front.    [Du Preez] And also of the Freedom Alliance?    [Terreblanche] The fact is I have not negotiated with the  Freedom Alliance either, because it is not at all necessary.  The task of the AWB is different, a task we have set for  ourselves, years ago, 20 years ago, when we said that at some  time or another this government will capitulate, as the white  colonial regimes capitulated in Africa. We said we must  establish a people's movement whose primary task would be to see  to it that law and order is maintained when chaos and disorder  breaks out.    [Du Preez] What you are saying is that whenever Gen. Viljoen  was negotiating, or holding discussions, or whatever term one  uses -- on behalf of the AWB as a member of the AVF -- you had  no faith in all that; you are saying that there are communists  in the ANC, and you do not negotiate with communists. There  were negotiations with Inkatha and the Bophuthatswana government  and Ciskei and the Freedom Alliance, and even then you as the  AWB had no faith in the talks. Is that so?    [Terreblanche] I find it very strange that you could make  such a statement.    [Du Preez] Have I misunderstood you?    [Terreblanche] No, I think you understand me quite clearly;  and I believe I also understand you well. I want to point out,  however, that I was the first leader of an organization which  negotiated with nonwhite leaders outside parliamentary  structures -- or rather, I talked with them. I, as leader of  the AWB, invited Captain Diergaardt [member of the Democratic  Turnhalle Alliance of Namibia] to South Africa long before the  fall of South-West Africa. I signed an agreement with Mr. Musa  Myeni of Inkatha in the Transvaal. I also signed an agreement  in Vereeniging with Inkatha's Mr. Thwala. I signed an agreement  with Ciskei. As for the present negotiations, I have no part in  them, because Gen. Viljoen and Dr. Hartzenberg have taken it  upon themselves to shoulder that part of the attainment of a  homeland.    [Du Preez] And do you have confidence in them? Even today?    [Terreblanche] I do. Of course, I do.    [Du Preez] When your people booed Gen. Viljoen on 29  January,  why did no one stand up for him? There he was, standing alone,  and the people who were booing him were mainly AWB members.    [Terreblanche] It is clear you were not present. I was the  person who immediately went to his assistance. I walked to the  platform and said, the people do not understand this point, and  I then proposed that the issue be referred back to the national  assembly. I made the announcement, and the situation was  defused.    [Du Preez] Good, but now we come to an interesting point.  You say that you told the people they do not understand the  point, but this was a very important point that General Viljoen  tried to make. In reality, as I understand the situation, it is  the closest the National Front has ever come to a settlement.  In my book, as I read it from a neutral corner, this was such a  good dispensation for the National Front. Can you tell me what  your understanding is of that proposal offered by General  Viljoen when he was heckled, because that was actually a turning  point?    [Terreblanche] On that Thursday, the Thursday preceding the  Saturday of the meeting, Dr. Hartzenberg informed me of the  situation for the first time and we had the documentation at  hand. The same night I put forward the official stance of the  AWB to Dr. Hartzenberg, and that is that the requirements of the  Afrikaner National Front and my organization, the AWB, are not  being met. I shot down that document with the greatest  determination.    [Du Preez] What did that document say, Mr. Terreblanche?    [Terreblanche] That document merely said that the Afrikaner  Boer nation has a right to propagate the ideal of a homeland  after the 27 April election.    [Du Preez] As I understand it, and I stand corrected, this  document stated that the Afrikaner National Front should  participate in the nonracial election and then all the electoral  wards, or districts rather, will be counted separately and  announced. People voting for the National Front will then vote  for a manifesto which says: We want a homeland. As I  understand the document and its contents said that they will  then look at where these people are who want a homeland and how  many there are, and then a clause will be added to the  transitional constitution which says that when there is  sufficient proof of support for a homeland, then it can be  negotiated nine months thereafter, after a new government is in  place. Is my understanding of this incorrect?    [Terreblanche] Yes. You see, the basic issue is that the  African National Congress or the government did not recognize  the rights of the people, that it wanted land of its own in its  own free republic. All that it said -- the modus operandi --  all that they said is just that you will have the right to  pursue the ideal of a homeland.    [Du Preez] But it is written into the constitution.    [Terreblanche] That does not mean anything. Whether it is  written into the constitution or not -- it means that the  constitution is so full of shortcomings -- whether or not it is  written into the constitution, then in the future we may only be  able to argue about certain things. To say you have the right  to ask about these things is pathetic. Recognition was not  given as a right of our people. When I argue about this I am  being realistic. The right of people -- the reason for the UN's  existence, the reason for its existence, is to see that nations  can live in freedom and sovereignty and that the one does not  hinder the other's sovereignty -- all that these people are  saying is that we are offering, in your own fatherland, that you  will have the right hereafter to propagate this. I just want to  say, later they added a tail, which said that you will have the  right to speak your language and that you will have the right to  practice your religion. If you look at the entire document, it  says: Under a strange government, in which I am not admitting  that you have the right to your own land, you will be able to  cry in Afrikaans and you will be able to pray in Afrikaans --  those are the only rights you are given.    [Du Preez] Then you said that this is unacceptable?    [Terreblanche] Yes.    [Du Preez] But that was General Viljoen's proposal.    [Terreblanche] Yes.    [Du Preez] But earlier you told me that you still trust  General Viljoen.    [Terreblanche] The fact of the matter is...I believe that  General Viljoen, to the best of his ability, tried to achieve a  settlement, and indeed also told me and my general staff, that  he will do everything in his power to try and achieve a  settlement along these peaceful lines, that he would never be  able to tear himself away from the ideal or the reality of a  homeland and the right of the Boer people to self-determination.  Now General Viljoen has the right to try his own method. As I  told you....    [Du Preez, interrupting] But is that a method you reject?    [Terreblanche] It is very definitely something that I will  not attempt to do, because it does not help if the people you  are negotiating with are the aggressors who have already  declared war.    [Du Preez] But General Viljoen does not think so. Do you  think he is naive?    [Terreblanche] I do not think that General Viljoen should  think the way I do or as any other person thinks.    [Du Preez] Yes, but you feel strongly about this.    [Terreblanche] I do feel strongly about this but I want to  tell you again that the issues inspiring us to stand together is  much bigger than the difference in method used -- than  differences in modus operandi between the two groups.    [Du Preez] And if he made that proposal on that day, the  29th, this proposal contained in the document, which people from  other camps saw as a big breakthrough -- if he was not heckled,  if the document was signed, where would you be today, because he  wanted the document to be accepted. Would you not have accepted  it?    [Terreblanche] I would not have accepted such a settlement.  If we were forced to the polls with a vague promise that the  ANC, showing great mercy, would give us a homeland after the  27th, one that it does not want to give now, then I would  definitely have distanced myself from the National Front. The  people have decided and it does not help to say AWB supporters  shouted him down. That was the voice of the people, and you  know what Paul Kruger said....    [Du Preez, interrupting] And did the people reject Gen.  Viljoen?    [Terreblanche] No. They rejected the proposal.    [Du Preez] But he believes so strongly in it.    [Terreblanche] I don't think he believes so strongly in it.    [Du Preez] There are many people in this country who believe  that that was the best deal the Afrikaner could have negotiated;  they feel that Eugene Terreblanche is dragging them into war,  instead of accepting that deal. They ask, what right does he  have to declare war on behalf of our descendants? They say, if  we tested our votes, we could have had a very strong argument  against the rest of the country, and against the world; we  could have pointed to our support, to our regions, and to the  clause in the constitution which says if there is sufficient  proof of the desire of a group to have self-determination, it  must be negotiated.    [Terreblanche] Let's just look at what you have just said.  We have been promised nothing. All they said is, you will have  the right to propagate your homeland. When they said we can  test our support, they meant a test of support against the 28  million or 30 million people in this country. They want the  smaller number of white votes to be counted along with those of  the black majority. We said we would very much like to show our  support, either through a referendum or an election held among  the Afrikaner people, which would be conducted by the state, so  that we could prove to the state what the will of the Afrikaner  Boer nation is. The ANC, on the other hand, proposed that they  count the votes of the 4 million whites together with the rest,  and then decide whether we may propagate our goal further.    [Du Preez] Let's just stop there for a moment. Eugene  Terreblanche and the AWB are now saying this is not acceptable,  this is not a good proposal. You say you will make the country  look like Guy Fawkes, and I quote, the Boers will burn down this  land. Now you talk about a reasonably serious war. What about  this: you take part in the elections, you show support for a  homeland, and then a clause is added onto the constitution  saying that now you may propagate your goals, and so on. The  ANC and the communists then laugh at you. Is this not the  moment you say, now I am in a corner?    [Terreblanche] Mr. du Preez, one cannot give recognition to  an illegitimate election. If you become part of an election,  then you become part of the outcome of that election. I cannot  become part of a monster of a system created to evaluate the  small minority in its own fatherland. The only way of democracy  is for the people to have true freedom. Democracy does not just  mean the right of the individual. Democracy means the right of  a people to live in freedom, and that members of that people  should not be stopped from exercising its own human right. We  have been offered just that; no recognition. We as a nation  are not being recognized in spite of the suffering and grief,  sacrifice and struggle, to civilize this country. You are now  being counted as equal. When you've seen how many have voted  for a homeland, you will feel you have the right to propagate  that homeland, and to decide if we will get a homeland.    [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche were you present when the  Bosnian  professor addressed the Afrikaner People?    [Terreblanche] Yes I was.    [Du Preez] Can you remember what she said about her  experience in Bosnia-Hercegovina: Better a thousand days of  negotiations rather than the first bullet?    [Terreblanche] Yes.    [Du Preez] The violence, are you not being too hasty? Do you  not realize the seriousness of a war with which you are  threatening?    [Terreblanche] Mr. du Preez, let us leave the issue of  violence, and my opinion of violence for later. I opposed that  lady. I said to her it is precisely because of your  negotiations, precisely as a result of the methods used by the  enemy, that you now have a modern Stalin situation. The  original Stalin did to Eastern Europe exactly what Nelson  Mandela and De Klerk are attempting to do now, namely to combine  small groups of people in a unitary state in order to create a  type of a new Russian Republic, a democratic republic, which  failed after 40 years, after the tears, grief, and death of  millions of people. Now Joseph Stalin's recipe is being used in  a unitary state, and under a communist authority. We know that  almost 75 percent of the national executive committee of the ANC  are communists.    [Du Preez] You are saying the Boers will burn down the land.  I do not want to be judgmental Mr. Terreblanche, but my  impression as an Afrikaans-speaking South African is that you,  your party, and other members of the National Front are  romanticizing violence. And I do wonder if the difference  between Eugene Terreblanche and Constand Viljoen is not that  Constand Viljoen knows the meaning of a war. He placed our sons  in body bags in Angola and Namibia. Are you familiar with that  side of a war, and where will that war which you are planning  begin?    [Terreblanche] I am not here to write a resume about  myself. But I want to say to you that at one stage, for a year  and 14 days, I was on the borders of my country, and then again  for six months. I know the bush, I volunteered, and I am the  son of a militarist, and have never, when my country was in  danger, taken cover behind negotiations or nice talk. And with  due respect, you are deliberately trying to drive a wedge  tonight between Gen. Viljoen and myself. Gen. Viljoen and I....    [Du Preez, interrupting] I want to get answers tonight for  the viewers and the electorate?    [Terreblanche] I do not believe that there is one single  viewer or voter who for one moment thinks that I am  romanticizing a bloody war. I also have walked along the  pathway of the dangers of terrorism in the banks and deep gorges  of Rhodesia for months and months, and today these same  terrorists want to sit around the table with vague promises of a  homeland. It is unbelievable, that a people believing in a  living God should be granted vague promises from Satan himself  and his peons, and his communists, this is what worries the  people. Not the fact that I say I am prepared to defend my  country with my life.    [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, we have about 30 seconds left.  Tell me one thing, against whom is the war, and who gets the  first bullet. The day you declare war, who gets shot first?    [Terreblanche] The aggressor. I categorically state: We are  standing on the verge of a revolution which will not be caused  by the rightists of South Africa, but the chaos which will  follow because of this government, the ANC, the elections....    [Du Preez, interrupting] Who in the elections?    [Terreblanche] It does not matter, white or black, or  technicolor, if he takes away the right of the Boer people to  govern himself in his God-given country....    [Du Preez, interrupting] So it could be Mr. de Klerk?    [Terreblanche] Sir, let us not....    [Du Preez] Could it be an Inkatha supporter, or the  Alliance?    [Terreblanche] No it cannot be an official of Inkatha,  because Inkatha is not participating in the elections, and  kwaZulu feels the same way I feel about my fatherland.    [Du Preez] What about the current racial conflict underway?    [Terreblanche] For heavens sake it is not about race. It is  the rights of a people, and in this case, the rights of the  Boers, the Zulus and the Tswanas, which has been signed away at  the table of communists.    [Du Preez] Mr. Terreblanche, our time is up. Thank you very  much.</p>

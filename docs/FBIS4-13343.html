			<p>BFN     [Text] Suez, 18 Apr (MENA)--Field Marshal Muhammad Husayn  Tantawi, minister of defense and war production, has stressed  the importance of continuous military training to upgrade the  Armed Forces' combat readiness.    In remarks made while attending the military exercise  "Taysir  13" east of the Suez Canal today, Tantawi praised the skill of  the 3d Field Army and noted the combat ability of the Egyptian  soldier.    He called for continuing tough training for small and  medium-size units and for providing the necessary care for  soldiers to enable them to achieve a high level of physical and  technical competence and to always be ready to defend Egypt.    He said the state and the people are securing modern and  advanced equipment for the Army to enable it to perform its  tasks honorably.    In the exercise, a mechanized infantry unit of the 3d Army  crushes an enemy attack in a mountainous region. The unit stops  the advance of enemy forces, destroys them, restores defensive  positions, and launches a counterattack.    The exercise begins with enemy warplanes attacking the  positions of the mechanized infantry unit. The Air Force then  intervenes, confronting enemy planes and forcing them to flee.    Reconnaissance units start to gather military information on  the movements of the two sides.    Ground defenses, helicopters, and vehicles equipped with  antitank missiles confront and destroy the attacking enemy  tanks. Our forces use mine fields and landslides to hinder the  enemy advance. Here the competence of the Egyptian antitank  missile "al-Ahram" appears. The missile is mounted on light  military vehicles and can destroy enemy tanks far away.    In the next phase of "Taysir 13," the 3d Army tanks launch a  counterattack against enemy positions, inflicting heavy losses  on them. Electronic war techniques, represented by jamming and  obstruction, are used.    Antichemical-warfare units carry out surveys to make sure  the  enemy used no chemical weapons in the battle.    The exercise is part of a major training plan currently  being  implemented by the 3d Field Army using live ammunition; it  coincides with the anniversary of the return of dear Sinai to  Egypt.    Mechanized infantry, tank, helicopter, reconnaissance,  chemical warfare, and Air Force units took part in the exercise.    The drill seeks to highlight the ability of commanders to  make decisions in emergencies and control their forces during  the battle. It also aims to unify the method of action used by  the Armed Forces branches in mountainous regions and to train  tank crews working in the mountains.</p>

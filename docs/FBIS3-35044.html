			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Today is the fifth anniversary of the declaration of  the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU] between the Great Jamahiriyah,  Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania. On this day five  years ago the treaty creating the AMU was signed at the  Marrakesh summit in fraternal Morocco as a step on the road to  achieving the all-embracing Arab unity.    The brother leader of the revolution emphasized at the final  session of the Marrakesh summit the need to set up the AMU for  the benefit of the toilers, the poor and the deprived who have  suffered decades of oppression and colonialism, and to let the  overwhelming majority [of the peoples of the Maghreb] have their  share in the new unified Arab Maghreb. He also stressed that  this Union should be a support for the struggle of the Arab  Palestinian people for the liberation of Palestine from the  river to the sea.    However, five years after its creation the treaty of this  Union has remained mere ink on paper and its march has not  achieved more than zero because it did not render any service to  the Arab people in this region. Suffice to note that this union  was incapable of holding a summit meeting and was unable to lift  an unfair embargo imposed on a member state.</p>

Flight Test Demonstration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The system must be demonstrated in flight to satisfactorily perform its intended function, without exceeding the system deployment load factors, for the critical flight conditions, except as allowed in 1(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Satisfactory deployment of the parachute must be demonstrated, at the most critical airplane weight and balance, for the following flight conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Power off stall with slow entry, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Spin with deployment at one turn, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Never exceed speed with 1g normal load. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Flight demonstrations are not required for airplanes with similar characteristics, (such as configuration, weight, and speed) to airplanes that have already received an STC for the installation. Only airplanes where a significant change from airplanes that have already received an STC need to include a flight demonstration. A significant change in airplane characteristics could be defined as any variation that could potentially cause the airplane to react to parachute deployment different from original tests. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Occupant Restraint <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each seat in an airplane modified with the parachute recovery system must be equipped with a restraint system, consisting of a seat belt and shoulder harness, that will protect the occupants from head and upper torso injuries during parachute deployment and ground impact at the critical load conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Parachute Performance <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The parachute must comply with the applicable requirements of TSO&hyph;C23c, or an approved equivalent, for the critical airplane weights. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The system limit load factor for deployment must not exceed 80 percent of the airplane ultimate load factor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) It must be shown that, although the airplane structure may be damaged, the airplane impact during touchdown will result in an occupant environment in which serious injury to the occupants is improbable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) It must be shown that, with the parachute deployed, the airplane can impact the ground in various adverse weather conditions, including winds up to 15 knots, without endangering the airplane occupants. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. System Function and Operations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) It must be shown that there is no fire hazard associated with activation of the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The system must be shown to function reliably and to perform its intended function. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) It must be shown that arming and activating the system can only be accomplished in a sequence that makes inadvertent deployment extremely improbable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) It must be demonstrated that the system can be activated without difficulty by various sized people, from a 10th percentile female to a 90th percentile male, while sitting in the pilot or copilot seat. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) The system must be labeled to show its identification, function, and operating limitations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) It must be shown that the occupants will be protected from serious injury after touchdown under various adverse weather conditions, including high winds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. System Protection <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) All components of the system must provide protection against deterioration due to weathering, corrosion, abrasion, and other causes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Adequate provisions must be made for ventilation and drainage of the parachute canister and associated structure to ensure the sound condition of the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. System Inspection Provisions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Instructions for continued airworthiness must be prepared for the system that meet the requirements of &sect;23.1529. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Adequate means must be provided to permit the close examination of the parachute and other system components to ensure proper functioning, alignment, lubrication, and adjustment during the required inspection of the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Operating Limitations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Operating limitations must be prescribed to ensure proper operation of the system within the approved flight envelope of the airplane. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Operating limitations must be prescribed for inspecting, repacking, and replacing the parachute and deployment mechanism at approved intervals. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Kansas City, Missouri on June 22, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Gerald W.

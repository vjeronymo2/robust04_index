			<p>BFN     [Text] Tripoli, 1 May -- These days the British Government  is waging a violent campaign against Iran under the pretext that  Iran had contacts with the IRA.    The JANA international affairs editor commented on this,  saying: This campaign is merely a repeated attempt on the part  of Britain to falsify the truth and abolish rationality. This  attempt is governed by a colonialist logic based on  misrepresentation, deception, and turning the given facts upside  down, if what gave rise to the British Government's rancor was  the contact of a certain party with the IRA.    As it recently confessed, it was in official contact with  this organization at a time when it was describing it as a  terrorist organization and anyone who had contact with its  members as a terrorist who supported terrorism.    But if the matter is related to aid from one party to  another, in Britain's history and the behavior of its  governments are matters which make it the first to be condemned  and the first against whom a campaign should be waged motivated  by the anger of peoples rather than those campaigns based on  falsification. It has been noticed that it was Britain who  received and provided support for the Iranian opposition. Now  it is trying to cover up this stance by waging its propaganda  campaign against Iran.    When it raises the Irish issue in this framework, it is  trying at the same time to deceive peoples' minds by diverting  attention to the essential cause of this problem which is its  occupation of Ireland and its determination to colonize this  country and deny Irish people the right to self-determination  and then has recourse to pinning its evil actions on others.    The Editor added that what Britain is complaining about  today  is its own doing, as it is the one which occupied Ireland and  the Irish people did not go to occupy Britain. It is also the  state which built an empire on colonizing peoples and draining  their wealth and is now reaping what its hands committed and  that empire and its limbs were cut off by the struggle of  peoples for freedom and independence. Britain has collapsed to  the point where it retreated to its capital London and in front  of which it is taking in its doorstep and might even retreat to  beyond this capital unless it submits to the logic of right and  law and abandons its behavior ruled by the colonialist and  guardianship mentality and becomes aware of the fact that the  resistance by the Irish -- whose fire is burning as the result  of its occupation -- is not caused by Iran or anyone else.  Britain has no other way to get out of this situation apart  from ending its occupation of Ireland and letting the Irish  people achieve self-determination.</p>

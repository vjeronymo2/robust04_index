			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY RECORDS: HIS PRIVATE RITUAL NOW A PUBLIC ISSUE  </P> <P> When Mayor Tom Bradley sat down each year to fill out public disclosure forms  on his personal financial dealings, aides and close associates say, it was an  intensely private ritual.  </P> <P> The pattern began with the earliest and simplest of Bradley's disclosure  statements, aides say, 14 years ago when Watergate-era voters first required  California's elected officials to reveal holdings and income sources to avoid  possible conflicts of interest.  </P> <P> At first the mayor, who had only a few investments, filled the forms out by  hand, aides say. But even in later years -- as both the information required  and Bradley's investment portfolio grew more complex -- the mayor prepared the  forms by himself, then sometimes hovered over a personal secretary as she typed  them up.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shunned Assistance  </P> <P> He worked from memory and from whatever records were available, and he neither  sought nor obtained help, say his aides and his accountant.  </P> <P> "I never offered because I know he's very private about such things," said  Anton Calleia, the mayor's longtime chief administrative assistant.  </P> <P> "He did it himself and he wasn't very good at it," said Jules Glazer, the  mayor's accountant.  </P> <P> That is the explanation the mayor and his supporters are offering for what they  describe as inadvertent and "highly technical" mistakes in the mayor's public  accounting of his personal investments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public's Right Cited  </P> <P> However, the volume of errors and the nature of some of the omissions, as  revealed in a massive series of amendments filed by Bradley on Friday, may add  to the public's suspicions about the embattled mayor, said Walter Zelman,  executive director of California Common Cause.  </P> <P> Describing the extensive errors as "openly negligent," Zelman said: "The public  has a right to question whether this (results from) the general inability of  the individual to do the job himself, or some larger effort of concealment, or  some kind of disrespect for the law."  </P> <P> After months of controversy, and amid a series of city, state and federal  investigations of Bradley's business dealings, the mayor filed 66 pages of  amendments to his financial disclosure statements spanning 1984 through 1988.  The filing with the state Fair Political Practices Commission -- two weeks past  deadline -- corrected more than 100 errors, ranging from substantial omissions  to minor technical errors.  </P> <P> The tangled nature of the mayor's earlier reports had helped fuel suspicions  that the mayor might have mixed personal and public business. Bradley's lawyers  had to spend months reconstructing an accurate and complete picture of the  mayor's investment activities.  </P> <P> To avoid such problems in the future, Bradley in April announced that he would  place all of his investments in a blind trust. On Saturday, Deputy Mayor  Michael Gage said creation of the trust is "imminent." UCLA professor of  management William Ouchi and William Doheny, managing director of the U.S.  Trust Co. of California, had been been selected to administer the trust. And  the prominent downtown law firm of Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher will be legal  counsel, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Direct Control  </P> <P> Gage said Bradley will have no direct control over his investments and will  only receive periodic reports on his worth and earnings.  </P> <P> The corrections filed Friday showed that Bradley apparently obtained several  securities -- such as BCI Holding, Inc., junk bonds handled by Drexel Burnham  Lambert -- when they were readily available to the general public. Bradley's  relationship with Drexel and its indicted former junk bond king, Michael  Milken, is under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department and the  Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> But they also revealed previously undisclosed investments in two California  land partnerships, Sierra Investors, Ltd., and Yosemite Investors, Ltd.; a  television shopping channel, CVN Inc.; a New York-based mortgage firm, American  Insured Mortgage Investors; Cadence Design Systems Inc., a San Jose-based  computer software supplier; as well as junk bonds and warrants Bradley held in  Columbia Savings &amp; Loan.  </P> <P> The Times has reported that Bradley lawyers have been exploring the mayor's  dealings with Columbia vice chairman Abe Spiegel, a longtime friend and  fund-raiser.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Data on Stock Trades  </P> <P> In addition, the amended statements show the mayor failed to accurately report  a series of transactions, ranging from the amounts and dates of stock trades to  the circumstances surrounding loans. In a few cases he listed properties and  securities he no longer owned.  </P> <P> The reports showed Bradley obtained shares of two hard-to-get, hot new issues  of stock -- L.A. Gear athletic wear and Worlds of Wonder toy company -- and and  turned a quick profit of about $1,000 each.  </P> <P> Among the new questions raised by the reports are the previously undisclosed or  misreported transactions involving Columbia Savings &amp; Loan. Bradley, on his  original forms, had reported receiving a personal loan from Columbia. On his  amended forms, he reported the loan actually went to a Riverside land  partnership, KSTJ II.  </P> <P> One of his partners, Juanita St. John, said Saturday that the loan was for  $50,000 and was used to pay a balloon payment on a previous mortgage. She said  she was not certain who arranged the loan or what the interest rate was, but  she maintained that the partnership did not get special treatment because of  Bradley's ties to Columbia executive Spiegel.  </P> <P> St. John heads the mayor's city-funded Task Force for Africa Relations, which  the city attorney and controller are investigating for possible misuse of tax  funds.  </P> <P> Bradley also reported Friday for the first time more details about foreign  governments and others who helped pay some of his travel expenses. He said a  $3,000 tab for his 1987 trade trip to Africa was paid by the Asian American  Economic Development Enterprises and Small Business Development Group. The city  attorney is investigating the exact source of the funds, which originated with  a charitable donation from Matsushita Electric Co. of America, the parent  company of Panasonic Co.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the firm said Matsushita did not intend the funds to be used  for Bradley's trip.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A ceremonial signing of a memorandum on mutual  understanding between the governments of Ukraine and the United  States of America about the transfer of the missile equipment  and technologies took place in the White House. Ukraine's  Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov and U.S. Vice President Al  Gore signed the document.    Proceeding from common interest in maintaining and  consolidating international peace and security, says the  document, the governments of both countries are ready to jointly  counteract the proliferation of the missile equipment and  technologies which could contribute to the elaboration of  acquisition of the missile systems for delivering mass  annihilation weapons.    The memorandum envisages a package of measures aimed at  strict control over the proliferation of missile technologies,  the carrying out of joint inspections and consultations in this  field, exchange of relevant data in case missile equipment and  technologies are transferred.    Meanwhile, the memorandum emphasizes that the regime of  control over the missile technologies rules out the creation of  obstacles in the way of creating Ukraine's national space  program or its cooperation with other missile and space states  in this sphere.    By signing this document the United States of America, as a  matter of fact, recognized Ukraine's just interests in  preserving and further promoting scientific, technological and  production capacity of Ukraine in the missile and space field.  This agreement also means that Ukraine is recognized as an  equal participant in international cooperation and a subject of  the world aerospace market.    The second important result of the work done by the  Ukrainian  delegation, led by Valeriy Shmarov, in the U.S. capital was the  adoption of a joint statement in which the governments of both  countries reaffirm their loyalty to building relations of  partnership, mutual trust and respect, and further developing  new relations in the cause of security and defense.    Recognizing Ukraine's positive contribution to the cause of  nuclear disarmament, the specific steps toward deactivating  missile installations in Ukraine and the implementation of the  trilateral statement as a whole, the Government of the United  States of America, in response, announced that after 30 May this  year the U.S. strategic missiles will no longer be targeted at  Ukraine.    This document also emphasizes that as from this date the  U.S.  missiles will not be targeted at the territories of other  countries, which will testify to the lessening of nuclear threat  in the world as a whole.    Speaking at the signing ceremony in the White House, U.S.  Vice President Al Gore underlined that by its actions in many  fields over the year Ukraine has proved that it is a reliable  and responsible partner.    The adoption and signing of these important  Ukrainian-American documents is yet another concrete step toward  fulfilling the program of a broad development of bilateral  relations signed by the presidents of Ukraine and the USA Leonid  Kravchuk and Bill Clinton. An agreement was achieved on further  contacts between both sides.    On behalf of the president and the government of our state  Valeriy Shmarov invited the U.S. Vice President to visit Ukraine  at a time convenient to him. The invitation was accepted with  gratitude.</p>

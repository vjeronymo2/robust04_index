			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Brussels, Jan 21 (AFP) -- Two leading socialist  officials of Belgium's French-speaking regional government  resigned Friday [21 January], a few hours after Belgian Deputy  Prime Minister Guy Coeme, after being embroiled in a bribery  scandal.    Guy Spitaels, former Francophone Socialist Party president  and president of the French-speaking regional government, and  Guy Mathot, another member of that government, announced their  decision to the press just two hours after the Royal Palace  announced Coeme's resignation.    The three leaders had been accused of taking bribes and  channelling funds to the Socialist Party in connection with the  1988 purchase of 46 Italian Agusta helicopters for the Belgian  Army.    Coeme, 48, was defence minister at the time of the 225  million dollar purchase. [passage omitted]</p>

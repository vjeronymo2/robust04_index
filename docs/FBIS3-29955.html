During this period our party and people have  consistently waged the struggle to model the entire society  after the chuche idea under the dear comrade leader's  leadership. As a result, they have registered great victories  and changes which are unprecedented not only in the history of  our nation, but also in the history of the communist movement,  and our revolution has greeted an ever- victorious era of a new  upsurge.    It is thanks to the wise leadership of the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is brilliantly leading the cause of  modeling the entire society after the chuche idea, that our  people have proudly built a tower of socialist success on which  the chuche idea has been embodied and are enjoying an  independent and creative life to their hearts' content and that  they are vigorously struggling and advancing, being optimistic  about the future of socialism and communism and full of firm  faith in victory.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has  taught: Everything is being properly carried out in our country  today and it will be also properly carried out in the future,  too, because Comrade Kim Chong-il is outstandingly inheriting  our revolutionary cause.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is the  great leadership to inherit and consummate the chuche  revolutionary cause that the respected and beloved leader  Comrade Kim Il-song pioneered and has led to the road of victory  and glory. The chuche revolutionary cause, which the great  leader started its historical beginning, is the popular masses'  cause which is pioneered and developed under the banner of the  chuche idea, and it is also a sacred cause to completely realize  the popular masses' independence by building socialism,  communism, through the embodiment of the chuche idea.    On the course of carrying out the chuche revolutionary cause  under the wise leadership of the respected and beloved leader  Comrade Kim Il-song, our people achieved the task of national  liberation, brilliantly achieved the tasks of democratic  revolution and socialist revolution in the northern half of the  Republic after national liberation, and, thus, built the most  superior socialist system of our own style there. In this way  our revolution has reached a high stage, greeting a new  revolutionary turning point.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, with his insight into  the mature demands of our developing revolution, developed and  consummated the socialism of our own style which has embodied  the chuche idea by expounding the program of modeling the entire  society after the chuche idea and, thus, has provided the  guiding principle to seek a high stage of communism.    As the dear comrade leader has elucidated, modeling the  entire society after the chuche idea means to advance our  revolution, using the great chuche idea as the only guiding  principle, and to build and consummate socialism, communism on  the basis of the chuche idea. In other words, it means to remold  men, society, and nature in conformity with the demands of the  chuche idea and, thus, to completely realize the popular masses'  independence.    The program of modeling the entire society after the chuche  idea extensively contains the most correct goal and direction of  struggle for completely guaranteeing the popular masses'  independence, as well as struggle policies and methods for their  realization, by developing and consummating socialism of our own  style and realizing communism at a high plane.    When we thoroughly uphold and implement the program of  modeling the entire society after the chuche idea we can develop  and consummate the socialist cause without the slightest  deviation and vicissitudes under any difficult circumstances and  conditions and successfully build communist society in which the  popular masses' independence is completely realized.    The cause of including the entire society with one ideology  can be achieved only by the great leader [suryong], the great  leader [yongdoja] who created the revolutionary ideology and  theory representing the times and who has produced brilliant  revolutionary achievements by embodying the revolutionary  ideology and theory through tested leadership.    Despite the difficult condition in which the imperialists  and the traitors of socialism are intensifying the  counterrevolutionary offensive, the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il always upheld the banner of the great chuche idea, put  forth an original idea and theory to realize the program of  modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, and has wisely  led our people's struggle for their realization.    Above all, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il put forth an  original idea and theory to realize the program of modeling the  entire society on the chuche idea, thus providing us with an  ideological and theoretical guideline for us to advance the  chuche socialist cause vigorously straight forward along the  road of victory. His new elucidation of the essence of  socialism and of the inevitability of its inheritance and  completion is an important achievement he has made for the  realization of the cause of modeling the entire society on the  chuche idea.    The dear comrade leader gave a new elucidation that by  embodying the chuche idea, socialism brings forth a society  which is free from exploitation and oppression of man by man in  which social equality is realized and in which the popular  masses are tied in comradeship as common masters of state and  society and enjoy independent and creative life suitable for the  nature of the social human being. Based on his original  proclamation that in socialist society where the popular masses  are masters, ideology is of vital importance and the party's  leadership is the lifeline for the victory of the cause of  socialism, he clarified anew that the basic factor of the  development of socialist society lies in the struggle of the  popular masses united in comradeship with high self-awareness  and capability as masters.    His elucidation of the new idea on the method of building  socialism is one of the important achievements the dear comrade  leader has built for the realization of the cause of modeling  the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader  put forth the idea and theory on living in our own way and on  highly exalting the Korean nation-first spirit, thus  establishing an original method of carrying out party building  and state building in our own way according to the chuche faith  and will, developing politics, economy, and culture in our own  way, and carrying out the revolution based on the Korean  nation-first spirit.    That the dear comrade leader established the scientific  theory on inheriting and completing the cause of socialism based  on the revolutionary outlook on the leader is the most important  achievement he made for the realization of the cause of modeling  the entire society on the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader  made a comprehensive compilation of the idea and theory on the  inheritance and completion of the cause of the revolution into  such demonstrative statements, as we should firmly maintain the  purity of socialist ideology and correctly resolve the issue of  leadership succession in order to fulfill the cause of  socialism. To do this, we should build the party as a guide of  socialist-communist society under a long-range program, realize  its leadership firmly, and correctly inherit the tradition of  the ideology and leadership achieved by the leader.    Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il gave a new  comprehensive elucidation of the ideology and theory on the  essence of socialist society and its inheritance and completion  based on the principle and methodological theory of the chuche  idea, the abundant experience of our country's building  socialism, and the scientific analysis of the historical lesson  in building socialism. By so doing, we could overcome the  limitation of the previous socialist ideology and theory  centered on materialism and establish a complete socialist  ideology. At the same time, our socialism was turned firmly  into the chuche socialism centered on popular masses, thus  enabling us to advance vigorously along the single road of  victory and glory. This is the most noble achievement the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has made on the way to realize the  cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il also provided a strong  political force and a guarantee of armed forces to realize the  program of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea, so  that the cause of our-style socialism could make a long drive  taking advantage of victory unshaken in the face of any trial.    The dear comrade leader attached prior importance to  building  the party firmly organizationally and ideologically in leading  the revolution and construction and put forth the revolutionary  policy on modeling the entire party membership on the chuche  idea; and, to realize this policy, he strengthened and developed  our party into an invincible revolutionary party in which the  uniformity of ideology and leadership is firmly ensured, in  which the entire party membership is united as strong as iron,  and which has taken root deep among the popular masses and  formed a harmonious whole with the masses.    The dear comrade leader placed the unity and cohesion  between  the party and the people onto a high plane of wholehearted  unity, and combined the entire society into one sociopolitical  living organism in which the leader, the party, and the masses  share their destiny. In this process, the main force of our  revolution, the main force of the cause of our-style socialism,  has been solidified as an indestructible force.    Based on his insight into the important significance of the  revolutionary armed forces in carrying out the cause of  socialism, the dear comrade leader put forth the independent  army building policy on modeling the entire army on the chuche  idea, and strengthened and developed the People's Army to be  one-a-match-for-a-hundred revolutionary armed forces well  prepared politically, ideologically, and in terms of military  technology. Hence, our people have come to have invincible  revolutionary armed forces that can support with arms the cause  of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea. Solidifying  the main force of the revolution into an invincible force and  providing strong revolutionary armed forces constitute a  decisive factor that brings forth the victorious advance and  ultimate completion of the cause of modeling the entire society  on the chuche idea.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il defined the three  revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--as a  fundamental way to realize the modeling of the entire society on  the chuche idea and wisely leads the struggle to implement it.  By so doing, he successfully remakes nature, society, and  people as demanded by the chuche idea. The dear comrade leader  put forth the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and  cultural--as a strategical line for socialist-communist  building, and exercised his leadership so that the technological  and cultural revolutions could be vigorously pushed forward with  the ideological revolution given prior importance. He exercised  his leadership so that the party's leadership role for the three  revolutions would be intensified, so that the movement of  winning the three revolutions red flag and the three revolutions  teams movement would be vigorously conducted, so that the three  revolutions would be turned firmly into a work of the masses  themselves under a powerful leadership system. As a result of  this, the entire society came to be filled with the chuche idea,  with the socialist collectivist spirit and beautiful communist  virtues prevailing in it. At the same time, our self-reliant  socialist economy came to be accelerated on the high plane of  chucheization, modernization, and scientization; the  intellectualization of the entire society came to be in  brilliant progress, and the socialist literature and art came to  be in full resplendent bloom.    Thus, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il brilliantly led  the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche idea,  creating the history of great victory for our-style socialism,  and brought forth an epochal upturn unprecedented in the nearly  5,000-year history of our nation.    It is the greatest honor and happiness for our people to  uphold and follow the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il--outstanding ideologist and theoretician with brilliant  wisdom and great statesman and iron-willed brilliant commander  with iron-will and tested leadership--at the head of the party,  the revolution, and the revolutionary armed forces. Only  victory and glory will shine in the future of our people who  carry out the cause of modeling the entire society on the chuche  idea under the leadership of the dear comrade leader. On this  road, our socialist fatherland will grow and prosper forever.</p>

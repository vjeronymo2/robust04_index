			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fleming to pay Dollars 1.1bn for Scrivener food distributor Fleming, the second biggest wholesale food distributor in the US, is to buy Scrivener, the country's third biggest distributor, from its German parent company for Dollars 1.1bn in cash. The purchase, announced yesterday, will turn the combined companies - close neighbours in Oklahoma City - into the biggest food distribution group in the US, pushing the Minneapolis-based Super Valu Stores into the number two slot. Since 1977, Scrivener has been a subsidiary of Franz Haniel - a family-owned German conglomerate with interests in transport, trading and pharmaceuticals. Mr Franz Haniel is understood to have agreed sale of the subsidiary to pay off debt incurred last year when it bought Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, a French pharmaceutical company. Fleming said its purchase of Scrivener would create a group with combined annual sales of Dollars 19bn. It would strengthen Fleming's customer base in the Midwest and east, and take the group into seven new markets: Iowa, the Carolinas, western Pennsylvania, New York, Illinois and Minnesota. The enlarged Fleming will serve more than 5,800 independent and chain supermarkets and more than 2,800 convenience stores in the US. Of the Dollars 1.1bn purchase price, some Dollars 388m is for Scrivener's equity and most of the rest will be used to pay off Scrivener's loans. Fleming said Scrivener made operating profits of Dollars 106m last year. Fleming has been suffering from static or declining profits caused by weak retail food sales and a lack of food price inflation. Excluding extraordinary items, net profits fell to Dollars 99.3m from Dollars 118.9m last year on a 1.5 per cent increase in turnover to Dollars 13.1bn. At the beginning of this year Fleming embarked on a reorganisation to restore profits growth by cutting costs. Yesterday, Mr Robert Strauth, chairman, indicated that a similar 're-engineering' process would be applied to Scrivener, and could take some Dollars 20m out of the company's operating costs.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Economists foresee autumn poll: FT survey suggests declining prospects for government next year ECONOMIC conditions could box the government into an October general election, after the Tories' performance in last week's local government elections in effect ruled out a snap June poll, economists warn today. Next month the economy will be still stuck in recession with annual inflation running at about 6 per cent. Although it will fall to about 4 per cent by the end of this year, by early 1992 it will have started to climb again, the economists predict. Interest rates will have stopped falling and the trade gap begun to widen, they add. With unemployment expected to average 2.6m next year and set to continue rising well into 1993, the Tories are likely to preside over an increase in public borrowing to at least Pounds 12.2bn next year from a forecast Pounds 8.8bn in the 1991-92 financial year. If the government wants to avoid going to the polls against either of these poor economic backcloths, it will have to capitalise on the low interest rates and inflation likely in October. These conclusions emerge from today's Financial Times spring survey of economic forecasts from 21 leading academic economists, City institutions and private-sector financial groups. It discloses increasing anxiety about the strength of the recovery which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has said is 'round the corner'. Over the weekend, the Institute of Directors and the 3i investment capital group reported a significant rise in business optimism over the past two months. The independent forecasters, however, are convinced that the recovery will be much less rapid than the descent into recession last year, and fragile and weak at best when it starts around the third quarter of this year. The consensus among the 21 forecasters suggests a turnaround in gross domestic product from a 1.6 per cent drop this year to growth of around 2 per cent next year. But this will be insufficient to stem sharp rises in unemployment. Manufacturing output is projected to fall by 4.6 per cent this year and the current account deficit to grow from Pounds 6.3bn in 1991 to Pounds 7.3bn next year. Recent interest rate cuts will not be as effective as in previous recessions, because companies will use cheaper borrowing to repair balance sheets rather than invest in new plant, machinery or labour. Economists fear that the recovery will not be sustained. Worries centre on the government's reliance on growth in real incomes and consumer spending to pull the economy out of recession, rather than structural improvements to manufacturing industry. Rising demand pressures - and technical factors associated with the compilation of the retail prices index - are predicted to cause inflation to rise to 4.3 per cent by the end of next year, after falling to 3.6 per cent this autumn. Some economists fear for sterling's stability in the wake of the local government elections. The political uncertainty will mount, 'weakening sterling and hence limiting the authorities' ability to cut base rates and even, conceivably, forcing them to increase rates', warns Mr Roger Bootle, of Greenwell Montagu.

			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> RAMS: Four months after losing to the 49ers in the playoffs, some of the Rams  were back on the field Monday (C2). . . . This year the problem is finding a  field. After a two-week rookie camp at Rams Park in Anaheim, summer camp begins  July 25 in Irvine instead of the Rams' usual Cal State Fullerton site, closed  by construction. . . . Then it's off to Berlin for an Aug. 11 exhibition game  against Kansas City. David Reyes and Jeffrey A. Perlman  </P></p>

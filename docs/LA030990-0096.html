			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / CD CORNER: COLUMBIA'S 'JOHNNIE RAY' SHORT BUT SWEET  </P> <P> At just under 24 minutes, "The Best of Johnnie Ray" must be one of the shortest  compact discs in existence.  </P> <P> But the key tunes in the nine-song Columbia Records collection showcase the  contributions of a man whose place in rock history has been greatly  under-appreciated.  </P> <P> Ray served as a small yet significant bridge between the smooth, generally  formal pop style of the '40s and the more intense and informal approach that  would characterize the late-'50s rock revolution.  </P> <P> Ray, who died Feb. 24 in Los Angeles of liver failure at age 63, worked in a  mostly conventional pop framework on record in the early '50s, but he applied  such strong rhythm &amp; blues instincts on such Columbia Records hits as "Cry"  and "The Little White Cloud That Cried" that the singles sounded revolutionary  at the time.  </P> <P> Though Ray's records mostly sound dated now because of the timid, pop-framed  musical backings, you can hear in his vocal interpretation the soulful drama  and abandon that would become a fixture in modern pop music.  </P> <P> It was ironic then that the arrival of rock in 1956 meant the end of Ray's  reign as a major record seller. Where he had 13 Top 20 hits before 1956, he  only had two after that pivotal year.  </P> <P> Even if he had been a rebel in the earlier pop world, Ray was rejected by the  new teen rock crowd as someone who belonged to a different era. The emphasis  was on the new and the young, and Ray -- who was 29 when Elvis Presley's  "Heartbreak Hotel" entered the sales charts -- just didn't fit.  </P></p>

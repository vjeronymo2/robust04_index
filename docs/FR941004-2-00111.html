			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The United States cannot at present commit to a larger contribution to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES budget. The United States is the largest single contributor; under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the United Nations scale, the United States is asked to provide 25 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the annual operating budget. In Fiscal Year 1994, Congress appropriated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $1 million to the Department of State for this purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the United States recognizes the heavier workload being imposed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretariat, Standing Committee, and both the Animals and Plants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. External Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet; no position  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is possible at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> External funding refers to the financial support by Party governments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-governmental organizations for projects that have been approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standing Committee. The CITES Parties have established a process whereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Standing Committee approves projects and approves donors, to avoid even  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Secretariat's report on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue is expected to summarize approved donors, approved projects, projects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that have been funded, and approved projects that are awaiting funding.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service, the Department of State, and the National Marine Fisheries  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Service have made substantial contributions to externally funded projects,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including travel of delegates from developing countries to COPs, support  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for committee meetings, facilitating a meeting of the Working Group on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport of Live Specimens, biological studies of significantly traded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species, review of national laws for the implementation of the Convention,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> numerous enforcement-related projects, and other similar projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> XII. Committee Reports and Recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Animals Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. This agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> item has two subitems in the provisional agenda:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Report of the Chairman  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Regional representation on the Animals Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The United States supports the active role of the Animals Committee in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scientific and management issues pertaining to animal species listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CITES Appendices. Encourage membership which will continue the active role  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Animals Committee, and selection of a Chair with a strong commitment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a proactive Animals Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Animals Committee report may contain information or recommendations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealing with Appendix II species subject to significant trade, marking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> techniques, crocodilian tagging, sea turtle ranching, care for and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reintroduction of seized live animals, and various other issues. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> United States has actively participated in the work of the Animals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee since COP8, and will continue to be an active participant in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Animals Committee functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Animals Committee is currently composed of individuals representing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six CITES geographic regions: North America, Central and South America and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Caribbean, Asia, Oceania, Africa, and Europe. Each CITES Region  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently has one representative on the Animals Committee. The Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives are selected by their respective regional caucuses, at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> COP. A new Chair will be selected by the new Animals Committee, most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> likely during a meeting to be held at the close of COP9.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Plants Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No document has been received from the CITES Secretariat yet. The United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States supports the continued activities of the Plants Committee to improve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the effectiveness of CITES for plants, with a focus on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> publication of checklists and identification guides; significant trade in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> orchids, succulents, and other species; review of the timber trade; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trade in artificially propagated plants. Encourage membership which will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue the active role of the Plants Committee, and selection of a Chair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a strong commitment to a proactive Plants Committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

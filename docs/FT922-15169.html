			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Election 1992: Sharp fall in 'Tory gainer' stocks seen SHARES that might benefit from a Conservative victory dropped sharply yesterday, falling twice as far as the FT-SE index of big-company stocks. Shares that might benefit from a Labour win dropped by much less. 'Conservative gainers' are now over 9 per cent lower than at the start of the campaign, while 'Labour gainers' have dropped only a third as far. A number of shares did particularly badly. Courtaulds Textiles, which might face higher costs from a minimum wage, dropped 16p or 3 1/2 per cent to 431p. SG Warburg, the merchant bank, which might lose corporate finance business if a Labour government clamped down on takeovers, dropped 20p or 4 per cent to 471p. Thames Water, threatened by tighter Labour regulation, dropped 10p, nearly 3 per cent, to 335p. Meanwhile, a poll of City fund managers found that 89 per cent expect the election to result in a hung parliament. Labour will be the single biggest party, according to 48 per cent, while 41 per cent think the Conservatives will have the most seats. Most - 46 per cent - think the Liberal Democrats have conducted the most impressive campaign. None consider the Tory campaign the most impressive, while 30 per cent chose Labour. However, 80 per cent think the Tories have the best long-term economic programme, compared with 9 per cent for the Liberal Democrats and 6 per cent for Labour. The survey was conducted by Gallup for Smith New Court, the securities house.</p>

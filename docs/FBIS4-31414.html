			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Meciar, chairman of Movement for a </F> Democratic Slovakia, by an unidentified correspondent; place and  date not given; reprinted from EXTRA SLOVENSKO No. 22: "One  Hundred New Priorities"]    [Text] [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If the Movement for a Democratic  Slovakia [HZDS] wins the elections, what course will its program  pursue?    [Meciar] Many issues have been resolved compared with 1992.  Slovakia has become an independent state, and its foreign policy  orientation is also clear. The transformation process is  continuing. It is necessary, first and foremost, to deal with  economic issues. Our domestic conditions also need to be  arranged afresh. If we win the elections, we will have new  policy priorities in the HZDS. Our strategy is changing; the  next four years will require something different from what it  has been up to now.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If you were to win the elections, would  you sever all links to the current government, or would you  carry on with the things you consider to be good?    [Meciar] This government has made several mistakes. It has  halted the construction of the state and the state  administration. It has, admittedly, implemented a verbal  continuity, but, in fact, it prefers a different strategy for  economic life. While we chose the strategy of recovery, it is  proceeding toward a strategy of restriction. It favors a  different form of privatization; it is returning to what was  rejected in 1993. So, we could not follow up on this. We would  have to go back to 1992.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] If you were to lose the elections, would  you leave politics?    [Meciar] Probably, yes. I am offering the citizen an  alternative. If you do not want it, fine, you have others.    [EXTRA SLOVENSKO] Why do you not have a good personal image  in many countries? What do you intend to do to change this  situation?    [Meciar] First and foremost, if we win the elections, the  Foreign Ministry has to improve. Every state and its  representatives make a name for themselves abroad via the  professionals, which is something I personally have not made use  of yet. We also never had a foreign lobby, although the  potential for organizing one from among Slovaks is great. We  never knew how to address them properly. We have to change this.</p>

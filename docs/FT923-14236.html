			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Suspects kidnap warning CARIBBEAN countries have attacked last month's US Supreme Court decision allowing abduction of suspects for trial in the US, Canute James reports from Port of Spain. At their annual summit in Trinidad this week, Caribbean Economic Community (Caricom) leaders said the ruling was 'a violation of the most fundamental principles of international law'. It should be condemned 'unequivocally' by the international community, and all countries should conform with extradition treaties. Delegates said several Caribbean governments had been 'angered' by the US ruling, but none had yet decided to discontinue co-operation with US law agencies on fighting drug trafficking.</p>

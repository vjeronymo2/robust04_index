			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Emission Generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of the registration requirements, F/FA manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required to conduct a detailed characterization of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion and evaporative emissions of their products, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as biological tests in which animals are exposed to these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. The next sections describe the methods specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rule for generating the emissions to be used in these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chemical and biological tests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As proposed in the NPRM, combustion emissions are to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generated using applicable portions of the FTP. <FOOTCITE>22</FOOTCITE>  To control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some of the inherent variability of FTP emissions generated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transient engine operation, <FOOTCITE>23</FOOTCITE>  this final rule requires the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a mixing chamber or other apparatus (see Section VI.B.2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This is one of the approaches discussed for consideration in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reopening Notice. EPA is permitting the use of either the engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamometer or the chassis dynamometer for emission generation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during biological testing using FTP or FTP-equivalent cycles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed in the Reopening Notice, EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decided to require the use of non-catalyzed emissions (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> untreated exhaust emissions) <FOOTCITE>24</FOOTCITE>  for biological testing in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to assure that the test animals are exposed to the full range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission species potentially resulting from the combustion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs. A brief summary of the rationale behind this decision is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 22 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Test Procedure (FTP) are the standard exhaust and evaporative emissions test procedures described in 40 CFR part 86 and used by EPA to certify new vehicles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 23 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Transient engine operation is achieved by varying the engine speed and/or engine load, which typically results in an emission stream varying in quantity and composition over time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 24 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Exhaust emission not subject to an aftertreatment device such as a functional catalyst or particulate trap. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program is not to test the effectiveness of emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices or to directly evaluate the emission performance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various vehicles and engines. Rather, it is to examine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential toxicologic effects of the emissions produced by F/FAs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in use. With modern emission control technology in place, most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the ambient air pollutant species attributable to automobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust come from two sources: Malfunctioning vehicles (``high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitters'') and normal vehicles during their cold start period,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when their engines run rich and their catalytic converters have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not yet reached effective operating temperatures. The variety of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions from these two important sources are not well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represented by hot, catalyzed exhaust generated from well- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintained, modern vehicles. Emissions during the cold-start  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include hundreds of organic chemical species which are generated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the catalytic converter reaches its effective temperature.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Once the catalytic converter is warmed-up, its efficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increases to the point where only a dozen or so simple compounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remain in readily measurable amounts in the catalyzed exhaust.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, the use of catalyzed exhaust in the biological testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program would exclude from the tests relevant emission species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that could potentially be harmful to human health or the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> environment. In fact, laboratory animals would be exposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only very few of the organic emission species associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combustion of the fuel or additive of interest. In contrast, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ambient air normally contains the full range of combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions, since cold-start emissions are continuously reintroduced and some ``high emitters'' are always in operation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since humans experience long-term exposure to these emissions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes it is important that they be included in the test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exposure atmosphere. EPA's analysis <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  of non-catalyzed emission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data demonstrates that emissions that receive no aftertreatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> represent a comprehensive aggregate of characteristic combustion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products at enriched concentrations, including the species which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may otherwise be emitted only during the cold start or by high- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emitting vehicles. In order to simulate emissions that include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the full range of potential species produced in the combustion of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> F/FAs, EPA is requiring the use of non-catalyzed emissions for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> biological testing in this program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See memorandum from Stephen Mayotte to Docket A&hyph;90&hyph;07 (Item No. IV&hyph;B&hyph;02) regarding ``Engine-out versus Tailpipe Emissions in Light-duty Vehicles.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the exception of exhaust after-treatment devices, this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule requires that all normally required emission control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment be present and fully operational on all test vehicles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and heavy-duty engines used in the generation of non-catalyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions. In order to maintain the appropriate operation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exhaust system while obtaining non-catalyzed emissions, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the use of non-functional aftertreatment devices (e.g.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a blank catalyst with no catalytic wash coat) in order to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simulate the back pressure, residence time, and mixing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characteristics usually provided by normally functioning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aftertreatment devices. Special emission generation allowances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the testing of specific additives which are introduced for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use in conjunction with certain aftertreatment devices are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed in Section VI.F.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

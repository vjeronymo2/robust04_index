			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Indian trade hit by plague panic India's businessmen were yesterday counting the growing economic cost of the plague, with tourism and food exports the two sectors hardest hit. The disease, which has killed about 50 people with another 2,500 cases suspected, has disrupted the travel trade and exports. Hotels and tour operators, gearing up for the tourist season, have reported cancellations by groups from Europe, the Far East and North America. Some business visitors have cancelled trips. At least three trade fairs have been postponed. Trade with the Gulf states, worth Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.8bn) a year, has been badly affected by Gulf governments' decisions to close air and sea links with India. The biggest impact is on exporters of fresh food, who rely on the Gulf for 70 per cent of overseas sales, worth Dollars 177m last year. 'After three years of effort in promoting exports we are back at square one,' said Mr Gian Nega, assistant director of the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority. Health officials, including Dr NK Shah, the resident representative of the World Health Organisation, accused the Gulf countries and other states that have cut trade links of over-reacting. The Indian government has launched a campaign aimed at calming the fears of tourists, business travellers and importers of Indian goods. Mr T. Khanna, commerce secretary, expressed concern at the potential damage to Indian trade. 'There has been a panic reaction from some of our trading partners. But I believe it will soon blow over.' In London, Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said the countries that had imposed restrictions on travel and imports risked hampering efforts to deal with the problem. 'We are trying to create an atmosphere where people have confidence that plague is no longer an incurable disease,' he said. An official of KLM, the Dutch airline, in Delhi estimated that 25-30 per cent of tourists who had planned to travel to India by KLM this week and next had cancelled. Other European airlines, including British Airways, Lufthansa and Swissair, also reported cancellations by tourist groups. The disease claimed two lives in the capital, Delhi, yesterday - the first reported deaths outside the western city of Surat where plague broke out last week. In the the UK, the health department said yesterday its plague surveillance system had identified eight people showing flu-like symptoms 'who may be infected'. But the Communicable Diseases Surveillance Centre said later that medical tests had cleared seven, while the eighth was unlikely to have the plague. Growth forecast, Page 3</p>

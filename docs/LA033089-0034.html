The National Weather Service said tornadoes  touched down near Nacogdoches, Lufkin and Huntington, Tex., and Anacoco, La.  There were no reports of injuries or serious damage. More than 14 inches of  rain fell at Longview and 13 inches at Henderson, Chalk Hill and Atlanta in  east Texas, the weather service said. Six inches fell at Hope, Ark., and nearly  that much at Texarkana. Some roads were flooded and others were washed out in  northeast Texas. Some homes in Texarkana reported 2 feet of water inside. A dam  failed near Henderson and some people had to be rescued from trees by boaters.  In Panama, Okla., the Poteau River was 6 feet above flood stage. The weather  service reported 11 inches of snow at Petersburg, N. D., 7 inches at Larimore  and 4 inches at Grand Forks.  </P></p>

Latvia's response to Kozyrev's statements was not reckless  because the full text of his speech contains the same ideas of  continued military presence in the Baltic region as the  ITAR-TASS news agency reported earlier.    The Jan. 19 statement by Baltic prime ministers also does  not  misconstrue Kozyrev's words in the conference of Russian  diplomatic corps representatives.    Andrejevs described Kozyrev's comments as ambigous. They  allow for various interpretations, the minister noted.    The Latvian Government was also troubled because the  statement followed President Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow,  Andrejevs said.    The U.S. State Department, however, demanded Russian  clarifications on the statement "if the news accounts on  Kozyrev's comments are accurate."    This leads to believe that Russia did not coordinate its  political course with the U.S. Government, Andrejevs said.    State Department spokesman Michael McCurry said Jan. 19 that  Kozyrev's comments are "certainly at odds with statements by  President Yeltsin in Moscow and certainly (are) at odds with  things that we've been told by high officials of the Russian  Government in our meetings in Moscow and prior to Moscow."    As reported, Kozyrev spoke out against a complete withdrawal  of Russian troops from the Baltics and other former states of  the Soviet Union because of Russia's vital interests.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by "a responsible source" at the Foreign Ministry </F> of the State of Qatar]    [Text] The State of Qatar has voiced support for the  Security Council Resolution No. 924 on the situation in the  Yemeni Republic and its constant position on the need to end the  fighting between the Yemeni brothers and resort to dialogue to  solve the problem. The State of Qatar, however, has voiced  reservations over two paragraphs of the statement issued  yesterday, 5 June 1994, at the end of the session of the  Ministerial Council of the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] on the  situation in Yemen, because these two paragraphs do not refer to  the legitimate name of the fraternal country, the Yemeni  Republic, as mentioned in the Security Council resolution. In  addition, the two paragraphs do not note the importance of  preserving Yemen's unity that was set up by consent and public  referendum.</p>

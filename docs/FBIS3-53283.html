But Israeli defence ministry spokesman 'Oded Ben-'Ami denied  the report.    "Israel will free 3,500 detainees when the accord is signed  and will release all the rest before July 13 provided those  belonging to (anti-autonomy) factions pledge to stop the armed  struggle," 'Arafat's Fatah said in a leaflet.    General elections are supposed to take place in the  Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on July 13, according  to the self-rule accord signed by Israel and the Palestine  Liberation Organisation in Washington four months ago.    But an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories has  already been delayed one month.    About 11,000 Palestinians are still held in Israeli prisons  according to international humanitarian organisations.    Israel released 101 Palestinians on January 7.</p>

			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARCHDIOCESE PAYS $358,000 TO FAMILIES IN MOLESTATION CASE  </P> <P> A Roman Catholic archdiocese has agreed to pay $358,000 to the families of  three former altar boys who allegedly were sexually molested by a British  priest.  </P> <P> The church authorities returned Father Anton Mowat to England for treatment  instead of reporting him to police, the Atlanta Constitution reported this  week.  </P> <P> Mowat fled a treatment center there and currently is a fugitive.  </P> <P> Mowat, who spent two years as associate pastor of Corpus Christi Catholic  Church in suburban Stone Mountain, was charged last year with molesting four  boys, ages 12 to 14, during the 12-month period ending in October, 1987.  </P> <P> The out-of-court civil settlement involves three of the four boys.  </P> <P> The archdiocese agreed to pay $30,000 each to the three parents or guardians,  with a total of about $107,000 in other compensation plus $161,000 in attorneys  fees going to two of the guardians, according to court documents.  </P> <P> The church also agreed to undisclosed "deferred payments" to two of the victims  after they reach the age of 18.  </P> <P> Parents reported the molestations to the archdiocese, assuming that the church  would contact authorities.  </P> <P> Sent back to England, Mowat vanished from a Catholic center where priests are  treated for various psychological or behavioral problems. Church officials in  England reportedly were unaware of the indictment.  </P></p>

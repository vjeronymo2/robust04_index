			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / How To Spend It: And for the rest. . . For all who find the very idea of sending little bibelots or billets-doux to their loved ones too soppy to contemplate, here are some of the alternative suggestions for marking St Valentine's day that my male colleagues have come up with. MIKE TYSON: A copy of Emily Post on etiquette. NEIL KINNOCK: A video of From Russia with Love. KEVIN MAXWELL: A ouija board SIR BOB REID (BR): A second-class season ticket on Network South-East JOHN MAJOR: A year's supply of Grecian 2000 BORIS YELTSIN: A Raisa Gorbachev dummy. EDITH CRESSON: A copy of The Life of Houdini ROBIN LEIGH-PEMBERTON: Samuel Brittan's collected essays TINY ROWLAND: A gift voucher from Harrods GERALD RATNER: A Mickey Mouse watch JAQUES DELORS: A colour-by-numbers picture of Margaret Thatcher NORMAN LAMONT: An Aladdin's lamp.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 9 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Tsutomu  Hata said Saturday he does not think a general election will be  held in the next six months in spite of the political disruption  stemming from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's abrupt  announcement on Friday that he would resign.    Hata, also deputy prime minister who is thought to be one of  the most likely candidates to succeed Hosokawa, was speaking at  the 25th trilateral commission plenary meeting held in Tokyo.    "There is no need for Japan to hold an election now," he  told  the audience, saying that even Diet deliberations have not begun  on the 1994 budget.    Hata, who leads Shinseito, warned the new electoral system  for the House of Representatives enacted in January may be  scrapped if the next general election is held under the current  multiseat electoral system.    The new electoral system combines single-seat districts and  proportional representation seats. But a new electoral map has  not been drafted yet.    "There are some Diet members who say an election under the  current electoral system would be more advantageous for them,"  he said, adding that such assertion may gain power in the  political unrest.    Hata also said whatever kind of a new administration comes  about, there will be no policy changes that conflict with  Hosokawa's reform drive.    The foreign minister said it will not be clear until next  Monday whether he can go to Morocco to attend a ministerial  meeting from April 12 to 15 to sign the final agreement on the  General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade.    During the gathering, Hata is expected to discuss with U.S.  Trade Representative Mickey Kantor on resumption of bilateral  framework trade talks.</p>

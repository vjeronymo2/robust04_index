			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Mucklow improves to Pounds 10.1m The tentative revival in the UK property market helped A&amp;J Mucklow Group, to a 4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 9.67m to Pounds 10.1m, for the year to June 30. Mr Albert Mucklow, chairman of the property development and investment company, cautioned that the recovery in both rental income and capital values was 'slow and patchy,' and unlikely to show through to group profits for some time. 'The ball is still in the tenants' court. But rents have stopped falling now, and we are beginning to see the start of some recovery.' Rental income and turnover edged forward to Pounds 20.53m (Pounds 20.12m). But some of the positive signals seen at the interim results stage had faded in the second half. Evidence of this was seen in the group's industrial vacancy levels, the 245,000 sq ft decline in the first half falling to 27,000 sq ft during the second half. However, the overall industrial vacancy level dropped nearly 300,000 sq ft to 1.48m over the year. Mr Mucklow said that starts on two new projects - a 48,000 sq ft factory and office block and a smaller office development in Birmingham  - had been made. 'We wouldn't have started unless we were confident that the market is improving,' he insisted. He added that the West Midlands commercial property market seemed to be in a healthier state than the southern regions. Mucklow had also acquired two new properties, at a cost of Pounds 4.33m, since the year-end. One is a 6,200 sq ft partially let office building in Birmingham, the other a 135,000 sq ft industrial estate in Mitcham, Surrey. A review of the company's portfolio had resulted in a valuation marginally up on the previous year at Pounds 221m. Earnings per share rose from 6.42p to 7.53p, while the net asset value advanced from 144p to 157p. The final dividend is 3.2346p for a total of 6.286p (6.103p). The shares fell 12.5p to 146.5p.</p>

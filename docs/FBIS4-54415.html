			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague April 28 (CTK) -- Thirty-six percent and 29  percent of Czechs respectively consider themselves right or  centre- orientated, a poll conducted by the Institute for Public  Opinion Research (IVVM) at the turn of April revealed. Five  percent of Czechs are on the extreme right, 18 percent on the  left and one percent on the extreme left, the poll showed.    The average rating (on a scale from 1 for the extreme left  to  7 for the extreme right) is 4.47, slightly less than in March  (4.47) [as received], but still more than in November (4.38).    The right-wing orientation is most noticeable among Praguers  (4.69), students (4.94), people under 29 (4.81) and people with  tertiary education (4.72). Farmers (3.93) and the elderly  (people over sixty, 3.98) are at the opposite pole of the  political spectrum.</p>

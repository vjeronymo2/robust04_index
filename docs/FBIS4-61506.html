			<p>BFN     [Text] Mayor of St Petersburg Anatoliy Sobchak has said the  authorities were doing their utmost to try to ensure perfect  security for western business there. He was speaking on  Thursday while meeting Swedish Prime Minister Karl Bildt who  arrived in St Petersburg to attend Swedish Days there.    In this connection, Sobchak pointed to widespread western  rumors that St Petersburg had become a highly dangerous place  for business activity.    About a month ago, the U.S. consulate in St Petersburg  compiled a report about the city's rampant crime which was later  published by U.S. newspapers. The report warns businessmen and  tourists against visiting St Petersburg and expresses concern  over high crime rates in the region ahead of the Goodwill Games  which will involve U.S. sportsmen.    Sobchak and Bildt have both expressed satisfaction over the  state of relations between Russia and Sweden.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT CURING THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S ILLS  </P> <P> Despite repeated calls for action, the serious deterioration in our health  system continues unabated.  </P> <P> The California Legislature recently adjourned from an otherwise productive  session without achieving progress on this issue. The Board of Supervisors was  forced to slash the Indigent Medical Services budget by an incredible 54%. The  Medi-Cal network has essentially disintegrated with the decision by Fountain  Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center to withdraw from the program and  the appearance that another major hospital is ready to do so. Worst of all,  there seems to be no major consensus solution on the horizon.  </P> <P> This situation has severely restricted access to needed health services for  millions of Californians. Many people have been forced to seek routine care in  already overloaded and underfunded emergency departments, the only guaranteed  access point to our health system.  </P> <P> A study of 1,000 UCI Medical Center emergency patients found that 25% regularly  use the emergency department for their basic health needs. This phenomenon has  led to overcrowding, trauma center closures, ambulance diversions and hospitals  choosing to downgrade or eliminate emergency services. This affects all  citizens, rich and poor, who may be less able to get timely emergency care.  </P> <P> While the United States spends nearly 12% of its gross national product on  health care, by far the most of any nation, we rank just 20th in infant  mortality, and our life expectancy is only average. There are a host of factors  that explain this apparent paradox. In a study of emergency admissions at UCI,  we found that patients with restricted access who delayed in seeking care had a  25% longer and more expensive hospital stay.  </P> <P> Inadequate public discussion of ethics and resource allocation has led to high  societal and legal expectations of unlimited care as a basic right. This has  forced physicians to practice defensive medicine by ordering unnecessary tests  and procedures, costing about $50 billion to 100 billion annually. Because of  the immense complexity of insurance forms and regulatory oversight mechanisms,  the United States leads the world in administrative spending, with more than  20% of total costs. We have made no serious attempts at comprehensive planning,  public education or prevention of illness. California spends $18 billion each  year for health and societal costs related to alcohol and tobacco abuse.  </P> <P> Despite the scope and magnitude of the health care crisis, and the plethora of  reform recommendations from many panels and commissions, the legislative  solution remains elusive. The reasons include lack of consensus among the major  players, lack of political will to make difficult decisions and lack of  political pressure from voters.  </P> <P> Any comprehensive plan must involve the following:  </P> <P> 1) Health insurance. Everyone, including the poor and "uninsurable," must have  some form of insurance providing access to basic services and long-term care.  This system should be primarily based on employers, with cost tied to personal  income. Insurance plans must be more standardized and simplified and cannot be  left solely to market forces.  </P> <P> 2) Tort reform. Reasonable standards of care with a clear medical-legal linkage  must be developed. Removing this problem from the courts and instituting some  form of binding arbitration would be in the best interests of everyone and  would save billions yearly in defensive medicine costs. By removing "blame"  from the system, all patients who are injured or suffer an unavoidable bad  outcome could be quickly and fairly compensated.  </P> <P> 3) Emphasis on prevention/wellness. We need to establish financial incentives  for wellness, such as tax credits or insurance rebates. Our system often makes  it difficult to receive screening exams, immunizations and prenatal care, while  we routinely incur enormous spending in covering intensive care and  high-technology, in-hospital services.  </P> <P> In lieu of the big-fix solution, immediate stabilizing measures are required.  Late last year, the Orange County Emergency Medical Care Committee unanimously  passed a cost-effective, seven-point, short-term plan in anticipation of the  evolving crisis. It calls for using tobacco tax money; supporting mandatory  motorcycle helmet legislation; supporting stiff penalties for drunk drivers and  implementing all available cost recovery mechanisms for alcohol-related  injuries; developing a high-profile education campaign stressing disease  prevention; supporting a requirement for state-mandated auto insurance to  include a basic health package; creating a disaster mode in which good-faith  providers who serve the uninsured could be deputized to limit liability, and  developing an emergency prioritization list for county Indigent Medical  Services money.  </P> <P> The November election represents a golden opportunity for voters to authorize  needed resources. Proposition 134, the nickel-a-drink alcohol tax initiative,  would raise more than $730 million annually for law enforcement, mental health,  public education, alcohol treatment centers, emergency and trauma care and  battered women shelters. A broad coalition supports the initiative.  </P> <P> California has the lowest overall alcohol tax in the nation. The wine tax was  last raised in 1937, the beer tax in 1959 and the spirits tax in 1967. The  annual revenue of $129 million from these taxes offsets just 1% of the total  societal cost of alcohol abuse, with taxpayers subsidizing 99%. As 11% of the  population consumes 68% of the alcohol, Proposition 134 is an initiative that  all of us can support.  </P> <P> The view from the front line is not a pretty sight. Our health safety net is  full of gaping holes large enough for any of us to fall through. Your  constructive participation in the political process could make the difference  in saving lives.  </P></p>

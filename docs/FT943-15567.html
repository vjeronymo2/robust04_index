			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Media sector The advertising recovery has come earlier and stronger than even the optimists expected. The Advertising Association now expects spending to grow by 13 per cent this year and 10 per cent next. The question for investors is how best to lock into the upswing. Advertising agencies are the obvious places to look because almost all their income is linked to spending by their clients. Yesterday's results and cut dividend from Gold Greenlees Trott are a reminder that the spoils will not be spread evenly. There are similar arguments for selectivity among media owners. National newspaper companies seem intent on reinvesting higher advertising revenue in lower cover prices, although it is doubtful whether they will make a decent return on this investment. Regional newspapers could be caught in the crossfire: it will be difficult to raise the cover prices of leading regional titles while national alternatives are cheaper. The better opportunities may lie in radio - which has been gaining market share - and magazine publishers. Even though radio shares have raced ahead over the last year, not all the good news may yet be in the price. Recent takeovers - including Reuters buying the new London radio company even before it started broadcasting - shows the appetite of industry insiders. Despite the impressive swing out of recession this year, advertising spend may not grow much faster than the wider economy in the 1990s. If that happens, the best investment opportunities will lie in sectors which are taking a larger slice of the cake.</p>

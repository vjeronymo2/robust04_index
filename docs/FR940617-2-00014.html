			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Best Information Available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Customs shipment data suggest that there were sales of subject merchandise during the POI. Because MOFTEC and most of the potential respondents failed to provide information concerning whether there were such sales, the Department, in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, must base its preliminary determination on best information available (BIA).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining what to use as BIA, the Department follows a two-tiered methodology, whereby the Department normally assigns lower margins to those respondents who cooperate in an investigation and margins based on more adverse assumptions for those respondents who do not cooperate in an investigation. Since the potential respondents in this case did not cooperate, we assigned a BIA margin based on the most adverse assumptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, BIA is the information contained in the petition, as amended on November 24, 1993. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See Initiation of Antidumping Duty Investigations: Silicomanganese from Brazil, the People's Republic of China, Ukraine and Venezuela,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 64553, December 8, 1993.) The amended petition provides only one margin, listed below, for all PRC producers and exporters of silicomanganese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Circumstances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioner alleges that critical circumstances exist with respect to imports of silicomanganese from the PRC. Pursuant to section 733(e)(1) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.16, we analyzed the allegations using the Department's standard methodology.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To find critical circumstances, the Department must determine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhere of the same class or kind of subject merchandise, or the importer knew or should have known that the producer or reseller was selling the subject merchandise at less than its foreign market value; and 2) there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over a relatively short period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have not found a history of dumping of PRC silicomanganese in the United States or elsewhere. According to Department practice, however, we will impute knowledge of dumping to importers of subject merchandise when the dumping margin exceeds 25 percent in purchase price situations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see Preliminary Determination on Silicon Carbide from the PRC <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 58 FR 64549, December 8, 1993). In this case, the estimated dumping margin for silicomanganese imports from the PRC is 150.00 percent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We consider imports of merchandise under investigation to be massive if there has been an increase of 15 percent or more over a relatively short period of time. For the preliminary determination, we were able to obtain import data through the month of March. To determine whether there have been massive imports of silicomanganese from the PRC, we compared the import volume for the month in which the petition was filed, November, and the four months subsequent to that month with the import volume for the five months prior to the filing of the petition, using Department of Commerce shipment data. We found that the import volume of silicomanganese during the period subsequent to the filing of the petition was massive, increasing by 426.83 percent over the previous period's import volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the foregoing reasons, the Department preliminarily finds that critical circumstances exist in this case.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Suspension of Liquidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 733(d)(1) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of silicomanganese from the PRC that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date 90 days before the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the amount shown below. These suspension of liquidation instructions will remain in effect until further notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,9 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 --> &blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Manufacturer/producer/exporter <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Weighted-average margin percentage <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=1 --> All exporters <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 150.00 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ITC Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITC of our determination.

The revolutionary spirit of our people who are advancing  along the straight road of chuche finds a graphic expression in  that they firmly arm themselves with the great chuche-based idea  of socialism and think and act only in accordance with its  requirement and that they are making strenuous efforts to defend  and thoroughly implement the party's line and policies, the  article says, and continues:    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, basing himself on the  chuche idea founded by the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song, has  developed and perfected the idea of socialism from a new angle.  The chuche-based idea of socialism proves that socialism is the  most advanced society where the popular masses are the masters  of everything and everything serves them and which is steadily  developed by their concerted efforts. As our people have firmly  armed themselves with the chuche idea they cherish the justness  of the socialist cause of chuche as their faith and dynamically  advance along the road of socialism without wavering under any  anti-socialist whirlwind.    Today our people's struggle to defend and build socialism is  immediately a struggle to implement the party's line and  policies. At the 21st plenary meeting of the 6th party Central  Committee our party, on the basis of a profound analysis of the  changed circumstances and the realistic demands of our socialist  construction, set the three years to come as a period for  adjustment in socialist economic construction and put forward a  strategic agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign  trade-first policy. Our people find their way in the line and  policies of the party and deem it as the requirement of a worthy  life to defend and implement them and turn out dynamically to  this end. As they have a definite stand toward the party's line  and policies, our people are displaying a high revolutionary  spirit and militancy and creating new miracles and feats in  carrying them through.    The revolutionary spirit of our people is also manifested in  solving all problems by themselves in the high revolutionary  spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, the article says.    Noting that it is the revolutionary spirit of our people to  decisively counter the base maneuverings of the enemies with  redoubled courage in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance  and fortitude, the article stresses that for this the  foundations of our independent socialist national economy are  firmly consolidated with each passing day and our political,  economic and military might strengthened still further.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Beninese Human Rights Commission and the  Independent Parliamentary Group have each responded to the  interior minister's ban on the union rally at the Cotonou Labor  Exchange on 25 January, saying in communique that they deplore  the interior minister's violation of demonstration rights.    [Unidentified reporter] In its communique, the Beninese  Human  Rights Commission refers to Article 25 of the 11 December 1990  Beninese Constitution, which stipulates that the state  recognizes [words indistinct] the conditions fixed by the law,  the freedom of movement, the freedom of association, the freedom  to meet, the freedom to stage marches and demonstrations. The  Beninese Human Rights Commission therefore states that in light  of that, the interior minister's decision is arbitrary and  illegal. It therefore condemns the minister's decision and  calls on the government to take necessary measures to ensure  that such acts are not repeated in Benin.    The Independent Parliamentary Group also referred to Article  25 of the Beninese Constitution and reminded the public that  such actions should not be tolerated in the country. [passage  omitted]</p>

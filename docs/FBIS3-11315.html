According to the Cesar police, Edilberto Duran Osorio, Edna  Barbosa, Sandra Quintero, Hernando Rueda, Teresa Caselles  Casadiego, Nancy del Rosario Herrera, Ramon Elias Chichilla,  Yesid Augusto Rincon, Maria Carrascal, Jose del Carmen Porras,  Obdulio Herrera, Freddy Antonio Leon, and Nixa Salome Sanchez  were released yesterday morning.    The officials had gone to coordinate the district elections  in La Palestina, Puerto Nuevo, and El Hobo, Rio de Oro  Municipality. In addition, reports by the police and the  Departmental Office indicated that close to 3,400 citizens who  had registered to vote in the rural areas of Rio de Oro,  Aguachica, and San Diego were unable to due to pressure from the  guerrillas.    The Bolivar police stated yesterday morning that the ELN  burned the tally sheets (approximately 1,000 ballots) in the  Tache, San Jacinto de Achi, Bermudas, and Mejico District, Achi  Municipality. The attack came when the voting officers of four  villages were traveling on the Magdalena River to bring the  ballot boxes to the municipality's capital city. The  delinquents intercepted them and destroyed the ballot boxes,  voting lists, and other documents.    Colonel Hector Castro Cabrera, Bolivar police commander,  said  nobody voted in Pinones District (with a potential of 160  voters), Mompox Jurisdiction, and denied reports that San Pablo  Mayor Manuel Rudas Ruedas had been kidnapped.    The murder of voting officer Luis Arnulfo Campana Lloreda  and  the theft of two ballot boxes in Agua Sal District, Bagado  Jurisdiction, shattered the calm surrounding the vote-counting  process taking place in El Choco Department. The incidents  occurred at about 1000 in the morning when the four members of a  commission were walking toward Bagado carrying the ballot boxes  containing 373 votes. According to an official report by the  Choco police, an ELN group took the commission members by  surprise and later killed Campana.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Franchises lift Harry Ramsden's EXPANSION OF its franchise activities enabled Harry Ramsden's to increase profits for the year to September 30 from Pounds 548,595 to Pounds 561,491. Revenues from the franchises more than made up for a downturn at the company's original restaurant in West Yorkshire. The USM-quoted fish and chip restaurant company said that the brand had been successfully established at Glasgow, Blackpool and Heathrow airport. Further expansion is planned for this year with the possibility of openings in Hong Kong and the Middle East. It is also buying Merryweather's, a small chain of fish and chip shops. Turnover, relating totally to the West Yorkshire restaurant. fell to Pounds 1.85m (Pounds 1.93m). Net interest received declined to Pounds 115,960 (Pounds 216,254) and there was a share of associates' losses of Pounds 5,971. Earnings per share were 6.8p (6.6p) and a proposed final dividend of 3.5p leaves an unchanged total of 4.5p. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 34,275 covering the costs of moving from the Third Market to the USM.</p>

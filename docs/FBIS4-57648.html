			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 20 May (EFE) -- Today, the Peruvian Government  said President Alberto Fujimori refused to meet Amnesty  International (AI) representatives because he believes it is  "inadmissible" for them to request a change in the country's  laws.    Peruvian Justice Minister Fernando Vega said: "Lawyers from  New York or AI cannot be allowed to request the change of the  country's laws or judicial procedures." He added: "It now seems  that Americas Watch also wants to come to Peru."    AI Secretary General Pierre Sane from Senegal has been in  Peru since 14 May, heading a delegation that met with Lima  Archbishop Augusto Vargas Alzamora and relatives of the missing  and people detained in Lima and Ayacucho. Minister Vega said  Sane requested the appointment of a commission composed of  notables in order to effectively guarantee human rights. Vega  said: "The foreigners' visit, who in two days are telling us how  we should administer justice, cannot be tolerated. This is an  excess that cannot be allowed."    Vega again rejected the request for changing Peruvian  antiterrorist laws by saying the Repentance Law, which is blamed  for the arrest of innocent people accused of terrorist  activities that have not been adequately proven, should not be  changed. Vega said: The law says the accusations must be  clearly proven before any arrests are made. He added, however,  that there are judges who do not implement the law correctly but  there are certain corrective mechanisms in the judicial branch  and the Prosecutor's Office for that purpose.    Pierre Sane will meet today with members of the Peruvian  Congress Human Rights Committee to request changes in the  Repentance Law. He also will insist on the formation of a  commission of notables. Sane believes these requests do not  interfere with Peruvian sovereignty.    Sane said AI has asked the U.S. Government for the formation  of this type of commission, which he said already exists in  other countries. Sane sent a letter to the Peruvian Government  last April to announce his arrival on 15 May and requested a  meeting with President Fujimori, the Armed Forces' chiefs, and  police.    Vega answered that because of the prejudice and negative  attitude shown by AI regarding respect for human rights in Peru,  Sane will not be received.</p>

			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Survey of Latvia (2): After a severe crisis, hopes are high for a better future - Economy / The first three years of independence have seen hard times The severity of the crisis which has existed in Latvia's economy is evident from the fact that manufacturing output has more than halved. In every sphere where the country did well in Soviet terms - production of electrical goods, buses, railway wagons, wood products, leather goods - it has suffered contractions of up to two thirds compared with former production levels. The economy is in the end about the well-being of the people within it and by the crudest measure of that, the death rate, Latvia also does poorly. Life expectancy has sunk (as it has, but usually by more, elsewhere in the former Soviet Union), over the past two years - largely because men are dying almost three years earlier than they used to at a little over 60. The first three years of independence have been hard on the people: it gives the dwindling band of pro-Soviet enthusiasts who still turned out earlier this month (in their hundreds now rather than their thousands) to mark the anniversary of the October revolution at the spot where the statue of Lenin used to stand, something with which to tarnish the achievement of the creation of the new state. Reforms, too, are benefiting the growing middle class, but not, so far, the general population. The restitution of pre-war property has created overnight a rentier class which can live comfortably on the proceeds of their properties, especially if they can be let to businesses. The privatisation of services, including medical services, has meant that doctors and dentists, traditionally very badly paid, can now command high fees quite openly, where previously they resorted to asking for 'presents'. This has allowed the standards of service to go up - but, as Maija Dukate, head of Riga's largest (private) dental clinic admits, 'it doesn't look so good if you're on a pension of 30-odd lats a month'. The hardship and the figures are not a matter of dispute: interest must now focus on whether or not the headline last week in one of the business papers  -'The Worst is behind us: now it gets better' - is likely to be true, or is merely a reflection of a hopeful government looking for re-election. Mr Maris Gailis, the prime minister, said confidently: 'We will see growth next year of between 3 and 5 per cent in the economy and we also think we will keep inflation down to around one per cent a month.' (It is presently a little above that). In part, the prime minister's confidence derives from an increasingly popular view that the decline in the Latvian economy has reached the bottom. In part, it also reflects a belief that the strict financial regime imposed by the Central Bank with the acquiescence - sometimes grumbling - of the political leadership has laid the basis for real non-inflationary growth. The country's finances have been the most unambiguous success the Latvian leadership has enjoyed. The Bank is independent, with its chairman - Mr Einars Repse - and its council appointed by parliament but thereafter not dismissable for a six year term. In 1992, it lifted most restrictions on foreign exchange, liberalised interest rates and introduced the 'Latvian rouble' at a floating exchange rate. In October 1993, the Bank brought in the lat, a purely Latvian currency. This was not tied to any national currency but in 1994 was brought into line with the IMF's SDR (special drawing right) unit. The currency reforms brought down an inflation rate of close to 1000 per cent a year in 1992 to about 35 per cent last year, and it is forecast to fall to about 24 per cent in the current year, and to half that figure in the next. The lat, the face value of which is the highest of any of the post-Soviet currencies, appears to have successfully inserted itself into the national economy - playing the role taken rather earlier by the kroon in Estonia, as at the same time a symbol of sound money and independence. Mr Ilmars Rimshevics, the young deputy governor of the Central Bank, says that there is pressure from the government and from manufacturers. 'Many of them think we are too independent, but so far the success we have achieved in inflationary terms has shown that we are on the right course,' says Mr Rimshevics. Success has been achieved not only in introducing the currency: the bank has also re-organised itself by shedding most of its branch network, creating from some of the former branches a new commercial bank, Unibank, and selling others to independent banks. It has also sought to extend a network of regulations, one result of which has been that 10 banks have lost their licences. Of the hot money said to be coursing through Latvia's financial system, Mr. Rimshevics says carefully that 'a lot of the capital coming into Latvia is from the east (Russia), and there is not much information about it. If we did get some information that it was illegal we would of course co-operate with the authorities in investigating it'. Mr Rimshevics also says that the Bank will probably soon wind down the programme with the IMF which has served it so well - though he says that 'a memorandum with the IMF would probably still be useful to us at this stage'. He is confident, too - unlike his counterparts in Russia - that foreign banks can only assist the banking community in Latvia through competition. The Central Bank has no intention of keeping foreign banks out of the country - though so far only one bank has been issued a full licence and one other bank given permission to open a representative office. Mr Andris Piebalgs, the finance minister who professes himself as strict a monetarist as any central banker, says that he is going to insist on another very tight budget in the coming year - with a total income of Lts940m, of which only Lts40m-50m will be financed by a deficit. At the same time he is presenting a new tax code to the parliament, which would bring the high rates of profit tax down from between 35-65 per cent to a flat rate of 25 per cent - the rate also set for income tax. He is a little more cautious than the Prime Minister, forecasting 3 per cent growth for next year - but says that an annual inflation rate of 11 per cent for 1995 'looks more or less real'. He sees clearly enough that his country's producers and exporters are still suffering, that life as a pensioner on Lts31 a month is very hard, that teachers and civil servants are getting by on little more - all in the midst of a city in which wealth for the fortunate is clearly exploding. 'But to loosen up now is to lose everything, and we won't do it,' he says.  -----------------------------------------------------------            AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT (1990 = 100)  -----------------------------------------------------------                             1990    1991    1992   1993  ----------------------------------------------------------- All output                   100      96      81      63   of which   crops                      100     105      94      93   livestock                  100      92      76      50 Sown area of crops '000ha                     1,627   1,621   1,572    1426  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Latvian Ministry of Agriculture  -----------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------                    GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT           (in 1990 constant prices - 1990 = 100)  ----------------------------------------------------------- Year  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1990                                               100.0 1991                                                91.7 1992                                                60.8 1993                                                46.0 1994*                                               46.0 1995*                                               51.5 1996*                                               51.5  ----------------------------------------------------------- * Projected  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Latvian Government, Bizness i Baltiya  -----------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------                FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO LATVIA  ----------------------------------------------------------- Year                                               Dollars  ----------------------------------------------------------- MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL AID  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1992                                            51,441,160 1993                                            27,486,904 1994                                            39,870,087  ----------------------------------------------------------- PHARE (EUROPEAN UNION) ASSISTANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1992                                            16,250,000 1993                                            13,182,000 1994                                            30,625,000  ----------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL  ----------------------------------------------------------- 1992                                            67,691,000 1993                                            40,669,404 1994                                            70,495,087  ----------------------------------------------------------- Source: Finance Ministry, department for External resources  -----------------------------------------------------------</p>

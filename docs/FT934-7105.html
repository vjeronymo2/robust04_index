			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Drug sales sickly as health ministries strive to cut costs Drug sales in Europe have stagnated in the wake of reforms aimed at curbing spending on pharmaceuticals in Germany, Italy and the UK. Sales in pharmacies in the seven biggest European markets, which together form the world's biggest drugs market, were static at constant exchange rates during the first nine months of this year, according to IMS International, the market research group. In dollar terms they fell from Dollars 38.4bn (Pounds 25.7bn) in the first three quarters of 1992 to Dollars 34bn in the same period this year. Further reforms to limit pharmaceuticals spending, recently announced in Spain and Portugal, will add to the pressure on sales. France is also expected to reveal a new drug pricing scheme. Pharmaceuticals companies are also struggling with sluggish growth in the US, the world's biggest single market. This grew only 4 per cent from Dollars 31.9bn to Dollars 33.2bn. Sales have been held back by the growing power of bulk buyers of health services who can negotiate ever-greater discounts. The Japanese market, the world's second largest single market, rose 13 per cent in yen-terms, up from Dollars 11.3bn to Dollars 14.6bn. However, a 7 per cent price cut is expected to be introduced next year by the ministry of health and welfare. The slowdown in Europe was mostly the result of a collapse in sales in Germany, Europe's largest market. These dropped from Dollars 10.9bn to Dollars 9.3bn, a fall of 10 per cent at constant exchange rates. German pharmaceuticals groups, often highly dependent on domestic sales, suffered by more than the 10 per cent headline figure, however, because of changes in doctors' prescribing habits, away from expensive patented products to cheap non-patented ones. During the first four months, sales at the seven largest research-intensive drug manufacturers fell 16.5 per cent, while sales at the four largest generic companies increased 36 per cent, according to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. As a result, most drugs companies operating in Germany have announced restructuring programmes. The Italian market also declined, from Dollars 8.4bn to Dollars 6.2bn, a drop of 3 per cent excluding currencies. Drugs sales, excluding exchange rates, increased in five of the seven largest European markets. French pharmacy drug purchases rose from Dollars 8.93bn to Dollars 8.96bn, an increase of 6 per cent at constant rates. Drugs purchases in the UK fell in dollar terms from Dollars 4.1bn to Dollars 3.7bn, but rose 11 per cent in local currency. The Spanish market was one of the strongest in Europe. Although sales fell in dollar terms from Dollars 3.7bn to Dollars 3.3bn, they rose 12 per cent excluding currencies. The Dutch market was also strong, registering a 12 per cent rise, although the market was static in dollar terms at Dollars 1.1bn. The Belgian market was also static at Dollars 1.1bn, but increased 5 per cent excluding currencies. However, growth in France, the UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium was insufficient to offset the decline in Germany and Italy. In the seven largest European markets, the hardest hit categories of drugs have been for cardiovascular problems, muscular-skeletal complaints such as arthritis, and blood agents , for which all registered sales declines compared with the first nine months of last year. Sales of alimentary and metabolism drugs, mostly for ailments such as stomach ulcers, were static.</p>

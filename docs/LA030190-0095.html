			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WATER EMERGENCY DECLARED IN VENTURA;  </P> <P> CONSERVATION: THE CITY COUNCIL DELAYS DISCUSSION OF A RATIONING PROPOSAL AFTER  AGREEING THAT A DROUGHT-RELATED SHORTAGE EXISTS.  </P> <P> The Ventura City Council declared a water shortage emergency early Tuesday  morning after a lengthy public hearing in which dozens of residents begged for  exemptions and proposed alternatives to the city's stringent water conservation  proposal.  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously to declare the emergency but postponed discussion  on the water conservation ordinance. Mayor Richard Francis said he was  exhausted after hearing more than five hours of public testimony that stretched  the Monday evening session into Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's a reasonable person in this city who doubts there's a  drought," Vice Mayor Donald Villeneuve said after introducing the emergency  resolution.  </P> <P> But the murmurs from the 20 or so residents who remained in the City Council  chambers to witness the vote made it clear that not everyone agreed that the  city needs the type or magnitude of the proposed water conservation measures.  </P> <P> City officials said that because of low rainfall over the past three years,  water reserves from the Ventura River, which is the major supplier of water to  eastern Ventura, are about one-third short of demand. The Lake Casitas  Reservoir, which supplies west Ventura, have dwindled too, officials said.  </P> <P> Because of complicated legal arrangements between the city and the Lake Casitas  Water District, the district only provides enough water to cover the west  side's needs, further compounding the city's problems.  </P> <P> The draft ordinance outlines water quotas for residences, businesses and  institutions, with penalties of up to 10 times the normal water rate for  excessive use.  </P> <P> Residents would be given fixed quotas, plus bonuses based on their average use  over the past three years, if their average exceeds their allocation. Residents  of single-family houses would receive one-third more water than residents of  apartments, condominiums and mobile homes.  </P> <P> Businesses, institutions and fruit growers would be forced to reduce water  usage between 15% and 20% but would not be regulated by a quota system.  </P> <P> Another provision would ban all new water service hookups, which amounts to a  moratorium on new construction.  </P> <P> The council must decide among five options in implementing that provision. The  most stringent would block the construction of 1,662 units, the least stringent  would block 103 proposed units.  </P> <P> The city's goal is to reduce water usage by 30%, Francis said.  </P> <P> Monday's hearing was the second in as many weeks on water rationing. About 300  people packed the City Council chambers and spilled into an adjoining  auditorium, where the meeting was shown on television monitors.  </P> <P> About 45 speakers disputed just about every provision of the proposed  ordinance, although almost all acknowledged that the city had to take immediate  action to conserve water.  </P> <P> Growth advocates blasted city officials for trying to eliminate hookups. They  said city officials should more aggressively pursue alternative water sources,  including state-owned water from Northern California.  </P> <P> "Just think of all the painters, plumbers, tile people, where would they all  go?" if the city enacts a building ban, asked Ted Temple, who runs a small  construction business. "This community has to maintain some sense of vitality."  </P> <P> No-growth supporters criticized city officials for considering the use of  state-owned water, which they contended would lead to further development.  </P> <P> "I've heard enough from these whining, cement-loving developers. . . . If we  import state water, it's all over for Ventura," Bill Loci said.  </P> <P> City Manager John Baker told the audience that it is impossible to tailor the  conservation ordinance to meet everybody's needs. He said that is why an appeal  process for residents who would suffer undue hardships from water rationing had  been included in the ordinance.  </P></p>

			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Caldwell rises to Pounds 321,640 Profits of Caldwell Investments, the USM-quoted investment and holding company, rose from Pounds 220,060 to Pounds 321,640 pre-tax for the year to October 31. Turnover improved by Pounds 1.47m to Pounds 5.77m. Part of the increase stemmed from sterling's devaluation against the D-Mark and Swiss franc while increases in sales and gross margins of 34 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively reflected organic growth. Earnings emerged at 3.15p (1.62p) on a net basis or 2.94p fully diluted. The directors intend to propose payment of a dividend for the current year.</p>

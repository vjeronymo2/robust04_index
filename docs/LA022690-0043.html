			<p><P> February 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> FANTASIES ABOUT LIFE, NATURE  </P> <P> Modern fantasies about early native Americans living in harmony with nature are  just that -- fantasies, according to anthropologist Timothy Kohler of  Washington State University. He has found that the prehistoric Anasazi of  northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado significantly altered the  plant and animal mixes near their settlements.  </P> <P> The effect on the environment occurred through wood harvesting for fuel and  construction, field clearing and burning. This slash-and-burn strategy was  initially successful, Kohler said, leading to population growth, but eventually  populations became too dense to support this land-intensive agriculture.  </P> <P> Kohler suggested that human impact on the environment in the Dolores  Archeological Project area in southwestern Colorado eventually caused the  residents to leave the area after a 300-year occupation. Residents had to move  elsewhere to get enough to eat, he said.  </P></p>

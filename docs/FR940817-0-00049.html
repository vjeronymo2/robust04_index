			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Fifty-two commenters objected to establishing a separate process for Service managers, including district directors, deputy district directors, officers in charge, and assistant officers in charge, to request the Commissioner's authorization to exercise each of the enforcement authorities. The commenters stated that this process would hold managers to a higher standard than their subordinates, many of whom are trainees still on probation, who are automatically empowered to exercise an authority if they have completed the requisite training. The commenters asserted that this process violates standard management hierarchy, and pointed out that the vast majority of affected individuals are career immigration officers who not only have completed basic immigration law enforcement training, but also have extensive experience in field enforcement operations. In fact, due to the Service's limited enforcement resources, these managers participate frequently in Service field enforcement operations or respond to requests for assistance from other law enforcement agencies when their subordinates are out of the office conducting field operations. The commenters asserted that managers in other agencies within the Department, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are vested with the same powers and authorities as their subordinates, and the Service's managers should not be treated differently if they have undergone the requisite training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service and the Department agree that a more streamlined process should be established for granting enforcement authorities to Service managers who are trained and who have maintained qualifications. The rationale behind the proposed rule's segregation of managers was to ensure that law enforcement authorities are granted only to those immigration officers, regardless of rank, who need the authorities and are fully trained in how to exercise them. To accomplish this task more expediently while ensuring the existence of a well-trained cadre of immigration officers at all levels in the agency, the final rule provides enforcement authorities to managers who have successfully completed basic immigration law enforcement training without creating a separate authorization process. The final rule also provides a mechanism for empowering those managers, as well as other immigration officers within one of the designated categories, who have not successfully completed one of the basic immigration law enforcement training courses by allowing them either to attend one of the basic immigration law enforcement training courses or to seek a determination from the Commissioner, with the Deputy Attorney General's approval, that they have training substantially equivalent thereto. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters stated that each immigration officer should have the power to exercise all of the enforcement authorities as long as each such officer is trained and certified. They stated that the proposed regulations created a rigid class system wherein only certain categories of immigration officers would be authorized to exercise certain enforcement functions and that this system impedes the Service's ability to respond to operational emergencies. In addition, some commenters stated that the enforcement role of immigration inspectors at ports of entry and the field review work and office interviews conducted by immigration examiners necessitate empowering both inspectors and examiners with all of the enforcement authorities. The Service and the Department disagree. In drafting the proposed rule, the Service used the Attorney General's ``Guidelines for Legislation Involving Federal Criminal Law Enforcement Authority'' (Guidelines) dated June 29, 1984. Although the Guidelines were developed to guide federal agencies in preparing legislative proposals concerning future grants of law enforcement authority, the Guidelines' overriding policy is that an officer should be given only the authorities that the officer needs and has been trained to execute. The Guidelines require an agency to extend grants of law enforcement authority only to those employees who have graduated from an accredited course of training in the exercise of that authority and only where a significant likelihood exists that, in the course of performing their assigned duties, the employees will frequently encounter situations in which it is necessary to exercise that authority. Each category of immigration officers has a different mission, and only those categories who satisfied the Attorney General's criteria were granted one or more of the enforcement authorities. In reviewing these regulations, consistent with the Department's review of other regulations, guidelines, and policies affecting criminal law enforcement authority in the Executive Branch, the Department believes that the same delineation of authorities is both appropriate and effective. The following chart summarizes the categories of immigration officers who are authorized to exercise the principal enforcement authorities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

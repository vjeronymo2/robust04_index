Have national significance in terms of their impact or replicability in that they develop products, services and techniques that may be used in other States; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Create and disseminate products that effectively transfer the information and ideas developed to relevant audiences in State and local judicial systems or provide technical assistance to facilitate the adaptation of effective programs and procedures in other State and local jurisdictions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A project will be identified as a ``Special Interest'' project if it meets the four criteria set forth above and (1) it falls within the scope of the ``special interest'' program areas designated below, or (2) information coming to the attention of the Institute from the State courts, their affiliated organizations, the research literature, or other sources demonstrates that the project responds to another special need or interest of the State courts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Concept papers and applications which address a ``Special Interest'' category will be accorded a preference in the rating process.

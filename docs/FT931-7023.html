			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Leading Article: When industry fears the worst day by day the toll continues. The scale of the cutbacks at some of Britain's leading companies is striking. Is UK industry in a self-reinforcing spiral of pessimism? Behind the wave of cuts lie the pressures of an agonisingly long-drawn-out recession. But there are also deeper trends. In all developed countries, there is a steady fall in the proportion of the labour force engaged in manufacturing production. The shrinkage of employment in the manufacturing sector as a whole - a drop of 16 per cent in the UK since 1988 - if anything understates this, since more and more manufacturing workers have service-type jobs, in design, marketing, after-sales, and so on. Europe must also cope with the restructuring of production and distribution during the creation of an integrated regional economy. Any individual European economy is likely to gain jobs from this process as well as lose them - but in hard times bad news is always more striking than good. Though services are destined to play a larger role in future employment, they have been undergoing their own shakeout, in both the US and the UK. Middle-managers in big companies, clerks in banking and insurance, stockbrokers and telephone engineers - no service occupation has been immune. Deregulation and privatisation are special cases of this trend. At worst, these forces are inescapable. At best, they contribute to the long-term health of companies and the economy: everyone gains from the cost savings forced on British Gas by its regulator. Still, there was something in the tone of yesterday's message from ICI - the emphasis on continued cost-cutting, the born-again ruthlessness about businesses which fail to meet profitability targets - that hints at the emergence of a mood of contagious pessimism among British industrialists. That darker mood will serve a purpose if it is accompanied - as at ICI  - by a willingness to address difficult strategic issues. Companies that do not ask themselves such questions are not helping their shareholders or their employees. Pessimism alone is not a strategy.</p>

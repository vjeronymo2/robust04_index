			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The Farnborough Air Show: Recession forces Airbus to delay launch AIRBUS INDUSTRIE, the European aircraft consortium, has been forced to delay the launch of a smaller derivative of its A320 narrow-body aircraft until the end of this year, or possibly next year, because of the financial difficulties of airline customers. Although the European consortium has launched a marketing campaign with seven airlines, Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus chairman, said yesterday that the consortium would not achieve its original target of securing sufficient commitments for its new A319 airliner by the end of this month. The A319 is designed to expand the Airbus narrow-body airliner family with a shortened derivative of the 150-seat A320. Airbus is already developing a 180-seater derivative of this aircraft, the A321. Mr Pierson acknowledged at the Farnborough Air Show that Airbus had underestimated the length and breadth of the airline industry recession. He said: 'Back in January last year, we did not believe the industry would face such a difficult time.' The industry's problems had been increased by the continued airline fares war and over-capacity in the market. Airbus would have to review its production programme before the end of this year to make the necessary adjustments in the face of the industry's short-term problems. But it did not expect to be forced to make drastic production cuts because it had already launched a production adjustment programme. It expects to deliver between 163 and 165 new aircraft this year, about the same as last year. Mr Pierson said sales would show a modest increase from Dollars 7.4bn in 1991 to Dollars 7.5bn this year. Airbus also expects to show an operating surplus of around Dollars 250m. By the end of this year Airbus expects its order backlog to total about 900 aircraft. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets and Airbus's principal competitor, is also being forced to reduce production. Mr Philip Condit, Boeing's new president, confirmed that the US company would cut production of its 737 narrow-body jets from 21 to 14 a month next month and also planned to reduce production of its larger 757 narrow-body airliner from 8.5 to 7 a month next year. Boeing had received commitments for 147 airline orders so far this year and its backlog of firm orders stood at about 1,500 aircraft. Boeing is also preparing to step up competition in the narrow-body airliner market by proposing to develop a larger version of the 737 to compete against the Airbus A320. Both Boeing and Airbus confirmed they were continuing to study the development of a 600 to 800-seater jumbo airliner. The two companies said the launch of such aircraft, not expected before 1997, would depend on market demand. However, many industry executives believe the development of super jumbos would have to entail significant international collaboration, including possibly even between Boeing and Airbus, because of the development costs. The Farnborough show is open to the public from tomorrow until Sunday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "SN-froe": "FPOe Organization Invited </F> Iraqis"]    [Text] Salzburg -- This week an Iraqi economic delegation  has been allowed to make propaganda in Austria for lifting the  UN sanctions. It paid a midday "official" (provincial press  service) visit to Salzburg. According to the Freedom Party of  Austria [FPOe] group of the provincial parliament, the  delegation had been invited by the "Group of Liberal  Entrepreneurs" (RFW), whose federal chairman is Helmut  Haigermoser, an FPOe deputy in the federal parliament. The  Iraqis were received by Margot Hofer, the future third diet  president of the FPOe. Hofer reported that the Iraqis had  pointed to the "disastrous humanitarian situation" and the "high  infant mortality." If this is true, the sanctions should be  lifted, she said.    Last year a trip by FPOe politicians, including Haigermoser,  to Iraq, which is being boycotted by the international  community, sparked harsh criticism. The FPOe delegation visited  Baghdad at the invitation of Husayn's regime.</p>

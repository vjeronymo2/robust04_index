			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Wage-Related Costs (Core). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For most hospitals, the wage-related costs used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> develop the wage index would be limited to ``core'' wage- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related costs. The list of ``core'' wage-related costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> includes all commonly recognized costs (which are similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fringe benefits used for cost reimbursement purposes) that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute significantly to the wage costs of a hospital and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that are readily identifiable on the hospital records.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These costs will also be listed on the revised HCFA&hyph;339  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> form, and hospitals will be required to provide the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary with a detailed description of the wage-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs in Exhibit 7. This description will allow the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary to review the appropriateness of each wage- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related cost. We believe that this core list includes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virtually all significant wage-related costs, including  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those costs that are required by statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To develop the list of core wage-related costs, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MTAG task force established a number of specific criteria.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To be considered a core wage-related cost, one or more of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following criteria must be met:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The wage-related cost is provided at a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial cost to the employer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The wage-related cost is of a type and nature that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would generally be offered as a fringe benefit by most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The perceived value of this wage-related cost is of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such importance that it would influence an individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The wage-related cost is a mandatory requirement under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal or State law (for example FICA, Federal and State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unemployment, etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Fees paid to external organizations that are directly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associated with the core wage-related costs may be included  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as part of the wage-related cost (for example, actuarial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees, claim administration fees, IRS form preparation fees,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> etc.).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following is the proposed list of core wage-related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Retirement Costs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 401(k) employer contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Tax sheltered annuity (TSA) employer contributions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Qualified and non-qualified pension plan cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prior year pension service cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Plan Administration Costs (Paid to external  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organization):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 401(k)/TSA plan administration fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Legal/accounting/management fees_pension plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employee managed care program administration fees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Health and Insurance Costs:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Health insurance (purchased or self-funded)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Prescription drug plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dental, hearing, vision plans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

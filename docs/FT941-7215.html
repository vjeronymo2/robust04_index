			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Goldsborough flotation hit by high price Applications for the public offer of shares in Goldsborough Healthcare were still being counted last night but it seemed the offer would not be much oversubscribed. The flotation valued the group at Pounds 74.5m, with 83.6 per cent of the shares being sold. Of these, 65 per cent were placed with institutions and the remaining 35 per cent, 12.8m shares worth Pounds 21.8m at the 170p offer price, were available to the public. Some analysts felt the pricing was too high, and the fall in the stock market affected interest in the shares. The float enabled Kunick, the leisure group, to sell its 50 per cent stake, and allowed NatWest Ventures to realise some of its investment.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fernando Rospigliosi in the "Controversies" </F> column: "Obscurity-Transparency"]    [Text] The changes that the pro-government majority is  introducing into the electoral system, under the pretext of  making it more efficient, only cast new shadows on the  transparency of that system.    The installation of a computation section in each voting  place, where all the tallies of the sections are gathered and an  additional tally is prepared with the total number of votes at  that location, complicates the counting, makes it more  troublesome, and slows the process unnecessarily.    The simplest and fastest way is precisely what is not done:  send in each section's results as these partial results are  obtained. In this way, unnecessary problems are avoided, such as  those caused by a situation where, in a voting station where  there are 30-40 sections, the transmission of results can be  delayed for many hours because of the need to compile a new  tally, and because one or two of those sections will probably  lag behind the others.    In the recent election in Panama, where I was an observer,  the sections--each one had up to 350 voters--closed at 1600. At  2000, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal announced the partial  results and continued to broadcast the results as the counting  proceeded. At 0800 on the following day, the president of the  Tribunal appeared on television and announced the vote count,  which was almost 90 percent complete. In other words, an almost  definitive result. A little later, the president of the republic  received in the palace the winning candidate, who had won by a  narrow margin of 4 percent of the vote.    In Peru, for simple balloting such as the plebiscite of 31  October 1993 in which there were only yes and no votes, the  National Electoral Board took two months to announce the  results. There was never any reasonable explanation for that  monumental delay, which contributed to the  plebiscite--justifiably--being called into question.    In Panama, the Electoral Tribunal used a system called TER,  Unofficial Transmission of Results. (In reality, it is  provisional or partial, but not unofficial, because it is  carried out by an official organization.)    The TER was based on a very simple form that the secretary  of  each section filled out as soon as the tallying was completed,  and which was then turned over to an employee of the Tribunal,  who was responsible for a certain number of sections. This  employee then turned over the form to a supervisor, who sent it  to a collection center where it was fed into a computer. The  system worked uninterruptedly. If one or two sections were  delayed in closing, they did not slow the process. There were 25  tallying centers in the country that were connected to a central  computer, on the screens of which the results automatically  appeared as soon as they were entered. All the news media--and  therefore the public--had immediate access to the results.    These results were provisional, because they were announced  before any decisions were made over possible challenges. But  unless there are many such challenges, the final result would  not change significantly.    In its turn, the Commission for Justice and Peace,  affiliated  with the Catholic Church, established a system of "parallel  tallying" of votes, which is a form of surveillance of the state  by society. This system was what permitted the Church to  denounce the fraud perpetrated in 1989, when General Manuel  Noriega tried to manipulate the electoral process and deny the  victory of the civilian opposition, which had won with 70  percent of the vote.    Although the situation had changed in 1994 and the  Commission  for Justice and Peace had complete confidence in the Electoral  Tribunal, it conducted--for the last time--the parallel tally.    To do this, they organized some 1600 volunteers, one for  approximately four electoral sections. These volunteers took  note of each section's results and turned them over to one of  the 150 supervisors who visited the voting places. The results  were transmitted by telephone, fax, or radio to one of the  Commission's three tallying centers in the country--the center  in Panama City had 40 computers and as many telephone  lines--which in turn sent the results by telephone line (modem)  to a central computer.    Thus, in the space of a few hours, this parallel system  tallied approximately 80 percent of the votes cast, obtaining a  result with a margin of error of less than one percent.    These systems, the official one as well as the parallel  tally, are used with minor variations in almost all the  countries of Latin America. Only in Peru are obsolete systems  maintained and attempts made to prevent a parallel tally. The  reasons are not technical, as no great sophistication nor  mysterious technology is required.    With a few computers, telephone lines--and radios--and  reasonable organization, reliable results are obtainable in a  few hours.    The problems are political, and they relate to attempts by a  civilian--military clique to perpetuate itself in power, and  which will not hesitate to thwart the people's mandate, if it  can.    This is why the next weeks and months in determining the  electoral system and mechanisms will be decisive.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jericho, Occupied West Bank, April 5 (AFP) --  Twenty-six Palestinians who were exiled by Israel returned to  the occupied territories on Tuesday [5 April] to bolster  preparations for self-rule, military officials said.    The group, nearly all from PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's  Fatah  movement, crossed the Allenby Bridge from Jordan at the second  attempt after the Israeli authorities at first refused to accept  23 of their 46 relatives.    The officials said the group had completed formalities, been  issued identity cards and would shortly pass out of the Israeli  side of the border post.    Another couple of dozen Palestinians were being processed at  the Rafah border crossing from Egypt into the Gaza Strip  following a deal between Israel and the PLO in Cairo last  Thursday.    Of the 26, one is a communist, one independent and one from  Yasir Abd-Rabbuh's moderate Fida' group.    The rest are Fatah men considered vital to efforts to build  autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho.    The exiles were expelled or wanted by the Israeli  authorities  and had fled abroad since Israel seized the territories in 1967.</p>

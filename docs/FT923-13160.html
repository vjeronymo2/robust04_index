			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Earnings up 46.7% at First Fidelity FIRST Fidelity, the biggest bank in New Jersey, yesterday unveiled a 46.7 per cent increase in its second-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 76.3m. The 500-branch bank, whose earnings per share rose from 80 cents to 93 cents year-on-year, has been recovering from property loan losses caused by exposure to Mr Donald Trump and other developers. Mr Tony Terracciano, chairman of First Fidelity, said that while loan demand remains sluggish, earnings were beginning to reflect the benefits of the core retail franchise and a more positive trend in the quality of assets. During the second quarter, First Fidelity's non-performing loans declined by Dollars 60m to Dollars 596.7m. The level of non-performing loans as at June 30 was 25 per cent lower than the Dollars 803m level a year ago. The bank, which with Dollars 29.3bn of total assets is the 25th-largest in the US, said its improvement was helped by a rise in net interest margins and a 10.8 per cent rise in service fees on deposit accounts. Chase Manhattan said it expected to receive Dollars 40m to Dollars 50m in interest payment on cross-border loans to Brazil during the second half of 1992, following the recently-announced agreement between Brazil and its leading bank creditors. The bank received Dollars 9m of interest payments during the second quarter. Chase said that Dollars 557m of its total Brazilian debt of Dollars 1.2bn is presently classified as non-performing. Mr Michael Esposito, chief financial officer, said he expected the level of bad debt provisions to continue at relatively high levels this year.</p>

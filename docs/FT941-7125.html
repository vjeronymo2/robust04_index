			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / US expels top Russian spymaster The US yesterday expelled Russia's senior intelligence officer from Washington, in retaliation after the arrest in the US of a senior Central Intelligence Agency officer on charges of spying for the Russian intelligence service. The State Department said Mr Alexander Lysenko, listed as a counsellor at the Russian embassy but described by US officials as the rezident of Russia's SVRR intelligence agency, had been declared persona non grata and given seven days to leave the US. Washington had asked Moscow to withdraw Mr Lysenko voluntarily after the arrest on Monday of Mr Aldrich Ames, a senior CIA counter-intelligence officer, but the Russian government refused. Mr Mike McCurry, State Department spokesman, said Mr Lysenko 'was in a position to be responsible for the activities associated with the Ames espionage case.' He refused to rule out further expulsions. The scale of the retaliation is considerably smaller than was habitual during the Cold War years. In the last such incident, in 1986, 55 Soviet diplomats were expelled. Mr McCurry insisted that the US still strongly supported political and economic reform in Russia: 'We believe that is just as important today as it has been for months.' The expulsion came after President Bill Clinton had spent the morning urging senior members of Congress not to cut off all aid to Russia in response to the arrest of Mr Ames and his wife, who are due to appear in federal court in Virginia on Tuesday. Mr Clinton called Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House, to persuade them that aid to Russia, for purposes such as reducing nuclear weapons and promoting economic reform, remained in the US national interest. US support for reform in Russia 'does not flow from a sense of charity or blind faith. Our policy is based on our clear American interests, clearly pursued,' Mr Clinton said after the meeting. He won support for the argument that the US should not overreact to the spy incident but it was clear that the request for more Russian aid in the US budget next year is in trouble. Senior members of Congress are increasingly questioning not only the overall amount of aid to the states of the former Soviet Union but also the proportion that goes to Russia. 'While we all agreed that the spy incident would not, in and of itself, warrant reconsideration of aid, there are a lot of other things that do. The Russia-first policy, I think, is increasingly in disfavour in the Congress,' warned Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, senior Republican on the Senate committee that controls foreign aid spending. He had insisted in budget negotiations last year on setting aside a portion of the aid package for Ukraine. That portion is expected to increase this year because of Ukraine's agreement with the US and Russia to give up the nuclear weapons on its territory. Other republics are claiming a larger share, some because they, too, have agreed to abandon their missiles, and others because they have reformed their economies further.</p>

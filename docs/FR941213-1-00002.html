In developing such criteria, the Board is required to allow reasonable opportunity for public review and comment. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7). In order to implement this statutory provision, the Board is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking pursuant to 12 CFR part 211 of its regulations governing international banking operations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Congress in enacting the FBSEA recognized the importance of the comprehensive, consolidated supervision of banks operating internationally. The FBSEA strengthened the role of U.S. banking supervisors as the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> host <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  country supervisors of foreign banks operating in this country. The Act also recognized the importance of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> home <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  country supervision in assuring the overall safety and soundness of foreign banks that conduct operations in the United States by requiring the Board: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. To determine that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive supervision on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor in order to establish a new banking presence in this country; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. To establish, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, these criteria in order to evaluate the operation of any foreign bank in the United States that the Board has determined is not subject to such supervision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As provided in sections 7(e) (1) and (5) of the IBA, as amended, a determination by the Board that a foreign bank is not subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis is a sufficient ground, in and of itself, for the Board to require or, in respect of federal branches or agencies, to recommend, termination of the foreign bank's U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(1),(5). Termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations in these circumstances is not mandatory, however. Instead, in enacting section 7(e)(7) of the IBA, Congress recognized that there may be factors in particular cases that militate against termination of a foreign bank's U.S. operations. 12 U.S.C. 3105(e)(7). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

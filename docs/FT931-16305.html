			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: UAL to axe 3,000 jobs in cost-cutting scheme UNITED Airlines, one of the three largest US carriers, yesterday announced a significant cost-cutting plan involving the axing of almost 3,000 jobs, a 5 per cent salary cut for some management, and reducing the company's flight schedule. The airline's parent company, UAL, said the measures were aimed at reducing annual expenses by around Dollars 400m in the hope it can claw its way back to profitability. The Chicago-based company suffered an after-tax loss of Dollars 165.9m in the first nine months of 1992, and warned yesterday it will also post 'a large fourth-quarter' deficit. There have been signs of a firmer pricing environment for the US airline industry recently, and there are hopes the savage fare wars seen in the past couple of years may be receding. However, Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, claimed yesterday 'the fundamental flaws in our industry are still pervasive and threaten our long-term financial health'. United's action echoes a similar announcement from Delta Air Lines last month, when its Atlanta-based rival unveiled a pay cut for all non-contract staff and cut its dividend to a nominal amount. American Airlines, the third big US carrier, has also warned it expected to shrink by the mid-1990s and has pruned administrative staff numbers. All three airlines have slashed planned expenditure plans for new aircraft - with United announcing in December it was in talks with Boeing to 'reduce significantly' its 433 aircraft on order and option. Yesterday's cost-cutting package by United will lead to a 2,800 reduction in existing job numbers and another 1,900 people will not be hired this year, as previously planned. All United officers and affected US management will take a 5 per cent salary cut, while other employees - in and outside the US - will be asked 'to participate in similar sacrifices'. United also said it would accelerate the retirement of its older aircraft, leading to the grounding of around 40 aircraft in 1993, and reduce non-aircraft capital expenditure across the board by an unspecified amount. The airline will also reduce its domestic schedule and cancel plans to fly certain previously-announced international routes.</p>

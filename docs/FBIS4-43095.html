			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kenan Akin: "Kiev Notes: Demirel's Worries"] </F>   [Text] No matter who says what, Demirel has undergone a  major transformation since becoming president. A brand new  "President Demirel" has supplanted the former Demirel, who was a  fault-finder, prejudiced, and had a passion for trivia.    This new brand of Demirel, who has supplanted Suleyman Bey,  is no longer looking at events on a daily basis. He also gives  the impression that he is sorry about certain things he said in  the past. Furthermore, we have a Demirel who, if not a replica  of the late Ozal, makes us not miss the latter. In protecting  Turkey's interests, Demirel commands an excellent assessment and  grasp of its rights as regards its neighbors and of the  international situation.    President Demirel has clearly identified his country's  internal and external enemies.    He realizes that Turkey is located in a very dangerous zone,  and he is capable of making a serious assessment of the  instability in this zone.    Among Demirel's ideas is the desire to live in peace with  our  neighbors and the world within the existing national borders,  but he is also the first among those who know that this is not,  and will not be, at all easy.    Just like Chief of General Staff Dogan Gures, Demirel too  knew from the very start that "Russia is a threat," and he is  not afraid to state this openly. Again, none but Demirel can  assess Greece's position so well. Demirel, who is deeply  concerned that Turkey is virtually encircled, is making  calculations on how to coexist in this delicate situation.    Vigilance and care not to get involved in a "hot"  entanglement have become Demirel's preoccupation.    As a journalist covering Demirel's visit to Poland, Egypt,  and Ukraine since he became president, I felt the excitement of  discovering these concerns. Truly, President Demirel sees to it  that Turkey does not get involved in clashes and does not suffer  injustice. Notwithstanding his "balanced" statements and  behavior, he is seeking new friendships and strategies.    Demirel's worries are prompting the search for ways out the  situation and long-term political investments. The visit to  Ukraine and Moldova was the product of such a thinking.</p>

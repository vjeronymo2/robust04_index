			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Single market is fast approaching MOST British companies are aware of the single European market. But many are unaware of exactly how it will affect their business. National Westminster Bank is now giving a hand with Pharos, a program designed to run on IBM-compatible personal computers. Once the floppy discs are inserted into the machine the software can be used to select information that is relevant to that company's business. The software, developed by the bank in conjunction with Ernst &amp; Young and the Confederation of British Industry, asks users about their company - products, suppliers, customers and so on. Using expert systems technology, the software then provides advice about how the single market will affect customers and products. The software helps customers to identify the main questions they need to ask and then gives some sources of advice. Pharos is available free but there will becharges for updates to the software - planned at two a year. Contacts: National Westminster Bank: UK, 071 931 1465.</p>

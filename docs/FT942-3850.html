			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Arts: Britain's lost ballerinas - Anachronistic teaching threatens our classical dance Many are called but few are chosen. Children take up ballet, thrilled by what they may have seen in theatre or on television: in its day, The Red Shoes did more to inspire young dancers than anything since Anna Pavlova's world tours. And ballet-training is fine for the young, encouraging a physical co-ordination which can promote a mental discipline no less beneficial. But a career as a dancer in a classical ballet company is vastly different. The combined rigours of a religious order and Olympic training are comparable: I do not suppose that either contains quite such obsessive concern with the minutiae of means, nor such chance of failure. And yet, despite the implicit hardships, young people decide to try for that short - often over by the thirties - and far from heady life in ballet. A recent audition for English National Ballet attracted 500, mostly British, aspirants. After a first weeding-out, just over 100 remained, and of these Derek Deane, ENB's artistic director, and his panel of teachers, found not one dancer suitable for the demands of a company that gives 200 performances a year. Shock Horror, of course, because Deane has made public issue of a matter which he believes to have serious implications for his company and hence for the future of ballet in Britain. He has been obliged to look to artists in Italy, France and America for the forthcoming London seasons at the Coliseum and Royal Festival Hall. Deane's argument, which has caused some much-needed flutterings in ballet's dovecots where the birds seem unwilling to stretch their wings, concerns a lack of serious grounding, even of a will to compete in classic ballet. Technical standards are higher today and, as Deane notes, 'British teachers don't always take this into account. Dancers are athletes - aesthetic athletes, maybe, but athletes nonetheless - and training must always bear this in mind. About half the dancers I took into the company last year needed re-training so that they did not become injured. With our heavy work-load, we must have dancers whose physique and abilities can sustain a very demanding schedule of performance.' The other problem is psychological rather than physiological. 'Apprentice dancers in this country also seem shy of ambition, of drive. These are not qualities of the British temperament. But look at the dancers of the Paris Opera Ballet, sustained by the brilliance of their technical training, or consider the American attitude towards dancing with its 'make or break' belief that one must use one's abilities to the best, or quit.' Ballet training responds to a national ideal. In the Soviet Union, dance reflected the demands of the new socialist aesthetic, it was powerful and yea-saying yet with enormous respect for the great classical past. American ballet mirrored a faster, more acute and energetic culture. By contrast, ballet in Britain now seems underpowered. Over the past decades I have reported with unfailing admiration on the Paris Opera troupe - the evenings given by Jeunes Danseurs, the Opera School performances, pinpoint those qualities of professional gloss and security Deane seeks. In America, New York City Ballet and its School of American Ballet are the exemplars of brightest skill. Balanchine once said that he might be 'remembered as a teacher'. The training he initiated and supervised sought (and found) ideals of clarity, speed, musical acuity, which are as much part of his genius as his choreography. To dancers in class who were not driving themselves hard, he would say: 'What are you saving yourself for?' Deane has noted a weakness of the 'English' style in ballet nowadays. The former virtues of classic harmony, ease, have waned. The English manner was formed under the guidance of Dame Ninette de Valois, whose school and company were the mainspring of British ballet from the 1930s onwards. She fostered a style that was elegant, modest and expressive. But it has not grown with recent years. British dancers now acquire a mixed baggage of influences from teachers of different schools. Identity seems unclear. Internationally, there is now a greater emphasis on physical brilliance in ballet. The arrival of the Bolshoi Ballet in 1955 opened our eyes to a more exultant way of dancing. Developments since then have encouraged audiences to ask for greater and more extreme muscular expression from dancers. Some choreographers make much more searchingly physical, and perhaps athletic, demands on their interpreters than in the past. Virtuousity is something audiences always adore and it is not always provided by British dancers. Comparison with Russia suggests how vital is a coherent system of training. The schooling shaped by Agrippina Vaganova, the accepted means for ballet training since Soviet times, from earliest steps to last professional days, endows the body with exceptional wisdom as well as dignity and physical power. It explains every movement, justifies every step. A Russian ballerina, working with ENB a few years ago, said to me: 'Vaganova taught us how to dance. The girls I see here in class have to learn for themselves.' Deane's associated concern is with the absence of sufficient financial support - through grants, funding - for dance training. For a child seeking a professional dance career, expense can be prohibitive if grants are not available. A two year course at the ENB's own recently established school, for example, costs Pounds 30,000. At the Royal Ballet School, our leading school of classical ballet training, a two year course costs Pounds 16,446. Inevitably many promising pupils are lost at the financial hurdle. But, Deane insists, problems really begin at the start of a professional career 'It is a completely different way of life. You are on your own, and if you don't have a solid basis of serious work in your body, then you are in deep trouble.' 'Is dancing difficult?' I once asked Natalya Makarova. 'Oh yes. Very difficult indeed', was the answer. If it is to be any good, it must be difficult, as every dancer knows. Not to provide classical dancers - extraordinary, dedicated beings - with the best skills, and the ability to use them, is to diminish them, and the art they serve. Deane's comments must be heeded. English National Ballet will be appearing at the Coliseum from July 25; and at the Royal Festival Hall from August 2 Ballet teaching reflects a national ideal. Have we got the classical dance we deserve? The film that launched a thousand plies: Moira Shearer (far left) and Ludmilla Tcherina in The Red Shoes (1948). Today, outmoded teaching, a failure of will and lack of subsidy means British dancers are losing out, says Derek Deane (left) artistic director of English National Ballet</p>

			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. DISSENT IN PERSIAN GULF CONFRONTATION  </P> <P> Whatever else can be said about Hussein, with the release of the hostages it is  clear that he is a brilliant political as well as military strategist.  </P> <P> The Bush Administration appears angrier than the day Iraq invaded Kuwait.  </P> <P> President Bush has tried so hard to show his ability to control world opinion  through the media like his predecessor, but has been upstaged by everyone from  Mikhail Gorbachev to Hussein. Much like the NASA scientists and their faulty  telescopes, Bush is discovering there are no absolute fail-safe formulas for  dealing with the modern world in the 1990s.  </P> <P> If Bush decides to take military action against Iraq to "declaw" its military  capabilities, I suggest he then establish Iraq as a Palestinian homeland.  </P> <P> FREDERICK CLEVELAND  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

Laying ahead of our people are major challenges and  opportunities. These challenges are:    -- The danger of being further left behind economically,  compared with many countries in the region and the world due to  the fact that we started from the lowest point, and that our  growth rate is not high and steady enough, while having to  struggle upward in a fiercely competitive environment.    -- The danger of straying off the course of socialism if we  fail to abide by implementation guidelines.    -- The scourge of corruption and other social ills.    -- Peaceful evolution-related schemes and actions of hostile  forces.    Yet, we also enjoy many fundamental advantages:    -- Our party has a correct policy line and it is united and  single-minded.    -- Our people are diligent, intelligent, and patriotic. They  have good abilities and firm revolutionary willpower and believe  in the party leadership.    -- Our armed forces are absolutely loyal to the  revolutionary  cause of our party and people.    -- The successes obtained in the renovation process are  creating our new posture and strengths.    -- The development of the scientific and technological  revolution and the trend toward broadening world and regional  ties of cooperation and development have brought to us  opportunities to obtain more important resources.    The general targets set forth by the Seventh Party Congress  for the period until 1995 will consist of overcoming  difficulties and ordeals, stabilizing and developing  socioeconomic activities, strengthening political stability,  dispelling negativism and social injustices, and basically  tiding the country over the current crisis.    Over the past two and a half years, we have achieved a  significant part of that target, especially the economic ones.  For the remaining years of our office, we must motivate the  entire party, people, and army to be of the same heart and mind;  to exert extraordinary efforts; to uphold a sense of  independence, sovereignty, and self reliance; to broaden  international relations; practice the motto of industry, thrift,  integrity and righteousness; strive to exploit our advantages;  dispel dangers; overcome ordeals; and successfully achieve the  general targets cited above. We must quicken our pace to  achieve the various aims of the strategy for socioeconomic  stability and development until the year 2000, in a bid to build  a powerful country, a prosperous people, and an equal and  civilized society.    The following are essential tasks:    1. To press for changes in the economic structure in the  direction of industrialization and modernization.    Socioeconomic improvements, together with the expansion and  strengthening of development cooperation with various countries  and international organizations, have allowed us to press ahead  by another step our national industrialization and modernization  to create more jobs, speed up the pace of economic growth, and  further renovate the people's material and spiritual life. This  is a central task of foremost importance for the period ahead.    Industrialization and modernization are the ways to avoid  the  danger of being further left behind, compared to nearby  countries; to maintain political and social stability; to  protect independence and sovereignty as well as the course of  socialist development.    At present, we have not followed the old pattern of  industrialization. We will not repeat the mistakes, hastiness,  and subjectiveness that the Sixth Party Congress has criticized.  Industrialization is in fact to build the material-technical  bases of socialism. This is not a simple question of increasing  the pace and proportion of industrial production in the economy.  Rather, it is a process of structural changes linked with  radical technological renovation to build a foundation for rapid  growth and high and long- lasting efficiency for the entire  national economy.    Industrialization must be accompanied by modernization and  this requires the combination of gradual steps of industrial  development with efforts to seize opportunities to shorten our  process and to form spearheads of development to catch up with  scientific and technological progress in the world.    The orientation, scale, and steps of the process of  industrialization and modernization must be carefully thought  out through a complete understanding of the following important  points:    -- The firm maintenance of independence and sovereignty must  go along with the broadening of international cooperation,  building an open-door economy both at home and abroad,  multilateralizing and diversifying relations with other  countries, combining economic activities with national defense  and security, and linking economic growth with social progress  and social justice, and with cultural development and  environmental protection.    -- Persisting on the strategy of directing vigorous efforts  at exports while replacing imports that can be produced locally.    -- Developing the comparative advantages of the entire  country as well as each area, sector, and domain in a given  period.    -- Constantly improving the competitiveness in local,  regional, and international markets.    -- Taking socioeconomic results as a fundamental standard  for  determining the course of development and for selecting  investment and technological projects.    -- Rapidly exploiting the strengths of the entire country,  of  each region, and sector; appropriately gathering resources for  the various fields of activity and various key areas to promptly  produce high results while paying attention to meeting essential  requirements, working out practical policies, systems, and  measures for localities which have difficulties; stepping up  development cooperation, and ensuring that various regions and  strata of people can benefit from the results of economic growth.    -- Attention must be paid to small- and medium-size projects  that require small capital investments and capital that can be  recovered quickly in accordance with the motto of using  short-term projects to finance long-term ones.    -- Building a number of necessary, large-scale projects.    -- Making intensive capital investments to exploit to the  fullest our productivity and our existing technologies with an  emphasis on projects that affect product competitiveness.    -- Combining traditional technologies with modern  technologies, ensuring the advanced nature of imported equipment  and technologies, giving priority to technologies that need  small capital but which directly or indirectly create more jobs.    -- From now until the end of this decade, great attention  must be paid to agricultural industrialization and to the rural  economy. We must carry out comprehensive agricultural, forestry,  and fishery development in conjunction with efforts to develop  processing industries for agricultural, forestry, and marine  products and for consumer goods manufacturing and exports.    -- Expanding trade, travel, and services in both urban and  rural areas and stepping up other overseas economic activities.    -- Renovating, expanding, upgrading, and selectively  building  infrastructure facilities in the most difficult areas where  development is being hindered.    -- Selectively building heavy industries establishments in  important sectors where there are pressing requirements and in  which we have conditions in terms of capital, technologies, and  marketplace to achieve rapid development and high results.    -- Developing scientific and technological studies and  application, education and training, public health, and  environmental protection to meet immediate and long-term  development requirements.    While exploiting comparative advantages such as cheap labor,  resources, and a convenient location, we must study and read  regional and world development trends, the strategies and  policies of trading partners and rival competitors, and attempt  to discover new opportunities and comparative advantages. We  must foster and develop to the fullest our most decisive  resource, namely the Vietnamese population, for long-term  development and to prepare the necessary conditions for  development along this course.    To carry out industrialization and modernization, we must  mobilize various sources of capital in conjunction with  effective efforts to manage our capital, with the domestic  source of capital being regarded as crucial and the foreign  source of capital as important.    To ensure an average annual growth rate of not less than  eight percent, we must promptly increase the total amount of  investment to over 20 percent of the GDP within the next few  years. This must be higher in the ensuing years along with  efforts to improve the efficiency of capital management. This  requires great efforts and appropriate policies to encourage the  entire society to practice thrift in production and consumption  and to concentrate on investing in production, especially in  material production.    Concentrated investment earmarked from the state budget is  decisive for the growth of the entire economy. It is necessary  to increase the sources of investment capital in targeted  projects by allocating a greater part of the GDP to the state  budget and by attracting all sources of aid and low interest  loans given by various governments and international financial  and monetary organizations. We must audit, inspect, closely  manage, distribute and effectively use our existing public  assets, and must guard against losses and wasteful spending.    The state's capital investment is designed mainly for  building the socioeconomic infrastructure and a number of key,  spearhead industrial establishments, and processing industries  for agricultural, forestry, and marine products, for the  manufacture of export goods, and to cater to export services.  Part of this investment must also be reserved for financing  employment projects and projects to reforest wastelands and bare  hills and expand aquaculture and deep sea fishing activities.    The state will only allocate invested capital to  socioeconomic infrastructure projects and to areas where the  capital is not likely to be recovered. As for the credit loans  invested by the government, it must be returned by users.    We must renovate our managerial mechanism in capital  construction to prevent negativism, waste, and misappropriation  of state-owned capital, especially in planning activities. We  must determine unit price in construction and must verify the  results of the projects. We must use support services, verify  product qualities, [words indistinct] of highly credible local  and foreign companies in this area. Each project must have a  supervisor. If it is a project where the capital must be  recovered, then full amount must be recovered for the state and  within schedule.    We must find all ways to be thrifty and to invest in  development projects of the people and in various firms  belonging to various economic components under various forms.  This must be done in such a way as to ensure that the  potentialities are mobilized and every cent invested will yield  profit. We must gradually increase the proportion of this  source of capital in the total capital investment of the entire  society.</p>

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Sandvik earnings slide 29% SANDVIK, the Swedish specialty steel and carbide group, yesterday reported a 29 per cent fall in profits after financial items, to SKr1.9bn (Dollars 315m) for 1991. It plans a dividend increase to SKr9 from SKr8.50 despite the earnings decline. It also expects demand is likely to remain slack this year, with a possible further fall in profits if the recession deepens. Sales fell 4 per cent to SKr17.5bn as orders dropped 5 per cent. All divisions experienced weaker earnings. The cemented carbide group, the company's biggest unit, saw earnings slip by 25 per cent to SKr1.18bn. Earnings for the steel division tumbled by 42 per cent to SKr279m, while the saws and tools unit posted a SKr16bn loss against a profit of SKr91m in 1990. The Process systems division had the smallest earnings decline, with a 16 per cent drop to SKr166m. Sandvik said it would eliminate 1,000 jobs this year from its labour force of more than 26,000, and has reserved funds in its 1991 accounts for this restructuring measure. Kemira, the Finnish state-owned chemical group, yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of FM522m (Dollars 116m) for 1991, against a profit of FM139m in 1990. It blamed weak demand for titanium dioxides and fertilisers, two of its main product areas. The price of fertiliser also fell in Europe last year due to growing imports from eastern Europe. Sales fell 5 per cent to FM10.8bn. Profitability was also harmed by rationalisation measures, including the closure of facilities in Finland, Sweden, the UK and Belgium. However, Kemira expects results to show a recovery this year.</p>

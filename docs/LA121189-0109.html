			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JEW WHO SAW HITLER GREETS NEW CRUSADE IN HOMELAND;  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY: CORONA DEL MAR MAN, A SURVIVOR OF THE NAZIS, RETURNS HOME TO FIND  A NEW COUNTRY IN THE MAKING.  </P> <P> As an 8-year-old Jewish boy in Hamburg, Max Wolfsberg saw Hitler. He and his  family survived anxious moments during the frightful Kristallnacht in 1938, and  they fled Germany the following year, a week before the Nazis launched their  invasion of Poland.  </P> <P> Fifty years later, Wolfsberg -- now a chemistry professor at UC Irvine -- was  back in Germany, and once again witness to momentous events: the collapse of  the Communist regime, the beginnings of democracy in East Germany and the  dismantling of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> "It was overwhelming," Wolfsberg said. "I'm completely convinced it's  irreversible."  </P> <P> Wolfsberg had been invited to Leipzig for a month as part of an interacademy  exchange administered by the National Academy of Sciences. He had been there  before to attend conferences, had taught as a visiting professor at a West  German university, and was well aware of the changes beginning to sweep through  Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> But neither he nor his wife was prepared for the blistering pace of the  political maelstrom they soon found themselves in.  </P> <P> They saw marches of half a million people in Leipzig, the cradle of the  uprising. They attended a classical music concert that turned out to be fraught  with political meaning. And, for the first time among their visits to the  German Democratic Republic, the Wolfsbergs found strangers willing to talk to  them -- sometimes directly, sometimes in thinly veiled references to the  historic events.  </P> <P> "We arrived in Leipzig around midnight Monday, Oct. 16," Max Wolfsberg said in  an interview last week, back home in Corona del Mar. "On Wednesday, people told  us there was an earthquake in San Francisco -- and that (East German leader  Erich) Honecker resigned. There were two quakes that day."  </P> <P> That evening, in the apartment given them for their month's stay, the  Wolfsbergs watched Egon Krenz, then the newly appointed government head,  deliver a 90-minute television address in which he promised to begin "a change  of direction."  </P> <P> The popular uprising that brought down Honecker had begun weeks earlier with  weekly Monday marches in Leipzig, often right after a prayer service at the  Nikolai Church in the old center of the city.  </P> <P> The Wolfsbergs agreed that they would go and watch the next demonstration on  Oct. 23.  </P> <P> They joined a quarter-million people who marched through Karl-Marx Platz, past  the city's opera house and concert hall -- and who stopped and booed in front  of the headquarters of the hated Stasi, or security police.  </P> <P> "They would shout, 'Visum frei bis Shanghai!' -- asking for unrestricted travel  as far as Shanghai -- "or 'Wir sind das Volk!' -- we are the people," Max  Wolfsberg said.  </P> <P> That slogan upset Wolfsberg because it was similar to one he heard as a boy in  Nazi Germany: Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fuehrer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hitler's Motorcade  </P> <P> "I was worried they would shout that also," the white-haired theoretical  chemist said, his carefully assembled collection of East German newspapers laid  out before him. "It brought back the Nazi era."  </P> <P> He recalled the day in 1936 when he demanded that his mother take him to see  Adolf Hitler.  </P> <P> His class in the private school he attended was going downtown the next day to  see Hitler's motorcade, he explained.  </P> <P> "They suggested that I not go," he said. "I made my mother take me . . . I  raised such a fuss."  </P> <P> Because he was so small, his mother passed him forward to the front row of the  crowd gathered to see Hitler. He ended up watching from the knee of a Nazi  storm trooper.  </P> <P> "I'm sure he didn't know I was a Jew," Wolfsberg said.  </P> <P> Soon enough, Wolfsberg said, he recognized "the terrible things" that were  going on in his homeland. An uncle was put in a concentration camp. Nazis tried  to arrest his father on Kristallnacht -- "Night of the Broken Glass," in which  Nazi mobs throughout Germany and Austria burned and pillaged Jewish homes and  businesses on Nov. 9, 1938 -- but were turned away.  </P> <P> Max developed a case of jaundice soon after Kristallnacht. "It was  stress-related," Wolfsberg said he was told.  </P> <P> The Wolfsberg family fled Germany in 1939, flying to Sweden, then boarding a  ship bound for New York. They lived in Galveston, Tex., for three years, before  moving to St. Louis.  </P> <P> It was there, at Washington University, that Wolfsberg attended college and  received his doctorate in chemistry. He came to UC Irvine in 1969.  </P> <P> Wolfsberg returned to Germany for the first time in 1959, while spending a year  in Europe on a fellowship. He was still bitter about what his native country  had done to him and his family.  </P> <P> "You were impossible," Marilyn Wolfsberg recalled, shaking her head.  </P> <P> Other Visits  </P> <P> Still, Wolfsberg made other trips to Germany. In 1977, he was awarded a prize  from the German Humboldt Foundation and was invited to work for a year at the  Max Planck Institute in Mainz, West Germany.  </P> <P> He told the secretary general of the foundation that he was not sure he should  even accept the award.  </P> <P> "I poured out my feelings to him," Wolfsberg said. "After that . . . I began to  feel comfortable . . . I don't have those feelings anymore."  </P> <P> And how did Wolfsberg, a survivor of the Nazis, feel during his most recent  journey to East Germany -- when the prospect of a united Germany once again  dominating the map of Europe suddenly looming nearer than at any time since  World War II?  </P> <P> "I'm not sure yet," he said. "I can't sort those feelings out."  </P> <P> It was easy enough in Leipzig, however, for both Wolfsbergs to grasp the  growing feelings of resentment and anger among East Germans toward a corrupt  regime -- and the excitement of a people speaking out for the first time in  decades.  </P> <P> One night, the couple attended an all-Tchaikovsky concert of the famed Leipzig  Gewandhaus Orchestra. The conductor, Kurt Masur, had been one of the earliest  figures in Leipzig to speak out against the government, and he had recently  returned from a tour of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> When Masur came out to open the concert, the audience stood and applauded for  10 minutes.  </P> <P> "There were two party members in front of us, wearing party pins," Max  Wolfsberg recalled. "They didn't applaud."  </P> <P> While Max spent his days doing research or meeting with East German scientists,  Marilyn explored the city, sometimes jogging through parks and down narrow  streets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Hideous Place'  </P> <P> One day, she said, she happened upon a group of children in their early teens  and stopped to talk.  </P> <P> One boy asked if she had been "downtown" yesterday -- an indirect way of asking  if she had witnessed that week's protest march.  </P> <P> " 'Yes,' I said. He said, 'So was I.' "  </P> <P> Another student -- a girl -- asked Wolfsberg what she thought of East Germany.  Taking care not to offend, she told the girl that she found the country  interesting, even fascinating.  </P> <P> "It's a hideous place," was the girl's reply, Wolfsberg recalled.  </P> <P> The Wolfsbergs attended two other demonstrations -- one on Oct. 30 of 700,000  people, and one the following week, in a driving rain, when about 300,000  showed up. They were stunned at the absence of violence.  </P> <P> A drunk or a provocateur easily could have thrown rocks through the glass wall  of the city's concert hall, they said. "It never happened," Max Wolfsberg said.  </P> <P> From Leipzig, the Wolfsbergs drove to East Berlin on Nov. 10, just as the  government was punching new holes in the wall and promising that freedom of  travel would be permanent. When they arrived, they saw thousands of people  lining up to obtain visas and cross for the first time into the West.  </P> <P> Later that day -- a Saturday, and their last day before returning home -- the  Wolfsbergs went to dinner at the Ephraim Palais, once the residence of a royal  jeweler and now a museum and restaurant.  </P> <P> Marilyn Wolfsberg had tried several times that day to call the restaurant and  make reservations, but no one had answered.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reflection  </P> <P> "When we got there, I told them that we hadn't been able to reach them all  day," she said. "The waiter answered, 'We were over there, on the other side.'  "  </P> <P> Back home, just a few blocks from the spectacular cliffs of the Irvine coast,  the professor's wife reflected on a month spent among people who put what  little they had on the line -- and won.  </P> <P> "It was such an exciting time," she said. "To see democracy being born in a  very nonviolent way."  </P></p>

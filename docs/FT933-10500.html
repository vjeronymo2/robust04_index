			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Ban imposed on council workforce THE GOVERNMENT has banned the London Borough of Camden from using its own workforce with immediate effect for new construction work, from April 1 next year for building maintenance and highways work, and from November 1 next year for sewerage work and vehicle maintenance. The decision was taken after the council's direct service organisations made losses - they are required to make a return of at least 5 per cent on capital employed.</p>

			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / The Queen's Awards 1994: Lessons for foreign students - Lisa Wood looks at five UK colleges and universities which are exporting their knowledge around the world Individuals from such far-flung corners as Alaska and China are among those currently matriculated as part-time post graduate students of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, one of five colleges and universities to have received the Queen's Award for Exports. It is the first time that the Esmee Fairbairn Research Centre at the University of Heriot-Watt has received the award. Similarly, it's a first award for the Queen Mary and Westfield College at the University of London, the University of Buckingham and Unived Technologies, the commercial arm of the University of Edinburgh. However, it is a second award for the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London which has been involved in educating overseas students since its founding in 1907. For all five institutions growth in overseas earnings - from both fees from foreign students and contracts for research - have been the result of strategic planning and considerable marketing effort. The Esmee Fairbairn Research Centre has been operating since the mid-1970s. In October 1990 its function changed and it became a commercial venture under the aegis of Heriot-Watt University. The centre, which gains most of its earnings from overseas, produces and distributes Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree programmes, texts and software. It also arranges for the sitting of examinations in 184 centres throughout the world. Since its introduction the MBA distance learning programme has attracted 8,000 students from 110 countries. Professor Keith Lumsden, director of the centre, said the training packages were entirely self-contained, requiring no live tuition. 'It is one of the biggest business schools in the world,' he says. At present all the tuition is in English, with papers marked in Scotland. The centre is considering offering the MBA in Chinese and Spanish. But, Professor Lumsden said courses in a foreign language afforded problems. Even if a sister body could be recruited abroad to mark the papers a significant number of scripts would have to be translated and re-marked by outside examiners in order to ensure consistency in standards. Unived Technologies is a similar commercial venture at the University of Edinburgh. Set up in 1984, it is the commercial arm of the university and markets research and development, consultancy and training services. Viewed by subject, information technology is the most successful research area but Unived has also won contracts in faculties of science and engineering, medicine, veterinary medicine, arts, social sciences and law. The company's export earnings have increased 2 1/2 times over the past three years. The Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine in London, by contrast, has been earning a significant part of its income from overseas fees for many years and holds the 1990 Export Award. Dr Tim Seller said the college recruited about 20 per cent of its students from abroad, particularly from the Far East, the Americas and Europe. At present they make up some 1,480 of the college's intake of 5,308. 'We recruit up to the government's imposed limits upon students in the UK,' he said. 'But, ever since we were founded in 1907, a basic part of our mission has been to be involved in overseas education.' Imperial had made substantial increases in its numbers of foreign students, said Dr Seller, with active marketing to young people who would be making their selection from the world's most prestigious institutions in sciences and engineering in particular. An equally strong marketing effort overseas is being made by Queen Mary and Westfield College, the fourth largest constituent college of the University of London. Some 24 per cent of its students come from more than 100 overseas countries. The college said: 'There has been a steady increase in the college's fee income from overseas students during the past six years, despite the competitive market.' The college currently attracts nearly Pounds 7.5m a year from abroad for courses, educational services and research. The college attributed its success in recruiting overseas students to several factors. They included offering degree courses in specialist areas such as commercial law; offering a modular programme of study; a dedicated international office to promote courses; and the provision of a range of support services including an English language and study skills unit and guaranteed housing for international students. At the University of Buckingham, a wide range of programmes and a two-year honours degree are among the attractions to overseas students. The university, which was founded in 1976, is the only independent one in the UK and does not receive direct government funding. It has pioneered two-year honours courses, offering it says 'mature students the opportunity of entering the job market a year earlier and school leavers the opportunity of a year out between school and university while graduating on time.' Sir Richard Luce, the university's vice-chancellor, said the award was a tribute to his staff who had devoted themselves to the university. 'We have reached nearly 1,000 students of whom 60 per cent are from overseas, with over 80 nationalities being represented,' he said. 'We believe that, with our two - year degree, we do have something very special to offer overseas students. 'British students benefit from this multicultural atmosphere and the alumni have an extensive global network. We are very proud of this award.'</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / China reveals money supply for first time China's central bank yesterday took a leap into greater public disclosure when it published up-to-date money supply figures for the first time since the Communist revolution. These revealed that the broader M2 measure of monetary growth accelerated in the third quarter in spite of the government's proclaimed tight credit policy aimed at calming an overheating economy and curbing inflation. The People's Bank of China, through the Financial News, its house journal, reported that M2 grew by 37.1 per cent year-on-year in the September quarter compared with 29.7 per cent in the second quarter. The M2 growth target for 1994 is 24 per cent. Mr Dai Xianglong, a deputy governor of the People's Bank, expressed concern about the M2 outcome. 'This shows that money supply is accelerating. . . and inflationary pressure is growing,' he said. The central bank official attributed the excessive monetary growth to higher than planned capital spending by state enterprises, lack of budgetary restraint, a blow-out in wages and salaries to government employees and increases in payments to farmers. Mr Dai made a plea for restraint, saying that for monetary policy to work in the fight against inflation government departments would have to play their part in curbing expenditures. It seems that one of the People's Bank's motives in breaking with tradition by publishing timely money supply statistics is to strengthen its argument for restraint. The central bank is seeking to transform itself from a passive state institution into a leader of the fight against inflation. Consumer prices nationwide were up 27.4 per cent in September compared with a year earlier. This was in spite of measures adopted earlier this year to stiffen price controls on basic commodities and services. The bank also published figures showing narrow M0 money supply growth of 26.4 per cent in the third quarter, and M1 growth of 32.5 per cent. It also reported foreign exchange reserves figures of Dollars 39.8bn at the end of September, an 87 per cent increase on 1993. This was partly attributed to an improved trading performance with exports exceeding imports by Dollars 1.38bn in the first nine months. Mr Dai said the decision to release the financial data was part of the central bank's attempts to bring its operations into line with similar international institutions. 'This will help the opening up and reform of our financial system and make for better international exchange (of information),' he told the Financial News. Mr Dai indicated that publication of money supply figures would become standard practice. He described the disclosure as 'an important step'.</p>

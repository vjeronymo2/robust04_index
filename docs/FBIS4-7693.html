			<p>BFN     [Text] The Czech Defense Ministry has decided to form its  own fast deployment unit. Our correspondent Milan Repka reports:    Defense Minister Antonin Baudys has said that a fast  deployment brigade will deal with, above all, the solution of  sudden crisis situations at any place in the Czech Republic,  including situations where the state is under threat.    According to Baudys, this unit should have about 3,000 men  and should represent some kind of model of the future Czech  Army. The equipment of this brigade should be compatible with  the equipment of NATO countries, both in the case of hand  weapons and helicopters.    As Baudys went on to say, he and Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus  agreed on putting domestic arms production first, while taking  its quality strictly into account.    Another step of the ministry within the framework of  transformation of the Czech Army is the necessary reduction of a  large number of commander posts. In this connection, Baudys  designated the basic principle of this transformation--above  all, orientation toward recruiting new officers to achieve the  aim of the Army service having to become attractive for high  quality people.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GM BIAS SUIT SETTLEMENT OKD  </P> <P> A federal judge Tuesday approved a settlement of a 6-year-old racial  discrimination suit against General Motors Corp. that requires the auto maker  to pay up to $3 million.  </P> <P> The suit claimed that GM discriminated against nearly 10,000 salaried black  employees in Michigan, Ohio and Indiana in its promotion, wage, transfer and  layoff policies. Of those, about 7,000 still work for GM.  </P> <P> After years of legal wrangling, attorneys for GM and the employees reached an  agreement last Oct. 21.  </P> <P> The decree calls on GM to pay between $1 million and $1.6 million to about  2,800 former employees, depending on the number of claims filed. GM also will  pay about $1 million in salary increases immediately to about 1,000 current  employees. Eighty-eight individual plaintiffs and witnesses will split about  $322,500 in one-time payments.  </P> <P> The settlement also establishes a system to monitor discretionary pay raises  and promotions for five years based on computer models. That portion of the  agreement has the potential of being the most beneficial, said attorney Dennis  James, who represented the employees.  </P> <P> "We think that's where the vast benefit comes in," he said. "It will affect a  substantial increase in black salaried promotions compared to the past  patterns."  </P> <P> GM spokesman John Mueller said company officials had not seen the order.  However, he said the agreement "provides the opportunity to redress some  perceived inequities and strengthens GM's existing systems to ensure all  employees receive equitable treatment."  </P></p>

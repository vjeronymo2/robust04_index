			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kenyan tea output down by 20% Output of Kenyan tea, the country's main commodity export, fell by about a fifth in the first half of 1994 compared with the same period in the previous year, a leading brokerage firm said yesterday, reports Reuters from Nairobi. African Tea Brokers said the crop figure for June was posted at 16.12m kg, a decline of 929,766 kg from June 1993. 'The cumulative figure now stands at 91.58m kg, a fall of 21.85m kg over last year,' ATB said. The firm is based in Mombasa, where east Africa's weekly tea export auctions are held. Temperatures in Kenya's tea growing areas had been low with intermittent rain, farmers in growing areas said. Growth had been restricted and crop levels were generally at a seasonal low. 'West of the Rift (Valley), Kericho has been cold and fairly dry apart from some rain towards the end of July. Leaf intake has shown a slight decline,' said one farmer at Kericho, a key growing belt 300 km north-west of Nairobi. 'In Nandi conditions remain wet with cold early morning temperatures. Slight hail has had no effect on crops with levels now rising,' he added. 'Areas east of the Rift have experienced cold mornings with sunny intervals in the afternoons and well distributed showers. Crop intake is maintained.' Britain and Pakistan were the main buyers of Kenyan tea in June, while Egypt bought lower grades. Sudan, North America and South Africa also increased their buying, ATB said. The firm said there was continued good demand for all Malawian primary grades, with prices firm to dearer. 'Night temperatures there were cold with patches of early morning fog and leaf intake continued to decline,' ATB said. Malawi produced 27.15m kg of tea in the January-June period of 1994 compared with 26.73m kg in same period a year earlier. ATB put Uganda's tea output in January-March at 2.7m kg, up from 2.5m kg the first three months of 1993, and Tanzania's at 7.1m kg, unchanged from January-March last year. In Zimbabwe 6.7m kg was produced in the first three months, compared with 5.3m kg last year, the firm said.</p>

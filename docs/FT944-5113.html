			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Portillo to oppose German move on EU labour standards Mr Michael Portillo, the employment secretary, will today oppose an attempt by the German government to pass a resolution strengthening minimum labour standards for the European Union. His stance seems certain to isolate him from his ministerial colleagues at the social affairs council meeting in Brussels. Mr Portillo fears the German proposal may usher in a new wave of social regulations damaging to European business, and bring the UK government into further conflict with other member states. The UK government has resisted European Commission attempts to strengthen workers' rights because it believes they add to labour costs and undermine competitiveness. While the German motion would not enjoy any legal force, its approval by the ministers would increase the pressure on Mr Padraig Flynn, EU social affairs commissioner, to produce a new programme of social directives mainly to improve worker rights. Until recently, Mr Flynn appeared to have ruled out any further legislation, emphasising the need to concentrate on tackling unemployment and enforcing existing social directives in member states. But a number of EU countries, including Germany, as well as the European parliament and several European trade unions, are pressing the Commission to extend the EU's existing binding and enforceable minimum labour standards. Mr Flynn appears to have changed his position and has now promised to draw up a new agenda of social legislation. Today's 10-point German resolution would cover: Equality of treatment for part-time workers and those on fixed-term contracts; Prohibition of discrimination of workers who exercise their rights to complain or take legal action or refuse to perform unlawful tasks; The right of a worker to be heard in internal company matters; Protection of the privacy of workers, in particular over the collection, processing and transmission of data; Adequate protection for workers against dismissal; No sex discrimination against workers; The right to 'an appropriate continued' payment of wages on holiday and during illness; Administrative co-operation in cross-border temporary employment; The integration of disabled people into working life; The establishment of impartial and free counselling and job placement services. Mr Portillo is also expected to veto the draft EU directives on part-time and fixed-contract work. The other member states would then be likely to use the social protocol of the Maastricht treaty to pass the measures.</p>

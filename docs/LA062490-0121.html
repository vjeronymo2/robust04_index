			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON SAM HALL KAPLAN  </P> <P> I mourn the loss of Sam Hall Kaplan's column from the pages of the Los Angeles  Times.  </P> <P> Kaplan has consistently offered us welcome food for thought.  </P> <P> His menu has been full -- planning, urban design, architecture new and old,  relationships between people and places, between government and private  enterprise -- all spiced with humor and seasoned with his unique personal  opinion. After partaking, we sometimes found ourselves gratified, sometimes  chagrined, but always stirred, always challenged to think.  </P> <P> Whether complimenting or poking fun at the Los Angeles built environment and  its creators, Kaplan, above all else, called for more sensitivity and more  humanity in our communities. His contribution has been a positive one, and we  are richer for it. His witty and provocative words will be sorely missed.  </P> <P> SUSAN N. MOSSMAN  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

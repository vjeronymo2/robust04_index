			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> CALLBOARD'S 'ON TINA TUNA WALK' -- IT'S A GAY COMEDY  </P> <P> John Glines' "On Tina Tuna Walk" that opened Thursday night at the Callboard  Theatre in West Hollywood sounds like specialty sushi or stir-fried tuna. It is  neither. Call it specialty theater. The name refers to one of the walkways in  the Pines on Fire Island, an overtly gay community, and the comedy that follows  is not "John Loves Mary," but Michael loves Paul.  </P> <P> Comedy requires complications. These are provided with unbridled zest and  campiness by Michael's friends Eddie (Eddie Cobb), Russell (Scott Allyn) and JJ  (Jay Acovone), the only straight guy in the group. In their effort to cure  Michael (Gregg Marx) from pining after his dead lover, they set him up with  Paul (Michael Hartson), a ringer for the dear departed.  </P> <P> The plot's twists and turns are seriocomic soap opera, less important than the  mix of printable and unprintable -- often zinging -- one-liners on which they  rely. Glines has a generous heart and knows how to put a play together. In  Eddie, the mother superior who runs the show and rules the roost (variously  outfitted as Lady Bracknell, Tokyo Rose or whatever else), he captures the  epitome of the pushy-hilarious queen.  </P> <P> Cobb, who inspired as well as created the role Off Broadway, gives an  unfettered, outre performance worth the price of admission. He is ably  supported by everyone else and except for a couple of brief sags in the second  act, director Peter Pope (who staged "Torch Song Trilogy" on Broadway, produced  by Glines) knows how to balance restraint and excess and keep the comic tempo  thumping.  </P> <P> The smart set, costumes and lights (by Matthew Moore, Ina Raye and George  Gizienski, respectively), give a lift to the Callboard stage.  </P> <P> "On Tina Tuna Walk" is slight fare, but fun. It won't be for all markets. It is  comedy about and aimed at the gay community for which it's bound to hold the  greatest appeal -- and which should keep it running for some time.  </P> <P>  At 8451 Melrose Place, Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays 3 and 8  p.m., indefinitely. Tickets: $15; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Independent Electoral Commissioners Dikgang Moseneke  and Gay McDougall say that the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission] has the capability to conduct an election in  kwaZulu-Natal. Speaking after a brief tour of the region Miss  McDougall and Advocate Moseneke said they had found that the  majority of people in the region anted to participate in the  elections. Mr. Moseneke said the IEC would be flexible in the  way it organized the elections there, and where necessary it  would shift voter stations out of trouble zones to the border of  South Africa and kwaZulu. He said security would be stepped up  and the routes to the voting stations protected by the SADF  [South African Defense Force].</p>

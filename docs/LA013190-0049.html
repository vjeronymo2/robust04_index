			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A DRIVING REIGN  </P> <P> If Gov. Deukmejian did very much driving in the traffic congestion and gridlock  in Southern California, he would or should ask, "How long has this been going  on?" The correct answer would be at least as long as the eight years of his  governorship.  </P> <P> This traffic situation has developed despite his many pre-election campaign  promises not to follow in the footsteps of the Brown/Gianturco "do-nothing"  regime.  </P> <P> JOSEPH E. MONROE  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

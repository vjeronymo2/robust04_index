The BSE's Plan was approved by the Commission in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26737 (April 17, 1989), 54 FR 16438 (April 24, 1989). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> letter from Karen A. Aluise, Assistant Vice President, BSE, to Sandy Sciole, Branch Chief, SEC, dated May 6, 1994 (requesting amendment of the Plan). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34309 (July 5, 1994), 59 FR 35548 (July 12, 1994). no comments were received on the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BSE's Plan, as embodied in Chapter XVIII, Section 4 of the BSE's Rules, provides that the Exchange may impose a fine, not to exceed $2500, on any member, member organization, or person associated with a member or member organization for any violation of an Exchange rule that has been deemed to be minor in nature and approved by the Commission for inclusion in the Plan. The rule change will add to the List of Exchange Rule Violations and Fines Applicable thereto Pursuant to Section 4 of Chapter XVIII for the imposition of fines: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Failure to Promptly Respond to Exchange Blue Sheet Requests or File Regularly Scheduled Financial (FOCUS, SIPC) and/or Regulatory Reports (Specialist Performance Evaluation Questionnaire, Quarterly Option Report); <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Improper Use of the ITS Administrative Message Function; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Failure to Register Floor Employees and Complete Appropriate Forms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of Section 6(b). <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5) requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts, and, in general, to protect investors and the public, and with the Section 6(b)(6) requirement that the rules of an exchange provide that its members are appropriately disciplined for violations of an exchange's rules and the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78f(b) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Commission believes that an exchange's ability to effectively enforce compliance by its members and member organization with Commission and Exchange rules is central to its self-regulatory functions. The inclusion of a rule in an exchange's minor rule violation plan, therefore, should not be interpreted to mean that it is not an important rule. On the contrary, the Commission recognizes that the inclusion of minor violations of particular rules under a minor rule violation plan may make the exchange's disciplinary system more efficient in prosecuting more egregious and/or repeated violations of these rules, thereby furthering its mandates to protect investors and the public interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that adding the provisions listed above to the Chapter XVIII of the Exchange's Rules and to the Exchange's Plan is consistent with Sections 6(b)(5) and 6(b)(6) in that the purpose of chapter XVIII is to provide for a response to a violation of Exchange Rules or policy when a meaningful sanction is needed, but when initiation of a disciplinary proceeding under the Chapter XXX is not suitable because such a proceeding would be more costly and time-consuming than would be warranted given the nature of the violation. Chapter XVIII provides for an appropriate response to minor violations of certain Exchange rules, while preserving the due process rights of the party accused through specified, required procedures. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Plan permits any person to contest the Exchange's imposition of the fine through submission of a written answer, at which time the matter will become a disciplinary proceeding subject to Chapter XXX of the BSE's Rules and, where applicable, the reporting provisions of Commission Rule 19d&hyph;1. Furthermore, the Exchange retains the option of bringing violations of rules included in the Plan to full disciplinary proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Furthermore, the Commission finds that violations of the provisions being added are objective and technical in nature, and are easily verifiable, thereby lending themselves to the use of expedited proceedings. Noncompliance with the provisions may be determined objectively and adjudicated quickly without the complicated factual and interpretive inquiries associated with more sophisticated Exchange disciplinary proceedings. If the Exchange determines that a violation of one of these rules is not minor in nature, the Exchange retains the discretion to initiate full disciplinary proceedings in accordance with Chapter XXX of the BSE Rules. The Commission expects the BSE to bring full disciplinary proceedings in appropriate cases ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> in cases where the violation is egregious or where there is a history or pattern of repeat violations). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;BSE&hyph;94&hyph;08) is approved. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. &sect;78s(b)(2) (1988). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Jonathan G.

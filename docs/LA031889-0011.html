			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UPROAR OVER TWO FLAG EXHIBITS  </P> <P> The response of offended Muslims to the book "The Satanic Verses" is not unlike  the response of Christians to the movie "The Last Temptation of Christ." The  difference is in degree: violence or peaceful demonstration. But the basic  issue of each is the violation of conscience and the fear of misinterpretation  of truth in their religion.  </P> <P> Now, consciences are being violated as the American flag is walked on in the  name of art. The consciences of citizens hurt as the symbol of unity is defiled  for the artist's individual freedom.  </P> <P> Is there no end to the discounting of others' beliefs? To be effective, freedom  always has to have limits (such as obedience to the law); but a far greater  limit is that of not doing anything that would hurt my brother.  </P> <P> MARY SMITH  </P> <P> Canyon Country  </P></p>

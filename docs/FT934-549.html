			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Tecs seek approval for mergers with chambers Training and enterprise councils are to advise the government not to object to their integration with chambers of commerce, provided that a number of quality criteria are met. If ministers accept this advice, which comes after the government invited Tecs' comments, a number of mergers could take place. The move would be unpopular in some areas but would be in line with wider moves to redraw the map of locally delivered business and economic development services. Kent Tec, for example, is negotiating with Kent County Council over its integration with the county's economic development unit. The quality criteria could include obliging the new bodies not to be deliverers of services. At present many chambers give contracts to Tecs to provide training. Chambers, which are private bodies, and Tecs are already co-operating in the new Business Links outlets which deliver services to small businesses. But a number would like to go further. In the past the Department of Employment has set demanding criteria before considering mergers, saying that the two organisations have different aims and remits. Chambers, it has said, exist to serve the needs of their business membership while Tecs were set up by the government to provide support for training and economic development.</p>

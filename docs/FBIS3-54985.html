Former President Abulfaz Elchibey, who was removed from  power  by a coup in 1993, issued a message stating that "an independent  and democratic Azerbaijan is a major threat to imperialist  forces." Indicating that Azerbaijan is living under extremely  grave conditions, Elchibey called on the Azerbaijani diaspora to  help the refugees. Elchibey repeated his call for unity and  togetherness and said no power will manage to divide the people.    In the meantime, opposition is growing against Geydar  Aliyev,  whose position has weakened because of growing economic disarray  and further loss of territory after the fall of Elchibey. The  detentions of the leaders of People's Front and Musavat Party,  which forged a national unity on the instructions of Elchibey,  is continuing. The reporters are under pressure following the  introduction of censorship against the opposition papers. It is  being reported that Mahir Memedov, one of the directors of the  paper DZHUMHURIYET, has been detained and is being asked to  resign his job.    Geydar Aliyev, who disbanded the 37 volunteer battalions  formed during the Elchibey era, has now ordered the detention of  Adil Hashimoglu, who has been commanding the volunteer  detachments since the start of the war with Armenians. Adil  Hashimoglu, who commanded the units in Kubatlinskiy and  Zangelanskiy Rayons at the request of Elchibey and who was  instrumental in the latest military successes, was detained on  the pretext that in complicity with the People's Front he was  plotting a coup in Ganja against Aliyev. The detention of  Hashimoglu, coming soon after the imprisonment of the people's  hero Arif Pashaogly and Chief of the Security Directorate in  Kazakhskiy Rayon, caused a reaction among the refugees in Ganja  and Baku.  <H5>  Demirel Invited Aliyev </H5>   It was agreed to set up a group to draw up a border  agreement  between Azerbaijan and Turkey. It was confirmed that the  borders of Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic cannot  be altered forcibly and that the 1921 Kars treaty recognizes  guarantorship rights to Turkey.    In a statement issued by Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin and  Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov, it was stated:  "Turkey will not remain a mere spectator if an attempt is made  to forcibly alter the borders of Nakhichevan Autonomous  Republic."    In seeing off Gasan Gasanov at Ankara's Esenboga Airport,  Hikmet Cetin handed him a personal letter from President  Suleyman Demirel. Cetin said that the letter is an invitation to  Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev to visit Turkey.    Gasanov stated that Aliyev will visit Turkey most probably  in  January and added that the Turkic republics' heads of state  summit, which was held in Ankara on 29 October last year, will  be held in Baku between 20-22 January.</p>

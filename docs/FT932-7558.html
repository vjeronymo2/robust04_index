			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: The sparkle in a fund manager's eye - International bonds INTERNATIONAL bond fund managers are full of good reasons for forgetting gilts and investing in fixed interest bonds issued by governments other than the UK. Their enthusiasm is unsurprising given the relatively high returns achieved in this sector. The performance figures for the largest 10 international bond funds in the table, produced by Micropal, show an average return of just under 19 per cent over the year to May 1 - a return assisted in part by sterling's decline. Fund managers predict more to come. 'Over the last two years, international bond funds have performed fantastically well,' said Tim Kay, investment manager for Baring's Global Trust. 'Our view on gilts is that there is not much more scope for prices to move upwards. The current return is probably only the coupon, that is, 7-8 per cent for medium maturities. International bonds are attractive because of the possibility of making capital gains from the European markets and currency gains from the dollar. We see the dollar strengthening against sterling.' The theory is that current UK interest rates have bottomed out or are very near the bottom giving limited scope for capital gains but the slide in interest rates has only recently begun in Europe. In addition, international bond funds give their managers scope for currency plays which the sterling denominated gilts market cannot offer. Martin Wooller, director of fixed income at Fidelity Investments, believes that European currencies will be weak against the dollar for the next two years. Some 83 per cent of Fidelity's international bond fund exposure is to dollars while 60 per cent of the fund is invested in European bonds. Yields have fallen since we last published the table on April 24, reflecting the move into recession in Europe, according to Wooller. Although a fall in interest rates in Europe offer the potential for capital growth, yields averaging 5.9 per cent for the funds listed in the table, are no longer appealingly high for those looking principally for income. 'Investors now think that the yield on bond products is low,' acknowledged Kay, 'but we go for total return.' He believes that bond funds should be used by investors as a low risk investment as one part of a portfolio to bring down the overall risk without reducing the yield greatly. One fund which aims to deliver a high yield and is not a total return fund is Guinness Flight's EMU trust, which invests solely in European bonds. The 9.2 per cent yield is achieved through its holding in Spanish peseta bonds (28 per cent), Italian bonds (25 per cent), sterling bonds (15 per cent), ECU bonds (12 per cent, Danish kroner bonds (10 per cent) and French bonds (9 per cent). The performance is significantly weaker than the other funds listed, usually the consequence of choosing between income or capital growth. Philip Saunders, director Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, mainly attributes the lower performance to the fund's investment restriction to Europe.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LARGEST 10 INTERNATIONAL BOND FUNDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fund                              Size      Yield       Perf*                             (Pounds m)        (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mercury Global Bond              251.2        5.4        22.2 Baring Global Bond               167.8        5.5        18.1 Perpetual Global Bond             66.0        6.2        26.1 Beckman International             50.0        3.2        19.8 Fidelity Int Bond                 36.0        5.8        19.5 Norwich Int'l Bond                27.2        5.5        23.4 Cannon Int'l Curr Bond            26.2        5.4        20.7 Gartmore Global Bond              21.2        5.9        18.8 S&amp;P Int'l Bond                    20.5        6.0        22.1 Guinness Flight EMU               18.8        9.2         7.0 Sector average                    29.3        5.9        18.9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Micropal. ** As of May 1. * Offer-to-bid with net income reinvested over one year to May 1.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] AL-BA'TH says that it is not new for Israel to heap  accusations on Syria to tarnish its stands. AL-BA'TH says that  most Israeli accusations are not worth considering or responding  to. This is because to respond to some of these accusations,  which are within the context of lies and deception, requires the  reassertion of unequivocal facts. Such facts cannot be  obliterated, irrespective of the allegations fabricated by  Israel. A sample of such accusations is that whenever the  national Lebanese resistance deals a painful blow to the Zionist  occupation troops and their agents, Israel starts leveling  accusations amounting to blatant threats against Syria.    AL-BA'TH adds: Although Syria's stands on the peace process  are constant, principled, and clear, the Rabin government's  accusations are ready and repetitive, occurring whenever Syria  makes it clear that it will not respond to Israel's terms and  peace proposals which guarantee nothing but Israel's interests  and ambitions.    AL-BA'TH stresses that Israel's accusations against the  resistance in Lebanon are part of the pressures being exercised  against Lebanon in the course of the peace process. Moreover,  the scope of such accusations is often expanded to include Syria  by alluding to alleged Syrian pressures against Lebanon.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: Facts on the ground will remain  stronger than any attempt at falsification. Lebanon's right to  resist the occupation is legitimate. Lebanon needs nobody to  tell it what to do in this regard or to interfere in its  affairs. Lebanon is exercising a natural right. It adopts  stands that maintain its rights and sovereignty, inspired by its  national and pan-Arab interest. The voices that have joined  Israel and begun to accuse Syria of interfering in Lebanon's  affairs are not worth responding to or commenting on. Under its  legitimate leadership and cohesive national unity, Lebanon will  remain greater than accusations. It will not be harmed for  opting for brotherly relations with Syria in the interest of the  two sisterly countries.    TISHRIN comments on Israeli proposals in southern Lebanon  and  the future of the Golan Heights. It says: These days, the  Israelis are talking much about proposals and plans to activate  the peace process regarding both southern Lebanon and the Golan.  However, the Israelis have failed to reveal the content of  their proposals, and whether they are based on full withdrawal,  or, like previous Israeli proposals, are a new attempt to  circumvent UN resolutions.    TISHRIN stresses that Syria's position in this regard is  clear and unmistakable. Syria is eager to expedite and activate  the peace talks. At the same time, Syria adheres to the Madrid  conference formula and the constants of a just, comprehensive  peace. Syria will not relinquish one inch of the Golan, nor  will it ever bargain over its undeniable right to restore it.    TISHRIN contends that Syria does not need papers to activate  the Syrian track. As the Israeli rulers are well aware, Syria's  stands are based on right, justice, international legitimacy,  and on the fact that only the full removal of the occupation  from the Arab territories is the path that will lead to a  successful, durable peace. As long as Israel is far from that,  then it is only fair to say that the national Lebanese  resistance to the Israeli schemes in southern Lebanon and  confronting the Israeli policy of aggression, expansion, and  repression is legitimate. This is because resistance targets  the occupation and seeks to defend southern Lebanon against the  aggressive Israeli control.    TISHRIN stresses that any Israeli talk about partial or  limited withdrawals and about proposals that do not speak of  full withdrawal and terminating the occupation of southern  Lebanon and the Golan are yet another rejected and denounced  Israeli attempt to maintain the occupation. So are phased  solutions. The allegation that what is urgent is to arrive at  security arrangements is an Israeli illusion.    Concluding, TISHRIN says: Israel would be gravely mistaken  if it believes that it will be able to follow a policy of  blacking out facts. Withdrawal from the entire occupied  territories needs no interpretations. It needs only a sincere  desire to implement the resolutions of the international  legitimacy. The road to peace starts with full withdrawal.  Only such a withdrawal will lead to the achievement of peace.</p>

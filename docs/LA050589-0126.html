			<p><P> May 5, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> 'SIGNS OF LIFE' FALLS SHORT OF A WONDERFUL IDEA  </P> <P> "Signs of Life" (AMC Century 14), set in a small coastal Maine village, is  deliberately shot with a jewel-like clarity that suggests the paintings of  Andrew Wyeth: window curtains billowing in the morning breeze, hills and  coastline icily distinct. Director John David Coles and cinematographer Elliot  Davis turn the town into an objet d'art: precious, irreplaceable. But they also  may want to suggest that sad clarity we get in the moments when something is  irrevocably passing, leaving us forever.  </P> <P> The movie takes place on the last day of a local shipyard that has been  defeated by modernity and fiberglass. The last boat is about to be launched;  the boss (Arthur Kennedy) and his housekeeper (Kate Reid) muddle through the  dust and detritus of decades; the foreman (Beau Bridges) awaits the birth of  his fifth child while despondently mulling over chances of new employment; the  two younger workers (Vincent Phillip D'Onofrio and Kevin J. O'Connor) are about  to pull up stakes, to leave their loved ones -- a retarded younger brother  (Michael Lewis) and a girlfriend (Mary Louise Parker) -- and head for Florida  and an absurd dream of finding buried treasure.  </P> <P> Writer Mark Malone symbolically compresses the day's events, which include a  birth, a marriage and (maybe) a death. And, while Kennedy's Owen Coughlin faces  mortality, he is dogged by a beaming, spectral young man: the image of his  long-dead father.  </P> <P> "Signs of Life" tries to portray a part of America most recent movies ignore:  the old, the nonvictorious. But when Bridges' foreman robs a store, he is the  dispossessed outlaw: The wind blows the bills off his chest, like the gold dust  in "Treasure of Sierra Madre." And when D'Onofrio's Daryl and O'Connor's Eddie  hit the road, they are enacting a goofball parody of thousands of highway  quests from "Easy Rider" to "Rain Man."  </P> <P> "Signs of Life" sounds like a wonderful movie. But, instead, it's a wonderful  idea. It has all the virtues we've come to expect of American Playhouse  productions: artistic and social idealism, literacy, careful production, a  sense of the landscape, fine acting -- especially by Reid, Lewis and Arthur  Kennedy, a great American actor too long absent from the screen. But Malone,  like Chris Gerolmo in "Miles from Home," comes from a more affluent milieu than  his characters. He may unconsciously condescend to them -- at best, turn them  into vessels of poeticized guilt, at worst, into a passel of rustic  nincompoops.  </P> <P> "Signs of Life" still has something precious to give us: those delicately  etched, Wyethesque landscapes, the mood of melancholy community and generosity  in the waning day, and Arthur Kennedy as Owen, raging, raging, against the  dying of the light.

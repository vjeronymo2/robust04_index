			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: WHAT'S IN A NEW NAME? GOOD FRENCH BISTRO FOOD AT  AN AFFORDABLE PRICE  </P> <P> Directory assistance operators may grow frustrated when callers request the  number of "that new French place at 4th and Ivy," but we may be able to glean  some encouragement from the fact that the management of a new bistro has chosen  to give it an outlandish, difficult to remember name.  </P> <P> The little-noticed Cafe des Beaux Arts has changed hands and been rechristened  The French Side of the West. The name doesn't have the same ring as something  brief and punchy like Chez Jacques or La Grenouille, but it does signify  something wonderful: The management is so thoroughly unacquainted with American  restaurant procedures that it actually serves meals the French way -- with  simplicity but also with an endearing attention to detail.  </P> <P> From one point of view, the most important fact about the French Side is that  it serves four-course dinners at a fixed price of $12.50 and the cooking  happens to be quite good.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chef is From Burgundy  </P> <P> The chef, Guy Naltet, is from Burgundy, one of the two best-known wine  producing areas of France and a region celebrated for its robust fare. The menu  draws on the traditions of this region by featuring such pleasant and currently  hard-to-find dishes as coq au vin, boeuf bourguignonne, poulet chasseur and  salmon in the special, creamy butter sauce called beurre blanc.  </P> <P> Owner Philippe Beltran is a Parisian who came to San Diego by way of the  Caribbean.  </P> <P> A generously sized plate of charcuterie (the English, and not quite  satisfactory equivalent of this term would be cold cuts) appears while guests  study the chalkboard menu. This plate of highly seasoned meat preparations is  like the overture to an opera -- it forcefully foreshadows that which will  follow. Besides a slice of rather typical, country-style pate (in this case an  unexceptional, semi-roughly textured loaf of veal, chicken and duck) the plate  includes the excellent, seductively garlicky sausage of Lyon; jambon persilee,  or ham cubes embedded in parsleyed aspic; rillettes, a very rich paste of  crushed pork, simmered so long that it acquires the smoothness of butter, and a  slice of Brie.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Taste of Sorrel  </P> <P> Chef Naltet does not always emphasize strong flavors. Meals include the choice  of the soup of the day or a pretty, but rather bland, house salad. The greens  of the latter are accented here and there with tiny mounds of minced, pickled  red cabbage and shredded carrots, but the dressing, which a server said  included mustard, garlic, shallots, herbs and vinegar, tasted almost  exclusively of oil. It made a disappointing interlude between charcuterie and  main course.  </P> <P> There was a similar lack of punch in the rouille (a red pepper-based  mayonnaise) that dressed a classy soupe de poissons, a Mediterranean knock-out  brewed from fish, tomatoes and herbs that has a deep, briny taste. The purpose  of the rouille is to make the flavor sparkle; fortunately, this soup was so  good that it could do without the accent.  </P> <P> A creamy germiny, or sorrel soup, went in quite the opposite direction and  included a noticeable jolt of lemon juice. Sorrel, a multipurpose green that  can double as an herb (it is exquisite, and is beginning to turn up in  supermarket produce sections), has a sourish, lemony flavor of its own, and  adding lemon to it seems rather beside the point. Nonetheless, the ploy worked  -- this was a fine, hearty soup.  </P> <P> Sorrel sauce (basically a condensed version of sorrel soup) makes an excellent  accompaniment to most fish, and the French Side offers it as one of three  sauces with a beautifully cooked slice of sea bass. The sorrel sauce was tart,  the pepper sauce assertive and the beurre blanc mild and soothing. The main  attraction, meanwhile, seemed unusually well done; sea bass can be a coarse,  unlovable fish, but the kitchen cut the bass more thinly than is common, which  made it tender and quite agreeable.  </P> <P> The entree list runs usually to just eight items, including a grilled trout  with fennel and a house special (served for two or more guests) of shark with  saffron sauce and fresh noodles. Meat dishes are typical of Burgundy and  include a steak in white peppercorn sauce, steak with Roquefort sauce, chicken  in a pungent mushroom sauce and a special or two of the day.  </P> <P> The French typically pay great attention to garnishes, as does the French Side,  and most plates include the creamy, garlic-seasoned potato casserole called  gratin dauphinoise as well as a selection of well-cooked vegetables.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Knack for Sauces  </P> <P> The steak in Roquefort sauce also included quite a few peppercorns in its  seasoning, which made it seem refined and racy at the same moment. Naltet  generally knows how to make his sauces, and he also knows how to cook a piece  of beef; this was not the finest meat available (at $12.50 for the dinner, how  could it be?), but Naltet turned out a tender, juicy product nonetheless.  </P> <P> The most typically Burgundian dish, boeuf bourguignonne, was the least  agreeable of those sampled. A chicken breast chasseur took a much happier turn.  The dish is the French version of the Italian cacciatore (both words mean  "hunter-style"), but it is far subtler.  </P> <P> The desserts are in the classic French bistro style. The choice runs to  chocolate mousse, a decent caramel custard and a pyramid of profiterolles, or  ice cream-stuffed cream puffs doused with a good chocolate sauce.  </P> <P> Beltran has put together an extremely brief list of French country wines  suitable to the menu, and priced just as modestly.  </P> <P> THE FRENCH SIDE OF THE WEST  </P> <P> 2202 4th Ave.  </P> <P> 234-5540  </P> <P> Lunch Monday through Friday, dinner Monday through Saturday.  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted.  </P> <P> Dinner for two, including a glass of house wine each, tax and tip, about $35.  </P></p>

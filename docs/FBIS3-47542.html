			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An unofficial session of the Japan-U.S.  construction talks started in Tokyo on 12 January. The United  States has set 20 January as the date on which it will impose  sanctions unless agreement is reached. With the deadline close  at hand, the Japanese Government has sought the understanding of  the U.S. Government by working out an action program, including  a plan to introduce the general competitive bidding system for  public works in April.    For those projects sponsored by prefectural governments that  will be eligible for the bidding system, the Japanese Government  has set the cost of projects at "more than about 2.3 billion  yen." The U.S. Government, however, has demanded that this  ceiling be lowered.    Moreover, although the Japanese Government intends to  abolish  in April the major project arrangement (MPA), which was  exclusively worked out to help American companies, the U.S.  Government wants it continued. It is expected there will be  some tough talking before an accord is reached.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Bundesbank cuts The timing and size, though not the direction, of the Bundesbank's latest interest rate cuts were a surprise. A cut of half a percentage point in the discount rate, to 4.5 per cent, is an aggressive move, particularly when the repurchase (or 'repo') rate remained well above its previous discount rate floor. Combined with the torrid growth of the money supply, this cut must be deemed risky. The Bundesbank's traditional monetarism is in question. If the risk it is taking does not prove justified in the medium term, Germany's reputation for monetary stability may be endangered as well. The last time the discount rate was this low was in June 1989, though prior to that it had been at, or below, this level for more than six years. But German consumer price inflation, though declining, is still running at an annual rate of over 3 per cent and, more important for Bundesbank credibility, the annualised increase of broad money (M3) between the last quarter of 1993 and March 1994 was 15.4 per cent. How then does the Bundesbank justify the latest of this series of interest rate cuts, which have lowered the discount rate by 1 1/4 percentage points and the repurchase rate by 65 basis points (0.65 percentage points) since February? It points to the improved prospects for inflation and the need to loosen a 'liquidity blockage', by which it means the willingness of investors to hold liquid deposits, included in M3, rather than less liquid assets. An additional factor will have been the strength of the D-Mark. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, argued only a week ago that too strong an appreciation of the D-Mark against the dollar was not in the interests of the German economy. The current performance of the German economy can justify this latest series of cuts. Industrial output has been bumping along the bottom since the end of 1992, while gross domestic product, though recovering, remains well below the peak in early 1992. The declining rate of inflation and the low level of wage settlements also justify expansionary moves. Against this are not only the money supply, but also the performance of German bonds: the yield on 10-year bonds rose by 109 basis points, to 6.63 per cent between the beginning of January and Tuesday of this week. While less than in the US or the UK, this increase demonstrates that inflationary fears have not been slain. At the same time, the special factors that are used to explain the rapid growth of M3 are less than convincing. It is also not true that M3 growth would necessarily decline if people were prepared to shift into less liquid deposits. The principal determinant of broad money is credit growth, which may even be increased by the lower interest rates and recovering economy. It was easier to justify rapid cuts in German interest rates a year ago than it is now, which suggests that the Tietmeyer Bundesbank is different from that of his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schlesinger. This is not the first time policymakers have decided to explain away inconvenient monetary numbers, one particularly sad example being the UK in the second half of the 1980s. It is to be hoped that the Bundesbank is not making a comparable mistake.</p>

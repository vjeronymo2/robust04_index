			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / International Company News: CSA/Air France dispute intensifies The Czech government has stepped up pressure on Air France to sell its minority stake in CSA to regain control of the cash-strapped Czech national carrier. Czech government sources yesterday said financial institutions and two other airlines had shown interest in CSA. CSA said Czech investors were interested in buying Air France's stake. CSA said a letter had been sent to Air France last Saturday asking the French carrier to sell its stake to Czech subjects. But Air France, which jointly with the Caisse des Depots, the French state financial institution, paid Dollars 30m for almost 20 per cent of CSA in 1992, yesterday insisted it wanted to remain a shareholder in CSA. It said it regarded CSA as a long-term investment. Although the Czech government has made it clear it considers the withdrawal of Air France from CSA as its preferred solution for the Czech airline, negotiations with the French company and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), which holds nearly 20 per cent in CSA, are continuing. The trial of strength between the two sides rests on Czech demands for greater control on the airline's board which Air France is resisting. The Czech government is seeking to modify the June 1992 agreement with CSA's foreign partners, especially the rule on majority votes for important decisions at board level. Although the Czech government has a majority of members on the board, important decisions require the vote of the foreign partners. Air France and EBRD have asked for a refund from the Czech government because they claim the airline was overvalued by about Kcs746m (Dollars 25m) at the time of the deal two years ago. The French demands appear to have prompted the Czech government to seek to strengthen its control of the airline in return for injecting fresh funds in CSA, which is expected to lose Kcs1.2bn in 1993. However, there have been growing suggestions that the Czech government is examining the role of foreign investors in large Czech companies.</p>

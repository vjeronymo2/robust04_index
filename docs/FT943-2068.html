			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / Observer: Homely homily For once, British Telecom, which has just torn up a Pounds 1,000 bill incurred by a toddler 'phoning' his great grandparents in the West Indies, can teach other companies a thing or two about customer relations. The House of Fraser group, for instance, has been having a rather unseemly wrangle with a pensioner. Ten years ago, Walter Mealey sent Pounds 1,006 to one of its stores for some furniture, which he then decided against buying. He left the money at the store reasoning that, if he could find nothing else to spend it on, House of Fraser would eventually pay him a reasonable rate of interest. Most unwise. If he had put it into almost any building society, his original sum would by now be worth more than Pounds 2,000, thanks to fairly high interest yields during the 1980s. After lengthy correspondence, the store has now sent him a cheque for Pounds 1,250 - the original sum plus Pounds 244 interest, which the group calls a 'gesture of goodwill'. Obviously the annual percentage rate on goodwill doesn't match that charged on most store cards.</p>

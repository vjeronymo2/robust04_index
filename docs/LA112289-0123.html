			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT;  </P> <P> CONFERENCE FOCUSES ON AREA SOCIAL NEEDS  </P> <P> For the first time, top decision-makers from several public and private human  service organizations in South Orange County met to share information Tuesday  on the rapidly developing social needs there.  </P> <P> The first Human Service Conference, held at the Dana Point Resort hotel, gave  such public officials as Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez a  chance to meet representatives of more than 140 social service groups, in  workshops dealing with issues from drug abuse to mental health.  </P> <P> "All these groups speak as individual voices," said Judy Curreri, Dana Point  city councilwoman. "We had to speak as a unified voice. This conference is a  start."  </P> <P> The event was sponsored by the South Orange County Community Services Council,  a coalition of social service groups.  </P> <P> "By bringing together people who are the real decision makers in the community,  we can make a real dent" in the social problems facing South County, said Lee  Steelman, council president.  </P> <P> Although a dozen seminars on different issues were offered, a common complaint  was that help for people in crisis is frequently scarce.  </P> <P> Diane Gipson, a county social worker who deals with child abuse, said: "There  are more and more people looking for help. And there is a real lack of services  available in South Orange County."  </P> <P> Steelman recalled one man who called a Community Services information line and  threatened to commit suicide.  </P> <P> She took the man's number and promised to find help. Several phone calls later,  she was still looking. "One mental health unit actually told me that if I gave  them his name, they'd have to call the police," she said. Steelman finally  found a private psychiatrist willing to see the distraught man.  </P> <P> The well-known affluence of South County, "casts a false shadow on the needs of  people here," Steelman said. "That false impression has a harmful effect on  people who don't have money."  </P> <P> The council president said that many service organizations also have financial  trouble. Charitable contributions from Orange County residents lag far behind  donations raised by other California communities, she noted.  </P> <P> Keynote speaker Narda Zacchino, editor of the Orange County Edition of The  Times, said: "There is a callous indifference for the less fortunate among us.  There is a coldness among public officials that hasn't gotten better. It has  gotten much worse."  </P> <P> Another keynote speaker, Mark Baldassare, a demographer who teaches at UC  Irvine, said that although a recent poll showed 53% of South County residents  make more than $50,000 annually, many people still must rent their homes.  </P> <P> With over one third paying rent, "The image of the expensive house (in South  County), with a pool, isn't true," he said.

			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Limiting the risks at Lloyd's LLOYD'S of London has taken a decisive step towards abandoning its proudest boast: the unlimited liability, down to the last cuff-link, of everyone who stands behind the market's insurance policies. Nonetheless, the rules under which limited liability companies will be allowed to become Lloyd's members, published yesterday, offer the best hope of preserving the rest of the market's traditions. Lloyd's faces four interlinked problems: the trail of 'long-tail' claims for environmental and product liabilities under old US policies; the litigation crisis, which has threatened to tie up much of the market in an endless spiral of claims and lawsuits about the underwriting errors of the late 1980s and early 1990s; the flight of capital, as Names damaged by those losses take the first opportunity to escape from the market; and the growing threat to Lloyd's from rival centres, especially Bermuda. If the attempt to woo corporate capital is successful, it will address each of these issues. Once professional investors start to take advantage of the new incorporated Lloyd's vehicles, they will be signalling their faith in the management's strategy of erecting a 'ring-fence' to protect new participants from the damage of the past. A vote of confidence in the ring-fence is the best indicator available that the long-tail and litigation problems are not enough to threaten Lloyd's survival, as at one time seemed possible. The supply of incorporated funds will also help ensure Lloyd's has a strong enough capital base in the future to underwrite the scale of business necessary to cover its fixed costs. Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, says the market is not facing an immediate shortfall of capital, but needs corporate funds as a guarantee that future inflows will be adequate to meet its needs. Similarly, a flood of new capital would be an indication that, though Lloyd's is losing its monopoly on specialist insurance skills, it still has the power to attract new money. Much turns, therefore, on the response to the new incorporated opportunities. Initial indications are positive: investment banks say that, despite the damage of recent years, the Lloyd's name and the current healthy state of reinsurance rates are enough to attract keen investor interest. Mr Middleton is well aware, however, that the key to success is the extent to which Lloyd's meets its new goals of lower costs and greater professionalism. Without that, Lloyd's brave gesture of opening itself to corporate membership will be an empty one. In the long run, capital is only available to financial institutions demonstrating sustained profitability. Once, that was Lloyd's second-proudest boast. The market's members must hope it proves more durable than the first.</p>

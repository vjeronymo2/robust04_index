			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Liberal Democrats in Brighton: Power-sharing for Ulster backed Delegates approved a new policy statement on Northern Ireland in spite of continuing doubts over the permanence of the ceasefire declared by the IRA. The statement called for a power-sharing executive in Ulster, with cross-border agencies providing an 'Irish dimension'. Lord Holme, who played a leading role in framing the new policy, urged the US authorities to join the British government in pressing for further clarification. He suggested that they should 'squeeze out' of Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the word permanent or something akin to it before granting him another visa. A sharply contrasting view was expressed by Ms Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive Democrats in the Irish Republic. In her role as guest speaker Ms Harney said she had concluded that, even if the IRA was engaging in a face-saving exercise, it would be 'ungenerous and churlish' not to recognise that lives were still being saved. Mr John Roberts, chairman of the party's Northern Ireland policy working group, replied that it would be 100 times harder to achieve a long-term settlement than it had been to win a ceasefire.</p>

The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 93&hyph;SW&hyph;18&hyph;AD, 2601 Meacham Boulevard, Room 663, Fort Worth, Texas 76137.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to Sikorsky Aircraft Model S&hyph;58 and S&hyph;58T series helicopters. There have been four failures of the transmission main gear box ring gear (ring gear), part number (P/N) S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2, reported by the manufacturer. The failures were caused by a slow-growth fatigue crack in a single tooth on the drive side of the ring gear. The ring gear is a critical part in the main transmission. Therefore, any cracks in the teeth of the ring gear create an unsafe condition. This condition, if not corrected, could result in failure of the ring gear, failure of the main transmission, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved Sikorsky Aircraft Alert Service Bulletin No. 58B35&hyph;32, dated July 6, 1993, that describes procedures for removal and replacement of the ring gear, provides a new mandatory retirement life for the ring gear, provides for originating a component time-in-service record, and provides for marking a permanent serial number on zero-time and replacement ring gears as well as ring gears removed for servicing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require removing and replacing the ring gear within certain time intervals, establishing a mandatory retirement life of 2,500 hours' total time-in-service, originating a component service record, and marking a serial number on the ring gear, P/N S1635&hyph;20058&hyph;2. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 125 helicopters of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 31.5 work hours per helicopter to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would cost approximately $2,000 per ring gear. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $466,562.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

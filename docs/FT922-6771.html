			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Russian deputies to lay claim to Crimea THE Russian parliament is expected today to revoke the 1954 gift of Crimea to Ukraine. Mr Vladimir Podoprigora, deputy chairman of the parliament's committee for relations with former Soviet republics, said most parliamentary factions were prepared to vote 'yes' on the proposal. The much-postponed resolution decrees that Khrushchev's decision to transfer Crimea from Russia to Ukraine was unconstitutional. Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, condemned the proposal and said it would further undermine relations with Russia. 'Ukraine has not passed a single political resolution which interferes in the domestic affairs of Russia,' he said. Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, chairman of the Russian parliament, sought to reassure Ukraine that Russia's review of the 1954 transfer was a matter of historic justice not a territorial claim, but Mr Kravchuk dismissed this justification. 'This is a question of justice from the Russian point of view but if we are to follow this logic then all unjust acts must be reversed beginning with 1917 or even earlier.' Mr Kravchuk accused the Russian parliament of violating international law and ignoring political reality. Mr Podoprigora denied the vote would mean Russia reclaiming Crimea, since both countries remained bound by an agreement not to seek border changes as long as they remained part of the Commonwealth. But whatever the rhetoric of some deputies and Russian nationalists, the Russian leadership has good reason to preserve the status quo. By reclaiming Crimea, Russia would create a precedent for territorial claims by others on its land. In Simferopol, the Crimean parliament backed away from confrontation with Ukraine yesterday by repealing an act of independence passed last month.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Narek Mesropyan: "An Ambassadors' Plot? They </F> Would Have Behaved Better in `High Society'"]    [Text] People behave differently as guests, but even when  they feel themselves "at home," it is only to up a certain  limit. There are lines that are not to be crossed. These  unwritten laws exist not only among Armenians. And we are not  the ones who invented the saying "my home is my castle." And a  castle has its own rules. In short, one does not bring his own  samovar to Tula; when in Rome, do as the Romans do; and so on.  There are no rules without exceptions, however.    It is assumed that if you feed someone, this gives you  certain rights. For fairness' sake, we should point out that  this exception has become a rule not only here, but in every  corner of one-sixth of the dry land. Here, however, unlike in  other places, guests feel free to do things they perhaps would  not dare to do even among Australian aborigines.    I am talking about the most honored guests. Ambassadors.    What Mr. Stupishin, the Russian Federation ambassador, felt  free to do is well known. It only seems at the first glance that  his attacks were aimed at our newspaper: It is obvious to  everyone whose pain and concerns GOLOS ARMENII voices. In any  event, those whose interests are described on our pages do not  throw a feast amidst a plague, do not take advantage of the  people's misery, do not buy up for peanuts art works or, for  instance, silver, and do not pretend that the obvious wealth of  some is the expression of well-being of all others. These people  have no relation to the ruling circles, which does not mean at  all that they do not have a right to life and their own  viewpoint.    In attempting to morally destroy them in one strike (and  using the basest verbal cliches at that), the ambassador of  Russia (we hope, though, an ambassador of only certain circles  of it) already now, long before the beginning of the election  campaign, attempted to wipe out a whole class of people who  resist the current authority--which means lawlessness, an  authoritarian regime, attempts at completely turning the country  into a police state, and many other troubles, which constitutes  everything we habitually still call life.    Let us not talk about diplomatic etiquette and its  expression  in every particular case. When there is a street fight, good  manners are dispensed with. And Mr. Stupishin needed so much to  do publicly a service for the current Armenian authorities,  which almost entirely absorbed the main inciters of anti-Russian  sentiments, that he did get into this street fight, not noticing  in the heat of servitude that he is turning into a color he  likes to paint others with.    But is he alone?    Not too much time has passed since the kerosene benefactor,  U.S. Ambassador Mr. Gilmore, decided to complement humanitarian  aid with public statements that Armenia has the right  authorities. We had barely had time to digest Bush's praise of  Levon Ter-Petrosyan when the ambassador began to opine that  those who, figuratively speaking, see even one spot on the  bright sun of the AOD [Armenian National Movement], are wrong.  The pro-Petrosyan lobby made of ambassadors thus became as  run-of-the-mill a thing as, for instance, "all-people's support"  for Yeltsin's resolve that manifested itself in the tanks  shelling the Russian Supreme Soviet.    The new world order, whose establishment is propped on the  shoulders of both Yeltsin and Ter-Petrosyan, apparently also  assumes a new function for diplomacy. Ambassadors are permitted,  for instance, to interfere unceremoniously in the internal  affairs of the countries where they are accredited, express  their opinion on the subject of some or other political force or  simply a group of people, exert pressure on the public  opinion--which means on the formation of a political system. A  convenient and useful one for them in every respect, of course.    Any state that is bold enough to call itself sovereign, even  for appearances' sake, should theoretically be upset over the  diplomatic "liberties" and attempt to make it clear to the  frolicking ambassadors that this sort of attitude at the very  least is demeaning; such a natural protest, however, apparently  has been dropped from the rules of behavior both by superpowers  and by those who, having lost their tracks, cannot decide which  republic--in a numeric count--of his country he is the head of.    And since such simple things are still a subject for debate,  there is nothing shameful in feeling free to drop a delicate  hint or resort to very obvious dictat. Just recently, for  instance, the French ambassador, Mme. d'Arteng, reproached  Armenia that our republic had not been brave enough to start  searching for new allies. But if one can somehow swallow such  remarks, seeing them as a statement of a fait accompli and the  diplomatic defeat of the ambassador herself, it is not clear why  did Mme. d'Arteng would need to send our young men, who have  already been in the war, to foreign countries, thereby  condemning them to the status of "wild geese." Is it perhaps  that the ambassador wants to protect the current regime from  those who already are used to fighting evil by other methods  and, given the current omnipotence of the police, will not feel  comfortable?    One can ask himself a lot of such questions. No answers will  be forthcoming anyway. Everybody will do what they see fit to  do. Without restraint.    Actually, when one is surrounded by lawlessness, it is hard  to expect that even ambassadors will behave themselves as they  would in high society. And because of that, in all truth, their  plot exudes too much of the local aroma.</p>

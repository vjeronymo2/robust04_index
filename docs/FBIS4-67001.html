			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Husayn al-Harbi] </F>   [Text] A team from the Criminal Investigation Department  has thwarted an attempt to smuggle in 100 kg of hashish and  1,000 crates of whiskey by sea. The authorities were tracking  the would-be smugglers from the beginning of the operation. The  leader was apprehended at sea with a part of the contraband.  His partner fled and was later caught, after midnight,  following a shootout with Interior Ministry personnel assisted  by al-Ahmadi patrols. A car driven by the second suspect, along  with the balance of the shipment, was also seized.</p>

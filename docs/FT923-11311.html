			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / London Stock Exchange: Wellcome success claimed AS book-building for the Wellcome share offer closed last night, lead managers for the global tender process were confident of success. Nevertheless, the shares slipped dangerously closer to the 800p minimum set for the issue price by managers Robert Fleming. The shares closed 4 lower at 826p with a hefty 1.6m traded. Wellcome Trust, the governing charity which holds 73.5 per cent of the pharmaceutical company's equity, has planned to release 330m shares, or 38.5 per cent. To create a healthy interest in the aftermarket, and prevent the share price slipping after the sale has been completed, initial orders for some 380m to 400m shares are considered necessary. As trading finished, Fleming indicated that it had received orders for around 350m shares with yesterday's interest from the US still awaited. Mr Ian Hannam, who is heading the global co-ordination for Fleming said; 'We have to wait for final indications but, as at 4.30pm, the target amount has been exceeded. Considering the state of the market it has been a phenomenal achievement.' Sceptics maintained their doubts over the full flotation of the 330m shares and some small selling in London on behalf of a US client who wanted to buy American Depositary Receipts knocked the market price. However, early positive comment by the head of investment at Legal &amp; General helped sentiment, and it appeared that UK institutions were finally showing their hands. Amstrad surprise News of another resignation from the board of Amstrad came just a few minutes ahead of the official close, giving traders little time to react. Dealers said they expect the shares to open sharply lower on Monday, possibly around 23p to 24p, after the market has had time to assess the latest developments. 'Amstrad is seen as an unmitigated disaster,' said one electronics specialist who added that no more news would be forthcoming from the company ahead of its results in October. What little activity took place after the news was on a small scale and left the shares  1/2 off at 28 1/2 p. Turnover reached 3.2m shares, with traders talking of some large deals booked after the close. Analysts were dismayed at the resignation of Mr Peter Thoms, group financial director. The news came only a day after Amstrad revealed that its losses for the year end-June will be around Pounds 25m more than previously expected, or in the region of Pounds 65m. Earlier this week it was revealed that corporate finance director, Mr Ken Ashcroft, was leaving to head up Betcom, Amstrad's 71 per cent owned telephone manufacturing subsidiary. Shell downgraded Shell suffered heavy selling after UK analysts dissected second-quarter results from US oil giant Exxon, focusing on the poor performance of non-US refining and marketing earnings, which fell by around two thirds compared with the first quarter. County NatWest lowered its forecast for Shell's second quarter current cost net income from Pounds 520m to Pounds 470m compared with the Pounds 952m it recorded in the first quarter. Shell closed 9 weaker at 458p, having touched 454p earlier in the session. There were also stories that one of the big Japanese broking houses had been recommending a switch out of Shell and into British Gas. ICI easier Anyone who had spent just over a year on a desert island and was ignorant of Hanson's Pounds 240m investment in ICI would have been none the wiser yesterday. On the morning of Smith New Court's initial market raid in May 1991, for Hanson, the stock stood at 1100p. This stake was sold in May this year for a reputed 1400p a share. Yesterday, the shares dipped below 1100p for the first time since just before the deal, losing 18 to 1098p. Smiths' chemical team, which has had its teeth into ICI for many months, refuses to let go. The house has steadily reduced its 1992 forecast from around Pounds 1.1bn to Pounds 750m and believes the interims next Thursday will produce only Pounds 430m. The house recently suggested the shares would be worth picking up at the current price but, because of the poor state of the London market, it is now believed to be content for them to drift off another 50p. A Kleinwort Benson sell note hit General Accident, down 5 1/2 at 363p, while worries about Guardian Royal Exchange's life assurance book saw the shares, badly hit at one point on Thursday, dip 7 to 114p on heavy turnover of 6.8m. Lasmo closed a busy week on a thoroughly depressed note. A series of selling raids, only partly arrested by highly encouraging exploration reports, kept the shares on the retreat all week; yesterday they fell again, closing a further 8 lower at 117p, after a low of 113 1/2 p. The shares have slumped amid worries that the group may pass its interim dividend, when the figures are revealed next Wednesday. They were also damaged by fears that the company may be dropped from the prestigious Footsie list of top shares. Yesterday Kleinwort Benson, the influential London broking firm, lowered its net asset value for Lasmo to 207p. Other London analysts are thought to have chopped their asset values in recent days, with some said be much lower than the Kleinwort figure. BP held at 206p against a very weak equity market, with the shares propped up by some determined buying interest, said to have originated in the US. Big overseas buying, especially from Switzerland and the US has been a feature of trading in BP in recent sessions. Greene King lost 30 to 467p, as its bid for Morland (down 41 at 420p), failed, resulting in acceptances of only 45.95 per cent. Bass slipped 17 to 522p on good turnover of 2.1m, following a report that broker Cazenove had cut forecasts. Food services and distribution group Albert Fisher closed unchanged at 39p, but turnover was a hefty 4.4m in reaction to news that Mr Tony Millar, the executive chairman, had resigned. The company said overall trading remains in line with expectations. Northern Foods fell 9 to 580p after the chairman told the annual meeting that the group had seen no improvement. Mirror Group continued to attract support, adding 3 at 72p on heavy turnover of 11m. However, suggestions that a stakeholder would be revealed shortly after the close of trading proved unfounded. Middle East worries prompted a decline in some transport stocks. British Airways fell 10 to 248p, while BAA eased 12 to 630p. Inchcape fell 19 to 392p. after Hoare Govett cut forecasts. News of an order worth about Pounds 500m from Canada for 50 EH101 advanced technology helicopters boosted Westland by 4 to 108p. British Aerospace continued in the doldrums, the shares losing another 7 to 192p. The clutch of downgrades in Lucas Industries continued to dog the shares which shed 3 to 99p, though traders reported buying at the lower levels.

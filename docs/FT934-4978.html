			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Newspaper Publishing falls Pounds 486,000 into the red Newspaper Publishing, the company behind The Independent and The Independent on Sunday, has moved into loss as it prepares to raise vital new long-term finance to secure its future. For the year to September 26 there were pre-tax losses of Pounds 486,000 compared with a Pounds 28,000 profit. Losses per share were 2.3p and no dividend is recommended. A main factor in the loss was Pounds 350,000 in professional fees arising from the failed attempt to take over The Observer, which went instead to The Guardian Media Group. Mr Ian Hay Davison, the chairman, said that revenue had held up well in a difficult year - turnover at Pounds 81.4m was only marginally down from last time's Pounds 81.8m. However, 'since the year end product redevelopment costs of Pounds 2.35m have been incurred on advertising and other promotional expenditure', he said. The company has a 'multi-million pound' bank facility which runs until the end of March 1994. Between now and then the company will have to get new long-term finance in place or renegotiate the bank facility. Mr Hay Davison confirmed that a business plan was being formulated 'which will form the basis for raising the long-term finance necessary for the company to go forward.' The options range from a rights issue which could give the largest shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy, effective control, bringing in a large new shareholder to a full takeover. The company sees a full takeover as the least likely option at the moment. Newspaper Publishing is going into its refinancing plan with the circulation of both its titles under pressure. The Independent is currently selling about 320,000 copies a day and The Independent on Sunday 360,000. The daily paper's market share has fallen from 17 per cent in 1992 to 16.1 per cent now and the Sunday title has a stable share of about 14.3 per cent. The market share figures mask a serious absolute drop in sales. Between May and October The Independent's circulation fell from 374,668 to 333,647, a fall of nearly 11 per cent. In the same period The Independent on Sunday fell by 8 per cent to 368,246.</p>

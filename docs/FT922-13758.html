			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls for second day in nervous trading Wall Street CONTINUED weakness in Japanese stocks, concern that US equities are over-priced, and another wave of index-related program selling pushed Wall Street sharply lower for the second day, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, after dropping as low as 3,163.47 in the morning, closed 32.20 down on balance at 3,181.35 for a two-day plunge of 94 points. Total New York SE volume was a heavy 249.3m shares. Declining issues led advances by 1,392 to 409 on the big board. The Dow's lowest close of the year was 3,172.41 on January 2. The falls were less dramatic in other market indices, which analysts said had started to correct ahead of the Dow. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was 3.56 off at 394.50, while the Nasdaq composite lost 7.93 to 573.68. Bank issues were particularly hard hit by the erosion in their Japanese counterparts. Rumours that a Japanese bank had failed to make a payment on a swap contract swept through the market in the morning, prompting Bankers Trust to deny rumours that it had taken a large loss from the failure of a swap transaction. JP Morgan and Bankers Trust dipped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 52 3/8 and Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 51 3/8 respectively. BankAmerica shed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 38 7/8 but Citicorp edged forward Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 15 1/4 . IBM was one of the few blue chips to buck the trend yesterday, adding Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 84 7/8 . The improvement was attributed to a higher rating of the stock by Merrill Lynch. Blue chips falling in active trading included AT&amp;T, off Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 40 7/8 , and General Electric, down Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 72 7/8 . Wal-Mart continued to see active trading following the death of the company's founder earlier this week. The stock, which had moved higher immediately after the news of the death of Mr Sam Walton, lost Dollars 1/4 yesterday to Dollars 51 3/8 . Among big retailers, Sears rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 44 5/8 , Woolworth improved Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 29 and The Limited slipped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 . In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer lost Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 but Microsoft improved Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 117 1/4 . Teledyne plunged Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 22 3/4 after the electronics equipment company posted first-quarter operating profits of 21 cents a share, compared with 28 cents a year earlier. Primerica, which owns Smith Barney Harris Upham, fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 37 on fears that the securities sector may not be able to maintain its record earnings. Canada TORONTO continued its downward trend but ended above the day's worst. The composite index lost 18.5 to 3,318.1, after Tuesday's 49-point drop. The index touched 3,299.1 at its low for the day. Falls outscored gains by 443 to 152 after volume of 27.4m shares. Traders said the market is nervously looking ahead to the US producer and consumer price indices for March due today and tomorrow respectively. Depending on the figures, the market could see the US Federal Reserve ease its monetary policy. Power Corp dipped CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 14 1/2 after the company reported slightly lower fourth-quarter earnings. Power Financial gave up CDollars  7/8 to CDollars 19 1/4 after announcing higher fourth-quarter earnings. Alberta Energy, up CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 10 1/4 , increased its annual dividend to 35 cents a share from 33 cents.</p>

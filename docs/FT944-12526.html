			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Campbell &amp; Armstrong cuts losses Campbell &amp; Armstrong, the shop and office fitting group, cut pre-tax losses from Pounds 1.88m to Pounds 198,000 in the six months to June 30. Turnover in the period rose by 8.6 per cent from Pounds 24.5m to Pounds 26.6m. Last year's figure, however, included Pounds 168,000 from discontinued operations. At the operating level there was a profit of Pounds 95,000, against a deficit of Pounds 912,000 last time. The pre-tax outcome was helped by the absence of exceptional items - last year the company booked an Pounds 815,000 loss on disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, less a release of closure provisions of Pounds 78,000 made in 1991. The net interest charge rose from Pounds 228,000 to Pounds 293,000. Losses per share came out at 1.4p (7.9p).</p>

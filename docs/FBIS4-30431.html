			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] It has been learned that with a view to turning  the North-South armistice status into a peace system, the  government has worked out a policy of concluding "the agreement  for ending the armistice status and establishing a peace system  between the North and the South (provisional title)".    On 27 June, a relevant high-ranking government official said  that "the North-South basic agreement stipulated that `the North  and the South shall make efforts to turn the armistice status  into a peace system.' Based on this, the government decided to  make a proposal to conclude an `agreement for ending the  armistice status and establish a peace system.'"    This government policy is put forward on the basis of its  judgment that at a time when a preliminary contact for a  North-South summit is to be held and a North-South dialogue,  including the summit, will likely be pushed ahead actively, and  when North Korea-U.S. dialogue, including a third round of North  Korea-U.S. high-level talks, which even envisages the  establishment of diplomatic relations, is being accelerated, the  present armistice system between the North and the South can  hardly make the two sides coexist, and thus the turning of this  system into a peace system is inevitable.    This official also noted that "The present Armistice  Agreement prescribes that the agreement is effective until it is  replaced with another agreement. Therefore, it is necessary to  conclude a new agreement." Although North Korea demanded to the  United States in the past that the Armistice Agreement be  replaced with a peace agreement, North Korea did not put forward  this proposal to the South side owing to differences in views  between the two sides.

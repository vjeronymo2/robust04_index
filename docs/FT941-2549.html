			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Arts: Choreographer to the great - The elegance and passion of Roland Petit's latest work show him as dazzlingly a man of the theatre as ever Roland Petit celebrated his 70th birthday in January. Impossible, of course: the reference books lie, for this spirit of French ballet, French theatre, remains what he has always been, a creator (and an interpreter) of prodigious vitality, wit, and dramatic flair. And as if to prove it, Petit last week produced three new works for the Paris Opera Ballet, their elegance and passion showing him as dazzlingly a man of the theatre as ever. It is the sheer craft, the mastery of means, that alone tell Petit's age and experience: no young choreographer today could be as daring, and tread the creative high wire with such aplomb. It is fitting that Petit should mark this anniversary in the Palais Garnier, in which he grew up as pupil and apprentice dancer. He was, and he remains, the very essence of Parisian theatre. By 1945 he had fled its musty confines, had made his first creations, and had gained the friendship and support of some of the most significant artistic figures in Paris - Kochno, Berard, Cocteau, Laurencin. His ballets of that period - Les Forains with its troupe of strolling players, its insidious Sauguet score, its miraculous design by Berard of a cart and a piece of red cloth; Le Jeune Homme et la mort, where death comes to a youth in a garret, beneath the flash of the Citroen sign - remain among the truest examples of French culture as the war years gave way to a renaissance of theatre, fashion, art, which Petit's ballets typified. Petit has always been an admirable indicator of the newest ideas; has joyously explored ballet, theatre, cinema, music hall, often with his wife and muse, Zizi Jeanmaire; and has in everything been stylish, vivid, and - rarest virtue - totally unpompous. His eye for design is unrivalled in the history of ballet, whence the fact that Picasso and Dior, Max Ernst, David Hockney, Paul Delvaux, Antoni Clave, Yves Saint Laurent, de Chirico, Tinguely, Erte and the graffiti artist Keith Haring, are among those who have decorated his productions. His sense of occasion, his ability to frame and enhance a dancer, have led to creations that have been worthy of Fonteyn, exquisite as the cat heroine of Les Demoiselles de la nuit; of Baryshnikov, as Herman in Queen of Spades; of Makarova, as The Blue Angel; of Plisetskaya in La Rose malade; of Peter Schaufuss as the Phantom of the Opera. His stagings for Jeanmaire have taken audiences from ballet (Zizi as the first, the only Carmen) to cinema (Zizi and Bing Crosby in Anything Goes), and music hall (Zizi, positively Zizissima, surrounded by ses boys, a mass of feathers, and those miraculous legs set to conquer the world). And there has been Petit as director for the past two decades of the fine Ballet de Marseille, for which he has made an astonishing variety of work. For Petit is a consummate man of the theatre. He has been, and remains, a dance-actor of tremendous allure. He has made memorably good full-length ballets: Cyrano dazzled by its economy and imaginative wit; Les Intermittence du coeur was a poetically sensitive exploration of Proust's world; Notre Dame de Paris and The Phantom of the Opera were hymns to his native city as well as skilful adaptations of two popular novels. He has re-made, gracefully, ballets' classics - a joyous Coppelia, an unfailingly happy Nutcracker. He has even published a volume of memoirs, J'ai danse sur les flots, which is a series of lightning sketches of his work and friends, and like his choreography and his dancing, blazes with life. The life-force is strong in the three new pieces he has made for the Opera Ballet. The thread on which they hang is scores by composers of the second Viennese school. The opening Passacaille uses Webern's opus 5 orchestral suite and the opus 1 Passacaglia. The choreography is plotless, the stage bare, the forces are a central couple - Agnes Letestu and Jose Martinez - with an attendant group of six couples. Costuming, by Herve Leger, offers white, exiguous tops and skirts or briefs, the women crowned with Nefertiti-like caps. The image is of the Pharoahs on the beach at Cannes, and is ineffably stylish. And so is the dance, which looks hieratic, off-beat, and is stunningly done. There follows Rythme de valses, with a chamber group at the back of the stage playing the Strauss waltzes that Berg, Webern and Schoenberg orchestrated for a musical evening. Three couples are each occupied with their own number, then united for the closing Emperor Waltz. The girls appear wearing Leger's ballooning skirts, then step out of them to dance in striped leotards. Their partners are in vestigial Hussar outfits. We are, we may suppose, to see the skeleton of the waltz itself. Not even that] With what I salute as his conjuring tricks, Petit makes each couple do everything except waltz. They make jokes, hint at mad steps, stretch, strut, embroider movement ideas and, yes, they are inhabited by the insidious onward pulse of the waltz itself. The piece is a capriccio by a master, most successful, I think, in the opening waltz which is done with adorable and youthful ease by Aurelie Dupont and Eric Quillere. Mlle Dupont is beautiful, entrancingly cool; Quillere is ardent, brilliant. The other couples (Carole Arbo and Lionel Delanoe; Fanny Gaida and Wilfried Romoli) are no less feat, though the cream of the ballet lies in its first section, where Petit states his cunning choreographic thesis. Petit's dramatic taste has often seemed haunted by death, and never more violently or more frankly so than in the Camera Obscura which closes the bill. This is a trio whose emotional situation was sparked off by Nabokov's novel, Laughter in the dark. Petit subtitles it Love is blind, and the love of the wealthy Albinus (Patrick Dupond) for a sluttish cinema usherette, Margot (Marie Claude Pietragalla), is blind in its obsession, as in the fact that he is deprived of sight after a car accident. Albinus becomes aware of Margot's passion for the young Rex (Nicolas Le Riche). He seeks to shoot him, but is, instead, shot by Margot. It is not this grubby narrative that occupies Petit, but its inner world of sexual obsession. To convey it, the choreography becomes more frank, more greedily sensual, than anything I have seen from him before, the dramatic scheme more allusive and more potent. The score, assembled from Schoenberg piano works, is ideally resonant. Performances, like the feelings they convey, are incandescent: Pietragalla, presented as irresistible flesh, is superb. Dupond catches all Albinus' sexual hunger; Le Riche admirably shows Rex's luscious physical allure as well as his miserable lack of courage. Once again, Petit has illuminated the gifts of exceptional dancers. Once again, with Bernard Michel's light-installation of a set - neon, lasers - he has shown a way forward in stage imagery. Once again, he has demonstrated that panache, that unerring understanding of the theatre - where ballet, let us never forget, must live and flourish - which has always fired his art, as creator, performer, director. The Petit programme is at the Opera Garnier, Paris, on March 19, 21, 22.</p>

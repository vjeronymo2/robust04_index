			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Regions see 40% rise in finance jobs JOBS have continued to be created in financial services outside London in spite of recession, according to research by Leeds University. Regional employment in the industry leapt by more than 40 per cent between 1981 and 1991 to reach more than 250,000. While London was hit by recession, growth continued almost everywhere else. Only in Birmingham and Bradford did it stall. Birmingham - which may have suffered from relative proximity to London - still emerged from the 1991 census with more than 30,000 financial services jobs, as did Edinburgh and Manchester. Bradford's stalled growth almost certainly reflects a local shift to its neighbour Leeds. In the census Bristol, Leeds and Glasgow recorded more than 25,000 each, but Leeds has been showing the fastest recent growth - 19 per cent between 1989 and 1991.</p>

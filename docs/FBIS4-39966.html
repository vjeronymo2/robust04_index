			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS commentator Tamara Zamyatina on </F> interview with Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian President's  Staff, specially for ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI; date and place not  given: "Sergey Filatov: Russia Needs a Policy of Accord"]    [Text] The fourth anniversary of the adoption of the  Declaration of Russian State Sovereignty 12 June 1990 confirms  that, by gaining independence, the Russian Federation [RF] has  survived as an integral state and is still growing stronger.  That was the opinion voiced during an interview with your  ITAR-TASS commentator by Sergey Filatov, head of the Russian  President's Staff. Moreover, according to him, the problem does  not boil down to ensuring the inviolability of state borders and  defending the country against external threat. It is a question  of creating a contemporary federal state in which both the  regions and citizens of various nationalities enjoy extensive  democratic rights.    Sergey Filatov recalled that Boris Yeltsin issued an edict 4  June giving 12 June the status of a RF state holiday. Since  this day currently falls on a Sunday, 13 June has been declared  a nonworking day in accordance with Russian laws.    In Sergey Filatov's opinion, the adoption of the new RF  Constitution, the Federation Treaty, and the bilateral Treaty  Between Russia and Tatarstan -- a document that was the prologue  to the establishment of new relations between the center and  Federation components -- were important milestones in the  strengthening of the Russian Federation.    "The Russian president's recent trip to Tatarstan  demonstrated that the bilateral treaty has helped secure total  political stabilization in a republic where separatist  sentiments were strong quite recently," my interlocutor noted.    On this basis it has become possible to formulate a program  to strengthen the republic's economy by joint efforts on the  part of the federal and republic authorities. Following the  example of the bilateral treaty with Tatarstan, similar  agreements will be signed in the near future with  Kabardino-Balkaria, Bashkiria, and Kaliningrad Oblast.    As far as strengthening the state is concerned, the head of  the President's Staff attaches great importance to the Treaty on  Social Accord, which has been signed in the past month by 854  statesmen, politicians, and public figures. Boris Yeltsin's  edict on the transformation of the Public Chamber under the  Russian president into a coordinating conciliation organ is  expected shortly in order to put this treaty into effect.    Tremendous work lies ahead in the sphere of regional policy,  which has not so far been backed up with legislative acts --  constitutions for republics within the RF, kray and oblast  charters, and a law on local self-government, which it is  intended to adopt in June. According to Sergey Filatov, the RF  president's State-Legal Administration and Administration for  Work with the Territories, along with the Ministry for  Nationalities' Affairs and Regional Policy, will direct their  efforts to providing Federation components with their own  legislation in the near future.    Sergey Filatov said that the aim of state regional policy is  to secure a "rich and uniform life for all Russia's citizens."  However, attaining this objective is inconceivable without  accord between the peoples inhabiting the RF. "Provided that  there is accord we will secure economic and political  stabilization as early as this year. If there is no accord you  can postpone the dream of a normal life until the next century,"  Sergey Filatov concluded.</p>

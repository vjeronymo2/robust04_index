			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Switzerland (10): Daunting task in the Balkans - The Red Cross THE International Committee of the Red Cross, founded to help the victims of war and guardian of the Geneva Conventions, is facing one of the biggest challenges of its 130-year history. Its effectiveness as the agent of humanity in wartime is being called into question in the former Yugoslavia in the most serious flouting of the Geneva Conventions since the Second World War. The test of the ICRC's legal and moral status on the battlefield - it is mentioned in the Geneva Conventions and is an observer at the United Nations  -comes at a time when it is seeking to redefine itself as a more international body, separate from its host country, Switzerland. At a quiet ceremony on March 17, the organisation officially severed its links with the Swiss government. The move resulted largely from Switzerland's fading neutrality after the Cold War. Bern's participation in UN sanctions against Iraq and moves towards closer ties with the European Community precipitated the separation in the interests of the ICRC's strict rules of independence. The government will continue, however, to finance a large portion of the ICRC's running costs. With some 30 operations in progress throughout the world, the ICRC's budget for 1993 is currently SFr754.6m (Pounds 336.8m). Of this total, SFr632m is earmarked for actions in the field such as the Balkans, Angola, Somalia and the former Soviet Union. These funds are raised in appeals to signatories of the Geneva Conventions, national Red Cross societies, and from donations. Another aspect of the ICRC's aim of becoming more international has been its decision to end its all-Swiss policy of delegate recruitment. Now candidates of any nationality can apply for selection as delegates. However, the top management will remain in Swiss hands. Its main decision-making body is a 25-member assembly of 'the great and the good' from the Swiss intellectual and business communities. They are expected to be sending young aid workers off to the Balkans war zone on the Zagreb express from Lausanne for some time to come. The poignancy of a train ride from Switzerland to a war in Europe has not been lost on the ICRC's headquarters staff. The organisation was born as the result of an earlier bloody war in Europe. A Swiss businessman, Henri Dunant, witnessed the suffering of wounded soldiers in the Franco-Austrian battle of Solferino, in Italy in 1859. On returning to his home city of Geneva he wrote a book, Memories of Solferino, in which he recounted the horrors of battle and the inhumanity of its aftermath. He proposed the setting up of a war relief agency out of which was born the ICRC and the Red Cross movement. The Geneva organisation then built up its reputation throughout the twentieth century and two world wars. Part of the the ICRC's task has been to help develop international humanitarian law from which it gets its mandate. Recent efforts by the ICRC to strengthen its reputation as an impartial intermediary in wartime has so far failed to add to its influence over Bosnia's political and military factions, which, with varying degrees of brutality, have broken formal agreements with the ICRC on the humane treatment of military and civilian victims. Repeated appeals for mercy to be shown to defenceless civilians, wounded combatants and prisoners in Bosnia have been ignored by the warring sides with a cynicism not witnessed by the humanitarian organisation, even during the bloody conflict in Afghanistan and some 17 years of civil war in Lebanon. Acts of vengeance, indiscriminate attacks on civilians, and the so-called 'ethnic cleansing,' have been carried out on what the organisation describes as 'a massive scale'. At its Geneva headquarters, a senior ICRC delegate held up four separate accords signed by Bosnia's Serb, Moslem and Croat leaders, and in one case the government in Belgrade, pledging to respect the Geneva Conventions. The first was signed on May 22 last year, a month after the conflict began, and all have been broken. 'In Bosnia we have had everything that is contrary to the Geneva Conventions,' the delegate said, 'massacres of civilians, the disappearance and execution of prisoners we have visited, rapes, mass arrests, expropriation of property, destruction of houses, and forced movement of civilian populations. HE adds: 'When you have 200 delegates working all over Bosnia trying to convince everyone, from the highest-ranking to the lowest, saying 'please behave humanely,' and you see its having no effect - what can you say?' Comparing the Balkans tragedy with the brutality the ICRC has witnessed in every conflict since the Second World War, the delegate says: 'There is a rationality gap in Bosnia that is bigger than anything we saw in Lebanon, or even Afghanistan.' One of the difficulties the ICRC has faced in increasing degrees over the past three or four years has been the politicisation and militarisation of humanitarian aid. The UN under Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali has adopted what it calls an 'Agenda for Peace.' The Egyptian UN chief has ruled that conflict operations must be integrated in every dimension: military, political and humanitarian. Where an organisation like the ICRC might find this policy advantageous in the initial phase of a war, the case of Bosnia suggests the advantages are only short-term. A political solution is still some way off and the humanitarian operation has been a relative failure. ICRC delegates, along with more than 500 local employees - of all ethnic groups - are based in 17 areas of the fragmented former communist country. They are striving to provide protection for civilians by being present in as many areas as possible. However, their main success to date has been securing the release of 5,000 prisoners of war.</p>

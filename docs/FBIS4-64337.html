			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["MJI"-signed report: "The FDP Does Not Mean the Army, but </F> Election Tactics"]    [Text] The Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social  Union [CDU/CSU] is becoming increasingly annoyed with the  Bundeswehr policy pursued by the Free Democratic Party [FDP] and  Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel.    The FDP chairman and his party's military experts have  rejected Defense Minister Volker Ruehe's plans -- the reduction  of the Bundeswehr from 370,000 to a maximum 340,000, the  reduction of military service to 10 months, and the option of a  flexible duration of military service. FDP military expert  Guenther Nolting criticized Ruehe's concept this week as "an  ill-considered emergency shot."    Members of the CDU Bundestag group have called this a  "double  game" of the FDP. Kinkel said on 27 January 1994: "We need a  new concept and Volker Ruehe should present it." FDP  Secretary-General Werner Hoyer said on 5 January: "An army of  370,000 men, a 12-month military service, the country's  security, the need to increase investment, and a lower defense  budget -- these elements of the Bundeswehr equation do not fit  together. That is why new considerations are necessary."    However, the concept presented by Ruehe in April was  rejected  by the FDP, even though it is in line with liberal demands. For  instance, in the coalition agreement following the 1990  elections, the FDP called for a nine-month military service. On  20 January, FDP Secretary General Hoyer advocated a  "differentiated military service." In this respect, "soldiers  should be trained for use in home defense brigades...within a  time that should be much shorter than 12 months."    The reduction of the troop strength that the FDP is now  criticizing actually was in accordance with liberal demands.  FDP expert Juergen Koppelin on 5 April considered a strength of  370,000 men as "hardly suitable" for an unbiased discussion of  the Bundeswehr's future.    The same Hoyer, whose January demands were considered in  Ruehe's planning, earlier this week mentioned the more likely  reason for the FDP's contradictory attitude. He said that  Ruehe's concept was an attempt to chum up with the Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] and a covert signal for a  grand coalition. So the FDP does not primarily mean the  Bundeswehr; it means election tactics.</p>

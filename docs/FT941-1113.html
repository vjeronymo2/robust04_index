			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The end of the account and interest rate worries created a day of turmoil in stock index futures, with an early fall to 3,081 turned around by US buying. The June contract on the FT-SE 100 closed at 3,138, about a point ahead of its fair value premium of around 10 points, with exceptionally high turnover. US institutions took it up to 3,147 in the afternoon before bond weakness pushed it back down. Meanwhile, traded options turnover was 40,000. Volume in FT-SE options was 18,577, and Land Securities was the busiest stock option at 3,079.</p>

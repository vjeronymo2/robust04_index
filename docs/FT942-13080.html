			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Stable currencies put on IMF agenda Continental European finance ministers have put greater exchange rate stability back on the international monetary agenda. But any idea of creating a new world monetary system or extending Europe's experience with the exchange rate mechanism to other countries stands virtually no chance of acceptance by the biggest industrial nations. Following the meeting this week of the policy-making interim committee of the International Monetary Fund, Mr Philippe Maystadt, Belgian finance minister and committee chairman, disclosed that the Fund's executive board had been asked to study 'possible ways to introduce a greater degree of discipline in the present exchange rate system'. The Fund board was asked to report back to the committee by its next meeting in Madrid in October. Mr Michel Camdessus, IMF managing director, made clear he believed there was little chance of a new system to stabilise exchange rates and that the problem was better addressed through strengthened co-ordination of economic policies.</p>

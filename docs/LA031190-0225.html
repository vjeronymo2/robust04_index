			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> The importance of writers in the success of a television series was especially  significant this season.  </P> <P> The highly successful "Roseanne" was a hit because of scripts that would be  hard for anyone to harm. We also had "Sister Kate," which had all the elements  for success except the most important one: Stephanie Beacham was superb as the  nun with the caustic tongue and the children were adorable, but the plots were  often stupid and contrived. Then you have the best of both worlds -- Candice  Bergen in "Murphy Brown."  </P> <P> Pat Silver, Van Nuys  </P></p>

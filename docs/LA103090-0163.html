			<p><P> October 30, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> MOTEL'S LAST TENANT HAS 5 DAYS TO MOVE  </P> <P> A Ventura County Superior Court Judge decided Monday to give the last tenant of  the Lemon Tree Motel in Oxnard five days to vacate the building so the city can  demolish the structure Nov. 9.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge Bruce Thompson approved an order forcing Theresa Melendi,  a cook, to leave her room at the Lemon Tree within five days or face forcible  eviction by sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> Peter M. Kuetzing an attorney for the city, said he asked Thompson for the  order because Melendi has said several times that she would not leave the  building.  </P> <P> Kuetzing said Melendi was notified in August that she had 90 days to leave the  building.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old motel has been the center of controversy since the city  acquired it in June through eminent domain proceedings.  </P> <P> The city contends that the motel is the center of drug deals and prostitution  and plans to demolish the aging building to make way for a parking lot.  However, Bertha Ochoa, the motel's former owner, claims she has been the target  of a conspiracy among city officials to throw her tenants into the streets.  </P> <P> Mecky Meyers, who was hired by the city to relocate the tenants, said Melendi  has refused the city's efforts to find her a new home. "She's closed all the  doors herself," Meyers said. "The city tried through me in every way to reach  the woman."  </P> <P> However, Melendi said the city has refused to help her find a new home, and she  insists that she was only told last week that she must leave the building.  </P> <P> Although Kuetzing said the city is set to demolish the building Nov. 9, Ochoa  said she is trying to raise funds to hire a lawyer to appeal the city's eminent  domain order to a federal judge.

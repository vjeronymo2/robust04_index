			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Murayama urges action to reduce unemployment Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's prime minister, yesterday called for steps to fight unemployment, which remained stuck at a seven-year high of 3 per cent in August for the second month running. He made his appeal at the first meeting of labour ministers since the government took office in June. The Economic Planning Agency said it would advance, by a month to early October, details of a scheme to expand the government's Y430,000bn (Pounds 3.27bn) public works scheme, covering the decade to 2000. The latest unemployment report suggests that the labour market will continue to be weak through the early stages of Japan's economic recovery, warned government officials. The number of jobs available for every 100 job seekers rose slightly from 62 in July to 63 last month, but was still low for a country that agonised over a labour shortage only five years ago. Most economic analysts expect the jobless rate to go on rising gently into the recovery, because the yen's strength continues to put pressure on exporters to cut costs to bring them closer into line with international competitors. That conclusion was supported yesterday by a labour ministry survey of manufacturers, in which more than 40 per cent of companies which were shifting production overseas expected to cut Japanese staff as a result. The risk of deflation still remains, according to another set of statistics released yesterday, showing that consumer prices in Tokyo rose by a mere 0.1 per cent in the year to September. The trend is for prices to stagnate, reckons the government's management and coordination agency.</p>

Children were  terrified to learn that two people were arrested the Sunday  before last [27 February] for hiding explosives in the  kindergarten's kitchen. Parents were also terrified to learn  that their innocent children could have been killed at any  moment.    Al-BILAD has learned that last Sunday [5 March; as  published], the security agencies apprehended 'Abd-al-Majid M.  and 'Imad S. [not further identified] less than an hour after  the two hid large quantities of machine guns, weapons, and  ammunition in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten. The kindergarten  is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society, which, as is well  known, is controlled by the Muslim Brotherhood group.    Eyewitnesses told AL-BILAD, which rushed to investigate the  story in al-Qasr, that 'Abd-al-Majid M. is considered the shaykh  of the returnees from Afghanistan. He was arrested before for  involvement in the Muhammad Army case, but was later released.    The second suspect, 'Imad S. was working as an imam at the  mosque adjacent to the kindergarten and lived in a house within  the mosque building. He was also working at an Education  Ministry school in al-Yarut town. He is married to a woman who  teaches at al-Faruq kindergarten, where the explosives were  hidden.    According to information made available to AL-BILAD,  'Abd-al-  Majid M. brought the explosives in a car from Amman. He then  asked 'Imad S. to hide them in his house. However, the latter  suggested that they be placed in the mosque. The explosives  were then moved to a communal kitchen used by the imam. The  kitchen is part of the adjacent kindergarten.    Apparently, the car that brought the explosives from Amman  was under close watch by security agencies. After the  explosives were hidden, the security agencies, which were  closely monitoring the operation, hurried to arrest  'Abd-al-Majid M. and then the imam, 'Imad S., only minutes  before the call to the evening prayer in al- Yarut village, near  al-Qasr.    From its investigation into the case, AL-BILAD was shocked  to  find out that the operation was part of a new terrorist scheme  the "Jordanian Afghans" [term used to refer to Jordanian Muslim  militants who fought in Afghanistan] were planning to execute  outside Amman.    Informed sources told AL-BILAD that the scheme involves  moving the bombing operations from Amman to the governorates and  districts since the security agencies have gained full control  over such operations inside Amman. The scheme involves  concealing the explosives at mosques and kindergartens that are  controlled by the Islamists.    According to well-informed sources, the primary objective of  the scheme is the assassination of a General Intelligence  officer and the bombing of shops selling alcoholic drinks in the  various governorates, particularly al-Karak, as part of a  large-scale scheme aimed at disturbing Jordan's domestic  security and terrorizing and intimidating citizens.    Within this context, AL-BILAD learned that the security  agencies have uncovered large quantities of ammunition, machine  guns, and bombs in many mosques in various parts of the kingdom,  including 'Ubadah Bin-Bishr mosque in al-Subayhi, where dynamite  sticks were found.    Information leaked to AL-BILAD confirm that an Arab state is  involved in supporting the Jordanian Afghans group in these  operations. It has been proven that contacts were held between  the [Jordanian] Afghans and other Afghan parties supported by  the same state.    The final number of the "Afghans" arrested thus far in the  bombing cases stands at around 40. According to informed  sources, the accused will be brought to trial in the next few  days.    AL-BILAD toured al-Qasr town as soon as the weapons cache  was  discovered in al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten and obtained  detailed information from the residents of the area and informed  sources on the kindergarten operation, which is considered, as  we have said, one of the major operations planned by the  Jordanian Afghans.    The first observation one can make at the kindergarten is  that the kindergarten, affiliated with the Islamic Center  Society, has more than 470 children. The weapons were hidden  less than one meter away from a kindergarten class full of  children. This means that these children could have been killed  at any time if there was any mistake in the transportation of  these explosives. Eyewitnesses also said that none of the  townspeople expected the imam of the mosque adjacent to the  kindergarten to be involved in such acts. This means that the  scheme was thoroughly planned.    AL-BILAD also learned that the mosque where the imam worked  was built at the expense of al-Faruq Islamic kindergarten, which  is affiliated with the Islamic Center Society controlled by the  Muslim Brotherhood.    Residents of the area have not observed any strong  connection  between the first and second suspects to suggest any suspicions  of an organizational link between them.    In a related development, AL-BILAD has learned that other  people suspected of affiliation with the Jordanian Afghans were  arrested in al-Rabbah area. No information or specific figures  are available yet on those arrested.    In previous issues AL-BILAD published exclusive reports on a  plan involving bombings in Amman. It also published reports on  the secret files of the Jordanian Afghans, as well as those  arrested in these cases.    It is worth noting that the Muslim Brotherhood group has not  yet reacted to reports on the hiding of weapons in a  kindergarten that they control. Residents of the area say they  think the suspects belong to the Muslim Brotherhood group.</p>

			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Tel Aviv trips over central bank signals TEL AVIV equities, on a spectacular rising curve for more than a year, tumbled by more than 4 per cent yesterday after signals from the Bank of Israel that it wants to cool the market, writes Hugh Carnegy in Jerusalem. It was the second downward lurch this week, following a 2 per cent slide on Tuesday after Mr Jacob Frenkel, the governor of the central bank, referred to the market as a 'financial bubble'. After recovering on Wednesday, the market went sharply back into reverse yesterday on further reports that the Bank of Israel was seeking to curb bank lending to mutual funds for stock purchases, a major source of liquid-ity during the recent bull market. The main index of the 100 most traded companies dropped 4.16 per cent to 206.08 in turnover of Shk250m (Dollars 90m). Last year, the market raced ahead by almost 100 per cent in shekel terms and by around 75 per cent in dollar terms. The 100 index ended 1992 at 195.98. Many analysts have been warning that the market, with an average prospective price-earnings ratio of around 23, is due for a correction.</p>

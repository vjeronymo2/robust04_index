			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Transport minister cool on traffic switch to trains MR John MacGregor, transport secretary, yesterday poured cold water on hopes that road traffic congestion could be eased by switching large amounts of passenger and freight traffic to rail. In a speech to the Confederation of British Industry, he said: 'We need to be realistic about the scale of the contribution which the railways can make to taking traffic off the roads.' He said he was 'a great believer' in switching traffic to rail'. But he added: 'The idea that we can get a massive switch from road to rail is, I think, unrealistic.' Less than a month ago Mr MacGregor extolled the virtues of the Department of Transport's road-building programme, saying roads were 'good news' for the environment. His latest remarks are likely to reinforce fears among the environmental and public transport lobbies that he is a 'pro-road' minister in the Thatcherite mould. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, Mr MacGregor's predecessor, had seemed intent on breaking that mould. He had said he was 'enthusiastically and unequivocally' in favour of seeing more passenger and freight traffic travelling by rail. Mr Rifkind's critics point out that he failed to translate that desire into reality. Mr MacGregor appears to be taking a more pragmatic approach. He said: 'I want to see each form of transport making its most effective contribution to the transport needs of the nation. 'The best way of achieving that objective is to maximise the amount of choice and competition in transport provision, and to extend the contribution made by the private sector to meeting the transport needs of the community.' The CBI claimed that investment in transport infrastructure had been neglected for a decade until the mid 1980s, resulting in the worst transport system in Europe. Calling for a national transport forum, in which the government could enlist more co-operation from both users and providers, the CBI urged ministers to extend the policy of formulating and identifying national road spending proposals to all areas of transport planning and expenditure. After the meeting Sir John Banham, CBI director-general, said that the planned privatisation of British Rail risked becoming a 'poll tax on wheels' unless the government first ensured that BR was viable, with adequate public investment. THE NUMBER of rail passengers in Britain fell 3 per cent last year while pro-rail policies pushed up passenger numbers 20 per cent in Spain and 7 per cent in the Netherlands, according to a survey published yesterday. The survey, in Railway Gazette International magazine, also shows that rail-borne freight traffic rose against the trend in Italy and Austria as a result of measures to switch trans-Alpine movements from road to rail. The survey put British Rail 10th out of 19 in a staff productivity league table assessed by the amount of traffic handled. The magazine put Swedish State Railways top of the league, followed by the national railways of Finland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Spain.</p>

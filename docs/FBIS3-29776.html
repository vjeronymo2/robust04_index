			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The government plans to work out, as early as  before the end of this month, a market-opening program centered  on deregulation, and has also decided on including in this  program a mechanism for assessing and checking results of  foreign firms' actual access to the Japanese market based on  numerical results recorded in various sectors. The government  intends to adopt an approach of reviewing plans 1) to improve  market access one by one while watching results of importing  foreign-made products with competitive power based on actual  results of procurement of foreign products in the government  procurement sector; 2) on actual results in sales of imported  cars as well as increase in the number of dealers engaged in  simultaneous sales of imported and domestically-made cars; and  3) on actual results in imports of foreign-made auto parts. In  adopting this approach, the government aims to respond to  overseas criticism that "the Japanese Government is indifferent  to results." The government also plans to clearly state in this  program that the basic plan for public investment totalling 430  trillion yen [Y] in 10 years worked out in 1990 will be reviewed  and the amount of investment will be increased. The total  amount of the additional investment to be decided before the end  of this year is estimated to reach over Y100 trillion.    Following the failure of the Japan-U.S. economic framework  talks, the government has decided to work out a market-opening  program centered on four major points: deregulation; promotion  of imports and investment; strengthening of policy in  competition; and improvement of government procurement.  Concerned agencies and ministries have already started studying  detailed plans. Among topics brought up for discussion are  strengthening of application of the Antimonopoly Act;  deregulation in land utilization and the housing sector; and  simplification of procedures for importing foodstuffs and  medical supplies. However, the actual situation is that there  is a shortage of effective measures.    The government has decided on introducing a mechanism for  checking access results and on studying the plan to increase the  public investment because of its judgment that it is necessary  to set forth plans that can easily win understanding among  foreign countries. It has been strongly criticized overseas  that "despite Japan's continuous appeal for opening up its  market, there have been no results whatsoever." It is observed  that such dissatisfaction could be eased if Japan indicated its  approach of connecting check of development in import expansion  by numerial results, on the one hand, with efforts to analyze  the causes and work out countermeasures, on the other.  Moreover, in increasing the total of public investment, the  government intends to indicate its eagerness to promote  macroeconomic policy, according to which additional investment  is regarded as indispensable to efforts to reduce the external  trade surplus.    As for actual checking of results in the government  procurement sector, the government plans to publish actual  procurement from foreign firms by procurement agencies;  moreover, it will announce to what extent procurement has been  made by applying the general bidding system, and to what extent  procurement has been made by signing free contracts. Regarding  the auto and auto parts sector, the government will publish  figures on actual imports, and at the same time announce the  number of cases in which foreign firms have joinied in the  design-in process when both manufacturers and users join in  consultations throughout the processes of designing and  development. In addition, the government intends to select  various items -- in which foreign countries have strong interest  -- and check actual results of their imports.    In revising the basic plan for public investment, the  government intends to expand investment in those areas that are  most closely connected with efforts to improve the living  environment. As far as the macroeconomic policy is concerned,  an idea has surfaced that income tax cuts should be carried out  not only in fiscal 1995 but also in years thereafter.    The government is stressing that the trade surplus can be  reduced in a steady way through efforts to open up the market  and expand imports by implementing both micro- and macroeconomic  policies. However, it still remains ambigious as to whether it  will be possible to win understanding from foreign countries by  working out only these measures.</p>

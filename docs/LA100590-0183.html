			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SWEDES SPURN ROYAL WORK ETHIC  </P> <P> Swedes were in an uproar today over their king's unprecedented comment that the  Swedish work ethic leaves something to be desired.  </P> <P> "I suppose that we maybe should think about the Swedish work ethic and try and  improve it in one way or the other.  </P> <P> I assume we're all aware that it is not the best," King Carl XVI Gustaf, 44,  told Dagens Industri in an interview Thursday.  </P> <P> The Swedish monarch rarely speaks out on political or controversial matters.  </P> <P> Reaction came swiftly. Some people agreed with the king but others suggested he  was speaking for himself and his acquaintances.  </P> <P> "I wonder if he ever tried to work himself," said librarian Anna Simkutte,  labeling the royal comment "utmost rubbish."  </P> <P> "I suppose that the king makes his statement from the circles where he dwells  himself," labor federation spokesman Staffan Kellerborg said.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Robert Shrimsley and Christopher Lockwood: "The </F> Plot Thickens in EC Presidential Race"]    [Text] Britain could comfortably accept the appointment of  M Jean-Luc Dehaene as EC president, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign  Secretary, said yesterday.    Adopting a tone which will disappoint Tory Euro-sceptics, Mr  Hurd defended the Belgian Prime Minister from attacks in the  British press, saying he had "presided well" during Belgium's EC  leadership last year.    M Dehaene has been depicted as an arch-federalist. Mr Hurd  said that while he was not Britain's preferred choice, he could  be acceptable.    Giving evidence to the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Mr  Hurd said the Government was backing the candidacy of Sir Leon  Brittan, former Home Secretary who is now the EC's external  trade commissioner.    Until recently, Sir Leon was thought to be out of the  running  as other countries resisted the idea of a free-market British  candidate. However, in recent days, he has received the backing  of Italy's new Right-wing government and perhaps of Greece as  well.    The decision may be made in Corfu on June 24. That evening,  the EC's heads of government will dine there to discuss the  candidates.    But diplomats believe there is also a growing risk that it  will fail, occasioning the need for a second dinner in  September, probably in Germany.    A few weeks ago, M Dehaene was starting to look like a  certainty. He had the firm support of Paris, which liked him  because he is a French speaker, committed to further European  integration and, on past record, inclined to suspicion of  unfettered free trade.    France managed to persuade the Germans to look favourably on  him. One advantage M Dehaene had was that he was not Mr Ruud  Lubbers, the Dutch Prime Minister. Mr Lubbers had upset  Chancellor Helmut Kohl by granting Britain opt-outs on currency  union and the Social Chapter at Maastricht, by being hesitant  over German reunification and by championing Amsterdam as home  for the future European Central Bank.    Mr Lubbers's party lost elections last month and though he  is  likely to stay on as a caretaker, he is now available for the EC  job.    Earlier this month, President Francois Mitterrand and Herr  Kohl came near to annointing M Dehaene. That was a disaster.  To choose him now is to admit that the 12 are run by France and  Germany.    Suddenly, M Dehaene, who British sources were recently  describing as "unstoppable," is looking distinctly stoppable.  The Italians, Spanish, Greeks and British all incline towards  other candidates.    If one or two of these can only pluck up the courage to say  so to the Franco-German axis M Dehaene's candidacy would be dead.</p>

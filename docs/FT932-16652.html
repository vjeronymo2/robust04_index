			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Mersey dock plan dispute resolved MERSEYSIDE Development Corporation and English Heritage have resolved differences over Kings Dock, the last 40 acres of Liverpool's prime waterfront to be developed. The site, next to the successful Albert Dock redevelopment, overlooks the river Mersey and the Wirral. Filling it would complete the reconstruction of Liverpool's south docklands, which was started 12 years ago by the corporation after the area became derelict. The corporation and English Heritage have agreed that a plan by Richard Rogers Partnership, the architects, should provide guidelines for a mixed commercial and leisure development. Part of the scheme is an indoor arena to be used for the 2000 Olympic boxing tournament if Manchester succeeds in its bid to stage the games. Because of the proximity to Albert Dock and its warehouses - Britain's largest single collection of listed buildings - English Heritage had objected to the redevelopment.</p>

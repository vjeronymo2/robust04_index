			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / Ten killed at church in South Africa BLACK assailants armed with an automatic rifle and hand grenades burst into a white suburban church service in Cape Town last night, killing 10 worshippers including four visiting Russian seamen, Agencies report. The attack on the church in suburban Kenilworth was the deadliest so far this year in a series that have targeted white civilians. Witnesses said a hooded gunman burst through a side door of the church during the evening service and opened fire with an automatic rifle. Another man lobbed two grenades into the church, pitching one among about 130 Russian seamen brought to the church by a mission group. 'It was an absolute horror,' Mr Trevor Adams, one of the worshippers, said. 'People were screaming and crying.' The multi-denominational church was filled with more than 1,000 people, including Russian sailors who regularly attend services when in port. In addition to those killed, nearly 50 were injured, including some Russians. President F W de Klerk expressed outrage at the attack, saying it pointed to the need for a political resolution of South Africa's tensions. Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the massacre was the 'most foul, despicable thing imaginable'. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. The government has accused the radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and its armed wing, the Azanian People's Liberation Army, of previous attacks on whites. The PAC draws support from radical black township youth and has refused to follow the lead of Mr Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and suspend its armed struggle. Politically motivated attacks against white civilians were extremely rare until late last year. But there have been at least a half-dozen since last November, leaving more than 20 whites dead. The PAC president, Mr Clarence Mawketu, said last month the guerrillas would continue to target white civilians and the security forces.</p>

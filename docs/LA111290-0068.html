			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VETERANS HONORED AMID NEW WAR FEARS  </P> <P> Americans paid tribute to the dead of wars past in solemn Veterans Day  ceremonies Sunday at the Tomb of the Unknowns and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial  -- amid fears that the nation may be swept into a new war in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> At the Vietnam memorial, Bob Horsch of Rahway, N.J., a veteran of Army service  in Vietnam, said he believed it was "just a matter of time" until the United  States was at war again.  </P> <P> Horsch said he believed the military buildup in the Persian Gulf was justified  by the need to protect American interests and those of other countries.  </P> <P> Stephen Reuben of Lapwai, Ida., a member of the Nez Perce tribe who also served  in Vietnam, declined to say whether the buildup was a good idea, but also said  he fears the country was headed for war.  </P> <P> "I am afraid so, but I pray and hope we don't," Reuben said.  </P> <P> Speakers at the ceremonies, including Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, paid  tribute to the American troops now serving in the gulf region.  </P> <P> At Arlington National Cemetery, Cheney laid a wreath at the Tomb of the  Unknowns and addressed a capacity crowd in the adjoining Vermont marble  amphitheater, which seats 5,500.  </P> <P> "Those who have been deployed to the Persian Gulf and Saudi Arabia are probably  the best-trained soldiers we have ever had," he said. "The nation and the world  will be better for their service.  </P> <P> "People who are concerned about peace must stay prepared for war," Cheney said.  </P> <P> The ceremonies, held on traditional Veterans Day in advance of today's official  national holiday, took place under bright, sunny skies, with a crisp wind  whipping through the flag-draped amphitheater at Arlington.  </P> <P> At the Vietnam memorial, an armed services color guard and a bagpiper playing  "Abide With Me" accompanied military and patriotic groups who placed wreaths in  front of the 58,000 names inscribed on the ebony-colored, granite wall.  </P> <P> Meanwhile the Vietnam Women's Memorial Project announced the selection of two  finalists in its competition for a design of the memorial, to be built  alongside the Vietnam Veterans' Memorial. The target date for its dedication is  1992.  </P></p>

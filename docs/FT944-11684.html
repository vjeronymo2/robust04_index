			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / International Company News: Feeding frenzy among Italian banks - The recent spate of bids and mergers in the sector Mr Lamberto Dini, Italy's treasury minister, came straight to the point yesterday, when asked to comment on the spate of bids and mergers announced by Italian banks in the last week. 'It's desirable that the excessive fragmentation of the Italian banking system should be reduced,' he said. If anything, this is an understatement. Forbidden to trespass on other banks' territory until recently, Italy managed to arrive in the 1990s with more than 1,000 different banks, at least one for each fair-sized town. In terms of size, if the Japanese are the whales of the world's banking sector - accounting for 11 out of the biggest 20 in the world rankings prepared by The Banker magazine - then the Italians are the plankton, with the important qualification that Italy's banks have so far proved unattractive to their larger foreign counterparts. Within the Italian banking system, however, a small feeding frenzy has begun. The manoeuvres of the last week were not unexpected, and nor was the fact that the main bids came from the two recently privatised banks, Credito Italiano (Credit) and Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), both based in Milan. Both banks had raised cash for acquisitions through rights issues earlier in the year. Credit is seeking a majority stake in the Bologna-based Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), for which it is prepared to pay L19,000 a share, or more than L2,000bn (Dollars 1.3bn). Two days ago - exactly a week after news of the Credit offer leaked out - BCI decided to make a similar approach to shareholders in Banco Ambrosiano Veneto (Ambroveneto), with an offer of L7,000 a share, for an initial stake of between 15 and 29 per cent. This would then be followed up by a full bid on the same terms, in the hope of acquiring just over 50 per cent of Ambroveneto at a cost of nearly L1,750bn. Ambroveneto has so far refrained from comment about the BCI bid, but Credit's offer for Rolo - less generous, according to analysts - has begun what could turn into a hard-fought bid battle. Credit claims its offer is not hostile, but Rolo has reacted defensively, employing heavyweight advisers Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs International, and announcing plans to revive an abortive merger with the Caer group, which owns 76.4 per cent of Rolo's nearest rival, the Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna. Rolo has been painted as the champion of the prosperous Emilia Romagna region, with its strong local identity, but its future will depend on the willingness of its largest shareholders, which include BNP of France and Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computer group, to hold on to their stakes. Whatever the outcome of these offers, analysts say they could mark the beginning of further rationalisation in the sector. Until recently, Italian banks had been slow to benefit from the reform of the sector. Some banks have taken advantage of the 1990 Amato law, which allows foundations - the traditional shareholders in some of Italy's biggest banks  -to float up to 49 per cent of the banks' shares on the stock market. Others have formed loose regional alliances, but there have been few large mergers or takeovers. 'The consolidation process has been in the works for a long time,' said one analyst yesterday. 'I think we will begin to see other banks starting to take talk about strengthening their links.' Any future mergers will have to be consummated before the end of this year if they want to benefit from tax breaks under the Amato law, but observers say that deadline could be extended, as it has been in the past, to encourage reluctant partners to marry. Separately, the recent bids have reignited speculation about who stands to benefit from the trend for consolidation. In the short term, there are suspicions that certain investors may have known too much about the impending Rolo bid: the group's shares rose sharply ahead of the Credit offer. In the longer term, sceptical observers identify the hand of Mediobanca  - the Milan-based merchant bank - behind both the BCI and Credit moves. Mediobanca gained an indirect influence over the two banks after privatisation, through big corporate shareholders, and any extension of the two banks' branch networks would provide more outlets for the sale of Mediobanca's bonds and financial products. There is also a suggestion, denied by the banks themselves, that Credit and BCI have agreed to carve up the north of the country, while Banca di Roma - the other large state-controlled bank - consolidates its position in the south. There is still a long way to go, however, before Italy achieves the level of concentration of, for example, France or the UK. Analysts believe that the country can probably support between 100 and 200 banks, and unless Credit and BCI decide to merge with one another, the country will still lag behind in world rankings. Mr Dini himself said yesterday that it was up to the markets to decide the outcome of the mergers and bids tabled in the last 10 days. 'We can only observe,' he added.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW THE ITALIAN BANKING SECTOR COULD CHANGE (Italy's biggest banks)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Assets    Gross operating  Branches                                   (Lbn)     profit divided                                              by assets (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- San Paolo di Torino             188,918           1.27         959 Banca di Roma                   152,655           1.36       1,225 Cariplo                         123,622           1.54         651 Banca Commerciale Italiana*     115,813           1.52         689 Banco Ambrosiano Veneto*         42,005           2.01         500 Credito Italiano**              113,490           1.39         641 Credito Romagnolo***             31,155           2.25         356 Banco di Napoli                 109,227           0.91         800 Banca Nazionale del Lavoro      108,506           1.05         582  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Combined assets, L157,818bn; combined branches, 1,189 ** Combined assets, L144,645bn; combined branches, 997 *** Credito Romagnolo plans to merge with Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Italian Banks' 1993 Results  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

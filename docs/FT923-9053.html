			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Capital Markets: Nippon Credit wins Daiwa backing to reshape affiliate NIPPON Credit Bank, one of Japan's three long-term credit banks, has won support from Daiwa Bank for its plan to restructure one of its leasing affiliates, heavily burdened with doubtful property loans. Daiwa, a leading commercial bank, has agreed to reduce the interest rate on loans extended to Crown Leasing, one of Nippon Credit's three financial subsidiaries. Nippon Credit has been seeking financial assistance from the creditors of its three affiliates and Daiwa's move could draw positive responses from other banks, which have so far rejected the plans. The move will be the first case where a non-parent bank has agreed to support a non-bank financial company. 'We still feel that Nippon Credit Bank should take full responsibility, but we also felt that by rejecting restructuring the problem would only get worse,' said Daiwa. Daiwa has Y70bn (Dollars 549.8m) in loans outstanding to Crown Leasing, and said it would reduce the interest rate to 2 per cent from 7 per cent. Daiwa said its interest income on the loans would therefore fall by Y3.5bn. Nippon Credit is the smallest of Japan's long-term credit banks, which have been responsible for much of the long-term lending for industrial investment since the Second World War. It has been dubbed 'Nippon Fudosan (property) Bank' by local bankers, due to its large outstanding loans to property companies compared with other leading commercial banks. While Nippon Credit claims that outstanding bad loans at its three financial subsidiaries total Y350bn, the figure circulating in Tokyo is as high as Y1,000bn. Jitters over mounting bad loans at Nippon Credit and its affiliates have caused volatility in Nippon Credit's shares. On the Tokyo stock market yesterday, its shares fell by Y1,000 to Y4,800. The yields on Nippon Credit's five-year debenture has risen compared with debentures issued by the other two long-term credit banks: Industrial Bank of Japan and Long Term Credit Bank. While until now, their five-year bonds were seen as identical investments, bond traders say investors have started to differentiate the credit value of the three banks.</p>

			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Leading Article: Europe must keep moving WHEN EUROPEAN leaders meet at their emergency summit in Birmingham next month, their task will be nothing less than to craft a crisis strategy for the future of the European Community. Their formal agenda will be more specific: the currency explosion which forced Britain and Italy out of the Community's exchange rate mechanism, and the growing uncertainties over the future of the Maastricht treaty. But the job of the summit will not be to draft technical responses to technical problems, but to ensure that the shock of the present crisis does not drive the process of European integration right off the road. The Birmingham summit will present a choice between two broadly distinct strategies. The first is that all 12 member states should proceed together along the path they have already mapped out together, which means ratifying and implementing the Maastricht treaty. The alternative would be a strategy of variable geometry, in which some of the member states would move ahead down the road of economic and political integration more quickly than others. For political and psychological reasons, the traditionally orthodox strategy is to be preferred, if it can be sustained. Not merely are all 12 member states manifestly part of a European family of nations, but the Community's institutional model has always been based on the premise that all member states should normally take part in all joint policies on a basis of legal equality. One consequence of this universalist system is that it gradually reinforces the sense of shared interests; over the years, the 12 have increasingly recognised that their common interests go beyond the narrow specifics of their existing treaties; that is why they negotiated a treaty as wide-ranging and far-reaching in its scope and ambitions as Maastricht. More soluble Ideally, then, the 12 would press ahead with the Maastricht treaty as quickly as possible, and the British government would bring it back to the House of Commons for ratification as soon as possible. This would still leave the Danish problem unresolved, but it might become more soluble, one way or another, after all the other 11 states had ratified the treaty; at the very least the choice facing the Danish government and people would be more clear cut. The trouble with this orthodox strategy is that it is not at all clear that it can be put into practice, and very doubtful indeed that it could be put into practice as rapidly as circumstances demand. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, has reaffirmed his commitment to the treaty. But he has made clear that he will not bring it back to Parliament until he knows how the Danes propose to deal with the problem of their No vote. Even then British ratification may remain uncertain: it may not be possible to get it through the House without causing a deep split in the Conservative party, and Mr Major may not soon feel strong enough to face that kind of struggle. Second, it is not at all clear how the Danish No vote can be reversed in a quick and painless way. If the rest of the Community were to offer substantive changes of policy to Denmark, the treaty would have to be revised, and ratification would have to start from the beginning again. If there are no changes to the treaty, Danish voters have no reason to change their minds. Deeply damaging In any case, the combined effect of the British and Danish factors will, at best, be to delay the ratification of the Treaty for another year or so. Such a delay now would be deeply damaging to the Community process. The Danish and French referendums have revealed serious popular misgivings about the Maastricht treaty, and the currency crisis has cast doubt on the durability of the existing European Monetary System, to say nothing of the future credibility of the Maastricht programme for economic and monetary union. Europe's leaders must urgently come up with responses to restore credibility to the Community process. One option would be for an inner group of member states to move ahead together more rapidly than the rest, for example towards economic and monetary union in anticipation of the ratification of Maastricht. The treaty expressly allows for such variable geometry, in which not all member states would move to the single currency at the same time; and the present currency crisis has obviously postponed any timetable by which Britain and Italy could move to Phase 3. In practice, any variable geometry initiative can only come jointly from France and Germany. It was their leadership which was primarily responsible for pushing the Maastricht negotiations to a conclusion, and it is their political relationship which will determine the future dynamic of the European Community. If they believe they can make a success of an accelerated move towards monetary union, in association with the Benelux countries, they should press ahead. What Europe can least afford right now is a prolonged period of drift and uncertainty.</p>

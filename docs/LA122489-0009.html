			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEAR AND REALITY  </P> <P> What a pleasant surprise to find "Fear and Reality in the Los Angeles Melting  Pot" (by Joel Kotkin, Nov. 5). Congratulations -- you have managed to capture  the flavor and complexity of the demographic changes in the L.A. area. The  overall positive portrayal is a refreshing change from other doom-and-gloom  reports. The photos were beautiful.  </P> <P> ANTONIA HERNANDEZ, PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL, MEXICAN AMERICAN LEGAL  DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND, Los Angeles  </P></p>

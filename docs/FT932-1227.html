			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Two banks finalise share-swap agreement CREDIT NATIONAL of France and Germany's IKB Deutsche Industriebank have finalised a cross-shareholding arrangement whereby each will take just over 5 per cent of the other's equity. The two banks, both of which specialise in corporate banking, have for some time operated on a partnership basis, but recently decided to formalise joint activities through an exchange of shares. The alliance is the latest in a series of similar deals between French and German financial groups. Banque Nationale de Paris and Germany's Dresdner Bank are finalising a 10 per cent cross-shareholding arrangement. Credit National hopes to follow the IKB deal with similar partnerships elsewhere in Europe. It said it was seeking partners with expertise in specialist finance, capital markets and property finance. The agreement makes IKB the second-largest shareholder in Credit National after Assurances Generales de France, the French insurance group, which owns a 5.7 per cent stake.</p>

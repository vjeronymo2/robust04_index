			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Financial Planning): Allowable deductions - Briefcase Before selling our second home, my husband transferred the property into our joint names as tenants-in-common. On our separate returns, we intend submitting identical capital gains tax calculations. Also, as the property was bought more than 15 years ago, we propose using the 1982 valuation (plus indexation up to the date of sale) as the cost, divided equally between us. Is this procedure correct? Are the solicitors' costs and the land registration charge incurred in the transfer, as well as those involved in the ultimate disposal, allowable as deductable expenses? And would an improvement to the property, such as the cost of installing patio doors, be considered an allowable expense? The procedure you have in mind is not strictly correct, although it is likely to produce answers which are fairly near the ones which the law prescribes. Your solicitors will guide you through the CGT labyrinth. Yes, the costs of conveyance and registration are deductible and so are those of ascertaining the March 31 1982 value and of improvements to the property (except, say, for any improvements which were destroyed by later alterations). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

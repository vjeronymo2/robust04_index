			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Chile leads flow of capital into Argentina  -Cross-border trade, almost doubled since 1990, is set to top Dollars 1bn this year FOREIGN capital is flowing once again into Argentina on the back of the government's economic reform programme. Surprisingly, much is coming from neighbouring Chile, small by comparison and until recently hostile. Chileans have invested more than Dollars 800m (Pounds 418m) in Argentina over the past two-and-a-half years, remarkable considering that Chile's gross domestic product of Dollars 31bn is less than a third of Argentina's. Despite the absence of formal integration pacts, cross-border trade has almost doubled since 1990, and is expected to top Dollars 1bn this year. President Carlos Menem's privatisation programme has provided most of the investments, but there has also been a tide of Chilean investment in retailing and manufacturing, as confidence in Argentina's economic stability grows. Also, binational infrastructure projects involving billions of dollars are being planned for the mid-1990s. Chilean utilities, privatised in the 1980s, have been scooping large chunks of Argentina's electricity sector now up for sale. A consortium led by Chilectra will this month take over managing Edesur, a power distribution company serving the industrial suburbs of Buenos Aires. Chilectra and its partners bid Dollars 511m for 51 per cent of Edesur, and plan to invest a further Dollars 100m to cut energy theft and improve services. This is the largest single Chilean investment in Argentina so far. Another group led by Endesa, Chile's biggest utility, has bought for Dollars 90m a power generating complex serving Buenos Aires. A rival Chilean consortium paid Dollars 92m cash for a majority stake in Central Puerto, a power plant also supplying the Argentine capital. Chilean companies believe they can turn these loss-making state utilities into profit. Less spectacular sums are being channelled into shopping malls and supermarkets, and the food, furniture and copper manufacturing industries. Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chile's former debt negotiator and adviser to Finance Minister Domingo Cavallo on Argentine debt, says Chileans are seeing niches for enlarging their businesses and reaping benefits of economies of scale. 'After eight years' economic growth, the home market has become too small for Chile's leading industrial groups,' he explains. 'Argentina is virgin territory. Its population is over twice that of Chile's, and per capita incomes are much higher.' Mr Hernan Somerville, Chile's chief debt negotiator in the 1980s, believes Chile's export of capital is a permanent trend. 'The first phase of Chile's export development  - fruit, fish, copper  - is now over. Many cash-rich Chilean corporations have reached the limits of their expansion in Chile. Becoming multinationals is the next step.' The gradual opening of Chile's capital account is helping this trend. Chilean companies wanting to invest abroad faced many curbs in the past because of the Central Bank's fear of capital flight, no longer seen as a problem. Argentine assets are perceived as cheap compared with their Chilean equivalents. Mr Somerville says Argentine assets are not seen as expensive in Chile because investors expect higher profits once Argentina's economic reforms begin to bear fruit. 'Chileans are willing to pay more for Argentine assets because they don't perceive the same risk factors as European or Japanese investors.' Some territorial disputes linger, but the civilian governments on both sides of the Andes, which almost went to war in 1978 over three islands in the Beagle Channel, are keen to bury their sabre-rattling days. Chileans have long been dismissive of the Argentine work ethic. Now businessmen on the Santiago-Buenos Aires shuttle detect a change. 'Argentines have become more cost-conscious and more realistic,' one Chilean investor says. Perhaps the Chilean asset in widest demand is expertise. 'Chile was a laboratory for free-market reforms, so we are well placed to advise our neighbours on the good, the bad and the ugly,' says Mr Aninat. His economic consultancy is setting up a ratings agency in Buenos Aires, as a new law that comes into effect in October will require all corporate bond issues and debt paper to be valued by two private rating companies. This has been the case in Chile for over 10 years. Chilean pension fund managers are also making a bee-line for Buenos Aires, where private retirement schemes will be introduced at the end of the year. Chile privatised its social security system 11 years ago. 'Nobody else in Latin America has our knowledge in this field,' says Mr Julio Bustamante, Chile's superintendent of pension companies. Another sign of fading rivalries is evident in the area of oil exploration. Chile's state oil concern, Enap, has been authorised to drill for oil on the Argentine side of the Magellan Straits. By the end of September, a final decision is expected on construction of a Dollars 200m oil pipeline, linking the province of Neuquen, Argentina, with Chilean refineries near Concepcion. The flow of crude will boost bilateral trade by Dollars 400m a year. Also, two rival Chilean groups are bidding to build a gas pipeline between Neuquen and Santiago, expected to cost over Dollars 1bn and be ready by 1995. Finally, both countries want to bore a 16-mile corridor under the Andes to relieve congestion on the mountain pass linking Santiago and Mendoza. Presidents Carlos Menem and Patricio Aylwin are expected to launch the project this month.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel Filiberto Rondon by journalist </F> Estela Guerra; place and date not given -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Guerra] Everyone knows about the work the  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] is doing to guarantee people  better living conditions, bearing in mind that this is the  fundamental factor that guarantees the success of the different  missions entrusted to the various armies. In order to get more  details about the work being done in the FAR in that connection,  I am talking to Colonel Filiberto Rondon, second in command of  the Western Army Rear Services.    Colonel, I have had the opportunity to tour this great  Western Army unit. I have noticed that many of the things done  here are things that lie within the realm of many centers, of  many state organizations. Why...[pauses] what is the basic  reason that these solutions are sought here, and that effective  solutions to the needs of the population -- the soldiers and the  population in general -- are found here?    [Rondon] We have instructions from our minister, who is the  head of the Army, to seek solutions; and we have been told that  we must guarantee, with fewer resources, the sacred duty of  defending the fatherland. Therefore, we are obliged to seek  solutions. We draw our inspiration from the thoughts of Jose  Marti, who said that if there are capable men, there are no  difficult times; and that difficult conditions and situations  must be given practical solutions.    That is why, given this situation, without abandoning its  main tasks -- such as being combat-ready and willing to repel  aggressions, preparing the theater of military operations, and  preparing our troops ideologically -- our Armed Forces  also...[pauses] the self-sufficiency plans too are a main part  of our tasks. As I said earlier, in order to improve the living  conditions of our troops independently of the resource  limitations, we have been obliged to seek solutions that will  allow our troops to be in both mental and physical shape to  carry out their missions. And we feel that -- and you have seen  it in this tour -- the results are there. They are not just  words. We have already obtained results. We can speak of results  obtained in 1993, 1992, and 1991. We have been trying to keep  our Armed Forces from being a burden on our working population,  and trying to lighten that burden progressively.    Unlike other organizations, we ourselves cannot shut down a  unit. We cannot send soldiers home. We are obliged to seek  solutions. And I think that that has really forced us. Moreover,  above all, we have drawn inspiration from our Armed Forces  minister, who demands that we maintain, despite resource  limitations, a high level of combat readiness and a high degree  of capability to respond to any enemy aggression.    [Guerra] That was Colonel Filiberto Rondon, second in  command  of the Western Army Rear Services, who has discussed the work  the FAR is doing to improve the living and working conditions of  the workers and the Armed Forces' civilian workers.</p>

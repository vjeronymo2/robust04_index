			<p><P> July 25, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> MANDELA STATES ANC'S PROVISOS  </P> <P> Nelson Mandela said today the African National Congress will halt its armed  struggle as soon as the government meets its demands for political reforms, and  possibly sooner.  </P> <P> Mandela indicated the ANC might accept a government commitment to change,  rather than insisting on the reforms being implemented before armed action  ceases.  </P> <P> "The government must remove all the obstacles. Then we will suspend the armed  struggle," Mandela said, adding that the timing of the cease-fire is  negotiable.  </P> <P> But Mandela also said, "As long as apartheid is the case, the armed struggle  will go on."  </P> <P> The ANC National Executive Committee decided at a two-day meeting that it will  definitely suspend all armed activities once the obstacles have been removed,  he said. He added that ANC guerrillas have not killed anyone since talks with  the government began in May.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Address by His Excellency Chan Youran on the discussion of </F> the two items on the agenda at the meeting of the roundtable  commission;" in Phnom Penh on 15 June -- read by announcer]    [Text] Phnom Penh 15 June 1994    The samdech royal representative:    I. On behalf of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] I  would like to express the following view concerning the  discussion of the meeting's agenda:    1. The cease-fire;    2. The minimal policy program;    II. Concerning the cease-fire on the meeting's agenda, the  PDK delegation has already expressed its view in its earlier  address, i.e. the PDK is happy to have a cease-fire now, and  have been in the past and in the future. This is because the  PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, is the victim. The  PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, does not want war and  fighting. We only want to end the war quickly and achieve  national reconciliation and peace. We have said that it is  necessary to have a genuine and permanent cease-fire nationwide  with proper and adequate control. This is the issue all of us  should discuss to seriously put together a cease-fire. Why has  the other side refused to discuss this issue in depth?    The PDK holds that it is imperative to avoid using the  cease-fire as a trick to cheat one another and the local and  foreign public in order to continue fighting. In such a case,  this would not be a genuine cease-fire and fighting will  continue. Can the cease-fire be genuinely and permanently  observed throughout the country if there is only empty talk  about it and national reconciliation, and without any basis upon  which all sides have agreed upon first? The entire Cambodian  nation and people are waiting to see a genuine and permanent  cease-fire. This is vital to them.    III. The first item on the agenda was raised for discussion  at the meeting. Each side expressed its views and the meeting  took note of all of them. Therefore, we should discuss the  second item about the minimal policy program to set up a  political basis for genuine national reconciliation and peace.    Those on the side of the two-headed government wanted to end  the meeting half way and refused to discuss the second item on  the minimal policy program for national reconciliation. It  refused to discuss the national reconciliation in depth.  National reconciliation is the key issue. The sacred goal of  our roundtable meeting is to achieve this in accordance with the  sacred aspiration of the entire Cambodian nation and people.    We would like to ask: Do you agree to have national  reconciliation so that Cambodia will have genuine peace? If you  do agree on national reconciliation and peace for Cambodia,  there should be a discussion. The PDK holds that to reconcile  the nation, all Cambodian sides should have a common political  basis and decide to work together. There should be talks about  what various sides should give one another in order to have a  political basis that everyone can agree on. Even in business  and investment, there are agreements and contracts that have to  be jointly signed. To marry their offsprings, there are  discussions among parents on what each side will give to the  other, on the dates of the various ceremonies, and on the number  of guests, and so on.    In short, the two items on the agenda -- the cease-fire and  the minimal policy program for national reconciliation and peace  -- are to be discussed one after another at this meeting and  subsequent meetings of our roundtable commission because this is  a topical issue that should be solved in accordance with the  aspiration and call by the entire Cambodian nation and people.</p>

			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 1994 CARS MUST HAVE DEVICES TO DETECT POLLUTION  </P> <P> The state Air Resources Board on Thursday ordered that new cars sold in  California beginning in 1994 feature a first-of-its-kind computerized warning  system designed to detect pollution-producing malfunctions ranging from  misfiring spark plugs to air coolant leaks.  </P> <P> The expanded dashboard diagnostic system, which ARB staff members estimate  could cost manufacturers $45 per vehicle, would have two major functions -- to  improve air quality and to help mechanics repair the increasingly high-tech  auto equipment designed to monitor and limit noxious emissions.  </P> <P> The new technology was approved by a 7-0 vote following a daylong public  hearing attended by more than 75 auto industry representatives and  environmental advocates. ARB engineering studies chief Steve Albu said it would  have a "greater (impact on emissions) than any other single control measure  adopted by the board."  </P> <P> Among those supporting the new regulation were the South Coast Air Quality  Management District, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the American  Lung Assn. and the Automobile Club of Southern California.  </P> <P> Mike A. Nazemi, planning manager for the AQMD, said the measure could result in  a 50-ton-per-day reduction in air pollutants in the greater Los Angeles area --  10% of the region's current daily vehicular emission output.  </P> <P> "This is probably the biggest control measure I have seen in the last few  years," said Nazemi, who had urged the board to implement the regulation in  1993.  </P> <P> Engineers for major auto makers praised the principle of expanded on-board  diagnostics but raised technical questions about the changes and requested more  time to put them in place. If dashboard warning lights lit up needlessly  because of kinks in a hastily approved technology, they argued, drivers would  quickly lose faith in the system.  </P> <P> "Due to the need to develop new, unproven technology, considerable lead-time is  needed," said Suanne K. Thomas, a staff scientist for the Motor Vehicle  Manufacturers Assn. of the United States. "(We) recommend that implementation  be delayed until the 1996 model year and phase-in be extended to the 1998 model  year."  </P> <P> The manufacturers' group is a Detroit-based industry organization that includes  Chrysler, Ford and General Motors among its members.  </P> <P> The state board, however, decided to begin implementing the changes in 1994,  with full compliance ordered by 1996.  </P> <P> "I'm sure more time could give us all a higher comfort level, but in the state  of California, we have to be aggressive," said Jananne Sharpless, board  chairman.  </P> <P> Board member John Lagarias quipped that the new dashboard system would provide  for "smart (warning) lights" as opposed to the current system of "idiot  lights." On-board monitor lights that the ARB ordered on new cars beginning in  1988 warn drivers that they need repairs only when basic emission-related parts  such as the fuel system malfunction.  </P> <P> But the new system will be much more extensive, requiring improved monitoring  of the fuel system but also requiring the monitoring of engine misfiring,  catalytic converter efficiency and chlorofluorocarbon leaks in air-conditioning  systems.  </P> <P> The regulation calls for on-board computers to store data that would help  repairmen identify the equipment that is malfunctioning. It also calls for  standardized computer technology to allow a universal scanning tool so that any  repair shop can have access to the data in the vehicle computer.  </P> <P> The advanced system, state officials said, would result in quicker repairs of  defective parts, thus leading to lower emissions of smog-producing  hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. The reductions of  hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would amount to more than 100 tons a day  apiece statewide, according to an ARB staff report. Almost half of the  reduction would be in the South Coast Air Basin, which includes Los Angeles,  Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.  </P> <P> The smog reductions, officials said, would eliminate almost twice as much  pollution as the tough standards adopted by the ARB in June to curtail tailpipe  emissions. At that time, rules were passed to reduce carbon monoxide emissions  from new cars by 50% and emissions of hydrocarbons by 30% by 1997.  </P> <P> ARB board members said that if portions of the new technology prove unworkable,  they can be dealt with in two years when the board's staff returns with a  progress report.  </P></p>

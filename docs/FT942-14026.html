			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Patten pressed over human rights Governor Chris Patten, under increasing pressure to set up a human rights commission in Hong Kong, maintained in the Legislative Council yesterday that similar bodies elsewhere in the world were 'pretty toothless creatures' but promised a decision by the end of June. Mr Patten came under intense questioning about allegations of telephone tapping. Last week a senior official who was dismissed from the Independent Commission Against Corruption, Hong Kong's anti-corruption authority, alleged that the commission had bugged telephones for political purposes. Mr Patten denied these allegations. Earlier in the day Amnesty International urged the government to set up a body to receive complaints. Mr Chris Avery, an Amnesty consultant, said: 'The report shows that people in Hong Kong who feel their rights have been violated have nowhere to go. There is no simple affordable complaints system in Hong Kong.' The report follows a House of Commons select committee report on Sino-British relations which advocated the formation of a human rights commission. Last month Ms Anna Wu introduced a bill based on Australian legislation.</p>

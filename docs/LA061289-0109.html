			<p><P> June 12, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JUSTICES WILL REVIEW $1.3-MILLION VERDICT ON PRICING BY TEXACO  </P> <P> The Supreme Court agreed today to review a $1.3-million verdict against Texaco  for price discrimination in a case that could force big changes in product  distribution practices of businesses everywhere.  </P> <P> The justices will hear arguments next term in Texaco's appeal of a U.S. 9th  Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the jury verdict against the oil  giant.  </P> <P> At issue is whether manufacturers such as Texaco can sell their product to  wholesalers at a lower price than to retailers if such pricing results in less  retail competition.  </P> <P> A federal jury in Washington state found Texaco guilty of price discrimination  for selling gasoline to 11 Spokane retailers at higher prices than to two  independent wholesalers, who in turn sold the gas to other retailers who  competed with the Texaco stations.  </P> <P> A federal law known as the Robinson-Patman Act generally prohibits the sale of  like goods to different purchasers at a different price but allows  manufacturers to offer discounts to wholesalers to compensate them for the  distributional services they perform.  </P> <P> In this case, the jury concluded that the wholesale discount was illegal  because it did not merely reflect the wholesaler's distribution costs but was  passed on to other retailers whose customers were the same as the Texaco  retailers'.  </P> <P> The case began when Ricky Hasbrouck, owner of Rick's Texaco, filed suit along  with 10 other station owners accusing Texaco of price discrimination. The suit  alleged that from 1972 until 1981 Texaco sold gas at lower prices to John  Dompier Oil Co. and Gull Oil Co., both of which supplied and operated a chain  of retail stations in Spokane.  </P> <P> During a three-week trial, the Texaco station owners presented testimony that  they had lost sales and profits as a result of the competition from Dompier and  Gull. A jury agreed and awarded them $449,900, which was automatically tripled  by law.  </P> <P> The verdict was affirmed by the appeals court in March.  </P> <P> Appealing to the nation's highest court, Texaco argued that the verdict "puts  in question the normal pricing practices of countless businesses across the  country and jeopardizes the continued role of wholesalers in the American  economy."  </P> <P> "In calling for suppliers to sell at different prices within the wholesale  level of trade based upon each wholesaler's costs, the decision departs from  established precedent, from practicality and from congressional intent," Texaco  said.  </P> <P> Lawyers for the Texaco dealers opposed the appeal, arguing that Dompier and  Gull Oil were not wholesalers but retailers in disguise.  </P> <P> The National Assn. of Manufacturers sided with Texaco in the case, telling the  court that the lower court ruling would "deter if not make impossible the use  of independent local businesses as distributors."  </P></p>

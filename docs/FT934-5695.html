			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / The Business Traveller: Cathay Pacific closes door on latecomers - Daniel Green reports on an airline's pursuit of punctuality Travellers leaving Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific should consult their watches more closely than usual. The carrier has introduced a 'doors close on time' policy in an effort to reduce the number of late departures suffered by just about every airline at the crowded airport. The principle is that the check-in desk closes half an hour before scheduled departure. The gate shuts with 10 minutes to go. Passengers arriving after the deadlines will not be allowed on board. Anyone who has checked-in but not arrived at the gate 10 minutes before departure will have their luggage taken off the aircraft - the latest computer labelling technology allows the bags to be found quickly. The problem Cathay is trying to solve is that delays on long-haul flights out of Hong Hong can easily be an hour or more if the take-off slot is missed. One late passenger can leave the other 400 people on a Boeing 747 sitting on the tarmac for an hour or more. Left behind 'Some passengers have been lulled into feeling they can turn up at the last minute for flights. They would not turn up like that for a bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka, or for a theatre performance,' says Mr Tony Tyler, general manager of Cathay Pacific Europe. 'We are going to upset some people but the silent majority will applaud us.' The scheme's first few months of operation have seen punctuality improved dramatically, and 300 passengers left behind in Hong Kong. No one left at the departure gate has complained, claims Mr Tyler. He admits, though, that some people trying to check-in less than 30 minutes before scheduled departure were upset at being barred from the flight. 'At (Hong Kong's) Kai Tak airport, there is no way they could get from check-in to the aircraft in time,' he explains. Cathay may be facing a lone struggle to persuade the temporally challenged to change their ways: British Airways, which also flies from Hong Kong, will not be following Cathay's lead. 'We have a very good punctuality record,' insists BA. 'We see no reason to change our policy.'</p>

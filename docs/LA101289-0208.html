			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE BIG ONE;  </P> <P> THE SAN ANDREAS CAUSES MANY TO QUAKE;  </P> <P> BUT THE NEWPORT-INGLEWOOD FAULT MAY EVENTUALLY PACK THE BIGGER WALLOP  </P> <P> The San Andreas is the glamour fault, the crease in California's surface that  grabs the headlines.  </P> <P> But it is the lesser-known Newport-Inglewood Fault, which runs through the  heart of coastal Orange County, Long Beach and West Los Angeles, that  scientists say may deliver the really Big One.  </P> <P> Geologically, the two faults are cousins. They are classic strike-slip faults,  meaning that when an earthquake occurs the earth on either side of the fault  line shifts horizontally, rather than vertically in the case of a "thrust"  fault.  </P> <P> The San Andreas is the granddaddy of strike-slip faults. It forms the boundary  between two massive "plates" or sections of the earth's crust that are moving  in opposite directions. When the plates along the San Andreas move far enough,  a quake may occur to relieve tension on the fault.  </P> <P> Geologists expect a major earthquake -- perhaps one as strong as 8.5 on the  Richter scale -- along the San Andreas' southern section within the next 50  years. Such a quake could kill thousands of people and cause billions of  dollars in property damage.  </P> <P> But a sizably smaller temblor on the Newport-Inglewood fault could produce the  same catastrophic results. The reason is location. The San Andreas skirts the  most densely populated portions of the Southern California basin, running  roughly north-south from the Salton Sea along the backside of the San Gabriel  Mountains across the San Joaquin Valley to San Francisco Bay. It is the master  fault of a vast fault system that runs nearly the length of the state.  </P> <P> The Newport-Inglewood fault is a runt, by San Andreas standards. It has neither  the length of the San Andreas nor the standing in quake lore. But its potential  for destruction should it shake or shift is unarguable, experts say. The fault  encompasses some of the most intensely developed neighborhoods and commercial  centers in Orange and Los Angeles counties, running from Newport Beach to Long  Beach and north to Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> A magnitude 7.3 quake on the fault could cause $60 billion in property damage.  Nearly 5,000 people could die.  </P> <P> "A smaller earthquake on the Newport-Inglewood could cause an equal amount of  damage of a bigger quake on the San Andreas," Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton  said.  </P> <P> One reason is the geological makeup of Southern California. Most of the soil in  the basin, including Orange County, is a relatively loose sediment from river  and storm runoff.  </P> <P> "The L.A. Basin is like a big hole filled with Jell-O," said Hutton, adding  that there is very little bedrock or solid material to "absorb the shaking."  Thus, a quake on the Newport-Inglewood tends to feel more powerful than its  actual magnitude.  </P> <P> Last April, for example, a moderate 4.6 magnitude quake centered on the fault  under Newport Beach violently shook wide areas of the county. It frightened  even seasoned Southern Californians because of the severity of the shaking.  </P> <P> The San Andreas, on the other hand, is buried in more solid ground, geologists  say. Therefore, it will take a more powerful quake to generate the same  vibration of a smaller temblor on the Newport-Inglewood fault.  </P> <P> But Hutton said the San Andreas deservedly gets more attention because  scientists believe it has a shorter "recurrence time" between major quakes.  Earthquakes with a magnitude of 6.0 or greater are likely to occur every 250  years or sooner along the San Andreas, while such temblors on the  Newport-Inglewood are more likely every 1,500 years. The last major episode on  the Newport-Inglewood fault was the 6.3 Long Beach quake in 1933.  </P> <P> "Those are estimates," Hutton said. "And estimates are just that. A quake could  happen anytime -- tomorrow, next week or 50 years from now. We don't make  predictions because we just don't know."  </P> <P> The San Andreas is a more closely studied fault, Hutton said. In Central  California near Parkfield, there are more than 100 different creep meters,  seismographs, strain tests and other experiments under way to monitor the  fault's movement. That stretch of the San Andreas has been pegged by scientists  as the most likely for a quake of 5.0 or greater.  </P> <P> Similar scrutiny of the Newport-Inglewood fault, however, is impossible, Hutton  says. Because nearly all of the fault zone is developed -- and privately held  -- Hutton said, it is difficult to find a safe and suitable location to set up  test equipment.  </P> <P> "It's hard to monitor such a fault because of the traffic noise and issues of  access and vandalism," Hutton said. "We're left to draw conclusions about the  fault's behavior from past experience."  </P></p>

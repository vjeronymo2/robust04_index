			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: OSCAR UPDATE  </P> <P> William Kaiser is not giving up on his efforts to get four Oscars off the  auction block and back in the hands of the original recipient, art director  Lyle Wheeler. At a news conference this morning in Hollywood, Kaiser, a  hospital supervisor from Tuxedo, N.Y., will unveil a poster "directed to the  Long Beach couple (known only as Tom and Sherry) who have Lyle Wheeler's  Adademy Awards . . . Please have a heart and return (the) four remaining  Oscars. . . . You and the auctioneer already made over $21,000 from your  initial investment of $20 from Wheeler's box of Oscars in an unclaimed  merchandize sale." Kaiser will then head for Long Beach where, over the next  few days, he hopes to place about 1,000 of the posters in store windows. Last  month, Kaiser paid $21,250 to save an Oscar that was headed for auction and  returned it to Wheeler. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

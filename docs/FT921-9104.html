			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Cable and Wireless requests US licence CABLE and Wireless has asked the US authorities for permission to run its own integrated international telecommunications network from the US to the UK and Hong Kong. The UK-based telecommunications group wants to link Cable and Wireless Communications, its US subsidiary, with Mercury Communications and Hong Kong Telecom, its British and Hong Kong subsidiaries. Its application, filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in December but not revealed by the company, has already run into opposition from competitors. Sprint, the long-distance US carrier, has argued that the licence should not be granted unless its own application last month to provide services from the UK is approved. The UK government looks inclined not to grant Sprint such a licence, raising the prospect that the introduction of competition across the Atlantic could become caught up in a trade dispute. Syncordia, a subsidiary of BT, Mercury's dominant UK rival, has told the FCC that approval of C and W's application should depend on whether other companies are allowed to compete with Hong Kong Telecom, which holds a monopoly on international services in the colony. American Telephone and Telegraph and MCI, the two largest US long-distance carriers, want tough conditions imposed to stop C and W distorting competition in the US by using its privileged position in foreign markets. The US-UK route looks set to be the main battleground as international telecommunications opens up to competition. It is the busiest intercontinental route, and some experts predict that call charges could drop by two thirds to 30 cents (16p) a minute if there were full competition. C and W's application and the response by its competitors are the latest moves in an elaborate game in which the largest telecommunications groups try to turn themselves from national monopolies into globally competitive groups. Until last month, C and W was negotiating to create a global alliance with AT&amp;T. Traditionally, telecommunications companies have owned international facilities on a co-operative basis with the carrier at the other end. C and W already provides international services out of the US as a 're-seller', using the facilities owned by AT&amp;T and others. Its application to run end-to-end networks has concerned competitors, who fear C and W could gain an unfair advantage by being able to operate both ends of a cable or satellite link.

			<p><P> May 2, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: HEPBURN GETS ESTIMATED $4.25 MILLION TO TELL ALL  </P> <P> LISTEN CAREFULLY -- $4.25 million. This is the Publishers Weekly estimate of  the advance being paid to Katharine Hepburn for her coming memoir, "Me." Knopf  hopes to publish Kate's book next spring, while the company's president, Sonny  Mehta, says, "I don't want to rush Miss Hepburn."  </P> <P> This could be the highest sum ever paid to any public figure to tell us all  about it in print. And even if Miss Hepburn doesn't "tell all" -- which would  be like her -- she'll tell enough, and it should be worth it. The four-time  Oscar winner has long resisted writing intimately about her life. Now she will.  </P> <P> Although the great Kate was hospitalized last week for surgery on the ankle she  injured several years ago in a car accident, she is in fine spirits. She has  told producer Alexander Cohen that she'll definitely serve as one of the hosts  for this Saturday's massive "Night of 100 Stars III" to benefit the Actors  Fund, even if she has to show up on stage on crutches.  </P> <P> When it comes to the welfare of fellow actors, the show must go on!  </P> <P> JOHN KENNEDY JR. scored an impressive same three-tabloid headline Tuesday from  the New York Daily News, the Post and Newsday. All called him "The Hunk Who  Flunked."  </P> <P> Maybe young John, who recently flunked the New York Bar exam for the second  time, needs to get his head out of the clouds and back into the books.  </P> <P> The sexy scion of America's most famous family has been spotted on more than  one occasion at the Sky Manor Airport in New Jersey where he is a devotee of  sky-diving.  </P> <P> THAT CAT with nine lives -- Elizabeth Taylor -- is making such progress that  she may be released from St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica by the end of this  week. Her doctors are cautious, but the violet-eyed phoenix never has been much  of one for caution.  </P> <P> The star's near-fatal bout with pneumonia has had some positive side effects.  She received a worldwide wave of love and sympathy that reversed her almost  two-year backslide.  </P> <P> The illness has cemented her strong relationship with her companion,  37-year-old construction worker Larry Fortensky, who has been called "a brick,  a tower of strength." Despite the age and status difference, Elizabeth seems to  have found herself a regular guy who is loyal.  </P> <P> Miss T. has already agreed to star in a movie for her old friend, British  producer Norma Heyman, which is tentatively scheduled to begin next September  in London.  </P> <P> WHEN JACKIE Mason opens his third return engagement at the Public Theater in  New York on May 5 for 11 performances, he'll include in his "try-out" such  subjects as Bush and broccoli, Lithuania, Donald and Ivana Trump. Then Jackie  will take his very special views on to Los Angeles and, finally, if all goes  well, back to Broadway. This time the show is titled "Jackie Mason -- Brand  New."  </P> <P> IN CASE you think Joan Collins is all washed up, consider this. Harrods and  Selfridge's of Great Britain are battling for exclusive rights to sell her  perfume, Spectacular. And it looks as if Selfridge's has won and she'll kick  off a personal appearance there May 11.  </P> <P> You see, Joan is the third-most-talked about celebrity in England, with only  Princess Diana and the Duchess of York running ahead of her.  </P></p>

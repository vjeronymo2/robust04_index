			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / BBC loses its radio listener majority The commercial radio sector has, it is believed, overtaken the BBC for the first time, Raymond Snoddy writes. The latest audience figures, to be announced today by RAJAR, the official audience research body for radio, are expected to show that the commercial radio stations went above 50 per cent of total listening in the third quarter. In the three months to June 19 the commercial sector took a 47.4 per cent share of all radio listening in the UK. The symbolic crossover was not expected until next year. The commercial share has been boosted by the launching of new stations but the performance of existing stations has also improved. The rise of the commercial sector has been rapid. Little more than a year ago the BBC's five national stations and regional and local radio output commanded more than 61 per cent of listening. Apart from the launch of national commercial stations such as Classic FM and Virgin 1215 - and Atlantic 252 broadcasting from Ireland - the repositioning of BBC Radio 1 has had a considerable impact on audiences. Concentration on more public-service aims and adding more speech, including poetry, drama, and current affairs to the pop music mix has cost the BBC more than 3m listeners in 18 months. Commercial radio has increased its share of total advertising in the UK from about 2 per cent to more than 4 per cent.</p>

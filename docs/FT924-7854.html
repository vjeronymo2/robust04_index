			<p>921113 FT  13 NOV 92 / Survey of Japan and the European Community (14): Understanding is deepening - Interview with Japan's ambassador to the European Community MR TOMOHIKO KOBAYASHI, Japan's ambassador to the European Community, answers questions put to him by Ian Rodger of the Financial Times. QUESTION: Tension between Japan and the EC appears to have subsided in recent months. Has the development of the relationship become less urgent? ANSWER: Because of the decline of order in the international situation, it is more urgent than ever to develop our relationships. The world needs stronger leadership. Europe, Japan and North America are the only possible leaders. Russia and China are not ready yet. But everyone seems to be more concerned with domestic problems than international orders. Unfortunately, we in Japan are hindered by the weakening of the Liberal Democratic Party and by the slowing down of the economy until some time next year. For example, on the question of accepting tarification on agricultural products - this kind of initiative is not foreseeable. EC Commission leaders are also hindered by internal problems. So what can be done? At this stage, we cannot do very spectacular things, but we can make concrete progress in particular areas. For example, we had our first high level meeting early this year on environmental co-operation, and identified many areas where we could work together. The EC has promised to help us in studies of the Sarawak tropical forest (in Indonesia); and Japan has agreed to participate in studies of the Brazilian tropical forest, which is of great interest to the EC. On science and technology, we will be having our first meeting of experts shortly, and we have started co-operation on the Human Frontier programme. Japan has also reached an agreement with the US, Russia and the EC on research into nuclear fusion, and, like the US, we are a party to the European Energy Charter, under which concrete agreements for joint research and development into alternative forms of energy are being negotiated. We have had three seminars on social policy so far. I think that by comparing notes on social and labour policies, European understanding of Japanese systems is deepening, so we no longer get these sweeping criticisms based on lack of knowledge. For example, our annual working hours, which everyone criticises, are almost the same as those in the US or the UK. So, active co-operation has really started. We are not just at the rhetorical level as we were in July 1991 when we signed our joint declaration. Relations are no longer based only on trade problems. Of course, trade problems exist, and we have to manage them carefully so as not to poison our overall relations. Some analysts say that Japan has been reluctant or unable to carry though on its stated desire to develop stronger political relations with Europe. Not true. We took the initiative to broaden relations. The joint declaration was a Japanese initiative. It says that political dialogue is very important, and between the EC Council, the EC Commission and the Japanese government, dialogue has already started. We have worked on joint assessments of the former Soviet Union, and we are working together in the G24 group on eastern Europe. We have at last become an observer on the Committee for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) this year, but France is reluctant that we participate fully. Maybe the European complaint that we do not pay enough attention to Europe is justified because interest on the Japanese side is still limited to very few people. The focus of most businessmen is on the US and Asia. Europe, with the exception of the UK, is still considered a difficult region for Japanese business, and this view is reinforced by anti-Japanese outbursts from Mrs Edith Cresson (the former French prime minister) and Mr Jacques Calvet (chairman of the Peugeot motor group). Even Germany is a difficult country for Japanese businessmen. People complain about Japanese keiretsu, but we find there are very strong business ties between banks and enterprises in Germany that make it very difficult for us to penetrate. And there are serious labour problems in Germany. People like Mr Akio Morita of Sony are trying hard to change views, and the latest slogan in Japan for promoting global business understanding is 'harmonious symbiosis' - whatever that may mean] SOME Europeans complain that Japan is not doing enough to help the eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union countries. The mass media in Europe are too egocentric. Even the EC Commission says that Japan should take on the same level of burden there as a European country. But for us, the significance of eastern Europe is very different. Germany got back the eastern lander, which was a triumph for democracy in western Europe. And now the white, Christian people in the other eastern European countries are coming back to their western cultural home, so western Europe is very happy, even euphoric. Therefore, it is normal that they should pay for the regeneration of eastern Europe. Of course, if we reflect on the worldwide significance, Japan has to share the responsibility too, and we are ready to do that. But we have not had historical relations with eastern Europe. Look at it the other way round: what is happening in Cambodia or North Korea or Mongolia? Only Japan is helping Mongolia's democratisation drive with massive aid. We are the biggest provider of official development aid (ODA) to China, and we have other constituencies, willy nilly, as a result of geography, like Bangladesh. We advocate that the five former Soviet republics in central Asia should be entitled to ODA, but our initiative is being hampered by some European countries that want to direct aid mainly to their former eastern European friends. We understand that Europe is not so interested in these areas, but we are telling Europeans that they should become more involved in Asian problems because the US is retreating, and many Asian countries are worried. A European presence could be an element of security in Asia, even calming fears of Japanese domination. As for Russia, it is doing very little to ease tensions in the far east. Its military power there may even be increasing as it replaces old equipment. It is still occupying part of our country. So how can we give massive macro-economic aid? Would France give financial aid to a country that was occupying Alsace? Wartime resentment against Russia is still strong in Japan. The Soviet Union took 600,000 Japanese prisoners after the war, and there were terrible stories of torture and deprivation. Yet, we have pledged Dollars 2.6bn in technical and humanitarian assistance. The IMF is giving Dollars 24bn to Russia, and we are the second largest contributor to the IMF. So there are differences in viewpoint. We cannot avoid misunderstandings - that is why political dialogue is necessary. The UK presidency is doing a lot. They brief us regularly and we have responded by sending the deputy minister for political affairs for regular private consultations in Europe. Understanding is deepening, little by little.</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Fyffes The prospect of a slice of the banana market changing hands quickly has slipped away with the rejection by Fyffes' board. It remains to be seen whether the putative bidder will return for a more aggressive bite. If one of the large American companies is interested, the temptation must be strong. The new EC regime has cut the market share of dollar-based producers and handed it on a plate to Fyffes and Geest. US companies - particularly Dole, which is the best placed - must be tempted to buy that quota back. Geest has its own dollar-based plantations, so would not offer an outlet for more US bananas. Fyffes is thus the more tempting target. Presumably the Fyffes' board faced a nice calculation. On the one hand, it might not be sensible to sell out when earnings are about to jump. On the other, the company is probably at its most attractive to a US acquirer now. The EC quota system may, after all, be eased in future. If the McCann family wishes to sell its holding, it may not get a better moment. Perhaps the offer was seen as inadequate. In which case the board must hope that the buyer's taste for bananas encourages him back at a fuller price.</p>

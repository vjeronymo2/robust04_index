In Sherwood Forest, actors reenact scenes from  the legend of Robin Hood and in the Peaks District a performance of English  country dancers is held.  </P> <P> Exploring the North Yorkshire region, the video focuses on the city of York,  its archeological sites, old Shambles area and the beautiful stained-glass  windows of York Minster, plus a side trip to a country fair and fox hunt at  Castle Howard, the setting for TV's "Brideshead Revisited."  </P> <P> A visit with author/veterinarian James Herriot takes place at his "surgery"  (doctor's office) in the Yorkshire Dales.

			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN THE EYE OF THE STORM;  </P> <P> INSIDE THE NORTH CAROLINA ARTS FOUNDATION THAT'S UNDER FIRE FOR SPONSORING A  TOUR OF 'OFFENSIVE' ARTWORKS  </P> <P> In 1978, as a young, white Southern businessman with strong conservative  feelings of alienation about the Democratic Party, F. Borden Hanes Jr. switched  his registration to Republican.  </P> <P> There was one candidate for the U.S. Senate, in particular, whom Hanes found a  politically kindred spirit and for whose reelection campaign Hanes organized a  group of other like-minded young men. Hanes recalls that the group raised  between $30,000 and $40,000.  </P> <P> Their man won. His name: Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).  </P> <P> "I raised a pretty good slug of money for him," said Hanes. When Helms ran for  reelection again five years ago, Hanes worked behind the scenes in the  campaign.  </P> <P> "I don't agree with him on a lot of things, but there are ideas in which I'm  with him," Hanes said, "such as free enterprise, foreign policy and economics.  But on the abortion issue (and the larger) conservative social agenda, I just  don't identify with it at all."  </P> <P> Under the circumstances, there is something strikingly ironic about watching  Borden Hanes pick up a copy of a local newspaper that has published a color  reproduction of a photograph titled "Piss Christ." It is an image of a plastic  crucifix immersed in a tank of the artist's own urine.  </P> <P> The photograph, the work of New York photographer Andres Serrano, 38, was  included in a show sponsored last year by the Southeastern Center for  Contemporary Art, of which Borden Hanes is chairman of the board.  </P> <P> SECCA (pronounced "SEEK-uh") has been targeted by Helms in what most observers  agree is the most profound crisis for the National Endowment for the Arts since  the federal agency was founded nearly 25 years ago. (The NEA has helped fund  SECCA.) Helms and a handful of Republican state legislators in Raleigh have  seized on the depiction of the crucifix and the NEA's funding of a show of  photographs -- some depicting homoerotic and sadomasochistic themes -- by the  late Robert Mapplethorpe to launch a campaign at the state and federal levels  to ban public funding for offensive or indecent artworks.  </P> <P> It was the controversial photograph that drew Hanes and the boards of SECCA and  the old-money, blueblood foundation set up by the will of James G. Hanes,  Borden's granduncle, which provides about one-quarter of SECCA's funding, into  the political crisis.  </P> <P> Hanes had been discussing his past support for Helms while sitting in what was  once the parlor in the main house on the former estate of James G. Hanes, who  had run the family's textile business. The house is now a part of the 32-acre,  wooded campus-like setting for SECCA's headquarters. Carefully, Hanes studied  "Piss Christ," in which the crucifix can be clearly identified in front of a  reddish background. "I didn't even look at the title initially," he said. "It  gave me a sense of peace. I felt good about it. I didn't know at the time what  it was submerged in.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a pretty innovative approach. That amber hue is not only very  colorful, but it conveys a sense of passivity."  </P> <P> He analyzed the photograph with a knowing eye. He says that, in the decade  since his family urged him to join SECCA's board, he has become an ardent fan  of some of art's most avant-garde work.  </P> <P> "My vision would be that SECCA is a nationally recognized organization -- one  that the arts community in New York and Los Angeles can respect as on the  cutting edge of contemporary art, with feeling for the artists and feeling for  the communities that we serve.  </P> <P> "I'm hopeful that, in the long run, the flak is going to be beneficial." He  reasons that it will make people aware of SECCA, and those sympathetic to its  cause may contribute money.  </P> <P> Redge Hanes, Borden Hanes' cousin and chairman of the James G. Hanes  Foundation, is even blunter about the need for artists to work free of  political pressure. "If art doesn't provoke, who needs it? You can go buy  wallpaper from decorators."  </P> <P> The crisis has probably brought an end to Borden Hanes' support for Helms. But  even today, Hanes said he could probably call Helms and get through. He has  never placed the call.  </P> <P> "I just think he's got his mind made up," Hanes said of Helms. "No matter what  I would say, would he change his opinion becauses of something I would say? I  think there is an element in his support structure that has really got his  attention here. I can't identify with it. I'm just going to have to think about  whether I can vote for him again."  </P> <P> Borden Hanes comes from one of the two old-line Winston-Salem families that are  the social bedrock in this Forsyth County city of about 135,000. There are the  Haneses, of the textile company family that gave the world Hanes T-shirts and  underwear, and there is the family descended from the tobacco fortune of R. J.  Reynolds.  </P> <P> Sitting in an overstuffed chair, Hanes, attired in a neat, dark suit, reflected  on what has become the irony of this political affiliation. Hanes, 44, has  shunned the limelight as the SECCA crisis has developed. But it has exploded  around him, like it or not. The executive vice-president of an investment  counseling firm with offices here and in Atlanta, Hanes finds himself and SECCA  embroiled in a nasty political dispute that has made him personally  uncomfortable and, to a certain extent, even divided his family.  </P> <P> Last year, the Awards in the Visual Arts, a pioneer program organized by  SECCA's director, Ted Potter, nearly a decade ago, included Serrano among the  10 people it recognized as the nation's emerging artists. Among the works  included by Serrano in the annual touring show that is one of the key rewards  of winning the AVA (pronounced "AY-vuh") was "Piss Christ." The show that  included Serrano's photograph toured to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art  last year. The current year's show (without the photo), the eighth annual AVA  exhibit, opens Saturday at the La Jolla Museum of Contemporary Art. The show  has been seen in Atlanta and travels to Seattle and New York after its run in  La Jolla closes Oct. 15.  </P> <P> AVA seeks to break the stranglehold on art recognition held by large population  centers such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles by dividing the country into  10 districts -- each of which includes about the same number of artists. Thus,  AVA Area 2 includes only Manhattan and Area 10 is only Southern California and  Hawaii.  </P> <P> Each district produces one of the 10 annual winners. It is the only visual arts  competition in the country in which someone working in North Dakota has the  same opportunity to be selected for national recognition as an artist in SoHo  or the West Village in New York City.  </P> <P> The NEA provides about $70,000 of the AVA program's annual budget -- a total of  $412,000 last year.  </P> <P> Because of a bill working its way through the Congress, SECCA faces a pending  five-year ban on eligibility for federal arts grants and narrowly averted an  attempt in the North Carolina legislature to permanently bar the agency from  grants by the North Carolina Arts Council.  </P> <P> A House-Senate conference committee in Washington will try to reach a  compromise on the NEA funding bill after Labor Day. Observers agree, however,  that if the ban on public funding for offensive art survives, and if the  blacklisting of SECCA and the Institute for Contemporary Art at the University  of Pennsylvania (which organized a show of Mapplethorpe's work) sticks, the  endowment could not function.  </P> <P> Ironically, the actual "Piss Christ" photograph, 40 by 60 inches long, has  never been exhibited in North Carolina, Potter said. Serrano's submission was  selected by a panel of jurors who viewed his work on slides. The exhibit in  which the photo itself was included didn't come to North Carolina. The original  print has been sold by Stux Gallery in New York, which represents Serrano, to  an anonymous private collector.  </P> <P> Helms did not respond to several requests for an interview. In May, however,  Helms said in a Senate speech that criticized the AVA competition: "This  program, supported by the National Endowment, is administered by the  Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art. They call it SECCA. I am sorry to say  it is in my home state."  </P> <P> North Carolina Republican State Sen. Michael Decker, who sponsored a bill to  ban SECCA from state funding and who has been in close contact with Helms'  office on the issue, said the controversy over "Piss Christ" raises basic  questions of the appropriateness of public money being used to finance arts  programs.  </P> <P> Decker, a high school history teacher who lives in Walkertown, a community near  Winston-Salem, said he was drawn to the issue because he was repelled by the  title and subject matter of the photograph -- although he had not seen the  image in color until a reporter showed him one from a catalogue in Raleigh last  week.  </P> <P> "I think that if you are an individual citizen and you want to go to an art  gallery, that would be one thing," Decker said. "You have a choice. But  taxpayers don't have that choice. I don't think it's proper to force them to  subsidize something they would find offensive.  </P> <P> "I think art has a place and I think we can fund it, but I'm certainly not for  funding these horrendous things that are being put on us in the name of art."  </P> <P> Decker said he supported a measure offered in the state senate after he  introduced his own bill, which would ban state funding for religiously  offensive art. He believes that just as civil rights laws were used to prohibit  public money being used in support of racial segregation, the same principle  can apply to keeping public support away from offensive artwork.  </P> <P> "My main design is to prevent people from showing things that they call art  that are offensive to the vast majority of Americans."  </P> <P> Decker said the system he envisions would preclude an art museum that has state  support for the salary of its curator, for instance, from accepting a privately  supported traveling show that included offensive work.  </P> <P> "I don't think that one person should try to formulate a definition of what is  acceptable," he said. "(But) I'd be glad to be on a group of people who would  do that."  </P> <P> The situation has so upset Borden Hanes that the muscles in his face tense  noticeably when he talks about it. To him and his cousin Redge Hanes, a  registered Democrat, the political tempest threatens to damage a program that  SECCA, which was founded in 1956, has spent years organizing specifically to  challenge the supremacy of the East Coast-West Coast art Establishment.  </P> <P> And, the two cousins fear that continuing publicity could even endanger private  financial support, which forms the backbone of SECCA's $1.7-million annual  budget. The North Carolina Arts Council contributes about $70,000. Besides the  James G. Hanes Foundation's contribution, the remaining support is raised from  private sources -- most of them local and regional contributors.  </P> <P> For several years the bulk of AVA's funding was supplied by the Rockefeller and  Equitable Foundations. This year, BMW of North America Inc., the luxury car  importer, joined the two foundations as a sponsor and will host the New York  showing of the 1989 work at the BMW Gallery in New York.  </P> <P> A couple years ago SECCA got a $300,000 NEA grant that required it to raise  matching funds. A campaign that is just being concluded brought in $4 million  to build the new exhibit center and provide financing for other SECCA programs.  </P> <P> Potter said that between 70,000 and 90,000 people attend shows at SECCA here.  Another 500,000 view traveling shows -- mostly in the South -- that SECCA  organizes.  </P> <P> So far, said Redge Hanes, local people who support SECCA have remained  supportive, but the board is increasingly concerned about financial fallout.  "If you make an institution untouchable, then there are subtle movements of  potential funders away from that institution for reasons they can't even  identify," said Redge Hanes.  </P> <P> "If SECCA is denied federal funding because of one photograph, if that's fair,  then, my God, this country is into some very serious problems. Our foundation  is not saying that we don't personally find the title of that picture somewhat  offensive."  </P> <P> Redge Hanes, a member of the more politically liberal wing of the Hanes family  and a registered Democrat, is closely associated with U.S. Sen. Terry Sanford,  North Carolina's junior senator. He is also on the boards of the American Arts  Alliance and the American Council for the Arts, two of the largest arts  advocacy groups in the country.  </P> <P> The ramifications of an attack on SECCA, just as the South is beginning to  emerge as a nationally recognized center for the visual arts, make Redge Hanes  so angry he can hardly contain himself.  </P> <P> "Isn't it ironic that the self-same institution that is trying to break the  stereotype of the South is the one that they are trying to slaughter? A lot of  people from the South really resent the kind of superior attitude that people  in other parts of the country have held," he said.  </P> <P> "Perhaps our mission is to eliminate the concept of regionalism. Art is one way  to do that and possibly the only way. But if the McCarthys of this world can  put us on a blacklist, then stand back, dude, because the next time the Mark  Taper Forum (in Los Angeles) wants to put on a (politically or sexually  controversial) play, if it's offensive to some people, the response will be:  Zap 'em."  </P> <P> "We're in a very religious area here, where there are lot of born-again  Christians," Borden Hanes said. "To them, it's very black and white. Even if we  explain where Serrano is coming from, they don't want to hear it.  </P> <P> "They're just focusing on the crucifix submerged in the artist's urine. That's  all they can think about. They can't think about what he is trying to say and  express and (how) the commercialization of Christianity is very disturbing to  him.  </P> <P> "What I want to do now is to continue to support First Amendment rights and the  freedom of expression, but to have a little bit more political savvy and put  the Serrano thing behind us as far as this community is concerned."  </P> <P> As Borden Hanes sat talking in the parlor, the sounds of heavy construction  equipment could be heard outside.  </P> <P> The equipment is working to complete a new, $2.8-million, 23,000-square-foot  addition to SECCA's plant, which will more than double the art center's  exhibition space and include a 300-seat recital hall, sculpture terraces and  badly needed storage space. The new structure is to be dedicated next April.  </P> <P> Though it is a major exhibition center that organizes as many as 50 shows a  year -- including those here and others that tour in North Carolina and the  rest of the South -- SECCA does not have a permanent collection. The majority  of its 21 full-time employees, including Potter, the executive director, are  themselves working artists.  </P> <P> Most works included in shows at the SECCA complex here are offered for sale,  providing a badly needed commercial outlet for regional artists who have  difficulty breaking into the gallery system dominated by New York, Chicago and  Los Angeles. SECCA also sponsors a regional arts competition called the  Southeast Seven that provides grants of its own.  </P> <P> SECCA's arts education program is relied on heavily throughout the state. "It's  an incredible organization," said Mary Regan, director of the North Carolina  Arts Council in Raleigh. SECCA, said Regan, has helped develop interest in the  arts throughout the state -- to a degree people outside the region might find  surprising in the South.  </P> <P> "I could take you out in this state to any community and I believe I would  shatter your stereotype about what North Carolinians want," Regan said. "That  stereotype would be that North Carolinians in small towns and rural areas are  not that interested in the arts."  </P> <P> Potter's vision is that SECCA is already -- and can become more of -- a force  for change in a larger attempt to force the arts Establishment away from what  he calls "the fly-over effect, where they go from New York to Los Angeles, look  down (and see) nothing.  </P> <P> "This whole 'Hudson River mentality' drives me crazy. I've been saying for 25  years that there are artists worth looking at and getting recognition  everywhere." The Hudson River, which separates Manhattan from New Jersey, has  what Potter calls a mythological influence, "that if an artist chooses to live  on the wrong side of the Hudson River it's because he isn't good enough to live  on the right side. You can't tell me that the (arts Establishment) doesn't  still believe that.  </P> <P> "We're trying to accomplish (that change) and now this happens."  </P> <P> Potter believes that our society doesn't "want to admit that our artists are  serious. We want our artists to be perceived to be like self-indulgent  children. It's amusing to have them at parties occasionally and we like them  being just slightly naughty.  </P> <P> "If artists are perceived as focusing on critical issues of what we do, we  don't like that a bit. But whenever a society is dealing in depth with  heartfelt critical issues, art responds. Some people get annoyed as hell if the  artists want to come up with some kind of strong comment."  </P></p>

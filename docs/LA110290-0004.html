			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHARING BLAME OF 'MORAL MUTANTS'  </P> <P> I doubt whether there is a future for my caring, productive, honest,  14-year-old son. According to Josephson, he is destined to become a "greedy,  corrupt, selfish, dishonest" person (not unlike many politicians and attorneys  who inhabit the planet already).  </P> <P> It seems to me that Josephson has not discovered anything new. In each  generation there are those who try to get by on the accomplishments of others  and those who have the ethical fiber to rely on themselves to achieve.  </P> <P> In merely laying the waste at the feet of "parents, teachers and employers,"  Josephson leaves the real issue in the dust. The real problem lies with what is  learned about American history. If Josephson's 18-30 generation is engaged in  sexual misconduct and displaying criminal behavior patterns, it is partly due  to the examples set by people like Gary Hart and Richard Nixon.  </P> <P> Josephson can now disappear behind the walls of his foundation. He has had his  15 minutes of fame.  </P> <P> JOAN R. LOBENFELD  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

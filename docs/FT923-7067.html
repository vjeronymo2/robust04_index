			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Minorities reject buy-out at Hillsdown arm Minority shareholders in a bakery group controlled by Maple Leaf Foods, the Canadian subsidiary of Hillsdown Holdings, have rejected a buy-out proposal. Maple Leaf owns 66 per cent of Toronto-based Corporate Foods and had proposed a merger to facilitate expansion into the US baking market. Corporate Foods minority shareholders were offered 1.15 Maple Leaf shares or CDollars 19.9 (Pounds 8.80) in cash for each CF share. The proposal was defeated by a narrow majority of CF's outside shareholders at a special meeting. Although Maple Leaf improved its original offer by adding the cash option, the terms were still criticised by several institutional shareholders. Since acquiring a 56 per cent stake in Maple Leaf, formerly Canada Packers, in 1990, Hillsdown has moved aggressively to rationalise operations and to position the company for expansion in selected food-processing sectors in the US. Mr Charles Bowen, chief executive of Maple Leaf, said that while the merger would have 'solidified' the company's position in the bakery industry and simplified future acquisition opportunities, Maple Leaf was 'quite satisfied' to retain its present interest. CF has reported record profits for 11 consecutive years.</p>

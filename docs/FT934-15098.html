			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (4): The spotlight has shifted - Design ASK any German, French or British industrialist what are the most important characteristics of their Italian competitors, and the chances are that good design will feature as prominently as price and quality. The post-war success of Italian industry, especially in exports, has been intimately linked to innovative design. Often, Italian manufacturers have shaped taste, steering consumers towards products which may have offered little advance on their rivals technologically but beat them hands down on design. From furniture to freezers, cars to computers, Italian goods have gained a competitive edge against their foreign rivals through good design. While far-sighted company executives and a traditional stress on fine arts in education have been crucial influences, the existence of a cadre of gifted industrial designers in Italy has been essential to fulfil manufacturers' briefs. In recent years, items such as Alessi's shiny stainless steel cookware or the slinky matt-black Tizio desk lamp made by Artemide have become international symbols of 'design consciousness' among consumers. But the ubiquity of Italian design is not limited to expensive yuppie products such as desk lamps. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, architects such as Ettore Sottsass, now best known for his Memphis design movement, turned their hands to utilitarian items such as filing cabinets or typewriters. Today, their output features as prominently in international design museums as the trendier outpourings of their successors. However, many observers feel that Italian design has lost momentum and with it the international leadership it commanded as recently as the early 1980s. The message that design matters as much as keen pricing and quality manufacturing has caught on abroad. With many foreign companies now as design conscious as their Italian counterparts, has Italian industry lost one of its biggest competitive advantages? Mr Mario Trimarchi, director of the Master in Industrial Design course at Milan's Domus Academy of design, prefers to avoid confrontational terms. 'The design industry has internationalised immeasurably,' he says, 'and positions of national leadership are no longer so important'. He gives two reasons why the spotlight has shifted from Italy in the past decade. First, the study and teaching of design has developed at a number of international centres, apart from Milan, its traditional cradle. Among schools now prominent alongside Domus are the Cranbrook Academy, the Pasadena Art Centre and the Illiois Institute of Technology in the US and a variety of company-based design centres in Japan. Pure industrial design remains the credo at a number of top German design schools, while the UK's Royal College of Art is a magnet for students wanting a broader training in design and the fine arts. Secondly, issues in international design have moved on, says Mr Trimarchi. 'Ten years ago, Italy was at the forefront of renewing the language of domestic design.' Designers born or trained in Italy were spearheading a revolution in fashion, furniture and a stream of household products ranging from lavatory brushes to linoleum. Their ideas had worldwide repercussions. But now, new concerns have taken over. Ecological awareness and the correct use of materials from an environmental point of view is foremost among them. In the 1990s, the nature of materials has become almost as important to designers as to craft them. The new testing grounds for future design trends are also in industries where Italian companies are relatively weak. Rather than fashion or furniture, consumer electronics and computers are now the focal point for determining industrial design trends, Mr Trimarchi believes. With consumer durables playing an increasingly important role in every household, and technological innovations coming thick and fast, designing the latest 'black boxes' has moved into the forefront. So far, neither the US, Japan nor Europe has gained a clear lead, he says. Design-conscious Italian companies are aware of the challenges. At Artemide, the Lombardy-based lighting group owned and run by Mr Ernesto Gismondi, a former professor of missile technology at the Milan Polytechnic, the stress is now on products which marry attractive design to energy efficiency. 'The emphasis has moved on', says Mr Gismondi, whose company, established in 1960, reached international fame after the Tizio lamp, designed by international design guru Richard Sapper in 1972, started to catch on. Sales of the Tizio have started to fall off from their late 1980s peak, in a telling indication of the change in tastes and emphasis, notes Mr Gismondi. Leading the visitor into his spartan office, he gives a glimpse of the future. Gone are the high-powered halogen lamps of the 1980s which, although easier on electricity than a traditional filament bulb, still consume prodigious amounts of energy. Instead, Artemide's latest product is a stylish uplighter which uses compact fluorescent bulbs to produce as much light as a halogen lamp at a fraction of the cost in terms of power consumption. The new product has been designed by Mr Gismondi himself, rather than by one of the outside design studios which do most of the work for Artemide. But although the issues in international design may have moved on since Italy's heyday, Italian companies can still call on a huge pool of talent on their doorsteps. Milan remains one of the world's design Meccas thanks to the concentration of leading designers who work there. Its role has been reinforced by the 10-year-old Domus Academy, which pulls in some of the best young students, many of whom then seek jobs at the Milan studios. The school only takes about 30 postgraduates a year for its masters' degree in design and about 25 for a similar qualification in fashion - and therefore competition is fierce despite steep tuition fees of L21m excluding tax. However, the range of nationalities who apply gives some comfort to those who fear Milan may be losing its place as a design centre. About 90 per cent of the students come from abroad, says Mr Emilio Genovesi, Domus's executive director. While many return home to set up their own studios or, in the case of the heavy Japanese contingent, rejoin their sponsor companies, some stay in Milan to gain experience with local studios. 'Milan remains one of the most fertile meeting places for international designers', says Mr Genovesi. 'The fact that English is the common language reflects the mix of people who congregate here'. Other cities, such as Tokyo, Dusseldorf or Barcelona, may offer a concentration of manufacturing industry and designers working closely together. But none can match Milan for the breadth of backgrounds and cultures among its designers, he thinks. For a company such as Artemide, typical of hundreds of small, highly design-conscious Italian manufacturers, that vitality is a positive sign. Whatever the improvements in design taking place among their foreign competitors, it suggests they will be able to keep up with the pack, if not remain ahead, in future.</p>

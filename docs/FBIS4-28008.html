			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comment" column: "Respect Thy Neighbor"] </F>   [Text] International standards of neighboring behavior  require sovereign nations to respect one another and not to  interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, near or  far. Of course, with Thailand this is always different, unless  they themselves are the `victim' of neighborly meddling in their  own internal affairs.    So armed with the usual double standards, the Thais continue  to meddle and flex their muscles in the internal affairs of  Cambodia, their favorite `weak' neighbor.    A recent glaring example of this affair is when General  Charan Kunlawanit, head of Thai National Security Council,  embroiled himself in Cambodia's internal affairs when he  dispatched a diplomatic note warning Australian foreign Minister  Gareth Evans to reject His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk's plea  for military aid for the Kingdom of Cambodia. General Charan  apparently argued that aid would expose Cambodia as a puppet of  the West.    The question about what General Charan's role is in this  matter has turned out to be an interesting one. Never mine that  the Khmer Rouge has all this time received support from certain  segments of the Thai military, which makes them to be puppets of  Thailand. This turn of events is highly suprising for a man who  personally vetoed a U.S. request last year for permission to put  up aerial reconnaisance to monitor Khmer Rouge movements along  the Thai border, as reported in the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW.  General Charan's neutrality is of course a foregone conclusion,  especially in light of his comments to the BANGKOK POST a year  earlier, when he said Thailand would "be crazy" to sever ties  with the Khmer Rouge.    The rebels "share the same fence as ours. Boycott them and  we endanger our own being" the good general said.    Naturally, General Charan is not representative of the whole  of Thailand, but what is clear is that Thailand is not in too  much of a hurry to see Indochina, especially Cambodia's  in-fighting stamped out -- not if Thailand stands to gain from  another long, drawn out war.    And so the Thai comedy plays on.</p>

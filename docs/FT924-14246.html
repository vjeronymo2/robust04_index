			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Sport: The root of England's problem - Soccer WHEN England start their World Cup campaign against Norway at Wembley on Wednesday, it will be a testing meeting not just for the team but also for the resourceful journalists of Britain's tabloid newspapers. After England lost to the hosts in the European championships in June, one of the tabloids screamed: 'Swedes 2, Turnips 1'. In September, when England lost in Santander, it stuck with the theme: 'Spanish 1, Onions 0.' 'I'm beginning to wonder what's the bloody vegetable in Norway,' said Graham Taylor, the England manager. Taylor's persecutors have superimposed a photograph of his face on to a turnip. It is a good joke, but it also contains a truth. On the evidence of some of Taylor's team selections, criticism from the newspapers seem to have turned his brain into mashed root vegetable. The irony is that one of the reasons he was picked for the job over better candidates was his ability to handle the press. His two years as England manager have followed the pattern set by his predecessor, Bobby Robson. England qualified for the European championship finals in Sweden and then bowed out tamely, as Robson's team did in Germany four years earlier. Robson also guided England to two World Cup finals. In both, England started poorly but recovered when the players convinced Robson to change tactics. Taylor, like Robson, can build a team to qualify for international tournaments, but picking a team to win them is beyond him. Americans divide coaches into winners and losers. This is ruthless and simplistic, but it avoids confusion over priorities. If you want to win trophies then you pick a coach who has won most competitions at the highest level. But the choice of Taylor to guide the England team to the World Cup finals in the US in 1994 suggested that the FA had other goals in mind. There was a time when even the limited goal of reaching the World Cup finals seemed beyond England. The team finished the 1960s as world champions. In the 1970 World Cup, they were cruising to a quarter-final victory over the West Germans when Germany rallied to win 3-2. By the time England returned to the World Cup finals in 1982, the assured confidence of that team seemed an impossible memory. After England were eliminated in 1973, the FA appointed the 'winningest' manager in England: Don Revie. From the Revie fiasco, the FA learnt two wrong lessons. First, that managerial success at club level bears no relation to success in internationals; second, that an international manager must, above all, be able to cope with the unremitting attention of the media. When the FA appointed a permanent successor they turned to Ron Greenwood - the perfect man to clear up the wreckage. Over the next two decades, more difficult men such as Brian Clough, Bob Paisley and Howard Kendall led big clubs to multiple League championship and European trophies. All were passed over in favour of others who had achieved respectability and, in the case of Greenwood and Robson, some cup success, at smaller clubs. Their appointments, and that of Taylor, were a sign that the FA saw England as a middle-of-the-table club. Greenwood and Robson built teams that avoided disaster in the World Cup. Even so, criticism began to mount. Time and again England have entered important matches against medium-strength opposition, as they do against Norway, with the fans and the press predicting the worst. But if England win narrowly against Norway the personal abuse aimed at Taylor will be redoubled. English fans may live in constant dread of humiliating defeat, but they also dream of their team humiliating the world. Taylor must know by now that, for all his public relations skills, merely reaching the World Cup finals will not be enough. He must at least match the Paul Gascoigne-inspired run to the semi-finals in 1990. Taylor complains frequently, and with some justification, about the problems he has picking a settled team. But he often fails to take the opportunities he has. It is difficult to believe that he is nurturing players (other than David Batty) or developing continuity. The substitutions at the end of the Spanish defeat created only a sense of chaos. Taylor knew before the European championships that Gary Lineker would be quitting international football. But he left out of his squad the two best candidates to replace him: Ian Wright and David Hirst. As Lineker said, Alan Shearer is not, for all his virtues, an instinctive goal scorer. Taylor's squad was devoid of creative players in part because he spurned two proven internationals: Chris Waddle and Peter Beardsley. Both are playing well this season but neither is in the squad for the game against Norway. Taylor's reluctance to play Wright, Beardsley or Waddle reveals a lot about his attitudes. Beardsley lacks stamina, but Taylor has substitutes. Waddle will not stay in one position: as soon as he steps on the pitch he is out of the manager's control. Wright has a reputation for indiscipline. But his electric pace, assured first touch and goal-scoring instinct make him a potential threat at international level. Taylor might cave in to pressure and play Wright on Wednesday but he represents a risk and Taylor is averse to risks. Taylor must now wrestle with the biggest risk of all: Gascoigne. Taylor does not trust Gascoigne. He showed that when he dropped him for what promised to be a robust match against the Republic of Ireland in 1991. Gascoigne's injury gives Taylor an excuse for leaving him on the substitutes' bench. This is pragmatism, says Taylor. In truth he is lowering his sights. His instinct is to pick a team to scuff for a result. But football is full of scuffers. The true pragmatists know that this is not enough. They are the ones who collect the trophies Taylor has never won. He is happy to settle for a diet turnip when he could roll the dice and dine on caviar.</p>

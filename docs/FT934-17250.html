			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Martin Marietta unveils Dollars 1.5bn cost-cutting plan MARTIN Marietta, the US defence contractor, yesterday announced a consolidation plan intended to reduce operating costs by Dollars 1.5bn over the next five years. The restructuring, which involves the closure of facilities in seven states and a further 2,000 job losses, follows Marietta's Dollars 3.05bn acquisition of General Electric's aerospace division earlier this year. The merger created the world's largest aerospace electronics group, with annual revenues of about Dollars 11bn. The group's main products include space equipment, missiles, satellites, avionics and communications systems. Before the deal was approved in April, Mr Norman Augustine, Marietta's chairman, warned that significant cuts would be necessary to eliminate overcapacity and duplication in administration, research and production. Most of the facilities to be shut or relocated under the plan were formerly operated by GE. The former GE aerospace headquarters in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, will consolidate with Martin Marietta's main office in Bethesda, Maryland, with a 40 per cent cut in staff. GE's former Automated Systems arm, which produces simulation and test systems for the military at facilities in Florida and Massachusetts, will merge with Marietta's Electronic Systems Center in Orlando, Florida. In addition to cutting costs, Marietta said the consolidation was intended to 'put together complementary technologies under one group'. The resulting 'synergies', the company said, would lead to greater market penetration and higher shares. The redundancies announced yesterday are in addition to 9,000 jobs the company previously said it would eliminate this year. The figure brings the total number of positions that Marietta and GE Aerospace have cut since 1987 to 46,000. The down-sizing reflects sharp reductions in defence spending, as well as efforts to improve productivity. The scope of the consolidation was in line with analysts' expectations. At the close of trading on Wall Street, Marietta shares were up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 89.</p>

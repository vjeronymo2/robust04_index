			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Record exports for SA fruit arm UNIFRUCO, the export marketing arm of South Africa's deciduous fruit industry, overcame deteriorating market conditions to sell a record volume of 40.5m cartons of fruit during the 1992 season. Volumes were 15 per cent up on the 1991 sales of 35.2m cartons, while gross proceeds rose by 18 per cent to R1.7bn (Pounds 366m) from R1.4bn in 1991. Producer payments were up by 14 per cent to R978m from R861m. Mr David Gant, chairman, said that although the South African products were now competing on almost level terms, 'the business climate has deteriorated dramatically since the beginning of the year and producers should take note that marketing conditions are likely to be tough next year'. Positive developments on the marketing side included re-entry into the markets of the US, the Republic of Ireland, Finland and Denmark, and the opening of the Far East to South African deciduous fruit for the first time from January 1 1993. Mr Gant said good progress had been made with the implementation of the co-operation agreement between the deciduous and citrus export industries through the joint services company Fresh Fruit Services. Combining the bargaining power of the two industries had already realised considerable cost savings. The season was one of mixed fortunes for the different fruits, though most farmers produce more than one type and hence are likely to experience both the ups and downs. In terms of crop size, apricots grew by 46 per cent, peaches and nectarines by 64 per cent, table grapes by 19 per cent and apples by 15 per cent. In terms of net payments to the producers, the best performers were peaches and nectarines, up by 63 per cent; grapes, up by 31.5 per cent; and pears, up by 28 per cent. The general apple market, however, collapsed towards the end of the season resulting in the dumping of large amounts of competitive fruit at losses. Net payments for apples thus declined by 2 per cent. In terms of net payments to producers, the three largest crops are apples (R414.5m), grapes (R289.1m) and pears (R203.7m). Unifruco, the single channel marketing arm for South Africa's deciduous fruit exports, is one of the main southern hemisphere suppliers to the European market, principally during the European winter. It recently started exporting exotic products, such as avocados, for which volumes were up by 300 per cent during the past year. Mr Gant said the first year of exports of the Oak Village range of wines by the Vinfruco subsidiary had been 'fairly successful'.</p>

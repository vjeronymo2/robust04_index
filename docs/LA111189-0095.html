			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOTORCYCLISTS REVVING UP FOR LOVE RIDE TO BENEFIT THE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY ASSN.  </P> <P> More than 3,000 bikers and motorcyclists will gather Sunday morning along the  streets of Glendale near the Harley-Davidson shop at 3717 San Fernando Road for  the 8 a.m. start of the sixth annual Love Ride. Last year, the event raised  $360,000 for the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., Harley-Davidson's designated  charity.  </P> <P> The Love Ride originated with Oliver Shokouh, owner of Harley-Davidson of  Glendale. The first few years, he and his employees organized the event in  their spare time. With participants now numbering in the thousands, that's no  longer possible.  </P> <P> They come from as far away as New York City, at least in the case of Malcolm  Forbes, this year's special guest. Forbes will jet in to ride with Willie G.  Davidson, a Harley-Davidson vice president and grandson of the company's  founder.  </P> <P> According to Shokouh, among the Love Ride 6 riders will be music and  entertainment personalities, including David Crosby, Jay Leno, Billy Idol, John  James, Hoyt Axton, Peter Fonda, Eric Burdon, David Walsh, King on a Stick, John  Schneider and comedian Rick Overton. Overton will be emcee of the program at  Calamigos Ranch, destination of the 100-mile ride.  </P> <P> The participant who raises the most pledge money for the Muscular Dystrophy  Assn. will be awarded a $12,000 Harley Softail. The ride is open to anyone on  any brand of motorcycle with an entry fee minimum of $35.  </P></p>

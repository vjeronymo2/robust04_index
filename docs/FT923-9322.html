			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / People: Coming out of cold storage to run Boustead Singaporean businessman Jack Chia's acquisition of Boustead, the British manufacturing, technical services and distribution group, has caused a board reshuffle which brings non-executive director Bob Barton into the chief executive's seat, in place of Michael Noakes who has resigned. Barton, 52, had run Cold Storage, a Singapore-based food manufacturer, wholesaler and distributor, before returning in 1990 to the UK, after 29 years in South East Asia, to retire. 'I got bored with retirement in about five minutes,' he says, so he started to make a come-back as a 'corporate odd jobs man'. He had got to know Chia and his trading group Jack Chia-MPH some 15 years ago when Cold Storage entered into a joint merchandising agreement with the big Singapore MPH bookstore chain. Shortly after Barton returned to the UK, Chia invited him on to the Boustead board, first as an alternate, and then as a full non-executive director from last September. Noakes, meanwhile, was a former BTR troubleshooter who joined Boustead in 1987, well before Jack Chia-MPH had begun stake-building. The following year he masterminded two important acquisitions, but profits slumped in 1991 as the recession hit home. Boustead chairman Sir Thomas Macpherson noted yesterday: 'Noakes felt he had been connected with the pre-Jack Chia Boustead. And I cannot say he had established a total rapport with Chia. 'He was under no illusion that when Chia made a bid, that was likely to be the bell for him.' Barton acknowledges that Boustead's businesses are currently 'bitty' but says it is premature to suggest along what lines he will seek to develop the group. 'I will be surprised if you do not see the company making a quite significant acquisition in the next nine months,' adds Sir Thomas. Clement Chia, who had been an alternate director to his father Jack, now joins the board as a full non-executive director. Non-executive directors John Fleming and Dick Altham have resigned. ***** The next chairman of the British Film Institute, for an initial three-year term, is to be Jeremy Thomas, producer of films such as The Last Emperor and Bertolucci's The Sheltering Sky. He succeeds Sir Richard Attenborough who steps down in December after 11 years. Thomas has been in the film business since the late 1960s and produced his first film in 1974. He is currently working on a new Bertolucci film, Little Budda.</p>

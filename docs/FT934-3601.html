			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Observer: Market forced in Singapore Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, knows what market forces can do to his business. He is finding it increasingly hard to fill his cabinet with the best people because of the hefty salaries on offer in Singapore's high-growth private sector. Two of his ministers plan to quit within the next six months. To try to stop the political rot, his government has announced wide-ranging pay increases, starting with Goh's own basic salary. It's been increased by 20 per cent to SDollars 45,867 a month. When bonuses are taken into account, it rises to more than SDollars 60,000 per month. In US dollar terms this is equivalent to Dollars 450,000 a year, which is more than twice the salary of the president of the United States and four times what Britain's prime minister is paid. 'If you pay peanuts you'll get monkeys for your ministers,' says Goh.</p>

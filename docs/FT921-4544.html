			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Recovery put at heart of Tory election strategy AN INTENSE campaign to persuade voters that a fourth Conservative term is a prere-quisite for the economy's emergence from recession has been put at the centre of Mr John Major's general election strategy. As the prime minister trailed his manifesto at a weekend conference of party activists he stressed that the promised economic recovery depended on a Conservative victory. Among the pledges in the manifesto will be a fresh drive to regenerate the inner cities. His comments coincided with a signal from Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, that the Tories will make maximum capital during the campaign out of the past and present links of Labour MPs with leftwing causes. Mr Heseltine, a member of the government's election 'A-Team', said the Conservatives would emphasise repeatedly that any parliamentary majority secured by Mr Neil Kinnock would leave the Labour leader 'totally dependent on his party's extremist wing'. Since the start of the year Mr Major has been blaming the length of the recession on the world economic downturn. Senior colleagues said that approach had been judged a success. The aim now was to combine the voters' awareness of the worsening international outlook with a perception that the upturn in Britain was being delayed also by political uncertainty. Mr Major told the party's weekend local government conference that a Conservative victory was 'crucial' because: 'Britain is ready to come out of recession - and only a Conservative government can safely bring it out.' The prime minister added: 'What the country needs now, above all, is confidence . . . and if confidence in business is to grow, there's nothing that will make it grow faster than a Conservative victory at the general election.' That theme will be echoed throughout the four-week campaign proper which Mr Major is expected to launch when he asks the Queen to dissolve parliament after tomorrow's Budget. It will be used to answer Opposition charges that the government miscalculated the depth and duration of the recession and to move on to the offensive against Labour. A succession of senior ministers warned at the weekend that Labour's 'high-tax, high-spending, high-inflation' policies would wreck any prospect of an economic upturn. Mr Major confirmed that opportunity, choice, ownership and individual responsibility would be the principal themes underlying the manifesto which the Conservatives plan to publish early next week. He was joined by colleagues in emphasising that a commitment to improved public services would also be writ large in the Conservative prospectus. Mr Heseltine promised a large-scale initiative to bring together public and private finance to regenerate inner cities. His comments suggest that, after a difficult battle with cabinet colleagues, he has won the prime minister's approval to extend greatly the present City Challenge programme.</p>

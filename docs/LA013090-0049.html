			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL;  </P> <P> 49ERS TURNING NFL'S ATTEMPTS FOR PARITY INTO A PRIVATE PARTY  </P> <P> The two most remarkable things about the champion San Francisco 49ers are their  dominance in a parity era and their extraordinary improvement in just the past  year and a half.  </P> <P> Parity is a condition that the NFL strives for with the inverse draft and other  policies designed to cripple winners. And it works. Of the league's 28 teams,  17 are evenly matched, and 10 others are only a bit better or worse.  </P> <P> The 49ers alone stick out.  </P> <P> They are the dominant team that American sports fans have yearned for since  learning to love the old New York Yankees and Green Bay Packers.  </P> <P> But they weren't that good a year and a half ago. After 11 games in 1988, the  49ers were the shining symbol of NFL parity. They stood 6-5 that day. They had  just lost a 9-3 game to the Raiders, who were to finish 7-9.  </P> <P> Suddenly, and strangely, the 49ers started winning a week later, and they're  still at it, having won 24 of their past 27 games, including two Super Bowls.  </P> <P> If they are the best of all time, how could the 49ers so recently have stood  6-5 with the same personnel that clobbered Denver, 55-10, in Super Bowl XXIV?  </P> <P> Even against the Cincinnati Bengals in Super Bowl XXIII, quarterback Joe  Montana had to bring them from behind to win in the final seconds, 20-16.  </P> <P> The 49ers are a unique but mysterious success story.  </P> <P> After succeeding Bill Walsh as the 12th leader of the 49ers this season, George  Seifert instantly found that he inherited a team highly motivated by Walsh's  resignation.  </P> <P> Moreover, he had a cast of players handpicked by Walsh, who ranks as one of the  most shrewd talent scouts of his generation.  </P> <P> This season, accordingly, it couldn't have been too hard to coach the 49ers.  </P> <P> As Seifert said Monday: "Bill sort of forged this team. I'm satisfied just to  be part of it."  </P> <P> Next season's team, however, will belong more to Seifert. Of the 55 49ers now  under contract, he can protect only 37 under Plan B.  </P> <P> He will also have to come up with a new way to motivate the players. In  football, wanting to win is seldom motive enough.  </P> <P> "Usually, you've got to fear something," Montana said last week.  </P> <P> And this season, the 49ers feared that they might lose without Walsh.  Specifically, they feared what people would say about them as football players  if they lost without Walsh, who showed them how to win three Super Bowls.  </P> <P> Seifert's task will be at least twice as difficult next season. But he'll have  these two advantages over most other coaches:  </P> <P>  -- From Montana to Jerry Rice to Roger Craig to John Taylor to Tom Rathman to  Brent Jones, the 49er offense is so talented that it will be less dependent on  a motivational crutch than most of its opponents.  </P> <P>  -- The club's two work-ethic models, Craig and Ronnie Lott, are so diligent  that they inspire the whole organization.  </P> <P> The magazine and newspaper reporters who ignored Montana this winter in their  player-of-the-decade rankings should be required to stand in a corner until  they understand what the 49er quarterback accomplished in the 1980s.  </P> <P> A man who directs a pro football team through four Super Bowl-winning seasons  in nine years should win North American player of the decade by acclamation.  </P> <P> Sports Illustrated, which chose hockey's Wayne Gretzky, overlooked two things  about U.S. sports:  </P> <P>  -- In nationwide interest, football is far ahead of hockey.  </P> <P>  -- It requires more talent and courage to play quarterback well than to  succeed in any position in any other major team sport.  </P> <P> In baseball, for instance, it takes talent to pitch effectively -- but there  are no blitzers bearing down on the pitcher as he waits for a teammate to find  a clearing in the maze of a zone defense.  </P> <P> In basketball, pro players are doubtless better athletes, on the average, than  football, hockey or baseball players, but the full repertoire of an NBA player  is incomparably simpler than Montana's.  </P> <P> In hockey, Gretzky can fight back. In football, Montana has to stand there and  take it.  </P> <P> Three months ago, the Philadelphia Eagles sacked and bloodied Montana eight  times, but he got up to win, coming back with four touchdown passes in the  fourth quarter.  </P> <P> The question is whether there's a better athlete in any sport than Montana.  Although Bronco quarterback John Elway is a spectacular athlete, Montana has  better physical coordination, better balance and better agility. In physical  resources, Montana is arguably the better man.  </P> <P> Montana as an athlete is like a deer out there, or a dancer, or a leaf in the  wind -- graceful, fluid, effortless.  </P> <P> Gretzky is grand -- no arguments there -- but the leader of four Super Bowl  champions is the player of the decade.  </P> <P> What the Denver defense discovered Sunday is that there's no way to defend  against the four-time champions.  </P> <P> On their first touchdown drive of the second quarter, the 49ers, after opening  a 13-3 lead with passes, rested their wide receivers and gave the ball to  running backs Craig and Rathman on 13 of the 14 plays.  </P> <P> In the last two minutes of the first half, Montana, who had been clobbering  Denver with short passes, needed a big play to beat the clock, so he launched  one to Rice for a 38-yard touchdown.  </P> <P> When the Broncos rushed Montana with three defensive linemen, he could and did  wait a tick, then picked out the open target.  </P> <P> When they rushed him with three linemen and a linebacker, he hastily fired over  the middle, usually to Rathman.  </P> <P> The 49ers can play every kind of football. Although Rice, for example, is known  for his brilliance as a receiver, he showed the toughness to fight off one of  Denver's toughest hitters, safety Steve Atwater, when Atwater tried to knock  him down on the five-yard line on a touchdown play.  </P> <P> "I should have gone for the sure tackle," Atwater said afterward.  </P> <P> It was the most true to form of the 24 Super Bowl games -- the blowout that  most coaches and scouts expected -- but for the sports fans who appreciate  beauty and greatness in a football team, it was worth watching all the way.  With Walsh gone from the NFL, it may be years before there is another team that  can play on this level.  </P></p>

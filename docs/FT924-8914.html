			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Cambodian talks break down INTERNATIONAL talks on a peace accord for Cambodia broke down yesterday with the apparent failure to achieve agreement on disarming the four factions before general elections next May . 'Time is running out on the implementation of the Paris accords,' said Mr Ali Alatas, the Indonesian foreign minister, who co-chairs the Paris International Conference on Cambodia with Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister. 'I would be less than truthful if I did not say that we could not get full consensus on removing the obstacles to implementing the accord,' Mr Alitas said. The foremost objective at 'this rather serious stage of development' was to ensure the situation in Cambodia did not relapse into renewed fighting, he added. Mr Dumas said if no agreement was reached, the substance of the Paris agreement was in jeopardy. Both co-chairmen made clear the main obstacle was still the refusal of the Khmer Rouge to disarm. Other Cambodian factions, who have already laid down their weapons, are threatening to rearm unless the Maoist guerrillas step into line and allow UN peacekeepers into their zones. The Khmer Rouge signed the accord with the Vietnamese-installed government in October last year, ending almost 13 years of civil war but it has since violated the accord in almost every aspect. The three other Cambodian factions on the governing Supreme National Council (SNC) have co-operated with UN peacekeepers in the run-up to elections. They want the UN to abandon its disarmament plan, which they say would weaken them if the Khmer Rouge renewed its military offensive. Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen, has called for the expulsion of the Khmer Rouge from the SNC, which comprises leaders of the four factions and works with the UN. Khieu Samphan, a Khmer Rouge leader, joined yesterday's talks hosted by Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, chairman of the SNC. Also attending the meetings were the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, representatives from Indonesia, Japan, Thailand, Germany and Australia, which initiated the peace process adopted by the UN and the four Cambodian factions. They were joined by Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, who said: 'The situation in Cambodia is obviously still very fragile, but the fact that these talks are taking place in Beijing gives us all, I think, ground for optimism that a way can be found through the present difficulties.'</p>

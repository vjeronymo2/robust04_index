			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Concern over dividend cuts 10% off Raine shares THE SHARE price of Raine Industries fell by more than a tenth yesterday despite the announcement by the UK housebuilder of a 14 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.8m during the six months to end-December. A rise in group borrowings and concern over an uncovered interim dividend, which was maintained at 2p, sent Raine's share price tumbling by 12p to 101p, reducing its stock market value by Pounds 22.5m. Pre-tax profits would have fallen below last year's interim level of Pounds 2.4m if provisions for the six months to end-December 1991 of Pounds 3.4m, to cover losses on Raine's 2.8 per cent strategic stake in rival housebuilder YJ Lovell, had not been restated above the line. The company revealed that since January 1 there had been a substantial improvement in agreed sales and inquiries from would-be purchasers. However, Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the improvement had come too late to benefit the current financial year. He blamed wild fluctuations in currency and interest rates last autumn, which had hit housebuyers' confidence, and restricted sales during the run-up to Christmas. As a result, operating profits had fallen by 11.6 per cent during a first half which had included the first full six months of sales from Walter Lawrence. Earnings, after taking account of the 1991 restated provision, rose from 0.27p to 0.83p. In order to pay the maintained dividend the company will need to transfer Pounds 2.19m from reserves. Borrowings had risen since the end of June by Pounds 17m to Pounds 57m, equivalent to 47 per cent of shareholders' funds. Mr Parkin expected borrowings to get back to about Pounds 40m by the end of June. He added that the political and economic upheaval caused by sterling's withdrawal from the ERM had caused tremendous damage to the confidence of house buyers. First half sales of 654 were about 180 less than the group had expected. House prices and margins had remained under severe pressure, particularly in the south-east. However, Mr Parkin said that more recently there had been signs that prices had begun to stabilise, reflecting an increase in demand. The group's housing operation in California had continued to perform poorly and incurred a first half loss. UK contracting was also a difficult market with margins and orders under severe pressure. COMMENT Raine's share price last night was only slightly ahead of the 95p rights issues price in March last year when it acquired Walter Lawrence. The company, however, appears willing to raid reserves to maintain the final dividend provided the housing market does not dive again. It will need pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 17m in 1993-94 to provide sufficient earnings to maintain the dividend again. In the current financial year pre-tax profits are likely to be about Pounds 11m compared with a restated Pounds 10m for 1991-92. Borrowings, however, will be lower by June. The group's land costs, one of the lowest in the sector, will stand it in good stead as the housing market picks up. A prospective p/e approaching 30 for the current financial year suggests the shares are not going anywhere in the short term.</p>

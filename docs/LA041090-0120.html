			<p><P> April 10, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> LLOYD RETURNS TO TURN CHAPMAN'S SOFTBALL PROGRAM AROUND  </P> <P> Lisle Lloyd was faced with quite a task when he returned to Chapman College to  coach women's softball this season.  </P> <P> Not only was he taking over a team that finished last in the California  Collegiate Athletic Assn. the season before, but the college also had decided  to drop softball scholarships.  </P> <P> Lloyd, who was with Chapman for six years before being replaced by his  assistant, Gary Haning, last season, persuaded all 13 of the returning players  to stay -- though only the three currently on partial scholarships would  continue to receive funding.  </P> <P> So what has Lloyd been able to accomplish? Well, the Panthers (33-13, 6-6) are  ranked 14th in the NCAA's latest Division II poll and are third in the  conference behind Cal State Bakersfield (ranked No. 1) and Cal State Northridge  (No. 4). Chapman is ranked fourth in the Western Region, and four teams qualify  for the NCAA playoffs from each of the four regions.  </P> <P> Chapman is led by junior pitcher Jacki Blake, who has a 17-3 record, a 0.16  earned-run average and 112 strikeouts. Sophomore third baseman Sandy Olivas is  batting .466 with 12 home runs and an .831 slugging percentage.  </P> <P> "The team just really clicks this year. Everybody gets along with everybody,"  said Lloyd, who coached last season at Christ College Irvine.  </P> <P> Chapman's softball team isn't the only nationally ranked team on campus. The  men's tennis team is ranked third in the latest Division II poll and the  baseball team is ranked 16th.  </P> <P> The tennis team is led by the fifth-ranked doubles team of David Seline and  Darren Capik. The baseball team, led by first baseman-outfielder Mike Guiseffi  (hitting .459), will face UC Riverside, which is leading the conference, in a  three-game series beginning Thursday in Riverside.  </P> <P> You couldn't blame the Southern California College baseball team for feeling a  bit left out.  </P> <P> The Vanguards are tied for the lead in the Golden State Athletic Conference  with Cal Baptist (24-8, 9-3), which was ranked 12th in the National Assn. of  Intercollegiate Athletics poll released Monday, and Azusa Pacific (20-10, 9-3),  which was unranked but among teams receiving votes.  </P> <P> Southern California Christian (23-13-1, 9-3) received no mention at all in the  poll.  </P> <P> "I don't know who does the rankings, but we should be ranked," SCC Coach  Charlie Phillips said. "But that's OK. It's who's on top at the end that  matters."  </P> <P> SCC plays host to Cal Baptist today. Jim Dedrick, who has an 8-1 record and a  1.80 ERA, will start for SCC.  </P> <P> Christ College Irvine's baseball team has already won more than twice as many  games as it did last season, but Coach Scott Sarver says the Eagles' record  should be better.  </P> <P> "We've lost 11 one-run ballgames and that's terrible," Sarver said.  </P> <P> Last season, Sarver's first as coach, the Eagles were 6-33 and had to forfeit a  number of games because of a lack of players. This season, Sarver has filled  the squad with new recruits -- designated hitter Mike Johnson is the only  returning starter -- and Christ College is 16-18, 4-8 in conference. Saturday,  Christ College split a doubleheader with conference co-leader Azusa Pacific.  </P></p>

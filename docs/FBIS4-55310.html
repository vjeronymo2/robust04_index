			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the press spokesman of the Ministry of Industry, </F> Mining, and Energy Sources: "The Chrome Industry Has Prospects  for Development in the Market Economy"]    [Text] Representatives of the Independent Trade Union of  Miners in Albania, led by Asllan Myshku; the trade union of the  chrome corporation, led by Sabah Pata; the "Albkrom"  corporation; and the Ministry of Labor, Emigration, and Social  Assistance, along with the deputy minister of industry, mining,  and energy resources, Albert Brokaj, have held a meeting in  Bulqize, in the largest mining center of the chrome extraction  and processing industry.    During this meeting representatives of these trade unions,  which belong to the Union of Independent Trade Unions of  Albania, led by President Valer Xheka, brought up some important  issues related to the collective labor contract, which they said  was signed in a unilateral manner. They also raised issues  related to production, the opening up of new jobs, the financing  of new projects dealing with the development and future of the  chrome extraction and processing industry, the urgent need to  update technology, the creation of a joint enterprise, and  possibilities for privatization. They wanted to know why workers  in the corporation have not received 20-percent wage increases  in accordance with the government decision. They were concerned  about the sale of chrome, chrome concentrate, and ferrochrome,  about the consequences of the embargo [against Yugoslavia] in  the chrome extraction and processing industry and about the  satisfaction, as soon as possible, of demands for housing and  for the improvement of the miners' living and working  conditions.    The participants in the meeting raised a number of other  issues regarding the organization and management of work in the  corporation and stressed the need for a bitter struggle against  possible signs of corruption and for the further improvement of  social assistance.    In their response, Deputy Minister Brokaj and the  representatives of "Albkrom" and the Ministry of Labor,  Emigration, and Social Assistance said that the government has  drawn up a strategy for the chrome industry, which is a valuable  national asset, and, therefore, the government has demonstrated  and will continue to demonstrate concern for its continued  development. It was pointed out that this corporation has had a  higher hard currency income than any other corporation or  production unit in the country and that the greater part of this  income is used for the needs of the corporation. There are good  possibilities for increasing this income.    It was stressed that the ministry must seek compensation  from  the United Nations for the serious consequences which this  industry has suffered in the northeastern part of the country  because of the embargo. At the end of the meeting the trade  unions strongly stressed that a resolution containing the  following demands should be issued:    -- the collective contracts should be re-signed, with the  participation of all the trade unions, especially the trade  union of the corporation, which represents about 46 percent of  the employees;    -- the financial situation of the corporation should be  improved by forgiving the taxes for 1992 and 1993;    -- workers should receive a 26-percent wage increase;    -- negotiations for the creation of a joint enterprise  should  be accelerated;    -- additional funds should be sought from the government for  the construction of the Klosi traverse bank, the ramp, and shaft  No. 7, which are linked to the future of the mining industry;    -- the price of energy for the chrome corporation, the  largest consumer of energy, should be reduced;    -- the headquarters of the corporation should be transferred  to Bulqize and the retirement age for certain categories of  workers should be lowered.    The demands in this resolution will be presented to the  government. It was decided that the collective contract would be  re-signed on 15 April 1994 at the corporation's headquarters in  Tirana.</p>

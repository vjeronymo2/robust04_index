			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German banks gain on wages settlement RENEWED speculation that the Bundesbank might ease interest rates next week provided a backdrop to yesterday's activity, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT accelerated Thursday's uptrend, with specific strength in banks and construction stocks as the DAX index rose 25.44, or 1.5 per cent to 1,684.35, 0.4 per cent higher on a mixed week. Turnover rose from DM5.4bn to DM7.9bn, Deutsche Bank leading in DM1.35bn with both Dresdner and Commerzbank also making the top ten active stocks list. The sector liked the 3.3 per cent banking wage settlement, well below expectations according to Mr James Hyde of Williams de Broe; constructions saw good results from Bilfinger &amp; Berger, and Strabag. Banks were led higher by Commerzbank which has shown relative strength in advance of, and now after, its rights issue with a DM8 gain to DM283. Mr Hyde said that the underlying improvements in its costs and income were enough to offset its problematic loan book. Bilfinger put on DM50 to DM990 in a sector where 3 to 5 per cent gains were the order of the day, as the market was brought to see that the sector, this year at least, seemed recession proof. But it was a building materials company which really outperformed: Heidelberger Zement closed DM75, or nearly 8 per cent higher at DM1,050. Mr Michael Geiger of NatWest Securities reckons that the company could see a 50 per cent jump in net profits for 1992, with the elimination of losses in the US and the growth of its building additives business in the eastern German refurbishment market. PARIS closed higher but most of the activity was accounted for by technical trading as turnover rose to a hefty FFr4.7bn. The CAC-40 index closed 39.07 higher at 1,983.71, 2.4 per cent higher on the week. In the corporate sector, speculation that Pernod Ricard might be a takeover target, possibly for a UK group, pushed the shares up FFr19.50 or 5 per cent to FFr417.00, while Moulinex rose FFr5.10 to FFr100.10 on reports that it might be seeking a partner. In spite of a US broker's downgrade, Elf rose FFr10.70 to FFr377.40 on firmer oil prices while financials all gained on hopes for lower interest rates with Societe Generale moving up FFr21 to FFr645. MILAN turned its attention to insurance stocks as the cabinet discussed plans for pension funds. Generali fixed L550 higher at L34,960, before rising to L35,550 after hours. RAS added L974 to L24,883 while Alleanza gained L792 or 5.2 per cent to L16,112. The Comit index rose 6.41 to 513.21 or 2 per cent on the week, refusing to be deflected by the growing political scandal or Moody's decision to put the country's foreign debt rating under review for a possible downgrade. Montedison dipped L31 to L1,219 with analysts noting that news of the investigation of its former chairman Mr Raul Gardini would have no impact on the company. Sme gained L273 to L6,261 in response to Thursday's announcement by Iri, the state holding company, of criteria for the food group's flotation. ZURICH's SMI index rose 38.1, or 1.8 per cent to 2,099.4, down 0.8 per cent on the week. After the bank's 1992 results, UBS bearers rose SFr8 to SFr939 in active trade. Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich said that while the UBS profits were at the lower end of expectations, the SFr2 a share rise in dividend was a positive move and that investors were relieved that no rights issue had been announced. The chemicals sector, under heavy pressure early in the week, bounced back on the view that prices had fallen too far. Ciba-Geigy rose SFr10 to SFr635, Roche added SFr100 to SFr3,950 francs, and Sandoz put on SFr50 to SFr2,960. MADRID rallied in thin volume, the general index rising 4.89, or more than 2 per cent to 232.89 to close slightly down on the week. Ms Anna MacDonald, who heads Spanish research at Baring Securities, said that people had accepted that depreciation of the peseta within the ERM was inevitable, but that they were staying in equities for the lower interest rates which should be the corollary. STOCKHOLM gained on falling domestic interest rates, the Affarsvarlden General index rising 10.9 to 1,000.1 for a week's gain of 0.8 per cent. Turnover fell back to SKr807m from Thursday's SKr973m. Astra managed to restore some of the losses made earlier in the week after the market interpreted its results as disappointing. The B shares put on SKr24 to SKr685, still 1.3 per cent lower on the week. Handelsbanken A rose SKr4 to a new year's high of SKr69 while the B's were flat at SKr63.50.  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- February 26                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             Open        10.30        11.00        12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1131.72      1132.99      1134.62      1137.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1186.81      1189.29      1190.01      1194.02  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00        14.00        15.00        Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100     1137.82      1139.35      1139.58      1139.80 FT-SE Eurotrack 200     1193.63      1195.48      1194.80      1194.07  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                         Feb 25    Feb 24    Feb 23    Feb 22    Feb 19  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1125.06   1116.05   1119.41   1132.76   1136.60 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1178.13   1172.14   1178.69   1190.84   1191.09  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1140.22; 200 - 1195.75 Low/day: 100 - 1131.27  200 - 1186.18.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

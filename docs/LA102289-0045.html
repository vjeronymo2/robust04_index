			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STUPID ADVERTISING IS NO LONGER THE EXCEPTION  </P> <P> As a retired advertising agency executive, I found the article ("Tacky Ads: A  Low Road to Attention," Sept. 5) only scratched the surface of the growing  amount of stupid advertising being thrown at the public.  </P> <P> One area alone -- automobile promotion -- is a disgrace. Cars jump across  creeks with wheels and doors falling off then get back in place while some  squirt babbles about the qualities of the car. Cars dash through dust storms so  dense that the car can hardly be seen. As many as a dozen adults and children  get out of a car then back into it. A line of cars, bumper to bumper, race  around turns, sometimes on the wrong side of the road. What they are trying to  prove is beyond me.  </P> <P> If there was a prize for wasting the most amount of advertising money it would  be hard to decide which agency or client should receive it. Thank goodness I am  no longer in the business. And I am ashamed to admit that I ever was, based on  what is currently being produced.  </P> <P> Why don't you blast these upstart "advertising geniuses" and urge that they go  back to kindergarten before they totally ruin what used to be a respectable  business?  </P> <P> JACK WEST  </P> <P> Palos Verdes  </P></p>

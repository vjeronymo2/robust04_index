			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading The near month Footsie futures contract broke through two resistance levels after a squeeze sent it sharply ahead in thin trading, writes Joel Kibazo. The September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 3,125 and the first hour was marked by inactivity. However, a buying order from a US dealer that was given to three UK houses for execution enlivened an otherwise dull market and brought a mid-morning squeeze That sharp upward movement saw the contract break through the 3,033 and 3,046 resistance levels to reach the day's high of 3,055. September relinquished some of the earlier gains in the afternoon as dealers turned their attention to the weakness in gilts and the poor opening on Wall Street. The contract held on to a strong premium to cash for most of the session which encouraged arbitrage trading It closed at 3,145, at a 26 point premium to cash. Volume at 10,155 lots remained low. In traded options, an equipment breakdown left many dealers unable to update prices for several hours in the first part of the session. Turnover was 19,226 contract, only slightly above the previous total, with 6,502 lots dealt in the FT-SE 100 option and 2,089 in the Euro FT-SE option. Today sees the expiry of the July series stock options.</p>

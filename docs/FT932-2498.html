			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Letter: First woman PM, but others have western roots Sir, While Kim Campbell can certainly lay claim to being the first woman to become prime minister of Canada, she is not 'the first with western roots since Mr John Diefenbaker in the late 1950s' ('Canadian Tories take gamble on Campbell', June 15). Mr John Turner, defeated by Mr Brian Mulroney in 1984, had a rather weak claim to western roots: he won a seat in the House of Commons in a Vancouver by-election, after winning the leadership of the Liberal party and becoming prime minister, and lived in that city for a time in his youth. His term of office was the shortest in Canadian history. Mr Joe Clark has a genuine claim to western origins as the most famous son of High River, Alberta, and as MP for Yellowhead (Alberta) since the early 1970s. His term in office was only slightly longer than Mr Turner's: he formed a minority government after the 1979 election but lost another to Mr Pierre Trudeau several months later. James Mills, 173 quai de Valmy, 75010 Paris, France</p>

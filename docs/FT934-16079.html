			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Lamont urges tough public spending cuts MR NORMAN LAMONT, the former chancellor, yesterday demanded a cut in public spending, and warned the government that tax increases would cost it the next general election. Mr Lamont, who was sacked in May by Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the government must take 'unpalatable decisions' on spending in its first two years in office. 'Two per cent of (spending) programmes across the board would give us over Pounds 5bn,' he said. 'Does anyone in government really believe that programmes cannot be cut across the board by 2 percentage points? 'We are the party of low taxation, of limited government and free enterprise. That and that alone is the path that will lead our party to its fifth election victory.' Mr Lamont's comments, at a meeting organised by the Bow Group, amounted to a determined bid for leadership of the rightwing backbenchers who are concerned about the prospect of Budget tax increases. He challenged Mr Major's description of Baroness Thatcher's government as 'the golden age that never was', saying Britain was 'strengthened immeasurably' in the 1980s by 'the most successful government since the war'. He also called for an independent central bank and tough action on inflation, reductions in capital gains tax and a further round of privatisation, including Royal Mail. Mr Lamont said the government deficit was likely to be less than the projected Pounds 50bn, but warned that the structural deficit would not be eradicated by economic recovery. He said tax increases in the last Budget, in March, were necessary to convince the financial markets that the government was serious about controlling the public finances. But the size of the increase, which raised 12.5 per cent more revenue than Sir Geoffrey Howe's 1981 Budget, ruled out further tax rises. 'While it is possible to have such a large tax-raising Budget once a decade, it is completely impossible to have two in the space of nine months,' he said. Mr Lamont said the government must confront those who were 'accustomed to large increases in spending every year. The party, the government and the country must understand that those days are over.' He also attacked the refusal by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, to reopen negotiations on next year's Pounds 253bn public spending total, agreed when Mr Lamont was chancellor. 'That will not do for a tax-cutting party. High taxes to finance high spending are not the Conservative way,' he said. He put forward a list of measures to cut spending, including taxing invalidity benefits, equalising state pensions at 65, moving the pension age to 67, and contracting out unemployment and invalidity benefits. Mr Lamont said the government must 'look at' these policies if the party was to take control of public spending. 'We Conservatives talk a lot about reducing what the government does. But are we up to it?' he said.</p>

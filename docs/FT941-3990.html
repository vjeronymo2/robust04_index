			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / Lawrence's victory lifts Labor Ms Carmen Lawrence, the former premier of Western Australia who is tipped for high office in the Australian Labor party, is due in Canberra today having won a decisive victory in a Fremantle by-election at the weekend. Ms Lawrence received 59 per cent of the votes, a swing of 1 per cent towards the ALP. The result is seen as a personal triumph for Ms Lawrence given the unpopularity of the Labor party in Western Australia. The Fremantle seat was previously held by Mr John Dawkins, former federal treasurer, who has left politics. Ms Lawrence is likely to be given ministerial responsibilities almost immediately.</p>

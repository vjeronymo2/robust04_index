			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Emerging Markets This Week: A growing trend towards Africa - The Emerging Investor Will 1994 be Africa's year, the year in which international investors finally get the 'virgin' continent into their sights? Certainly there is a growing body of opinion, both in Africa and beyond, that believes this will be the case. Indeed, it can be argued that this trend is already under way. On the Johannesburg Stock Exchange foreigners were prominent throughout 1993, initially in the gold and bond markets and later as buyers of industrial stocks too. Figures supplied by Barings Securities show that for the foreign investor, who benefited from a 13.3 per cent strengthening in the financial rand, the investment currency for overseas investors, the overall index rose by 63.4 per cent, the gold index by 184.1 per cent and the industrial index by 41 per cent. They have also been evident in Botswana, while foreign buying on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange between late June and December was enough to cause the Industrial index to more than double. Mr Miles Morland of Blakeney Management, the London-based adviser to many of the world's largest emerging market funds, is one who believes that the continent's time has come. 'Looking at Africa is very much at the top of their (emerging market funds) agenda. There is a terrific willingness to believe in the African story.' This can be traced to three important structural changes. Clearly the catalytic event has been South Africa's rehabilitation as a respectable investment destination. This has caused great excitement in the US and the re-examination of the JSE has inevitably rebounded to the benefit of other regional markets. Without the JSE, it would be doubtful how much attention emerging market investors would devote to the other markets. Since Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, called for an end to financial sanctions against South Africa in September, there has been a veritable stampede of US visitors to Johannesburg. Significant investment flows have followed and the outlook for 1994 appears even more cheery. Mr Morland reckons that the first half of 1994 will see at least five South Africa or Southern Africa funds launched. Taken together with other African funds and country funds, he believes there will be at least 10 funds channelling money into South Africa next year. The second important change concerns Africa itself. If the 1960s saw the political winds of change blow through the continent, then the 1990s are witnessing some equivalent economic changes as governments increasingly embrace market economics after costly socialist experiments. The catalyst for these changes has been the end of the cold war, meaning no more eastern European bloc hand-outs, and the inexorable impoverishment of African economies through deteriorating terms of trade and poor economic management. Now, as Mr Morland comments, 'You either eat at the IMF's table, or you don't eat at all.' This has led to a huge shift in economic orientation, including a more favourable outlook towards equity markets. In 1983, for example, Mr Bernard Chidzero, the Zimbabwe finance minister, was able to extravagantly denounce the ZSE as 'the prostitute of the economy'. Ten years later the same Mr Chidzero used his budget to introduce reforms aimed at encouraging the development of the ZSE: foreign investors being allowed to buy up to 25 per cent of companies listed on the ZSE; reductions in capital gains tax on share market investment to 10 per cent from 30 per cent and the withholding tax on dividends declared by quoted companies to 15 per cent from 20 per cent. The final change concerns the burgeoning emerging market movement, particularly in the US, with an increasing portion of assets earmarked for emerging markets and offshore investment. A November survey by the US firm Kleiman International Consultants found that international institutional investment in emerging markets had risen by 3 per cent to 13 per cent of international funds in 1993, with allocation over the past five years rising more than five-fold. Even within this trend, Africa has a lot of catching up to do. A recent survey by Micropal of global emerging market funds found that the 54 largest of these funds had invested only about Dollars 40m out of Dollars 11.5bn (0.35 per cent). Clearly, if Africa in general and South Africa in particular becomes a focus for emerging market funds, then this in itself will be good reason to be invested there. To this rosy scenario, however, some cautionary caveats about Africa must be entered. Firstly, even by emerging market standards, Africa is an unusual beast. On the one hand, the JSE with a market capitalisation of about Dollars 105bn is much larger than the Dollars 20-Dollars 60bn average for emerging markets. On the other hand, most of the other African markets - Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe (with Zambia, Malawi, Uganda and Tanzania all on the point of opening) - are minuscule. A recent survey by Mr Michel ZhuParris of Morgan Stanley Asset Management found that between them Africa's newly emerging markets had only 12 liquid stocks with market capitalisations greater than Dollars 100m (with seven of these trading in Morocco). Second, although Africa is fairly cheap compared with many world markets, it has been cheap for a long time and for good reason. A major factor here is that investors are, with the exception of the Botswana pula, investing in very weak, devaluing currencies. Another problem is that the markets are shallow, illiquid and small. Also, in some cases, not the JSE, there is a dearth of domestic investors to piggyback on which can cause liquidity problems. Mr Mark Tunmer, chairman of the ZSE, comments: 'Our big problem is that we've got all the demand but nothing to sell.' He reckons that if the ZSE had been able to satisfy demand, foreign flows would have been four to five times larger. This problem has also affected the JSE, where buyers have had to get used to the idea that fulfilling a big order can take more than a week. These liquidity problems should, however, ease over time. If markets do enjoy a bull run this will stimulate new issues and rights issues, thereby increasing the amount of stock in circulation. A further factor to consider is that African markets are much more dependent on commodity prices and politicians than many other emerging markets. Investors not fully aware of developments could well burn their fingers. On the commodity front, developments are good. Important commodities like gold, cocoa and coffee have broken out of long bear cycles. The politicians may be behaving better, but in some cases the depth of commitment to financial discipline and good government remains to be tested. In the final analysis, what happens in South Africa will probably determine the extent to which other regional markets flourish.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      TEN BEST PERFORMING STOCKS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Friday      Week on week change Stock                    Country      close          Dollars      %  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Banco Do Brasil (Pfd)     Brazil       0.02           0.01     67.6 Eczacibasi Ilac           Turkey       1.11           0.38     53.2 Kordosa                   Turkey       0.98           0.32     49.3 Banco Itau (Pfd)          Brazil       0.30           0.09     47.4 Alarko Holding            Turkey       2.44           0.76     45.4 Eczacibasi Yatirim        Turkey       0.95           0.26     38.9 Banco Bradesco (Pfd)      Brazil       0.02           0.01     36.9 Arcelik                   Turkey       1.90           0.42     28.4 Turk Demir Dokum          Turkey       1.52           0.29     23.3 Brisa                     Turkey       2.22           0.41     22.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

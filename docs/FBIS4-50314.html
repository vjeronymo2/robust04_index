			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Li Tieying, member of the CPC Central Committee </F> Political Bureau, state councilor, and minister of the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy at the 1994 China  Beijing International High-Level Economic Forum, 11 May 1994:  "Economic Structural Reform and Establishment of the System of a  Socialist Market Economy in China"]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen:    The 1994 China Beijing International High-Level Economic  Forum has opened today. This high-level international economic  forum, co-sponsored by the Chinese State Commission for  Restructuring Economic Systems [SCRES] and THE INTERNATIONAL  HERALD TRIBUNE, has won support from many leading world famous  enterprises. Here, on behalf of the Chinese Government, I would  like to extend a warm welcome to our friends from political,  economic, and academic circles of various countries, and express  our heartfelt thanks to the entrepreneurs who have supported  this forum!    The Chinese Government attaches great importance to this  forum. The persons in charge of some departments of the State  Council will come and apprise you of relevant information.  China's economists, scholars, and entrepreneurs are also highly  interested in this meeting. We hope that it will help the  international community understand more about China's reform and  opening process, especially the theory and practice of a  socialist market economy, and contribute to smooth operation of  China's reform and opening up; and also help China to acquire a  further understanding of the world and absorb and draw on the  experience of success of other countries. This is the first time  that such a high-level international economic forum has ever  been held in Beijing. I hope such international economic forums  can be held regularly in the future.    Now, I would like to brief you on the progress and  achievements of reform and opening up in China and the process  of establishing a system of socialist market economy.  <H5>  1. Process and Achievements of Reform and Opening Up in China </H5>   1.1 Process of reform in China.    In December 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC  Central Committee decided to shift the focus of its work to  economic construction and pursue the policy of reform and  opening up. Over the past 15 years, following the road of  building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China has,  roughly speaking, gone through three phases in its extensive and  profound economic structural reforms.    1.1.1 The first phase (December 1978 -- September 1984).  The focus of the reform was on rural areas, mobilizing peasant  enthusiasm in promoting the production of commodities by  developing various forms of the contract responsibility system  on a household basis with remuneration linked to output. In  urban areas, the main operation was experimentation on  enterprise reforms, expanding the independent decisionmaking  powers of enterprises. In the meantime, the development of  special economic zones [SEZs] began and 14 port cities on the  coast were opened.    1.1.2 The second phase (October 1984 -- December 1991). The  focus of the reform shifted to urban areas. Centering around  the task of strengthening the vitality of enterprises, market  building, price reform, and reform of the macro management  system were pushed forward in a coordinated way. Urban and  rural reforms, as well as reforms of the scientific and  technological, educational, and political systems unfolded  across the board. Opening up was further expanded. Hainan SEZ  was established. The Zhu Jiang delta, Chang Jiang delta, and  South Fujian triangle were opened.    1.1.3 The third phase (January 1992 -- 2000). China's  reform entered the new stage of building a socialist market  economic system. As far as reforms are concerned, the focus is  switching from breaking the old systems to establishing new  systems and from policy adjustments to structural innovations,  single reforms are being replaced by comprehensive and  integrated reforms, and the endeavor to achieve breakthroughs at  important points is moving toward the integration of both  overall advancement and key breakthroughs. Opening up is  heading into unprecedented scope and depth. One may well say  that the coming few years are a crucial period for the final  replacement of the system of planned economy with the system of  a socialist market economy in China.    1.2 The 15-year reform and opening up have brought  about profound changes to economic structural patterns and  operational mechanisms in China.    --A new pattern has taken shape in which public ownership  reigns and a variety of economic sectors, including state,  collective, individual, private, and foreign-funded economies  coexist, compete on equal footing, and seek common development.  At present, state industry accounts for 48.3 percent of the  total industrial output value, collective industry accounts for  38.2 percent, and individual, private, and foreign-funded  industries 13.5 percent. Of the total retail volume of  commodities, state commerce accounts for 41.3 percent,  collective commerce 27.9 percent, and joint-venture, individual,  and private commerce 30.8 percent. The rapid development of  non-state-owned economies has injected life force and vitality  into China's economy.    --Efforts have been made to deepen the reform of state  enterprises continuously and to explore specific ways to  establish a modern enterprise system. State enterprises are  changing their identity to become independent legal entities and  subjects of market competition. State enterprises' operational  decisionmaking powers have expanded. Various forms of a  contract operational responsibility system have been introduced.  A large number of enterprise groups have been developed. The  merger, leasing, and auctioning off of enterprises have been  promoted. Deep-level reforms aimed at changing operational  mechanisms have been conducted. To find effective forms into  which public ownership can be realized, various types of  experiments on the joint-stock system in selected organizations  have been conducted. At present, the number of enterprises  under various types of experimentation with joint-stock systems  in China has reached 11,500. A batch of state- owned large and  medium-sized enterprises are being organized to accommodate  experiments on the establishment of a modern enterprise system.    --Efforts have been made to cultivate the market system and  push ahead with price reform, bringing enormous changes to the  formative mechanism of prices and continuously strengthening the  role of market mechanisms. Energetic efforts have been made to  develop various kinds of retail and wholesale markets and  cultivate production element markets, including capital, real  estate, labor, and technical and information markets. As a  result of the 15-year evolutionary price reform, today the  prices of over 80 percent of production means, over 85 percent  of agricultural products, and over 95 percent of industrial  consumer goods have been decontrolled. The prices of production  elements are in the process of marketization and the market  mechanism is playing an ever expanding role in the disposition  of resources.    --Macroregulation and control by the state are changing from  direct control exercised with administrative mandates to  indirect regulation and control which mainly employ economic and  legal means. Before 1978, mandatory plans accounted for over 95  percent of the total industrial output value, but now this has  dropped to 5 percent. The amount of means of production under  unified distribution by the state and the amount of commodities  purchased under state plans have also greatly decreased. With  the on-going reforms in the planning, investment, financial, and  banking systems, taxs, interest, and exchange rates and the  money supply have gradually come to serve as chief means of  macroregulation and control.    --A distribution pattern has taken shape in which  distribution according to work dominates and is combined with a  variety of other modes of distribution. The establishment of a  new social security system has also made a start. The method of  linking total payroll to economic efficiency and linking  employee remunerations to personal contributions at work has  been extensively adopted among state-owned enterprises. Some  progress has also been made in the reform of employee pension,  unemployment, medical, and industrial injury insurance, and  housing systems.    --Responsibility systems, primarily the contract  responsibility system on a household basis with remuneration  linked to output, and the two-tier management system combining  unification and division have been implemented extensively in  China's rural areas. The adjustment of the prices of  agricultural products and adjustments in the purchasing and  marketing systems have aroused peasant enthusiasm. China's  grain output increased from 300 million metric tons in 1978 to  456 million metric tons in 1993. China has been feeding 22  percent of the world population with 7 percent of the world's  arable land. By the end of 1993, 23.21 million township and  town enterprises had been set up in rural areas, absorbing 110  million members of rural surplus labor, which has greatly  contributed to the development of rural economy and increased  peasant income.    1.3 The reform and opening up have pushed China's  economy into a fast growth phase.    The 15-year reform and opening up have greatly emancipated  and developed productive forces, mobilized people's initiative  and creativity, and pushed China's economy up a big step.    --Economic growth has accelerated and overall national  strength has increased. The average annual growth rate between  1978 and 1993 was 9 percent. In 1992 and 1993 in particular,  the GDP [as published] increased over the previous years by 12.8  percent and 13.4 percent respectively. The rankings of the  output of some of China's major industrial and agricultural  products in the world have been significantly upgraded, and  China's overall national strength has gone up to 10th position.    --The industrial structure has undergone some change and  the importance of tertiary industry has incresed. Comparing the  year 1993 to 1978 when the reform began, the proportions of  three industries in the GNP went through the following changes:  The proportion of primary industry dropped from 28.4 percent to  21.2 percent, that of secondary industry rose from 48.6 percent  to 51.8 percent, and that of tertiary industry rose from 23  percent to 27 percent, in which communications and posts and  telecommunications saw significant development.    --Brisk markets and an active internal trade have satisfied  the growing material and cultural needs of urban and rural  residents. The average annual growth rate of the total retail  volume of commodities nationwide rose from 8 percent before the  reform and opening up to 14.5 percent after the reform and  opening up began. In 1993, the growth was 26.1 percent over the  previous year.    1.4 A new pattern has formed in opening up and  outstanding achievements have been made in foreign economic  relations and trade.    --A new multilevel, all-dimensional, and multimodal pattern  of opening up has been preliminarily formed. So far, five SEZs,  32 economic and technological development zones, and 52  state-level high and new-technology development zones have been  set up. There are over 900 cities and counties in China that  are open to the outside world. The opening up has started to  spread from primary and secondary industries to tertiary  industry. Improvements have been made in both the soft and the  hard environments for investment. The service systems oriented  to foreign-funded enterprises and laws and ordinances for  transactions with other countries have been constantly improving.    --Gratifying results have been made in foreign trade.  China's total import and export volume rose from $20.64 billion  in 1978 to $195.8 billion in 1993, representing an increase of  8.5 times, and the average annual growth rate was 16.2 percent.  In 1993, China's total foreign trade volume ranked 11th in the  world. The import and export volume of China now takes up 35  percent of the country's GNP, making China one of the most open  countries in the world.    --China has been showing a strong momentum of absorption and  utilization of foreign capital. From 1979 to 1993, China  approved a total of 174,000 foreign-invested projects and the  actual input made by foreign investors totaled $63.9 billion.  In 1993 alone, 83,000 projects of foreign investment were  approved with the amount of foreign capital utilized being  $25.76 billion.    --China's opening up has shifted from the previous practice  of one-way introduction to two-way exchange. China encourages  enterprises with adequate strength to make investments and set  up enterprises abroad. By 1993, 4,497 Chinese enterprises had  been set up in over 120 countries and regions, with $5.16  billion of investment made by Chinese investors.    1.5 People's living standards have been improving by  the year and so has their quality of life.    Since the reform and opening up began 15 years ago, the  living standards of urban and rural residents have greatly  improved. Peasant per-capita income per annum rose from 134 yuan  in 1978 to 921 yuan in 1993; the per-capita wage of workers in  cities and towns rose from 615 yuan in 1978 to 3,236 yuan in  1993. Price hikes factored in, these two increases represent an  average annual growth of 7 percent and 5 percent respectively.  Housing conditions of urban and rural residents have improved.  The per-capita living space in urban areas increased from 3.6  square meters in 1978 to 8 square meters in 1993; and that in  rural areas from 8.1 square meters to 19 square meters. The  balance of saving deposits of urban and rural residents  increased from 21.06 billion yuan in 1978 to 1.4764 trillion  yuan in 1993. The number of students on campus in institutions  of higher learning rose from 856,000 in 1978 to 4.4 million in  1993. These enormous changes indicate that the road of  expanding market regulation and reinforcing the role of market  mechanisms that China has followed in its reform and opening up  in the past 15 years is correct and China's economic structural  reform has stood on a new starting point.    2. The Basic Experience of China's Economic  Restructuring    2.1 The theoretical development of China's economic  restructuring.    China's economic restructuring is the self-development and  perfection of the socialist system and is an unprecedented  theoretical exploration and bold practice. The breakthrough in  reform theories and progress in practice run through the whole  process of reform and opening up.    Prior to reform and opening up, China implemented a highly  centralized planned economy marked by mandatory planning. To  begin with, we proposed the principle of "taking the planned  economy as the mainstay and supplementing it with market  regulation" in 1979 and then set the goal of socialist planned  commodity economy in 1984. We went further in 1992 by  explicitly saying that the goal of China's economic  restructuring was to establish a socialist market economic  system. This is the most important breakthrough in the theory  of China's economic restructuring and an innovative advance in  Marxist political economics, and has set the goal and direction  for China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping's economic  thinking has played a key role in the significant breakthrough  in the theory and practices of China's economic restructuring.    2.2 Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking greatly  contributes to China's reform and opening up.    Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect of China's reform and  opening up and modernization, founded the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics and laid out a grand  blueprint for China's reform and opening up. A series of  expositions by him on reform and opening up and the  establishment of a socialist market economy occupy an extremely  important position. He pointed out that China is still at the  initial stage of socialism. The nature of socialism is to  liberate and develop productive forces and the way to do so is  reform and opening up. He laid stress on emancipating the mind,  seeking truth from facts, taking our own path without  mechanically copying foreign examples, respecting the innovative  spirit of the masses, and proceeding in everything from China's  actual situation. He pointed out that both planning and the  market are economic means and that a socialist country can also  develop a market economy. He advocated that in the practice of  reform, we "need not argue with one another but should make  experiments and blaze new trails in a bold manner" and that we  verify the truth by practice. He has also stressed time and  again that we should boldly absorb and draw on all achievements  created in human civilizations, including all advanced forms of  management and operation of developed capitalist countries which  reflect the laws of modern socialized production.    Deng Xiaoping's economic thinking, which clearly shows the  direction of China's reform and opening up, is a huge impetus  for China's reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping has made  historic contributions to China's reform and opening up.    2.3 The basic experience of China's economic  restructuring.    --Sticking to economic development as the central task and  taking as the fundamental socialist task the liberation and  development of productive forces through reform and opening up.  The practice of China's reform proves that only by changing  once and for all the economic structure that restricts the  development of productive forces and by establishing a socialist  market economic structure which is full of vitality and vigor  can we promote the development of productive forces.    --In the course of reform and opening up, we should absorb  and use the successful experiences of other countries and, more  importantly, seek truth from facts and find a new path with  Chinese characteristics in the course of practice. In reform  and opening up, we stick to the viewpoint that practice comes  first and judge the success or failure of everything mainly by  adhering to the criterion of whether it is beneficial to  promoting productive forces, beneficial to reinforcing the  comprehensive national strength of our socialist country, and  beneficial to enhancing the living standards of the people.    --Using planning and the market as the means to regulate the  economy, fostering and developing a socialist market system, and  bringing into full play the fundamental role of market  mechanisms in the allocation of resources. In the practice over  the past 15 years, we have always stuck to market-oriented  reforms, removed price controls, fostered and established a  market system, made sound the market order and laws and  regulations for fair competition, brought into play the role of  market mechanisms, thus promoting the smooth reform of the  entire economic structure.    --Correctly handling the relationships between reform,  development, and stability, and seizing the opportunity to  quicken the change from the old structure to the new structure  so that the national economy can be further enhanced at  intervals of several years. Reform and opening up are the drive  for development and development is the foundation for social  stability and long-term national peace, and maintaining social  stability is an indispensable condition for developing the  economy and smoothly proceeding with reform.    --Sticking to the integration of reform at home and opening  to the outside world so that they promote each other and benefit  each other. Opening to the outside world is China's basic  national policy which will remain unchanged for a long time to  come.    Opening to the outside world, attracting capital and  advanced technology from abroad, learning foreign advanced  management experiences, and spurring China's enterprises to  participate in competition in the international market have  effectively promoted the deepening of reform at home and  economic development.  <H5>  3. The Goal of China's Economic Development and the Basic </H5> Framework of a Socialist Market Economic Structure    3.1 The goal of economic development.    In 1980, China set the three-step strategic goal for  socialist modernization. The first step is that China will  double its GNP in approximately a decade, thus basically  resolving the problem of food and clothing for the people. The  second step is that it will double its GNP again by the end of  this century so that the people will be able to lead a  comparatively comfortable life. The third step is that by the  middle of the next century, China will be able to catch up with  or overtake the level of medium-developed countries so that the  people will be better off. The first step was already achieved  in 1988. In light of China's current development, the second  step can be achieved ahead of time. In order to achieve the  second-step and third-step strategic goal, it is necessary to  quicken the establishment of a new socialist market economic  structure so that China's economy can develop in a sustained,  rapid, and healthy way.    3.2 The basic framework of a socialist market economic  structure.    The economic structure we are now establishing is an  economic  structure in which public ownership and a market economy are  inherently united, which is under the active and effective  macroeconomic control of the State, the market mechanisms of  which play an essential role in allocating resources, and which  can combine efficiency and equality to high standards. The goal  of establishing a new structure through reform is to liberate  and develop productive forces to the greatest extent, reinforce  comprehensive national strength, and enhance the people's living  standards. The basic framework is:    3.2.1 Transforming the management mechanism of state-owned  enterprises and establishing a modern enterprise system. It is  necessary to stick to the principle of taking the publicly owned  sector as the mainstay while striving for a simultaneous  development of all economic sectors, further transform the  management mechanism of state-owned enterprises, and establish a  modern enterprise system which meets the requirements of the  market economy and in which property rights as well as the  rights and responsibilities of enterprises are clearly defined,  government administration and enterprise management are  separated, and scientific management is established.  Establishing a modern enterprise system is a necessary  requirement for developing large-scale socialized production and  the market economy. It is the direction for the reform of  China's state-owned enterprises as well as an effective form of  achieving the integration of public ownership and the market  economy.    3.2.2 Fostering and developing a market system and  establishing a mechanism by which prices are mainly formed by  the market. It is necessary to establish a nationwide  integrated and open market system to closely combine the urban  market with the rural market, link the domestic market with the  international market, and create a fair environment for  competition to optimize the allocation of resources. On the  precondition of maintaining the relative stability of the  general level of prices, we should remove price controls from  competitive commodities and services, cancel the two-tier  pricing system for the means of production, quicken the process  of subjecting the prices of production elements to the market,  and establish a mechanism by which prices are mainly set by the  market.    3.2.3 Transforming the government's functions and  establishing a sound macroeconomic control system. It is  necessary to further transform government organizations,  transform government functions in economic management, and  establish a macroeconomic control system in which the national  economy is managed mainly through economic, legal, and necessary  administrative means. We should quicken the reform of the  fiscal and tax, banking, and planned investment systems, and  ensure the healthy operation of the national economy through  effective macroeconomic control.    3.2.4 Establishing a rational income distribution system and  a social security system. It is necessary to stick to a system  that takes the principle of "to each according to his work" as  its mainstay and allows the coexistence of many forms of  distribution and to embody the principle of giving priority to  efficiency and taking fairness into account. We should  introduce competitive mechanisms, smash egalitarianism, and  stick to encouraging some localities and people to become  prosperous first, and then gradually attaining common  prosperity. We should establish a multilayer and multiform  social security system which embraces social insurance, social  relief, social welfare, solace and settlement, social mutual  help, and personal savings and accumulation security. The level  of social security must be in keeping with China's national  conditions.    3.2.5 Stabilizing the basic productive relationships in  rural areas and establishing a rural economic structure suited  to the socialist market economy. We should stick to contract  responsibility systems, mainly the one on a household basis with  remuneration linked to output, and the two-tier management  system combining unification and division. We should develop  the rural socialized service system and promote the  specialization, commercialization, and socialization of  agriculture. On the precondition of maintaining the steady  growth of such basic agricultural products as grain and cotton,  we will readjust the rural industrial structure and quicken the  development of township and town enterprises and other  nonagricultural sectors, offering more employment opportunities  for the surplus rural work force.    3.2.6 Deepening the reform of the foreign trade structure  and opening wider to the outside world. We should establish an  open system of foreign trade and economic relations, actively  participate in international economic competition and  cooperation, and bring into play the comparative advantages of  China's economy so that the domestic economy and the  international economy will be linked with each other and  supplement each other. We should standardize foreign economic  activities and correctly handle foreign economic relations in  keeping with China's national conditions and the general norms  for international economic activities, and continuously enhance  competitiveness in the world.    3.2.7 Further reform the system of science and technology,  as well as the system of education. Responding to the needs of  a socialist market economy, we will build a new system which  conforms to the laws of development of science and technology  itself, and which closely integrates science and technology with  economy to promote scientific and technological progress and to  realize a comprehensive and coordinated development of the  economy, science, technology, and society. We need to actively  develop the scientific and technological enterprises which  belong to various ownership systems and operate in various  styles. The organs specializing in applied and development  research, and the organs providing scientific and technological  consultation and information services, should face the market  and promote integration of science and technology into economy.  We must change the situation in which the government takes  charge of everything in providing education and form a new  system in which the government is the main player in providing  education while various quarters of the society also take part.  We will strengthen compulsory education, vigorously develop  vocational and adult education, optimize the educational  structure, and train various types of professionals for the  society.    3.2.8 Strengthen the building of legal system. The essence  of a market economy is an economy under a legal system. In the  building and perfecting process, the socialist market economy  system requires a sound legal system as its norm and to protect  it. Before the end of this century, China must build a legal  system which meets the needs of a socialist market economy,  expedite the process of legislation for economic law, reform and  improve judicial, law enforcing, and supervisory mechanisms, and  perfect the organs providing legal services.    The above-mentioned eight areas constitute the basic  framework of the system of a socialist market economy in China,  in other words, they are the eight pillars supporting the new  system in China. At this moment, our concept is to initially  build a new economic system in the 1990's. On this basis, we  must work hard for about 20 years to form a set of systems which  are more mature and stable in various aspects. At present, on  the basis of continuously summing up experiences in practice, we  are moving toward this goal in a planned manner. We are full of  confidence in the future of China's reform.  <H5>  4. The Main Duties of Reform of Economic System in China in </H5> 1994    4.1 The year 1994 is a crucial year of realizing  overall advancement of, and major breakthroughs in, reform of  the economic system.    This year's basic principle of work is: Grasp the  opportunity, deepen reform, expand opening up, promote  development, and maintain stability. The main duties are:  Change operational mechanisms in state-owned enterprises, find  an effective way to establish a modern enterprise system and  expedite the reform of macroeconomic management system, then,  with these as key points, carry out other reforms in a  coordinated manner. This year, amid the rapid operation of the  national economy, we must thoroughly promote reform, and in the  overall changing of the old system into the new one, we must  ensure a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy. At present, we must earnestly strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control, check inflation, properly  handle the relations among reform, development, and stability,  and ensure a smooth process of reform.    4.2 Enterprise reform.    This year, the State Council will select about 100  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises to try out the  building of a modern enterprises system and explore an effective  way to establish a modern enterprise system. Regarding  state-owned small enterprises, they will be transformed through  forms such as leasing, contracting, and selling. Concerning  enterprises which have been making losses for a long time, and  which have debts larger than capital, they will go bankrupt  according to law. A majority of state-owned enterprises must  continue to change operational mechanisms, tackle the historical  burdens on enterprises step by step, and create conditions for  establishing a modern enterprise system. Urban collective  enterprises, township and town enterprises, and nongovernmental  high-tech enterprises may change their system to a joint-stock  system, and those with better conditions may transform into  joint-stock companies. Private enterprises will be encouraged  to change into standardized companies.    4.3 Properly carry out reforms of the systems of  taxation, finance, planning, and investment, and make a  substantive step in the building of a new macro regulation and  control system.    --The main content of revenue reform is to change the  current  system in which localities are solely responsible for their own  finances, to a revenue-sharing system on the basis of a  reasonable division of administrative power between the central  and local authorities, establish a central and a local taxation  system, and practice a system in which the central authorities  give tax reimbursements to localities. We must step up the  effort to carry out research on a standardized system in which  the central authorities transfer revenues to and from local  authorities and make preparations for further perfection of the  taxation system in the future.    --We wil promote the circulating-tax system which is mainly  based on value-added tax and, on the basis of lowering the  income tax rate for state-owned enterprises, straighten out  relations of distribution between the state and state-owned  enterprises. We will standardize income tax for domestically  funded enterprises, levy a standardized individual income tax,  expand the scope for collecting resource taxes, and build and  perfect the system of land taxes (fee) and property taxes.    --The reform of the financial system is mainly to build a  macro regulation and control system to be enforced by the  central bank, which independently implements currency policy  under the leadership of the State Council; to improve and  strengthen the central bank's functions; to maintain stability  of the value of currency; to organize policy banks; to gradually  separate the business of policy nature from the business of  commercial nature; and to turn specialized state banks into  state-owned commercial banks.    --To further deepen the reforms of planning and investment  systems, we will change the function of planned management;  strengthen the macro-nature, strategic nature, and policy nature  of the contents of planning; and simplify annual planning,  stressing medium- and long-term planning, and reduce mandatory  planning goals. We will build a mechanism for restraining  investment, strengthen the risk responsibility for main  investment bodies and bank loans, perfect the macro-regulation  and control over investment scale and structure, and standardize  decisionmaking behavior regarding investment.    4.4 With development of markets of production factors  as the key point, we must perfect the market system and continue  to promote price reform.    We must continue to develop commodities markets, make  special  efforts to develop the markets of production factors such as  capital, land, and labor markets, step up efforts to establish  market regulations, standardize the behavior of the main market  body, perfect market order, and form a market system which is  unified, open, competitive, and orderly as soon as possible. We  will further promote price reform and combine as soon as  possible the two systems of prices of means of production.    4.5 Expedite the reforms of social insurance system  and housing system.    The key point is to further reform and perfect the systems  of  old-age provision and medical insurance for staff and workers in  cities, and the direction is to let units and individuals  shoulder together old-age and medical insurance funds and to  link overall planning by the society to individual accounts. We  must expedite housing reform, thoroughly promote provident funds  for housing purposes, and vigorously develop houses which suits  our economy.    4.6 Promote reform of the foreign trade system,  further expand opening up to the outside world.    We must really delegate self-determining power to foreign  trade enterprises for them to do business, and develop  export-oriented enterprise groups according to the requirement  of modern enterprises system. We will further reform the system  of import management, strengthen the role of chambers of  commerce in coordination, and gradually establish a system of  public tender and auction for quotas and permits. Step by step,  we will allow large and medium-sized enterprises which have  better conditions, scientific and technological enterprises, and  circulation enterprises to have the right to engage in foreign  trade.    4.7 Expedite legal system building for economy.  We will announce, one by one, laws such as securities, labor,  foreign trade, central bank, commercial bank, bill and receipt,  insurance, futures exchange, and social security laws. For the  areas which do not have the conditions for legislation at this  moment, we will still formulate corresponding administrative  rules or regulations.    At present, the above-mentioned reform plans have already  been announced, progress has been relatively smooth, and this  indicates that China has taken an important step toward the  building of a socialist market economy system. In the first  quarter of this year, China's GDP increased 12.7 percent,  industrial production increased 18.6 percent, revenue increased  21.4 percent, the national economy maintained a good operational  trend, and the overall economy drew closer to the goal of  macro-regulation and control. The main problems at this time  are: Inflation is too high, some state-owned industrial  enterprises have difficulties, and agricultural production lacks  staying power. These problems have to be solved through  deepening reform.    According to the demand raised by the 1994 government work  report, which was adopted at the Second Session of the Eighth  National People's Congress, the Chinese Government plans to have  a 9 percent GDP growth this year. In light of the fact that the  GDP increased 13 percent for two consecutive years, it is  suitable to arrange such a growth rate. By so doing we can  maintain sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the  national economy.  <H5>  5. China Will Continue To Advance Along the Road of Reform </H5> and Opening Up    The building of socialist market economy system is a  complicated and arduous historic mission. The reform over the  past 15 years has scored great results, but there are also  dissatisfying areas, and on the road ahead, we will still run  into new twists and turns and difficulties. But we believe that  this undertaking is in accordance with the basic interest of the  Chinese people, and is conducive to peace, stability, and  development in the world.    China is still a developing country, and its people are  still  not well-off, and efforts still have to be made in the last  seven years of this century to solve the problem of food and  clothing for 80 million people in the rural areas, to help them  cast off poverty and achieve affluence. China has to work very  hard for several decades in order to achieve the living standard  characteristic of a moderately developed country. China's  construction not only requires a lasting stable environment at  home, but also requires a lasting stable and peaceful  environment in the international community, in particular, China  needs a good neighboring environment. We will continue to  seriously learn from the successful and beneficial experiences  acquired by the economic systems of various countries.    The Chinese Government's application for restoring its  status  as a signatory to GATT, is an important strategic decision on  further expanding opening up to the outside world. When China  participates in international the division of labor and  international exchange according to the common international  economic rules, it will be good for China's development and for  the countries which have economic interactions with China.  After 15 years of reform and opening up, China's investment  environment has continuously improved, its economy has  maintained a rapid growth trend, and its huge market potential  is being unleashed, greatly attracting foreign investors. We  are truly thankful to the persons who have offered assistance to  China's economic development, we welcome the experts and  scholars from various countries to China to carry out  cooperation and offer valuable opinions on China's reform and  opening up, and we sincerely hope more entrepreneurs from  various countries and regions can come to China to make  investments and to strengthen economic and trade interactions.  Undoubtedly, the establishment of a new economic system will  provide the best environment, in terms of system, to the foreign  businessmen who come to invest in China.    Human beings are marching toward a new century. In order to  have a bright future for China and for the world, China will  work hard to handle its own affairs well, resolutely follow the  independent and self-determining foreign policy of peace, and  develop friendly and cooperative relations with all the  countries in the world-- especially with our neighboring  countries--on the basis of the five principles of peaceful  coexistence. China, amid reform and opening up, and rising amid  development, will always be a reliable force safeguarding  regional and world peace. Let us work hard together to build a  new international political and economic order that is just and  bring human beings to a peaceful, developing, and prosperous  21st century. Thank you!</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Norwegian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Geir Salvesen report: "Norway Must Pay 9 Million to the </F> EU"]    [Text] There is a chance of yet another tug-of-war in the  final phase of the EU [European Union] negotiations -- over the  applicant countries' payments into the EU system. The new  applicant countries are expected to be net contributors to the  EU's joint coffers, and this will give the applicant countries a  good card to play in the final phase of the negotiations. As  yet Norway has not offered the EU any particular sum, and this  will be one of the last areas that will be resolved. On the  basis of the rules that exist today for the calculation of  membership contributions, Norway's gross contribution will  probably be around 8.5 billion kroner per year.    EU cooperation is financed through various taxes, import  duties, a percentage of value-added tax, and an element  proportionate to countries' GNP. In the past the government has  estimated Norway's gross contribution at around 7 million  kroner. Compensating for price rises in the intervening period,  this sum will now be somewhere in the region of 8.5 billion  kroner.    However, Norway's net contribution will be much less. This  is because Norway will get back money from the EU system in the  form of regional support and agricultural support. It is  difficult to determine exactly how much this will be, because  these central elements in the negotiations have not been  resolved as yet. As a result no one knows the exact effect on  the figures the outcome of the negotiations will have.    The fact that Spain now wants more money from the applicant  countries for its own regions and the poorer areas of the EU is  being viewed by the Norwegian side as yet another illustration  of the fact that Spain is the most difficult country to deal  with. But people are hoping that the other member countries will  succeed in disciplining Spain in the final phase. The trump  card in the negotiations is the same "membership money," which  Spain wants more of. The argument runs that if Spain behaves in  such a way that the negotiations break down there will not be  any money either for Spain or the EU.</p>

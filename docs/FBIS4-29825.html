			<p>BFN     [Text] The Cabinet yesterday agreed to lift an arms  embargo imposed against South Africa in accordance with the  United Nations Security Council Resolution 914.    The Security Council last month adopted the resolution  lifting the ban on arms and weaponry export to South Africa. It  also abolished a committee on apartheid problem in South Africa.    United Nations secretary general sent a letter inviting  member countries to follow the security council's decision in  accordance with the law of each country.    The Cabinet approved the lifting of the ban as proposed by  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on grounds of closer cooperation  between the two countries including security cooperation in the  future.</p>

			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Merck fall puts check on advance by Dow Wall Street ENCOURAGING economic news failed to lift US stock markets yesterday as declines in several big stocks, including Du Pont and Merck, left share prices lower at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the end of a volatile day's trading the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 12.01 at 3,553.45. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.05 to 447.19, although in the over-the-counter market the Nasdaq composite rose 4.59 to 705.59. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 273m shares. The day's economic news was broadly positive. The Commerce Department announced a 3.8 per cent climb in June durable goods orders, an increase three times larger than analysts had forecast. The figures, however, came with a catch. The big increase was due primarily to a jump in orders for commercial aircraft, a traditionally volatile component. Without the aircraft orders, the overall increase was just 0.3 per cent. Even so, analysts said that they were still relieved to see that orders were up in June. The news failed to lift market sentiment or prices, which tumbled at the opening. Although some investors continued to take profits following recent record highs for the Dow, the bulk of the decline was attributable to a handful of leading stocks. Merck led the way, falling almost Dollars 2 in early trading after the big drugs group announced a Dollars 6bn acquisition of Medco Containment Services, which will be funded through a new equity issue and debt financing. Merck recovered some of its loss later in the day, and at the close the stock was down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 30 3/4 after volume of 12.47m shares. Medco, traded on the Nasdaq market, jumped Dollars 4 3/8 to Dollars 34 1/8 . Du Pont fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 1/4 after the company disappointed the markets with second-quarter earnings of 76 cents a share, well below the 84 cents expected by analysts. Chrysler dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 5/8 in turnover of 9.5m shares, even though the car maker unveiled strong second-quarter net income of Dollars 685m, which included one-off gains worth Dollars 110m from the sale of stock and a plastics unit. The decline may have been a natural correction following recent big gains in Chrysler's share price. In the same sector, Ford Motor climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 52 in volume of 2.1m shares on news of an impressive improvement in second-quarter earnings. General Motors' class E shares, which represent the company's EDS unit, advanced Dollars 2 to Dollars 28 1/8 after the company, which announced as-expected profits yesterday, said it expected double-digit percentage revenue growth in 1993. Eastman Kodak moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 52 3/8 after reporting second-quarter net income of Dollars 1.13 a share, up from Dollars 1.11 a year earlier, even after a special charge. Canada TORONTO continued to climb in moderate trading. The TSE 300 index finished 11.5 higher at 3,923.1 and rises led declines by 403 to 301 after volume of 52m shares valued at CDollars 569.5m. Among the sub-indices, nine of the 14 gained ground. Golds recorded the day's biggest change, rising 1.13 per cent.</p>

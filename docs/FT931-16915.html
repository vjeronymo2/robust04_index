			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Howard to meet leasehold lobby MR MICHAEL Howard, the environment secretary, is to meet Tory backbenchers urging greater rights for tenants in the government's proposals on leasehold reforms. Ministers are conscious that an alliance between Labour and the tenants' lobby in the Tory party could defeat the government when the housing bill comes before the Commons as a whole for detailed consideration, probably early next month. The bill, which gives tenants on long leaseholds the right to buy the freehold of their block of flats or the right to extend their leases, and extends the right to buy for public-sector tenants, has had a troubled passage so far. Ministers have already had to agree to consider extending tenants' rights. The government knows that to avoid defeat it must satisfy its backbench 'pro-tenant' critics by abolishing the low-rent test, which is one of the criteria for whether leaseholders qualify for the right to buy the freehold of the property. At the same time, ministers fear that if the lobby on behalf of the landlords feels very hard hit, a few Tory MPs might abstain or vote against the bill's final Commons stage.</p>

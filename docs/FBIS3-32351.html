			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Carlos Lage, vice president of the Cuban </F> Council of State, by unidentified O ESTADO correspondent, "this  week" in Riberao Preto]    [Text] [O ESTADO] The United States is about to lift the  20-year-old embargo on Vietnam. Does Cuba see any indication  that the embargo against it may be lifted in the short or medium  term?    [Lage] We do not see that possibility nor any indication  that  the United States will lift the blockade against Cuba in the  short term. That is an ignorant and criminal policy that cannot  be maintained indefinitely while there increasingly are forces  that express their rejection of the blockade.    [O ESTADO] The names of Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina and  Raul Castro are mentioned as the strongest candidates to replace  Fidel. You allegedly also are on the list.    [Lage] No. Raul Castro is on the list. He is vice president  of the Council of State and second secretary of the party, and  the one who would replace Fidel. Why think of his successor if  the two are alive?    [O ESTADO] The Cuban regime seems to be implementing a  transition rhythm different from that preferred by the United  States and Cuban dissidents. Could you explain how this  transition works and where it will lead?    [Lage] We are not engagin in a transition to capitalism. We  are adapting our socialist economy to conditions abroad.    [O ESTADO] How are subjects like a multiparty system being  dealt with?    [Lage] Our concept is of a single party. In Cuba, a party is  not an electoral party that organizes itself to win or to  participate in an election and then lacks power to organize or  conduct society. From our point of view, a single party is more  democratic. There are multiparty elections in many countries but  barely 30 or 40 percent of the people participate in the  elections so the winners have barely 30 or 40 percent of the  votes.    [O ESTADO] Is it true that Fidel admires former President  Collor?    [Lage] The truth is that Collor, while he was president, had  a positive attitude toward Cuba and resisted U.S. pressures. We  do not forget that.</p>

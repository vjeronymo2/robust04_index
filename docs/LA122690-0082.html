			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> PARENTS CARING FOR CHILD GIVEN RESPITE  </P> <P> For more than two years, Maria Fuerte has been as much an intensive-care nurse  as mother to her son Gonzalo Jr., who was born with hydrocephalus, a swelling  of the brain caused by fluid buildup.  </P> <P> Three times she has brought him back to life using cardiopulmonary  resuscitation when the heart machine the youngster was attached to sounded a  warning that his breathing had stopped.  </P> <P> And in between emergencies, Fuerte tends to his everyday needs.  </P> <P> But last weekend, Fuerte and her husband got a break from the pressures of  caring for Gonzalo Jr., as they become the first couple to take advantage of a  local United Cerebral Palsy program which gave them a weekend in a hotel suite  donated by the Newport Beach Marriott Suites hotel.  </P> <P> Hotel officials set them up in a suite overlooking the Back Bay and treated  them to breakfast. Workers at the Cerebral Palsy office in Santa Ana set up an  agenda that included an evening at a local comedy nightclub.  </P> <P> "This is our first vacation since Gonzalo was born," Fuerte said. Relatives,  she said, would take care of her children, including Gonzalo Jr.  </P> <P> Cerebral Palsy officials say the Fuertes aren't the only family that needs a  break.  </P> <P> About 700,000 people under the age of 21 have some form of cerebral palsy and  more than 5,000 babies are born with the condition every year, said Alma Mesa,  infant program coordinator for the group's Santa Ana office.  </P> <P> "There are so many parents that have children with full-time needs and their  stress levels are so high," Mesa said. "The need for this program is very  real."  </P> <P> Tailored after a national United Cerebral Palsy program called "Respitality,"  which serves 5,000 couples each year, the Orange County office has arranged  with the Newport Marriott to provide rooms for two families a month for the  next 13 months.  </P> <P> Parents of any child suffering from a disease that requires full-time care are  eligible, Mesa said.  </P> <P> Cerebral Palsy officials in Washington say it can cost from $3 million to $12  million over a lifetime to treat a person with cerebral palsy.  </P> <P> But Fuerte said that since Gonzalo Jr. was born, time with her husband has been  more precious than money.  </P> <P> "This weekend will be the best Christmas present I could ever have," she said.  "The best present we could give each other is our time together." FRANK MESSINA  </P></p>

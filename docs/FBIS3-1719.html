			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By M Y Sung in Beijing and Mary Binks] </F>   [Text] Britain's ambassador to China, Sir Robin McLaren,  yesterday conceded further negotiations with Beijing over the  political future of Hong Kong were impossible. Sir Robin's  admission contrasts starkly with statements by Governor Chris  Patten and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd that the door  to talks with China remains open.    Two weeks ago, Chief Secretary Anson Chan also implied the  time for negotiations with China on political reform was over.  She said stringent time constraints dictated that the  constitutional reform process had to be completed soon.    In Beijing yesterday, Sir Robin said that China's conditions  for a resumption of talks on political reform were impossible to  meet. China has demanded that Britain nullify constitutional  reforms already endorsed by the legislature, and withdraw the  reform package gazetted on 25 February. The arrangements for  this year's district board elections, and next year's municipal  and Legislative Council polls need to be on the statute books by  the end of July. Sir Robin said Britain could not  simultaneously fulfil its obligations in implementing fair and  open elections and meet China's pre-condition for more talks.  Although the British wanted to reach agreement with China on  political reform, it did not seem "it was going to be possible",  he said.    Conceding the talks were over, and in the light of  statements  by China's Foreign Ministry that the non co-operation on  political reform would affect other transitional issues, Sir  Robin again warned Beijing against trade discrimination. He  said any discrimination against British firms for political  reasons would not be compatible with the deal on economic  relations and trade between the European Union and the Chinese  government.    Meanwhile, China's most senior bureaucrat dealing with the  territory, Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Director Lu Ping,  yesterday lashed out at Britain for attempting to play down the  Beijing decision to dismantle the territory's political system  after 1997. Mr Lu accused Britain of misleading Hong Kong  people by pretending this would not happen. The prospect of the  three tiers of government in Hong Kong straddling the transfer  of sovereignty was "pure imagination", he said. "We Chinese are  people who mean what we say. "And as we have said we will set  up a second stove, we must do it," he said.    A commentary published yesterday in the official CHINA DAILY  continued to accuse Britain of being hypocritical over Hong  Kong's democratisation. It accused the British of being  "die-hard colonialists...day-dreaming of playing tricks to  obtain de facto political and economic control of Hong Kong  after 1997".    Mrs Chan yesterday reiterated the British side had never  accepted Chinese demands, before or during the Sino-British  negotiations, not to put constitutional reforms before the  legislature without the approval of the Chinese government.</p>

Fischer has 100 career three-pointers,  which broke the record of 79 set by Judy Gilliam of Glendora in 1987-88.  </P> <P> "I guess somewhere somebody had 12 three-pointers in a game and it wasn't  reported, so we wanted Debbie to have a chance (to be the undisputed  record-holder)," Edison coach Philip Abraham said. "In third quarter, I said to  my assistant coaches . . . let her go for it (12). I said to her, 'Debbie you  have eight three pointers" because she didn't know."  </P> <P> "The third quarter was really great for me. After I hit two (three-pointers) I  said, 'Give me the ball!' " Fischer said. ARA NAJARIANFountain Valley 51,  Huntington Beach 32 -- Julie Workman scored 13 and Jennifer Barbaro added 11  for Fountain Valley, which led, 24-13, at the half.

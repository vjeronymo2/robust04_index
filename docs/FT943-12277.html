			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Leading Article: Mandate to change Many have tried, few have come closer. Unlike his predecessors, President Bill Clinton still has a chance of reforming America's health system. Congress might, just might, send him an American Health Security Act by the end of the year. During the next few weeks, Mr Clinton must fight to keep it worthy of the name. Unveiling his health reform package in February, Mr Clinton vowed to veto any bill which did not secure health coverage for the 16 per cent of Americans currently uninsured. Six months of Congressional bargaining later, the detail of the plan is dead. But various incarnations have survived, clearing the way for votes in both Houses by the middle of August. The administration has a few weeks to reconcile them, not merely with one another, but with the president's earlier promise. The reasons to reform the US health system are as compelling now as they were when Mr Clinton was elected. Though 37m people - one-third of them children - are uninsured, healthcare consumes a fast-growing 14.4 per cent of the country's GDP, far more than in other rich nations. Thanks to an inequitable mix of government benefit programmes and tax exemptions, the federal budget deficit takes much of the strain. Untangling this mess means finding a way to contain costs, extend coverage, and reverse the effect on the deficit. At bottom, that means greater government oversight, less opulent health insurance packages, and higher taxes. All of these measures would be unpopular. Were Mr Clinton starting afresh, for example, a system of government-purchased universal health insurance, funded by a new value-added-tax, would be the best choice. But he is not. Fewer savings Instead, Mr Clinton backed a form of market-friendly regulation to slow down costs. Though his own version has been much diluted, 'managed competition' of some form may survive, though it will deliver fewer cost savings than initially hoped. By itself, it will also deliver less in the way of wider insurance coverage. 'Universal', or close to universal, coverage will not be achieved without, first, requiring the purchase of insurance and, second, providing subsidies to those who cannot currently afford it on their own. Mr Clinton's way of approaching this was a mandate forcing companies to insure all of their employees, with the employer meeting the bulk of the costs. Another, more promising, approach was to place the mandate on individuals. Mid-term election Both proposals are all but dead in Congressional terms, at least as far as the first wave of reform is concerned. With a difficult mid-term election in prospect, Congress looks set to defer the tricky revenue-raising which either proposal implies until the turn of the century. If a milder batch of reforms and subsidies has not brought 'universal' coverage by then, Congress may or may not be forced to take more radical steps. Much breath has been wasted on what 'universal' should mean. Outside a British or Canadian-style system, coverage will never be absolute. Mr Clinton indicated last week that 95 per cent of the population might be considered adequate, but then seemed to backtrack. Clearly, a compromise is in order. But the administration will lessen its chances of success if it continues to look so confused. None of America's most lasting social reforms has been passed by a narrow, scrambled vote in Congress. The president rightly fears that his bid for posterity will be shaky if he does not win a safe margin of support for the final bill. Nevertheless, there are two reasons why he should hold out for a bill with a firm timetable for achieving close to universal coverage, even if the timetable ends up longer than planned. One is political: a messy fudge of his earlier promise would only add to the view that he lacks determination in the face of opposition. The second is more substantial. Not all Americans may be convinced that the crisis is as deep as he thinks. But most accept the need for change. If the concerns of the uninsured are not allied with this broader momentum, history suggests that their situation will receive even less generous attention in years to come.</p>

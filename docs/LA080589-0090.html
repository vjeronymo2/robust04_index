			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HALL OF CHAMPIONS PREP ALL-STAR FOOTBALL GAME;  </P> <P> L.A. CITY TEAM TRIES TO BREAK 2-GAME LOSING STREAK  </P> <P> The San Diego Section's high school all-star football team will try to gain its  third consecutive victory over the Los Angeles City Section tonight at 7:30 in  the third Hall of Champions football game at Torrey Pines High School.  </P> <P> Los Angeles hopes to regain the dominance it enjoyed before the game was  discontinued in 1963.  </P> <P> Last year, San Diego edged Los Angeles on a last-second, 39-yard field goal by  Torrey Pines' Tim Walker, 17-14. In 1987, when the series was resumed, San  Diego took a 19-0 lead but needed a 49-yard touchdown pass from Maurice Jackson  of Madison to Johnny Ace of Valhalla with less than three minutes left to win,  26-19.  </P> <P> Los Angeles, coached by Brad Ratcliff of University High and Tom Hernandez of  San Fernando, has a quick backfield. Dorsey's Wilson Bryant, the state  400-meter champion who will attend the University of Washington, will join  Washington's Takim Brown, Crenshaw's Shon Ellerbe and Banning's Keith Mims in  the backfield.  </P> <P> Banning, the Los Angeles City 4-A runner-up, has seven players on the 38-man  roster: Mims, defensive backs Eric Williams and Paul Montgomery, receiver  Johnny Lawrence and linemen Andy Gonzalez, Paul Ordonez and Bryan Proby.  </P> <P> Carson, which defeated Banning for the 4-A title, 55-7, has three players --  linebackers Peter Hunt and Todd Auvaa and defensive back Greg Lindsey.  </P> <P> Roman Foster, who led Dorsey to its best season in nearly a decade, will split  quarterback duties with Kennedy's Tony Smets.  </P> <P> San Diego will rely on passing, coaches Rik Haines of Torrey Pines and Dick  Haines of Vista said.  </P> <P> Quarterback Cree Morris and receiver Jake Nyberg, who will attend San Diego  State, were effective at Orange Glen last fall. While guiding the Patriots to  the San Diego 3-A championship game, Nyberg led the state in receiving with 93  catches for 1,456 yards. Morris was third in the state with 3,212 yards  passing.  </P> <P> San Diego also will be led by Southwest receiver Will Tate and Torrey Pines  quarterback John Lynch.  </P></p>

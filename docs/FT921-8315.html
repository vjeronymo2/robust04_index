			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers defeated in vote on council tax - Lords MINISTERS suffered their first defeat on the council tax legislation last night as peers decided that the severely mentally impaired should receive extra protection against being made responsible for bills. In discussion of the detailed report stage of the legislation, peers voted by 95 to 83 that people suffering from conditions such as Alzheimer's disease should not be jointly and severally liable for the council tax, which is due to replace the poll tax in April next year. The government is determined that the bill should be passed before the general election - at present it is due to be completed early next month. Overturning this defeat in the Commons could be time-consuming, however. Ministers say a household containing someone severely mentally impaired will receive a 25 per cent discount on bills. Lord Henley, junior social security minister, said the discounts meant there was no question of being liable for someone else's tax. Baroness Hollis, speaking for the Opposition, called the government's plans 'perverse, cruel and bizarre'. She said they meant, for example, that if that a husband left his mentally impaired wife, she could be pursued for payment of the entire household bill. Officials believe that strictly the amendment makes little difference to the actual liability faced by someone mentally impaired, but relying on this argument to prevent the change being effective would be a difficult line for the government to sustain.</p>

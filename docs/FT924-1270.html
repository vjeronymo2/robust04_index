			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays hit by provision DISCLOSURE of the size of provisions that Barclays Bank will have to make against loans to Imry Holdings, the property development group, surprised the stock market. It reopened a long-running debate over the threat to the bank's final dividend when it reports 1992 results at the end of February. Barclays ended the day 8 lower at 379p with turnover increased to 19m. The Imry provisions could well leave Barclays with a net loss for the year, according to sector analysts. Before the Imry disclosures, analysts' estimates of Barclays earnings for 1992 ranged from profits above Pounds 200m to losses of up to Pounds 165m. Concern about Barclays' exposure to losses in property have dogged the shares throughout this year. But they have rallied strongly since mid-October as some analysts have highlighted the strength of the bank's capital ratios. The shares were additionally unsettled yesterday when Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency, downgraded ratings for Barclays' senior debt and cut ratings of some subsidiaries. HSBC weak The latest tumble in the Hong Kong stock market, after China's foreign minister apparently ruled out concessions in the dispute over the colony, triggered renewed weakness in both classes of HSBC shares in London. The UK-registered HSBC stock fell to 463p before stabilising to close 9 1/2 down at 466p on turnover of 9.4m, while the Hong Kong-registered stock ended 10 off at 453p on 5.2m traded. A County NatWest 'sell' recommendation emphasised weakness in the shares. Mr John Aitken at County described the shares as 'fundamentally overvalued and 15 per cent too high'. He pointed out that HSBC's inclusion in both London's Footsie 100 index and Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index had left index tracking funds underweight in the sector. Glaxo hurt Pharmaceuticals company Glaxo recorded the biggest percentage fall in the Footsie list after agency broker James Capel opened the way for investors to switch from defensive to cyclical stocks. Capel reduced its rating for the group's new drugs, particularly Serevent, its anti-asthma product, and Imigran, the migraine treatment. It cut predictions for Imigran, arguing that the drug would generate sales of only between Pounds 30m and Pounds 35m in the first half of the year. However, Capel was formerly at the optimistic end of the range of forecasts. Hoare Govett, for example, was predicting only Pounds 38m sales for Imigran in the first half. There were further doubts over the security of the US patent on Zantac, the anti-ulcer drug which accounts for more than 40 per cent of Glaxo's sales, although analysts seemed reassured after speaking to the company. Investors also remain concerned about the announcement from Astra, Glaxo's Swedish rival, on trials of its ulcer drug Losec. Glaxo shares fell 27 to 768p, making a slide of 44 since the end of last week. ICI lost 24 to 1009p as securities house UBS Phillips &amp; Drew voiced caution over the potential in the bulk chemicals sector, particularly in PVC and polypropylene markets. UBS, which at Pounds 580m in 1992 and Pounds 700m next year is at the high end of predictions for the group, is reconsidering its forecasts. Energy sector specialists registered surprise at the impact of the announcement from Sir James MacKinnon, Ofgas chairman, that British Gas should be broken up. Nevertheless, British Gas made progress, closing 3 higher at 273p on good turnover of 14m. Mr John Toalster, at Strauss Turnbull, saw little downside for Gas shares whatever the outcome. 'If the break-up happened it would be hard to interpret it as bad news for shareholders.' An encouraging report on the housing market by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors triggered buying interest in construction stocks. Bellway jumped 10 to 278p and Wilson Bowden 9 to 343p. Building materials groups also progressed, with takeover stories and reports of broker buy notes driving Blue Circle up 8 more to 186p and Tarmac 7 higher to 113p. Reckitt &amp; Colman failed to show strength as the company warned analysts that, in spite of encouraging economic news from the US, prospects remained gloomy. The shares were steady at 603p. US selling prompted SmithKline Beecham to fall 16 to 430p in the Units and 12 to 492p in the 'A' shares. Wellcome was also weak, closing 17 lower at 1011p and suggesting a possible move out of defensive stocks. A buoyant brewery sector attracted attention. Allied- Lyons jumped 19 to 636p. Bass gained 10 to 622p, so too did Grand Metropolitan, at 453p. Guinness rose 11 to 491p. Cautious hints from the government that a national lottery's impact on traditional forms of betting would be limited helped Ladbroke, up 3 at 178p. Further negative remarks from Paribas on Euro Disney weakened sentiment, the shares closing 10 off at 718p. Profit-taking was seen in Tate &amp; Lyle, 4 easier at 395p. The shares had been boosted after the company said that it had regained its sweetener contract with PepsiCo. A stock shortage in Booker sent the shares forward 11 to 367p. Unilever's good run continued after a recent round of presentations, the shares adding 5 at 1075p. Meetings hosted by Argyll also brought a good response, the stock advancing 6 to 395p. Sparkling results from Shoprite Group spurred the shares on to 573p for a rise of 45. The boardroom moves and trading statement at Amber Day again boosted the stock, which put on 6 at 40p. Seven-day trading at WH Smith was said to be producing optimistic soundings from the company and the 'A' shares rose 8 to 504p. The gas watchdog's call for British Gas to be split up raised the spectre of further regulatory moves in the utilities areas, particularly the power generators sector. But damage in the latter was relatively limited, National Power slipping 6 to 264p and PowerGen losing 5 at 265p. Both stocks were additionally unsettled by switching into British Gas, a move recommended by Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Water issues opened marginally easier but then rose quickly to end the session with good gains across the board. Anglian was the best performer of the four Footsie water stocks, adding 3 at 488p. The best individual showing in the sector came from Wessex Water, up 7 at 584p. Regional electricity stocks were generally firmer, with Yorkshire 5 higher at 473p after the near 15 per cent dividend increase. British Aerospace continued to find takers after the announcement of orders for Airbus aircraft earlier in the week. The shares climbed 6 to 153p with turnover once again heavy at 7.2m. Profit-taking after the recent run left Siebe 10 lighter at 401p in trade of 1.2m. Rolls-Royce appreciated 4 1/2 to 114p after the announcement of an engine order from the Italian air force. Conglomerate MB-Caradon rose 16 to 281p, with the stock said to have been boosted by a James Capel recommendation moving it to a 'strong hold'. Tiphook was greatly in demand and the shares forged ahead 26 to 340p. A line of stock said to total about 1m shares was reported in airports group BAA. The shares closed a penny easier at 788p. A squeeze helped P &amp; O to jump 13 to 490p. Associated British Ports was a 'good market', according to a trader. The stock firmed 4 to 345p. British Airways closed 3 to the good at 281p on the news that it was to acquire a 25 per cent share of Quantas, the Australian airline. Turnover reached 4.7m shares.

			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / China tries to reassure nervous Hong Kong Mr Lu Ping, China's top official in charge of Hong Kong affairs, yesterday sought to reassure the colony that it would not be overrun when Chinese sovereignty is resumed in 1997. Mr Lu delivered a stern warning to Hong Kong about involving itself in China's political affairs, and told the colony to concentrate on its role as a bridge between China and the world. Mr Lu, on his first visit to Hong Kong since January 1992, stressed the 'one country, two systems' concept formulated by Deng Xiaoping, China's senior leader, more than a decade ago which provides for the maintenance of Hong Kong's way of life for 50 years after China's resumption of sovereignty in 1997. Mr Lu's comments appeared to be directed towards his Communist party colleagues as much as Hong Kong and international opinion. The New China news agency, China's unofficial embassy in the colony, has been associated with a tougher line on Hong Kong, advocating that because political talks with Britain had collapsed all previous agreements with the UK could be overturned. Mr Lu emphasised that Hong Kong under Chinese sovereignty would be ruled according to the law. He said the Basic Law for Hong Kong would be obeyed to the letter. The central government would also closely regulate the activities of mainland entities in Hong Kong. 'No department or province will be allowed to interfere in the internal affairs of Hong Kong and this should be made known to everybody, starting from now,' he said. Mr Lu also had some tough words for the 'handful' who thought they could turn Hong Kong into a 'political city' in order to influence politics on the mainland. This would be disastrous for Hong Kong, he said.</p>

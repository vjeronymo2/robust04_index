			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (9): Knives are out for the CEGB's mighty offspring - Juliet Sychrava looks at UK privatisation two years later ELECTRICITY privatisation, the pundits agree, has been a curate's egg. Bits of it - like trimming the fat from the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) - have been good. And bits of it - like failing to give the industry any incentive to conserve energy - have been bad. But the very worst bit of the egg, everyone from accountants to politicians agrees, was the decision to create only two large privatised generators, National Power and PowerGen, out of the CEGB's generation business. Offer, the electricity watchdog, summarised the market's worries about the 'duopoly' position of the two generators in its December report on the operation of the 'pool' or wholesale market in electricity. Although some competition had emerged, Offer said, 'emerging experience in the Pool suggests that the dominant market position of the two major generators gives them the ability to influence and control Pool Prices. This is not likely to inspire confidence in the Pool, nor be conducive to further new entry.' Offer did not, it said, rule out referring the two large generators to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC). Offer's fears were echoed by the Commons Energy Select Committee, in its February report on electricity privatisation. Offer, it said, 'should take steps as soon as possible to reduce the dominance of the two generators,' and by not later than 1995 it should decide if they should be referred to the MMC. But neither the Commons committee nor Offer suggested a satisfactory solution to creating more competition to challenge National Power and PowerGen. So far, the following strategies have been suggested: Break up the generators: The most extreme solution, and one often suggested by large electricity consumers, and British Coal. 'It is physically and operationally feasible,' says an accountant closely involved in the privatisation. But although the recent sale of Northern Ireland Electricity's power stations showed there would be no shortage of buyers for individual stations or groups of stations, it would be difficult. A break-up would mean a loss of value for existing shareholders, who could take legal action and call for compensation. It would also be disruptive, in an electricity market that has scarcely found its feet. Swap the government's 40 per cent stake in the generators for assets, then sell the assets to industry buyers: It has been rumoured that the government might cancel its 40 per cent shareholding in the generators, take over power stations of that value instead, and then sell them to other generating companies. This would create more competition and put pressure on the generators to keep their prices down. The idea has been discredited by the generators, who point out that this would be against the interests of the other 60 per cent of shareholders, because it would make the generators less competitive. It would also be hard to find assets which equal the Pounds 2bn market value of the government's stake without seriously damaging the generators' business, they argue. Force the generators to sell off stations which they intend to close or mothball: This would stop them from manipulating supply and demand in the market by opening and closing stations, and would give other generators a chance to win more market share. But, the generators have pointed out, if they cannot run plant, no smaller generator will be able to do so. And if they can, they will keep it open. Regulate the generators' costs/profits: This would ensure that the generators do not overcharge the regional companies and large customers who buy from them on contracts. Some large customers have suggested the generators are already keeping too big a margin over costs, while the generators insist they could not make money if they sold contracts more cheaply. But regulating costs or profits would be time-consuming - the regulator would have to examine the power station business in detail. It would also go against the principle of the new market, which was that the generators would operate like private sector companies, and competition would keep their costs down. Change the rules in the pool and the contract market: There are a number of proposals for modifying the pool, and the method whereby contracts to buy and sell power are agreed outside the pool - most power is still traded in contracts. These include making contract negotiations more transparent, so that customers have a sense of the market price. Changing the way Nuclear Electric, the third generator with substantial market share, sells power under contracts has also been suggested. At the moment, the company invites tenders for the contracts and then sets a price that customers argue may bear no relation to underlying costs. Making the price for Nuclear Electric's contracts more transparent and cost-reflective is important because National Power and PowerGen have used it as a benchmark for their own deals with customers. It might also help to have a more active market in contracts. There is already an embryo market, set up by Gerrard and National, but so far trading has been moderate. A liquid market in contracts would help promote transparency and give the generators' consumers more information about the market. Encourage competition to enter the market by making sure the pool gives clear supply and demand signals: An important criticism of the pool is that it is not a good mechanism for giving generators signals about whether to build new stations or not. The way the price of electricity in the pool is set means that at times of peak demand or short supply, a 'capacity' premium is triggered, pushing the price up. This is an erratic message, which makes it hard for companies to plan investment in new power stations by assessing the demand for more power. It thus inhibits competition to the two big generators. Also, because withdrawing plant from the pool will push up the 'capacity' element of the pool price the generators have an incentive to manipulate supply and demand by closing plant. The Commons select committee suggested that this system for rewarding generators for building capacity should be changed, but had no exact plans for how this would be done. Wait and see: The government's answer to the problem so far has been to wait for the market to mature, and for competing generators to emerge, and challenge the big two. But the Commons energy select committee has argued that that is not happening. Although privatisation brought a rash of new independent generators who announced they were building gas-fired power stations, many of their projects have foundered because of a shortage of gas at the right price. More worryingly, it now looks as if many of the new stations that are built will fail to provide the competition the government expected. That is because the stations have secured long-term contracts to sell their power to regional electricity supply companies, who then sell it on to captive domestic consumers. Because these consumers buy power regardless of the market price, the stations will not have to compete in the market. Worse, they may capture demand that existing coal stations could have supplied more cheaply. This, the select committee argues, must be urgently investigated by Offer. Even if Offer scrutinises every independent power project, the question of whether it will produce power at a market price in 15 years time is highly speculative. At best, Offer could assess how competitive the project's gas price, site, and technology were relative to other projects. So far, the independent power stations due later this decade show every sign of using modern technology and bargaining hard for competitive gas and the best financing package possible. It is true that they rely on long-term contracts rather than the pool price  -but most power is still sold in the contract market, if on shorter contracts. There is even a chance that the pool itself will become marginal to the electricity market.</p>

			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Redwood denies grant claims Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, yesterday rejected allegations that Pounds 7m of government grants had been illegally channelled to marginal constituencies in mid Wales. In a BBC Wales television programme screened last night, it was claimed that the money was disbursed via the Welsh Development Agency after the region lost its assisted area status in 1982. It was alleged that, under the 1975 act which set up the WDA, the agency had no legal powers to do this. Mr Jon Owen Jones, Labour MP for Cardiff Central, called on Mr Redwood to resign. 'It's a clear case of the political masters deciding that the money should follow their own perceived political advantage,' he said. Mr Redwood accused the BBC of 'not doing its homework' and described the allegations as 'scandalous'. He said: 'The legal advice I have is that the powers are available under the WDA act.' Parliament had been told in 1982 about the aid and it had not been challenged. 'This is just a sign that we have an election coming up,' said Mr Redwood. But he said he would call for a report from officials. The Welsh Office said: 'The money has been used to finance business in mid Wales, has created hundreds of jobs legitimately and has been audited. There is no evidence at all that the scheme has been used for wrong purposes.' In last night's programme, Mr Michael Henry, a former WDA director of corporate services, said he had received legal advice that the grant aid was outside the agency's powers, but had been told not to take it further. Mr Henry was dismissed last autumn in the wake of criticisms of the agency by the Commons public accounts committee, and is claiming unfair dismissal. Mr Ron Davies, shadow Welsh secretary, said yesterday the government had made a mistake in scrapping assisted area status for mid Wales. 'The whole incident highlights the incompetence and stupidity of government policy and the way they have handed over an increasing range of public services and taxpayers' money to unaccountable bodies,' he said.

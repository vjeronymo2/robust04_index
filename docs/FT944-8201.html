			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of the World Nuclear Industry (1): Concern over lull in plant construction - Fifty years after the first controlled nuclear chain reaction, the industry is still growing, but at a much slower pace than it would like Nuclear industry enthusiasts call it a breathing space. But many executives are concerned that the present lull in plant construction will be rather more permanent and that the frenetic building activity of the 1970s and, to a lesser extent the 1980s, will not be seen again in their lifetimes. There is little chance of a revival this century and even nuclear power's more robust supporters would be hard pressed to predict with confidence a resurgence in the early decades of the next century. Fifty years after the first controlled nuclear chain reaction, which made power generation possible, the industry is still growing, but at a much slower pace than it would like. Latest estimates from the International Atomic Energy Agency are that the 2,100 Terrawatt hours of electricity produced from nuclear power worldwide will expand by between 11 and 13 per cent by the end of the century. But that is against a background of a much faster expansion in demand for electricity which could see output growing by more than 20 per cent over the same period. The 17.5 per cent market share enjoyed by nuclear last year is expected by the IAEA to be 13 per cent at worst by 2015 and 15 per cent at best. What has gone wrong for an industry that once promised to provide the lion's share of the world's electricity? The Three Mile Island and Chernobyl accidents have had a decisive effect on the public's thinking. Nor have recent nuclear proliferation scare stories, however unjustified they may have been, helped nuclear power's cause. But a large part of the problem is commercial and stems from the transformation of the electricity supply industries in countries throughout the world. Monopolies are being dismantled, competition is being increased and, in some cases, ownership is being transferred from the public to the private sectors. The more commercially-minded, and in some cases smaller, utilities are adopting a more risk-averse approach. They want technologies that have low capital costs and short lead times, and power stations that can be built with easy planning consent procedures. They also want plant that can be used flexibly. None of this is conducive to nuclear power construction. Atomic power plants cannot be switched on and off with the ease of a gas or coal plant. They take longer to construct than gas, coal or oil-fired stations and are more expensive to build. The problems are demonstrated by recent constructions in the UK. Sizewell B, the 1,200MW station about to be fully operational on the east coast of England, cost about Pounds 2bn to build and is coming on stream 13 years after a public inquiry was started into whether it should be built. By contrast, PowerGen last year opened a 900MW gas-fired power plant at Killingholme, Humberside, less than four years after deciding to go ahead with it. The UK, with its access to North Sea gas, is a special case, but there are few countries where a new nuclear plant rather than a coal or gas plant would be built if the decision were based on short-term financial criteria. The nuclear industry argues that taking what it sees as a purely market approach is dangerous. 'It may be easy to leave nuclear energy aside in short-term policy but in doing so we endanger our planet's atmosphere, notably because of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect,' says Mr Remy Carle, deputy general manager of Electricite de France and chairman of the World Association of Nuclear Operators. Nuclear power stations emit virtually no carbon dioxide or sulphur. The industry says the short-term approach also jeopardises the energy balance of the next century. 'Today's energy resources will have to meet a massive increase in demand; a two-fold increase at some stage next century,' says Mr Carle. 'This is not possible without a significant contribution from nuclear energy.' Such arguments have most potency in south-east Asia either in countries where access to alternative sources of power are restricted, as in the case of Japan, or where the demand for electricity is likely to be high as economies burgeon, as in the case of China, South Korea and Taiwan. All of these countries are either building or hope to build nuclear power plants, and last year Asia had 14 reactors under construction, according to the IAEA. Activity is also intense in eastern Europe, where last year there were six reactors under construction in the Ukraine, four in the Slovak Republic, four in Russia and five in Romania. In Latin America there were five reactors under construction last year, including one in Argentina and one in Brazil. India is building five reactors and Pakistan one. The dearth areas for nuclear power construction include: the US, where no power station has been ordered since 1979 and plentiful supplies of gas mean none are likely in the near future; Australia, where no nuclear stations have been built and none are likely; Africa, where there are only two reactors on the whole continent, both in South Africa, and no more are planned; and western Europe where, with the UK's Sizewell B complete, only France is building stations and even it is close to the end of its programme, with four under construction. All of this could change, in the medium term future at least, if prices of fossil fuels rise and environmental pressures increase the need to cut carbon and sulphur emissions. But to stand a real chance of taking off again, the nuclear industry must make significant progress in three main areas: designing reactors which produce cheaper electricity, dealing with waste, and renovating dilapidated reactors. Research into producing cheaper nuclear power will inevitably be held back while there are only limited prospects that the vast sums of money needed to fund it will be repaid through new orders. While there are still hopes of developing fast breeder reactors - once thought of as the salvation of the industry - there seems little likelihood that fast breeders will enter commercial operation before 2020. Nevertheless, practically all countries with nuclear power programmes are developing versions of existing plants which are aimed at cutting costs and improving safety. Nuclear waste represents a thorny problem because the industry is often so dependent on governments for resolutions. This has been highlighted this year in the US where a coalition of state utilities and regulators have filed a suit accusing the Department of Energy of defaulting on its promise to take spent fuel. The search for a permanent nuclear waste dump has dragged on for years with little discernible progress and the utilities say the government is backing away from its requirement to take waste by 1998. But the most pressing problem for the world nuclear industry is to help renovate the creaking reactors of eastern Europe. Considerable progress is being made with the help of aid and technological know-how but efforts are hampered by lack of resources. With most east European utilities still in the state sector and charging prices well below costs, there is little incentive for investors to provide funds. Western scientists believe the most obvious root causes of the Chernobyl accident have been remedied in plants throughout eastern Europe. Nonetheless, they would prefer to see some operating reactors, including two at Chernobyl itself, closed down. Another significant accident may be unlikely but, if one did occur, a resurgence of the industry would be delayed for decades and possibly for ever.  --------------------------------------------------------        NUMBER OF COUNTRIES WITH NUCLEAR REACTORS  -------------------------------------------------------- Country group               In oper-  Under con- (&amp; no. of countries)         ation    struction*  Total**  -------------------------------------------------------- North America (2)               2         1         2 Latin America (46)              3         4         4 Western Europe (28)             9         2         9 Eastern Europe (30)             9         5        10 Africa (55)                     1         0         1 Middle East &amp; South Asia (21)   2         3         3 S E Asia and the Pacific (29)   0         0         0 Far East (11)                   4         3         4  -------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL (end 1993)               30        18        33  -------------------------------------------------------- *May include countries having reactors already in operation  -------------------------------------------------------- **Number of countries that have reactors in operation or under construction  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

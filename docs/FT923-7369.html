			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Observer: Hand-pik'd When it comes to international institutions, the European Community is probably more important to the South Africans than either the Commonwealth or the United Nations. This helps explain why Neil van Heerden, head of South Africa's diplomatic service, will soon be taking up his post as the country's next ambassador to the community. A craggy, law and political science graduate, the 53-year-old Van Heerden is one of South Africa's best known career diplomats. He joined the foreign affairs ministry in 1959, and served in Tokyo, Taiwan, Tehran, Washington and Bonn. But he really came to international attention during the Namibian independence negotiations and more recently has been at the heart of South Africa's constitutional talks. Differences with long-serving foreign minister, Pik Botha, are rumoured to be one of the reasons behind his move to Brussels. However, this need not affect his future; there will be a 'place for him in the new South Africa,' says the ANC, which is probably more than can be said for his erstwhile boss.</p>

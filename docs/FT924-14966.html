			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Coming to terms with conditions THE international bond market took a breather yesterday as borrowers, investors and intermediaries came to terms with what were claimed to be the worst conditions in the primary and secondary markets for several years. Upheaval in the currency markets, unsold bonds from recent large dollar issues, a queue of sovereign borrowers planning large borrowings and a dearth of institutional buyers have all conspired to push out spreads on Eurobonds. The gloom over the market intensified with speculation that the Republic of Finland was preparing a Dollars 2bn global bond issue. Sweden was among Scandinavian borrowers said to be considering a large bond issue, along with Italy, though recent negative statements by Moody's, the rating agency, makes both unlikely. After a Y75bn deal from Finland, launched on Monday, had been undermined by a warning from the country's finance minster about the serious state of the government's finances, traders were in no mood yesterday for another, even bigger issue from the country. The Y75bn issue broke syndicate yesterday morning, and was said by the lead manager to be trading at 99.10 on the bid late in the afternoon, down from the 99.35 issue price but still within fees. 'The best thing that could happen now is if the market closed down for a week,' said one syndicate manager in London. 'I haven't seen anything like it since 1987 - and this is probably worse than that.' The overhang of paper in the Eurobond market has been made worse by the large volume of new bond issues in the US recently. With underwriters still holding many of these bonds, the international market has suffered a knock-on effect, further damaging market sentiment.</p>

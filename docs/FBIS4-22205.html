			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lt. Col. Nykyfor Lysytsya, special correspondent </F> of NARODNA ARMIYA: "Apropos the Results of the Academic Year.  The Word `Flier' Comes From the Term `To Fly'"]    [Text] There are lately more and more officers who have  only rarely lifted their airplanes into the skies during the  past academic year. The 14th Air Army alone numbers 62 such  pilots. An additional 74 young pilots have each spent only five  to six hours in the air. The average flight time among the air  fighters amounts to a little over 20 hours each.    Much has already been said about this state of affairs. Let  me, therefore, confine myself to noting that the main reason for  this is a lack of fuel. The so-called rotation of flight  personnel -- in other words, transferring officers from one unit  to another -- has also played a negative role in this. The  situation is difficult.    What is the solution? After all, we do not anticipate a  significant improvement in the provision of material-technical  supplies for flights in the coming academic year.    These issues have been raised on many occasions at various  conferences, seminars, and meetings in the air army, which is  under the command of Lt. Gen. Viktor Lyashenko. Working  together, they arrived at certain conclusions and drew up some  specific recommendations.    To begin with, they decided to ensure that the best trained  specialists --the airmen first class and the airmen-snipers --  maintain their proficiency level. This solution is quite  justified. The combat capability and combat readiness of the air  units and subunits depend on these people. As a rule, they can  also serve as instructors, as so-called auxiliary instructors,  for those who care about their professional training. In  addition, an airman first class needs significantly fewer hours  in the air to maintain his skills than an airman second class,  and fewer still than an airman third class. This also means that  they use much less airplane fuel, which is in short supply.    Hence, the main combat crews on airplanes and helicopters  are  composed, as a rule, of airmen with the highest qualification.  They fly more flights. And they are first to be issued fuel.    That is how things were done this year. But it will be  necessary to abandon this principle next year. First, the number  of airmen first class is growing smaller -- many are being  discharged into the reserves. Some are losing their ranking  because of other objective reasons. Second, a large gap is  developing between the different strata of flight personnel.  Those who were ranked second and third class are now lagging  behind and losing their qualification. Metaphorically speaking,  the forest is being left without new growth, and this will  inevitably produce negative results.    That is why they decided to include airmen second class and  even airmen third class in the main fighter crews -- to enable  them to fly and improve their skills. But they will select only  promising officers for this, born aviators, as they say, whom a  minimum number of flight hours will suffice not only to maintain  their qualification, but also to raise it.    And what will happen to those who are not included in the  main combat crews?    This year they were assigned to the training regiments,  where  flights are conducted on L-39's. This, at least, allowed them to  retain the level of airman second or third class.    They plan to continue this practice during the next academic  year as well. However, the leadership of the Air Force needs to  take the necessary steps to organize this form of additional  training at the proper level. There were times when airmen who  had been assigned to fly were ignored by practically everybody.  As a result, the issue of raising qualifications did not arise,  even though considerable sums of money were spent.    Today, we cannot afford not to think and not to be concerned  about the future of military aviation. And this future lies with  the lieutenants raduating this year from military schools. They  do not yet have a class qualification. They also have much less  flight experience. Suffice it to say that their graduation from  school was postponed for a month because of a shortage of fuel  for scheduled training.    The regiments to which they have been assigned are also hard  up for airplane fuel. The lieutenants cannot expect to make solo  flights in the cabins of fighter planes in the near future.  Consequently, the leadership of the air army proposed to gather  all the young pilots into one training regiment, assign  experienced instructors to this unit, and organize further  training for these airmen. This will enable them to raise their  qualification to airman third class. Then, if they are not  assigned to the main combat crews, it will be possible to  maintain them as a reserve of class specialists [klasni  spetsialisty].    It is essential that the proposals put foward above find  official support from the Ministry of Defense. The creation of a  training regiment composed of lieutenants and other  organizational measures deserve serious attention, as well as  the allocation of funds. In the end, these costs will inevitably  prove to have been justified. After all, this is a matter of  investing funds in a cause that is vital to the state.</p>

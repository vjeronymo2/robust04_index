			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ihor Tarnopilskyy: "And the Defense Ministry </F> Assures Us That the Army Is Outside Politics"]    [Text] The declaration by the presidents of Ukraine,  Russia, and the United States on the nuclear weapons stationed  on our territory is one of the most important events of last  January and it triggered mixed reactions, especially in Ukraine.  It will probably have significant influence on the fate of the  Ukrainian people and state. President Leonid Kravchuk and his  team, for example, claim that Ukraine's future will be bright  and cloudless as soon as we give up or, to be more precise, hand  over our nuclear arsenal to Russia. For the first time,  officers and generals of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, headed by  Defense Minister Army General Vitaliy Radetskyy, were actively  involved in the campaign to support and propagate this idea.  The extreme zeal with which the Ukrainian military pressed for  the "nuclear trash" to be sent to our northern neighbor raises  the suspicion that they might not get their pay only from  Ukrainian funds. Whatever the case, Russian Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev could not even dream of better advocates of his  country's policies; and President Bill Clinton would definitely  promise them high positions in the Pentagon (remember how they  offered our president the job of press secretary for the U.S.  President?).    On the other hand, one can understand Ukrainian Defense  Ministry officials -- they simply obey instruction from on high.  As for the Defense Minister, however, it was expected that he  would give a frank opinion about the situation. But Gen.  Radetskyy did not have the guts to do this. It was done for him  by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and Supreme  Council deputies during the examination of the Moscow tripartite  treaty and its annex. Following that session, it became obvious  that the president's campaign is nothing but a fig leaf covering  his and other high-ranking officials' blunders.    So Ukraine has lost the battle over the right to have its  interests respected, and it was left at the mercy of two  empires. Very soon, under a slight dollar anesthetic -- and  maybe even without it -- it will have its "nuclear teeth"  removed. Moscow's playing of the "Crimean card," however, may  stop this operation.    Incidentally, as this situation would certainly work to the  Kremlin's advantage, the temptation to use it is very great.  The newly elected Crimean khan, Meshkov, does not even conceal  his pro-Moscow orientation, while the dropping of the moratorium  on the all-Crimean referendum gives the green light to  separatists. The self-assuredness of chauvinists will be  boosted by the knowledge that standing behind them is the Black  Sea Fleet -- a heavy military fist -- whose commander, Admiral  Baltin, habitually "forgets" that he is accountable to two  presidents. In late January, Baltin had another opportunity to  pay tribute to the Kremlin and do some saber-rattling, which he  certainly did according to the best imperial traditions. As a  countermeasure to the Ukrainian strategic territorial defense  exercises conducted in Kiev and led by the commander in chief,  L. Kravchuk -- which the Moscow media exaggerated to call  "large-scale maneuvers in southern Ukraine" -- Adm. Baltin  ordered heightened combat readiness in the Coastal Guard  Division and marine division exercises, including the loading of  military equipment onto assault vessels and the support of about  20 vessels. At the same time, it was explained to personnel  that Ukrainian military units and Ukrainian National  Self-Defense detachments were hatching plans for the seizure of  the Crimea. By these means, the Black Sea Fleet Command proved  that it was resolutely protecting the Ukrainian Crimea against  the Ukrainians.    One should also note that during these exercises, 43d Rocket  Army Commander Volodymyr Mykhtyuk was promoted to colonel  general. This "gift" from the president is explained by the  fact that the commander eventually stopped vacillating and  pledged allegiance to Ukraine. Hopefully, this example will be  followed by other officers. By the way, Ukraine obtained one  more general in January -- Valeriy Hubenko, head of the State  Committee for State Border Protection, who was promoted to this  high rank.    It is not difficult to notice that with the ever increasing  number of generals in the Ukrainian Army, the number of its  problems is not decreasing. While some of these problems  require considerable amounts of money and time to resolve, it is  absurd to make a problem out of introducing the state language  into the Army, particularly since the former defense minister,  Gen. Morozov, proved this himself. He learned Ukrainian in a  short time and spoke it with his subordinates. He also made  sure that the language became predominate in the military. Once  the leadership was changed, this process stopped and even  reversed. Today, all commanders that have already switched over  to Ukrainian in their everyday operations are forced to make  their reports in Russian because the Defense Ministry "does not  understand it well." Maybe they simply do not want to, Mr.  Radetskyy?</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Dubious statistics for cross-border travel Investors are crossing borders at an unheard of rate, but how far should they go in diversifying their portfolios? At the moment US pension funds, for instance, appear to be in the process of implementing a major shift in their overseas equity exposure, which may have risen by 3 percentage points last year to 8 or 9 per cent. If they want to raise their exposure to 15 per cent the present outflows could persist for another two years. If investors everywhere were to invest in each others' markets, the flows would more or less cancel out. But at the moment the US is in the lead and is swamping smaller markets, while many continental European countries restrict their institutions' overseas exposure to modest proportions like 5 and 10 per cent. British institutions have been seriously travelling this global road for longer than the Americans. When foreign exchange controls were abolished in 1979 the overseas exposure of UK pension funds was about 5 per cent, but it soon reached 15 per cent and each consensus target appears to have been pushed higher. The end-1993 exposure, including foreign currency bonds, was almost 30 per cent. A recent paper from Foreign &amp; Colonial suggested that the exposure should climb further over the next 20 years, to 40 per cent. Well, you would expect a global manager to say something of the sort. But the UK investor in equities might notice that the return on the domestic market over the past 10 years has exceeded that seen externally by a significant margin - an annual average of 18.7 against 14.4 per cent. Is global investment such a good idea? There are all sorts of justifications for investing overseas. US mutual fund investors have been succumbing over the past year or so to the most basic motive of chasing the highest short-term returns. Institutional investors are more strongly influenced by statistical arguments based on risk and return: diversification across markets which have low correlation can reduce volatility for a given rate of return. However, the mathematics does not give a consistent answer. Over the past 10 years the evidence suggests that a minimum risk UK institutional equity portfolio would have 70 per cent in the UK and 30 per cent overseas. But over 20 years the answer is quite different, indicating an overseas weighting of no less than 80 per cent. There is also the problem that the major markets are likely to be much more closely correlated in future, precisely because of greater overlap of investors. The fund manager Paul Woolley developed a matching theory whereby pension funds should seek a currency exposure comparable to the imported proportion in the basket of goods consumed by the typical pensioner. Although the fine print of this was hazy, it supported the principle that investors in small countries should naturally seek a much higher overseas weighting than their counterparts in large countries which are economically more self-sufficient. Now F &amp; C is putting forward yet another argument, a growth-chasing one. Pension fund investors should concentrate upon high growth 'emerging markets' to which they should commit perhaps 20 per cent of their assets, while severely deweighting mature economic regions such as continental western Europe. But although this argument may look just about respectable during the latest emerging markets boom, scheme sponsors may worry about crashes and revolutions. In any case, fixation on national markets and indices is surely a trap. What matters in the long run is the source of the dividends and earnings growth. From the point of view of international exposure, is there much difference for a US investor between shareholdings in, say, Exxon and Royal Dutch? Surely portfolio theory should focus on where the underlying profits are generated rather than on where the shares are listed. Shares should become differentiated more logically, between big international blue chips and generally smaller capitalisation domestic companies, more directly responsive to local economic conditions. On the basis of underlying earnings British institutional equity portfolios already have an overseas exposure of around 40 per cent. But admittedly, little of it is in those currently exciting emerging markets.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / Grand Met's drinks expert takes food George Bull, (left) who has piloted Grand Metropolitan's drinks business, International Distillers and Vintners (IDV,) as it grew into the world's largest wines and spirits company, is now moving to head GrandMet's expanding food operations. This follows the promotion earlier this year of Ian Martin, who led the acquisition and integration of the US Pillsbury food operations, to group managing director and chief operating officer, under Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and group chief executive. Bull, 55, will take over as chairman and chief executive of the food sector  -which includes Pillsbury flour and baking products, Green Giant vegetables and Haagen-Dazs ice cream - on July 15. His task will be to build the business, through acquisitions and joint ventures where possible, to match the scale of the drinks operations. The food sector contributed Pounds 300m in trading profits last year compared with IDV's Pounds 454m. Joining one of the founding IDV companies in 1957, Bull held a series of posts in the business before becoming chief executive in 1984. The company's volume sales are now the largest in the world - more than 96m cases of wines and spirits a year, including brands such as Smirnoff vodka and J &amp; B Rare Scotch whisky. It has achieved 25 per cent compound growth in trading profits over the past five years. John McGrath, 53, (right) who became managing director and chief operating officer of IDV last year, will succeed Bull as chief executive and joins GrandMet's board immediately. He came to GrandMet from Compair in 1985 and headed the group's brewing operations until the pubs-for-breweries swap with Courage. He was responsible for the reorganisation last year of IDV's international business into four geographic regions.</p>

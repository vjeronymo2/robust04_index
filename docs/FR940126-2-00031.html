			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;It is not intended that the funds must go to the same agencies for the exact same purposes every year; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The funding is open to all organizations helping hungry and homeless people and is not intended that the funds should go only to Local Board member agencies or local government agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having stated what it is not, what does the National Board want this program to be? EFSP should:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Create inclusive local coalitions that meet regularly to determine the best use of funds and to monitor their use in their respective communities;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Treat every program year as a fresh opportunity to reassess what particular community needs (e.g. on-site feeding or utility assistance, mass shelter or homelessness prevention) should be addressed;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Encourage agencies to work together to emphasize their respective strengths, work out common problems, and prevent duplication of effort; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Examine whether the program is helping to meet the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs of special populations such as minorities, Native Americans, veterans, families with children, the elderly, and the handicapped.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We must emphasize that this program has a commitment to emergency services. We continue to view it as an opportunity for building a cohesive emergency structure which can, for example,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Coordinate across agencies the emergency assistance provided to families and individuals applying for rental, mortgage, or utility assistance;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Enhance a food banking network that is economical in its cost and broad in its coverage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Reinforce creative cooperation among feeding and sheltering sites to ensure help for street populations most in need; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establish or maintain a system that complements rather than supplants existing private and governmental efforts to provide rent, mortgage, or utility assistance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Board is aware that much is asked of our voluntary Local Boards and LROs, and very little administrative funding is provided. But the cooperative model that EFSP has helped to create can be a useful vehicle for many governmental and community-based programs. As a group, local providers can accomplish much:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Initiating a dialogue with local offices of Federal entities such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture to take full advantage of excess commodities and its other programs or with the U.S. Department of Labor's Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Working with Federal programs that require the input of local providers such as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD's) Community Development Block Grant and Emergency Shelter Grant and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Care for the Homeless;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Pooling agency efforts to gain Federal (for example, HUD's Transitional Housing Program) and private foundation grants;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Leveraging EFSP funds within the community by encouraging matches of local EFSP allocations from State and local governments and private resources; and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Exchanging ideas on administrative and accounting methods that can improve delivery of services and focus on the collaborative rather than the competitive aspects of agency relations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Eleven years ago this program began as a one-time effort to help address urgent needs. The survival of this public-private partnership is not only a testament to needs, but also to the effectiveness of EFSP as an example of local decision-making and community responsibility in attempting to meet those needs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EFSP is a reminder of this nation's willingness to confront difficult problems within society in new ways. But most importantly, EFSP has fed and sheltered homeless and hungry people, it has maintained homes and the families in those homes, and it has created useful public-private partnerships within communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Gaza, AL-QUDS Information office -- Lawyer Khalid  al-Qidrah, official in charge of the city's Liaison Committee,  has stressed that all former rules applying to citizens under 30  years old have been abolished. These people have been given  temporary identification cards within the framework of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. He said that every citizen outside the  homeland can return. Regarding travel, every citizen who wants  to travel abroad has a right to do so without a permit from the  self-rule area. Al- Qidrah emphasized that the magnetized ID  cards will be abolished in the near future because they are  inapplicable in the self-rule area, which now enjoys special  powers under the Palestinian National Authority.    Engineer Furayj Ahmad al-Khayri, official in charge of the  Coordination Committee, said that every time his committee meets  with the Israeli counterpart he calls for going back to the  rules that were valid before the closure of the Gaza Strip on 29  March 1993, including travel rights for girls under 16 years old  and people older than 50 without obtaining permits. He said  that these measures are no longer necessary because we now live  in a stage of peace, which we as Palestinians recognize. The  Israeli side should treat us accordingly, he said.    Al-Khayari stressed that trade and economy in the Gaza Strip  are in a state of collapse as a result of the occupation. We  are doing all we can to build a stable economy and trade to  encourage Palestinian, Arab, and foreign financiers to invest.  He noted that without Israeli encouragement and confidence  there can be no progress. He said that university professors  and students should not be denied permits to join their  universities and that such pressure will turn them from  advocates of peace in the West Bank into fighters confronting  the occupation. He added that we want to live in peace.</p>

			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Refuge stake placed THE PLACING power of Cazenove, the UK broker which has been notably successful in holding on its post-Big Bang influence in the UK equity market, was in evidence again yesterday as it bought a 10 per cent stake in Refuge Insurance and successfully placed the shares with institutional clients. Cazenove bought the 5.16m shares from Canadian Refuge Holdings for 645p a share and sold them on at 650p a share. The deal is the second big bought deal involving Cazenove in two days. On Wednesday, in a joint effort with Warburg Securities, it bought and sold a 9 per cent stake in Anglian Water from Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French group, a deal that netted the two broking firms more than Pounds 1.32m. Yesterday's deal was thought to have delivered a profit of more than Pounds 250,000 for Cazenove. Refuge Canada Holdings, a separate Canadian life assurance group, held the stake in Refuge Holdings for many years. Refuge shares held rock steady throughout the session, closing at 680p. Other life shares suffered from selling by institutions keen to take advantage of the big discount available in the Refuge placing. Legal &amp; General slipped 7 to 333p, Lloyds Abbey 7 to 331p and London &amp; Manchester 8 to 234p. Reuters wanted A profits upgrading, hints of a forthcoming share split and expectations that an upcoming visit by leading UK analysts to the group's US operations may bring further re-ratings, triggered a strong rise in Reuters shares. The stock ended a busy session a net 22 higher at 1,264p on relatively good volume of 588,000 shares. Goldman Sachs, the US brokerage, upgraded its profits forecasts for the group to reflect the weakness of sterling, pencilling in earnings per share of 69.7p for 1992, up from 66.6p, and 78.6p for 1993, up from 76.2p, to allow for earnings growth of 11 per cent, against a previous estimate of 10 per cent. Goldman labelled Reuters 'our number one stock idea'. Next week Reuters is taking a group of 10 leading UK analysts on a visit to Chicago, to view the Chicago Board of Trade market and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange to observe Reuters' Globex automated trading systems, and then on to New York to see its Dealing 2000 system in operation. A presentation to UK and US analysts is also planned for later this month. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the packaging and paper group which fell from grace after a totally unexpected cut in the interim dividend last month, suffered another setback as one broker clipped its profits estimate. The shares closed 7 down at 156p, a fall of 4.3 per cent on the day, making the stock the weakest performer among Footsie constituents. Turnover was a hefty 4.2m. Yesterday's decline followed a profits downgrade instigated by County NatWest. The broker, citing growing recessionary pressures, chopped its 1992 forecast from Pounds 180m to Pounds 170m. County said Arjo shares have bounced some 30p since the dividend shock three weeks ago and that 'any further strength in the share price should be seen as an opportunity to trade out'. Asda upgrades Positive hints over trading continued to underpin the rise in Asda shares, ahead 1 3/4 at 38 1/4 p in hefty turnover of 18m, the heaviest traded stock of the day. Nomura and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew both upgraded the stores group yesterday after speaking to the company, raising their estimates to Pounds 95m and Pounds 110m respectively for this year. While word from the company is that trading has slightly improved, analysts cautioned that the company was starting from a low base and the shares were only a good buy on a short-term recovery and yield potential. Currency considerations gave a boost to selected pharmaceutical stocks. Glaxo added 13 to 777p and Wellcome 27 to 975p. In the hotel sector, a large buyer of stock in Queens Moat Houses saw the final turnover reach 10m. The shares rose 1 1/2 to 35 1/2 p. Forte gained 5 to 159p aided by a renewed buy recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Grand Metropolitan's return to favour continued, the shares climbing 3 to 391p, helped by US broking house Merrill Lynch raising its intermediate term rating to above average from neutral. Hints that tobacco giant Philip Morris might be interested in buying Heineken boosted Whitbread, which has a licensing agreement with the Dutch brewer. The 'A' shares jumped 17 to 433p. Switching from Sainsbury, 6 up at 463p, into Tesco was reported from a number of institutions. Tesco's closed 7 ahead at 223p in heavy turnover of 9.6m, helped also by a reiterated buy recommendation from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Talk that the chairman and chief executive at conglomerate Trafalgar House were about to resign did the rounds. The company is under siege from Hongkong Land, which last week took a 15 per cent stake in Trafalgar and is shopping for an equivalent stake. The shares edged 1 1/2 forward to 86 1/2 p, just ahead of the 85p offered by Hongkong Land, on turnover of 4m. Turnover in motor components group T &amp; N rose to 9.4m and the shares gave up 3 to 138p on reports that agency broker James Capel had carried out a placing of 4.5m shares with a majority of the day's business dealt at the 135p level. Shares in engineering group Siebe, depressed of late by a stock overhang, were wanted yesterday and gained 8 to 347p. Kleinwort Benson, the company's broker, was reported to have shown a keen interest in the shares. It was a stock overhang early in the session but which later cleared that caused a retreat in IMI, and the shares ended 7 lower at 228p. Also busy yesterday were APV and Vickers. The former firmed a penny to 77 1/2 p, while the latter lost a penny to 90p. Lonrho fell 5 to 59p, with BZW reported to have downgraded current-year profit estimates. The high street banks made more good progress, NatWest adding 11 at 348p on 3.4m traded and Barclays, despite the lingering dividend concerns, a further 5 up at 342p. Standard Chartered put on 5 at 481p with speculative buying stimulated by hints of a possible bid from the Far East. The prospect of a post-ERM burst of lucrative mergers and acquisitions was behind keen demand for the merchant banks. Kleinwort Benson rose 9 to 290p after an agency cross of 350,000. Sun Alliance retreated 7 to 286p, after news of the merger of the Australian non-life operations of Sun and Royal Insurance. Dealers were surprised at the decline in Sun shares; 'it looks a sensible long-term deal,' said one specialist. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (26).

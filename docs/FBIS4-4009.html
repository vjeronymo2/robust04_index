			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondents Sun Zhanlin (1327 0594 2651) and Ju </F> Mengjun (0215 1322 6511)]    [Text] Almaty, 26 Apr (XINHUA) -- Premier Li Peng and  Kazakh President Nazarbayev held two rounds of talks at the  presidential office here this morning. They had an in-depth  exchange of views on Sino-Kazakh relations and issues of common  interest.    The talks were conducted in a cordial and friendly  atmosphere. Li Peng said: "Our talks have been fruitful. The  talks, which have deepened mutual understanding and trust, will  be conducive to further expanding relations between the two  countries in various fields."    He added: China and Kazakhstan are neighbors sharing a long  border. China attaches great importance to its friendship with  Kazakhstan. The two countries hold identical or similar views  on many international issues. He pointed out: Sino-Kazakh  relations are new-type relations based on equality, mutual  benefit, respect, and noninterference in each other's internal  affairs.    Nazarbayev stated: Premier Li Peng's visit to Kazakhstan,  the first in history by a Chinese leader, is a historic event in  Kazakh-Chinese relations. He added: To develop relations with  China is a priority of Kazakhstan's foreign policy. Kazakhstan  will stick to the stance of noninterference in each other's  internal affairs, will oppose national separatism and  hegemonism, and will not allow "Eastern Turkistan" to carry out  activities from Kazakhstan against China to the detriment of  Kazakh-Chinese relations. Kazakhstan maintains that Taiwan is  an integral part of the Chinese territory, and that Almaty will  not have any official contacts whatsoever with Taiwan.    Li Peng expressed appreciation for Nazarbayev's stand that  the Kazakh Government will not allow national separatists to  engage in anti-Chinese activities from Kazakhstan. He also  thanked the Kazakh Government for taking the correct stand on  the Taiwan and Tibet issues.    The two leaders highly evaluated the Sino-Kazakh border  agreement, which they believed is a historical event in  bilateral relations and another important hallmark of the growth  of Sino- Kazakh goodneighborly and friendly relations. The  agreement will have a positive impact on expanding economic  cooperation between the two countries. Li Peng said: The  signing of the Sino-Kazakh border agreement once again shows to  the entire world that Sino-Kazakh relations are founded on  mutual trust and have strong vitality. He added: "We shall  strive to build a new silk road together and will turn the  Sino-Kazakh border into a boundary of peace, tranquility,  friendship, and cooperation."    Discussing bilateral economic and trade relations,  Nazarbayev  noted there exists broad foundations for developing economic and  trade relations based on equality and mutual benefit. He hoped  to further enrich the contents of cooperation and expand the  areas of cooperation at a level commensurate with the two  countries' potential. Li Peng said: "Despite the large growth  in bilateral trade in recent years, there is still room for  further development. I entirely agree with Your Excellency the  President's proposal for further developing cooperation between  the two countries. China will adopt a positive approach toward  this proposal."    LI Peng conveyed President Jiang Zemin's greetings to  Nazarbayev, as well as the Chinese president's invitation to him  to visit China once again. Nazarbayev asked Li Peng to relay  his best wishes and gratitude to President Jiang Zemin.</p>

			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Eni sells turbine arm to US trio The Italian government yesterday announced the sale of the Nuovo Pignone gas turbines and compressors group to a consortium led by General Electric of the US. The sale represents a significant political move by the Italian government, which had favoured a US partner over European candidates in its first big industrial privatisation. Both GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group and ABB-Atlas Copco also bid for Nuovo Pignone. The deal, which had been under negotiation for over a year, values the 69.3 per cent of Nuovo Pignone being sold by the Eni state holding company at about L1,100bn (Pounds 440m). The figure represents about L700bn for the equity and about L400bn in debt transfers. Nuovo Pignone, which specialises in low-powered turbines and compressors for the energy and chemicals industries, made net profits of L36.7bn on sales of L1,977bn last year. The L7,000-a-share bid is a significant premium for Nuovo Pignone's minority shareholders compared with Tuesday's pre-suspension closing price in Milan of L6,269. The deal prompted street demonstrations by employees. Union leaders fear the sale could result in Nuovo Pignone losing its independence and in redundancies among the 2,600-strong workforce. Political concern to limit such fears explains the complex structure of the deal. General Electric will take only 25 per cent of Nuovo Pignone. A further 20 per cent will be held by six Italian banks. Some observers believe the banks will sell their stakes, of between 2 per cent and 4 per cent each, to GE once the political heat over the deal dies down. In a surprise move, however, Dresser Industries and Ingersoll-Rand, two US turbine or oil industry specialists, are taking 12 per cent each. The two bid in tandem for Nuovo Pignone and may have decided to join forces with GE when it became clear they would be unsuccessful. As expected, Eni will retain a stake of 20.25 per cent in Nuovo Pignone, reflecting interlocking interests between the two. Lex, Page 12</p>

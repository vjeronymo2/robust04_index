			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Irish models in clothing VAT protest IRISH models abandoned the catwalks yesterday to join an industry-wide protest at the government's five percentage point increase in value added tax on clothing and footwear at the beginning of the month. Joined by sewing machine operators, shop assistants and jumper-knitters from across the country, they formed a phalanx of several thousand people from the Irish rag trade which converged on the Dail (parliament) to impress on deputies that unless VAT rates are reduced, further job losses can be expected in this much-depleted industry. In three successive budgets since 1991, clothing and footwear VAT rates in Ireland have more than doubled, from 10 per cent to the present 21 per cent, making the Irish rate one of the highest in the EC. A recent survey carried out by the Apparel Industries Federation showed as many as a fifth of the 15,000 jobs in clothing manufacturing in Ireland are likely to be lost because of the latest VAT increase. Like other industries it is already suffering under high interest rates and the punt's strength against sterling. Mr Reg McCabe, the federation director, said: 'The effect of VAT is to reduce industry margins; that threatens the profitability of companies and their ability to maintain jobs. (The increase) makes it easier for retailers in the republic to seek their supplies outside, particularly in the UK'. Imported and domestically manufactured clothing is charged at the same 21 per cent VAT rate irrespective of origin, but the industry argues that the latest increase will encourage cross-border shopping to Northern Ireland, encourage chain stores to seek cheaper supplies abroad, and divert 5 per cent of consumer spending on clothing into tax. About 80 per cent of the apparel market is already supplied by imports into Ireland; 50 per cent of the annual IPounds 230m (Pounds 233m) output from Irish clothing makers is exported.</p>

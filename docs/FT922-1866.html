			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Winds of reform blow in from a prosperous coast: Chinese provinces are hungry for a market economy, but there is a risk of overheating Last month Mr Yu Zhaoyong took a group of factory managers and businessmen from Changsha, capital of Hunan province, to Shenzhen special economic zone in the south of China. Their purpose was to study the zone's stock exchange, where rocketing prices are attracting money and attention from all over the country. Changsha wants one too. Mr Yu views the pronouncements of Mr Deng Xiaoping, the country's paramount lea-der and champion of economic reform, as 'like a spring wind blowing all over China'. As director of Hunan's commission for economic structural reform, Mr Yu is a chief architect of the development of the primarily agricultural inland province. He plans to attack its inefficient state-owned industries and, like his counterparts in other provinces, sees share ownership as a central element of his strategy. Structural problems - including unproductive state industries and controlled prices - still dog China's economy, even though Mr Deng's 'open door' reforms have been under way since 1978. But the extraordinary growth of the coastal southern provinces is well-known to all Chinese. Mr Deng's new drive has unleashed a competitive frenzy among provinces and cities which want to match the prosperity of the south. They are pushing ahead with ambitious plans to boost industry, introduce market reforms and attract investment. 'If you cannot make big strides, you will be left behind by the others,' says Mr Chen Binfan, vice-governor of Hunan province. Beijing is being deluged with applications for exemptions similar to those of the special economic zones, which have the fastest growth, and for approval of plans to set up stock exchanges and other markets. It is viewing them with caution. While the provinces' desire to slough off the restraints of the centrally planned economy is understandable, it risks quickly creating the same inflationary pressures that occurred twice in the 1980s. Consumer prices were rising at nearly 20 per cent a year by 1988, when the government put the brakes on the economy. The increase in 1990 was 2 per cent. This year's is expected to be 7 per cent. Professor He Jianzhang, director of the institute of economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, agrees. 'It is difficult to solve the issue of overheating now that the emphasis is on provinces formulating their own policies.' The authorities have recognised the tendency to overheat. Mr Li Guixian, governor of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said in London yesterday that he tightened credit after the economy grew at an 11 per cent annual rate in the first quarter. Industrial production grew at 18 per cent. He said this would not halt the economy's advance, but he would fine-tune monetary policy to maintain economic growth of 8 to 9 per cent. The view in Beijing is that some provinces will have to scale down their expectations. While coastal provinces such as Guangdong can raise their already rapid growth rates, Prof He warns: 'Some inland provinces and remote areas, because they lack infrastructure and transport and energy resources, cannot indiscriminately speed up their economic development.' It is easy to see why the south's rapid growth inspires emulation. During the 1980s, the value of industrial production in Guangdong, the most prosperous province, grew by an average 20 per cent a year at constant prices. Last year, it grew by 27 per cent, with per capita income rising by 25 per cent. Growth this year could be even higher, and provincial authorities are rewriting the 1991-95 five-year plan to accommodate higher growth targets. Most of the growth stems from foreign investment in joint manufacturing ventures and is concentrated in the Pearl River Delta, where the economy is rapidly integrating with that of Hong Kong. But even in Guangdong, chronic problems remain. In spite of the growth of the private sector, state-owned enterprises still account for 44 per cent of industrial output in Guangdong, and 30 per cent of these are loss-making. The figures for other provinces are higher. The difficulties span the spectrum of industry, from coal, power and machinery to consumer durables. Factories still churn out unmarketable products. Central and provincial governments have tried various means to turn them around, chiefly 'contract responsibility', designed to separate ownership from management. Enterprises take responsibility for their finances and may plough above-target profits back into their businesses. But who takes responsibility for losses? China's bankruptcy law has been little used. For many state enterprises, however well run, it is impossible to make a profit without the freeing of officially fixed prices, a process which even optimists in the government admit will take many years. Each reform triggers the need for a series of further steps. Making industries more efficient, for example, involves making new arrangements for surplus workers, who are housed, fed and cared for by their employers. Efforts to create an alternative social security system are still nascent. Facing these huge obstacles, officials all over China have lighted upon employee share ownership schemes as one way to revitalise state industries. In Guangdong, eight profitable state-owned companies, ranging from a huge electronic fan maker to a manufacturer of monosodium glutamate, have been chosen for an experiment. Thirty per cent of each is being sold to employees for a nominal price. In theory the shares cannot be sold for a year, but officials seem undisturbed that employees might sell after only a month or two and that unofficial prices are developing. Officials are attracted by the Chinese propensity to save. They reason that if savings could be mobilised, they would provide investment funds and help to revitalise industries. Share-owning employees would also have a greater incentive to perform, they believe. However, Beijing is cautious about allowing more stock exchanges. The fledgling markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have seen soaring prices, volatility, overstrained systems and violence. Investors poured money in because few other worthwhile investments were available. But Mr Fan Hengshan, senior economist in the government's economic re-structuring commission, says: 'We think that most state enterprises can be transferred to the shareholding system.' The 300 staff of Changsha Municipal Musical Instrument Factory would no doubt agree. Profits have risen 20 per cent a year since they were allotted shares three years ago, and they have earned dividends. The company has expanded from violins, gongs and drums into cooking utensils. The enthusiasm for shares is, however, symbolic of the erratic pace of China's development. The planners risk treating share ownership as a panacea, while continuing to put off more fundamental reform.</p>

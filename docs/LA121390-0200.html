			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> UNITED WAY PLEDGES REACH 67% OF GOAL  </P> <P> Pledges for United Way of Orange County have exceeded $15 million with just  over six weeks remaining in the 1990 fund-raising campaign, officials reported  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The pledge total represents about 67% of the $22.5-million goal, said United  Way spokesman Jeff Rocke.  </P> <P> "We feel real good about the pace of the campaign and how it is functioning in  the current economic environment," Rocke noted.  </P> <P> The 1990 goal is a 9% increase over last year's pledge total, a record-setting  $20.6 million. The 1989 campaign ended four consecutive years in which the  local agency had failed to meet its fund-raising goal.  </P> <P> Despite last year's success, county-based corporations have traditionally  contributed far less per capita than those in comparable urban areas.  </P> <P> To help offset the trend, the local agency this year began a new program that  allows donors unlimited choice in directing where their contributions are  spent. The donor-choice program allows donors to target their contributions to  specific agencies or to special issues -- such as homelessness and drug abuse.  </P> <P> Although no figures were available on use of the donor-directed option, United  Way officials said early indications are that program is proving a big success.

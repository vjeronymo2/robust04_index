Successive procedures are outlined for choosing the parameters  for this process of destruction of chlororganic wastes. The  required degree of destruction of the initial toxic substance is  determined on the basis of the MAC. The H/Cl ratio in the toxic  substance is used in determining the composition of the heat  carrier ensuring the bonding of chlorine in the destruction  products. Computed data are given on the necessary degree of  destruction for the most typical chlororganic wastes and the  results of thermodynamic computations of the quantity of toxic  products of destruction as a function of process temperature and  composition of the heat carrier are presented. The feasibility  of using E-plasmotrons as generators of a high-temperature  medium for the thermal destruction of chlororganic toxic wastes  is validated. Instead of large stationary plants it is deemed  essential that small mobile apparatus be used, constructed on  the modular principle so that one module can be replaced by  another for accommodation to changing physicochemical properties  of the wastes.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] All five persons charged with violating the  Official Secrets Act were today found guilty of all the charges  brought against them. They are fined between [Singapore dollar]  $1,500 and $2,000 on each of the charges (?brought) against  them. [passage omitted on names of defendants]    In passing judgment, Senior District Judge Mr. Richard  Magnus  said the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt the  charges brought against them while the defense had not rebutted  beyond reasonable doubt those charges. The offenses arose as a  result of a BUSINESS TIMES article in June 1992, which carried a  flash estimate for the second-quarter economic growth that year.    In making the mitigation plea, lawyers for the accused  persons urged the court to impose only a fine and not a  custodial sentence. Replying, the attorney general, Mr. Chan Sek  Keong, noted that all the five accused persons had distinguished  careers. He said he would not go so far as to say that a  custodial sentence is a correct sentence.</p>

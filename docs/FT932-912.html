			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Denmark's social democrats cut top rate of income tax DENMARK'S parliament yesterday passed by one vote a reform designed to boost economic growth and give highly taxed Danes income tax breaks over the next five years, Reuter reports from Copenhagen. The legislation was passed by 65 votes to 64 with 50 members of the 179-seat parliament absent. The Social Democrat-led four-party government has a one-seat majority. The cutting of Denmark's exceptionally high marginal tax rates will be financed by new green taxes on petrol, electricity, certain categories of motor vehicles, heat and water consumption. The reform also broadens the income tax base by eliminating or reducing deductions, most notably for homeowners and increasing social security contributions by taxpayers. The top rate of income tax will come down to around 60 per cent from just below 70 per cent, with the lowest rate down to around 40 per cent from just above 50 per cent. But the measures, to be implemented over five years from January 1, 1994, will reduce only slightly the total Danish tax burden, which is among the highest in the world. Opinion polls are showing plummeting support for the government, ind-icating that Danes are sceptical about whether they will be better off. Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, who came to power in January, proposed the measures after years of failed attempts by successive centre-right minority governments to mobilise support for reforming the tax system. The opposition Conservative and Liberal parties voted against the package after a month of parliamentary negotiations failed to reach an all-party consensus, arguing it imposed a heavy new tax burden on industry. The government calculates this at DKr3bn (Dollars 460m) by 1998, but the Federation of Danish Industries estimates the burden at just under DKr8bn.</p>

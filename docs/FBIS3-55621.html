The government of Belarus  has embarked on creating a national program under this title.  While it is being implemented, it will provide jobs for about  7,000 military servicemen in the republic who are now living in  military townlets which the Russian strategic troops are  leaving. Soon former servicemen and the members of their  families will be able to work in the sphere of small and  medium-sized business. Representatives of entrepreneurial  structures of the republic and the Minsk energy center of the  European community have declared an interest in this.    The military townlets in the Polotsk, Gomel, Klimovichi, and  Bykhov rayons will be the first to be reconstructed. The  prospects for their transformation were discussed at an  international seminar on conversion which ended in Minsk today.    The problem of creating new jobs for military servicemen was  discussed with representatives of international labor  organizations and business circles of Britain, Italy, the United  States, and Switzerland. Representatives of the World Bank and  the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development have said  they are willing to take part in financing the program.</p>

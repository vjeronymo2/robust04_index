			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Construction Contracts: Hozelock plant for Birmingham HOZELOCK has announced plans for a factory in Birmingham. Work on the 10 acre site is due to start in August and the new manufacturing facility - representing an investment of Pounds 8.5m - is expected to be operational by the autumn of 1994. It will house all the manufacturing and assembly lines for Hozelock's ranges of watering equipment, sprayers, garden electrical and housewares products. The new plant is expected to provide for the planned expansion of the company into the 21st century. Some 65 new jobs will be created, increasing Hozelock's Birmingham workforce to 550. The single-storey building will initially afford 175,000 sq ft of factory space and has been designed to facilitate easy expansion up to 235,000 sq ft and for the addition of a mezzanine floor. 'This is a major undertaking which will ensure that we have the facility to increase our manufacturing capacity to support the company s planned growth both in the UK and, particularly, the rest of Europe,' said managing director, David Codling. Situated at Birmingham's showpiece industrial estate, Midpoint Park on the A38 trunk road five miles to the north-east of the city, the new factory is also sited for easy access from the M6 and M42 motorways. It is also less than a mile from Hozelock's computerised national distribution centre at Minworth which will further speed deliveries of finished products to the retail trade. Work on the 10 acre site is due to start in August and the new manufacturing facility - representing a total investment of Pounds 8.5m - is expected to be operational by the autumn of 1994. Housing all the manufacturing and assembly lines for Hozelock's ranges of watering equipment, sprayers, garden electrical and housewares products, the new plant is expected to provide for the planned expansion of the company well into the 21st century. Some 65 new jobs will be created, increasing Hozelock's Birmingham workforce to 550. The single-storey building will initially afford 175,000 sq ft of factory space and has been designed to facilitate easy expansion up to 235,000 sq ft and for the addition of a mezzanine floor.</p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / UK Company News: 'Patchy' markets leave Ocean static at Pounds 20.8m - Particularly bad conditions in continental Europe OCEAN GROUP, the freight, environmental and marine services combine which underwent an Pounds 8m streamlining of its management structure last year, has announced unchanged pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.8m for the first half of 1993. That followed a 20 per cent increase in turnover to Pounds 789.1m (Pounds 653.4m). Earnings per share and the interim dividend were also unchanged at 9.4p and 4.71p respectively. Mr Nicholas Barber, chief executive, said the results were consistent with the group's plans. He described its markets as 'patchy,' with particularly bad conditions in continental Europe. The group was not expecting any help from the world economy this year. Operating profits rose to Pounds 24.4m (Pounds 23.6m) and included Pounds 700,000 from Panocean, whose overseas activities were sold to Royal Pakhoed in March for Pounds 55m including debt. Panocean also contributed Pounds 6.4m to turnover. Net interest payments were Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.8m), reflecting a Pounds 12m increase in net debt to Pounds 63m and the reduction in UK interest returns from the group's Pounds 33m worth of sterling deposits. However, gearing was down from 35 per cent at December 31 to just over 20 per cent following the Panocean disposal. Pre-tax profit included a Pounds 2m benefit from exchange gains, countered by increased costs on the computer system being installed at MSAS, the international freight business. Freight and distribution services, which operate on very fine margins, boosted turnover by just over 25 per cent to Pounds 682.7m for the half, although its operating profit eased from Pounds 8m to Pounds 7.8m. The group expected to see the benefits from its new computer system next year. Marine services contributed the bulk of the profits, with Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 12.6m) from a turnover up 9 per cent at Pounds 63.8m. Mr Barber said the group had moved its oil exploration vessels away from the depressed North Sea to areas of strength in West Africa and south-east Asia. Cory Towage had a good first half and benefited from favourable trading in a number of its markets and from salvage revenue. Results at OIL showed an improvement over last year. Operating profit from the environmental services division was Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.6m) on turnover of Pounds 35.2m (Pounds 32.8m). COMMENT Rarely can a flatter first half have been announced. The company says it is satisfied with its progress since last year's reorganisation, which shed nearly 500 jobs and is expected to reap a full benefit of Pounds 5m by the year end after Pounds 1.5m in the first half. These savings are likely to account for the rise in pre-tax profits to about Pounds 44m, from Pounds 38.1m last year. But the picture is not so rosy if currency gains of Pounds 4m to Pounds 5m are added into the equation. However, the outlook brightens next year, when the benefits of the freight distribution business's new computer system should start to feed through and the Pounds 18m Barcelona distribution centre announced in July comes on stream. Meanwhile the shares are worth holding for their 5 1/2 per cent yield.</p>

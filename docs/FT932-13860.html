			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / World Stock Markets: Equities underplay South African fears  -Gold and diamonds are still the big winners in Johannesburg The Johannesburg Stock Exchange breathed easily yesterday for the first time in 10 days. South African equities seem to have emerged relatively unscathed from the political tension which has gripped the market since the Easter assassination of Mr Chris Hani, the influential leader of the South African Communist party. The overall index closed yesterday at 3,576, up 18 from Monday, the day of Mr Hani's funeral, and near to the 3,589 level where the index last traded before Easter. The JSE's performance underplays the widespread nervousness which has engulfed white South Africa in recent days. The institutions which dominate equity markets are notoriously chary sellers and this inertia has lent support to share prices, as has the weaker financial rand (the investment currency for foreigners, whose weakening cheapens South African shares for overseas buyers). The nervousness, however, was clearly evident on the exchange rate and bond markets, with the financial rand closing on Monday at R4.96 to the dollar, a discount of 36 per cent against the commercial rand. But yesterday it strengthened to finish at R4.56 against the dollar, a discount of 31 per cent to the commercial rand. The nervousness of the past 10 days aside, the first quarter of 1993 on the JSE was dominated by the performance of gold shares, with the All Gold index nearly 55 per cent up from its opening 786 for this year. The index closed yesterday at 1,248. The other star performer has been in diamonds: De Beers is 32 per cent up this year, and 73 per cent above the low of R44.25 it hit in the third quarter of 1992. The shares closed yesterday at R76.35. It has been almost wholly due to the good performance of these two mining sectors, and a 16 per cent climb by the banking index, that the overall index has risen by nearly 10 per cent so far this year. The industrial index, the motor behind the JSE in recent years, has not performed at all; indeed, it is actually below the level of 4,359 at which it started the year, ending yesterday at 4,337. This sluggishness is understandable. The 2.6 per cent dividend yield on the industrial index is barely above the 23-year low recorded last June. Given that the South African economy remains resolutely in the doldrums, with little prospect of a significant improvement in company earnings over the next 12 to 18 months, it is difficult to justify these ratings. Industrial shares are reflecting the dismal economic situation. The recovery of gold shares, likewise, was to be expected, although few would have predicted the extent of the recovery. Three factors underpin this improved performance: Better fundamentals in the local gold industry, especially in terms of cost control and productivity. Mr Rob Lee, of the Board of Executors, an institutional fund manager, notes that the industry is now producing slightly more gold than a few years ago, with 200,000 less workers. Secondly, better yields. When the index was at 800, it was offering a yield, through the financial rand, of about 10 per cent to foreign investors. These yields made South African gold shares very attractive, compared with North America or Australia. Finally, and flowing from this, South African golds attracted a portion of the international investment funds going into gold shares. It was these funds, mostly from the US, that drove up the index. The way forward for the JSE is not clear. Although diamonds and gold have blazed a trail for the first quarter, few are willing to predict that these trends will continue. As Mr Anthony Gibson, portfolio manager at institutional fund manager Syfrets, comments: 'Now is not the time for aggression.' Most industrial shares look overpriced, the gold bull run may be over, unless there is sustained strength in the rand gold price, and it is perhaps still too early to invest in cyclical commodity stocks. Mr Gibson argues that with inflation down at under 10 per cent, the real rates of return in the money market and medium-dated gilts make them perhaps the best place to be in the short term. Over the next two or three years, however, he concurs with Mr Lee's view that, whereas a substantial increase in earnings can be envisaged for some mining companies, the same cannot easily be said for industrial shares. 'Perhaps the trend towards mining has only just begun,' comments Mr Lee.</p>

			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Offer gives Attwoods chief a disturbed night - A look the Browning Ferris bid Mr Ken Foreman, Attwoods chief executive, undoubtedly had a rude awakening yesterday morning. At some time about 3am he was roused from bed to hear that he had been sold out, not only by his largest shareholder but also three of his fellow directors. The men from Laidlaw who negotiated the deal to sell the Canadian company's 29.8 per cent stake, which resulted in yesterday's hostile Pounds 364m cash bid from Browning Ferris Industries, have been on the Attwoods board since 1990. Relations have been strained for some time, however. And Laidlaw's comments yesterday left no doubt that its disappointment with the investment was increasing. Yet Mr Foreman argues the worst is behind Attwoods, and the bid substantially undervalues its recovery potential. Investors might be forgiven for thinking they have heard such optimistic comments before, after the cash calls, disposals, and management changes of the last four years. Attwoods has long had a credibility problem with UK investors. In recent years their interest has fallen to just 25-30 per cent of the shares. The company has been plagued by rumours of Mafia links, which have been denied, following the takeover of a US company in 1984. The group's US subsidiaries, and some former US directors, have also at various times been the focus of government investigations for alleged bribery, fraud and corruption. Finally, Attwoods has faced regulatory problems in the US which have led to a series of law suits. Mr Foreman himself sits uneasily with the pinstriped brigades in the City of London. A small man, permanently suntanned as a result of his preference for his Florida home, Mr Foreman most often hits the headlines as the third husband of Mandy Rice-Davies. It was Mr Foreman's waste business, Drinkwater Sabey, which reversed into Attwoods Garages in 1982 and came to the market with ADT, the security and car auctions group, as a substantial shareholder. Laidlaw arrived in 1989, after a complicated asset swap involving ADT and Attwoods. Mr Foreman built the company through a series of acquisitions. He attracted influential support, including Sir Denis Thatcher, who retired earlier this year after 10 years as deputy chairman. By 1990 finances were getting stretched. Within 16 months it called on shareholders for Pounds 162m in two rights issues. The second was only successful when Laidlaw agreed to underwrite a substantial proportion of the issue. Since then, Laidlaw's support has been poorly repaid. In 1991 it wrote off half the value of its Dollars 900m (Pounds 580m) investment. Pre-tax profits have plunged from Pounds 28.5m in 1990 to last year's loss of Pounds 62.2m, after a Pounds 91m writeoff on disposals. Forecasts are for Pounds 20m after exceptionals for 1994, still some way from the peak of Pounds 39m. Nevertheless Mr Foreman says Attwoods is now set for its best year for some time. Recovery is beginning in the US and UK, while Germany has at least got no worse. Attwoods' defence will draw strongly on the recovery story. However, a greater challenge will be to convince investors of the management story.</p>

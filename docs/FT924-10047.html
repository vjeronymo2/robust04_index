			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / World Trade News: Salinas pledges war on 'unfair' imports MEXICO is expected to make greater use of anti-dumping laws and import rules in an attempt to slow growth of its trade deficit, after President Carlos Salinas pledged his government would 'mount an effective guard against unfair trade practices'. These measures, and new regulations for importers introduced in August, are compatible with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the government says, but officials concede the timing of their introduction was influenced by their wish to keep down the deficit. The measures, the officials say, should allow the current account deficit to be kept below Dollars 20bn (Pounds 12.2bn) this year. The deficit on trade for the first nine months stood at about Dollars 14.5bn (Pounds 8.8bn), after sharp falls in August and September. The government is examining imports of steel and textiles from the US, which it suspects are being sold into Mexico at below average costs. It is also considering action against Chinese textile imports, where anti-dumping laws cannot be invoked because it is impossible to determine manufacturing costs. Regulations introduced in August, including the requirement to translate into Spanish labelling and official documents, have been causing long delays at the US-Mexican border, through which 70 per cent of the country's imports pass. This explains most of the rapid decline in the trade deficit that month from over Dollars 2bn to around Dollars 1.5bn. Mexico's health secretary has similarly required importers of consumer food products to record the origin, production process and other details of their imports. Such measures have been used to turn away Dollars 3m-worth of beef from Northern Ireland which had passed all international health standards. Mexico's current account deficit increased from Dollars 7.1bn in 1990, to Dollars 13.3bn last year. This year, the deficit is likely to reach Dollars 20bn, Dollars 7bn more than originally forecast.</p>

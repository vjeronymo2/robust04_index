			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / US wants war crime trials MR Lawrence Eagleburger, US secretary of state, said yesterday Serbian political and military leaders should be tried for war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia. He said Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, and General Ratho Mladic, the Bosnian Serb military commander, would have to answer for crimes against humanity committed by forces for which they were responsible. 'A second Nuremberg' awaited the practitioners of ethnic cleansing, he said. 'They ought, if charged, to have the opportunity of defending themselves by demonstrating whether and how they took responsible action to prevent and punish the atrocities,' Mr Eagleburger said. Addressing foreign ministers at a special meeting of the international peace conference on former Yugoslavia in Geneva, Mr Eagleburger said the US was supplying details of war crimes, including the names of the individuals who committed them and the leaders who may have ordered them, to the UN War Crimes Commission. The Commission, meeting in Geneva this week, is charged with sifting the evidence for future prosecutions. Mr Eagleburger called earlier this week for an international war crimes tribunal to bring perpetrators to justice. The naming of President Milosevic to a possible war crimes investigation reflects the growing frustration of the international community about its failure to end the bloodshed in Bosnia. A western diplomat said the statement 'made clear Serbia has a choice. No one has satanised the Serbian people. But the policies of the regime in Belgrade are responsible for Serbia's isolation and international sanctions.'</p>

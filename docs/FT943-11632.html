			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / NHS managers face large job losses Thousands of jobs including senior Civil Service posts will disappear under proposals to streamline the central management of the National Health Service announced yesterday. Strict upper limits on the number of staff employed in regional administration will lead to the abolition of more than half the posts in regional health authorities. The regions have already been through one recent job-reduction exercise, which resulted in the number of people working in them being cut to 2,600 from 3,900 last year. Under yesterday's proposals a further 1,500 posts will go. In addition, 2,300 employees in the Department of Health's headquarters in London and the 1,000 in the Leeds-based NHS executive were warned yesterday that there would be 'substantial' cuts. The reductions are likely to begin in the autumn. The government said it hoped to avoid compulsory redundancies. The proposed losses are the result of a review of the NHS's central management requirements now that much decision-making has been devolved to local level. Ministers have been under pressure to stem the growth in mana-gerial and administrative posts. Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, said yesterday that he was taking similar steps to improve NHS efficiency in Wales. He plans to divert Pounds 12.5m from administrative costs to patient care over three years. The reductions in staff in the English regions will save about Pounds 90m. Ministers plan to replace the English regional health authorities with eight new area offices of the NHS executive, and a maximum staffing level of 135 has been set for each of these.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Misawa, Aomori Pref., Feb. 20 KYODO -- Social  Democratic Party (SDP) Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said Sunday  [20 February] his party will drop its objection to a proposed  cabinet reshuffle, urging it to be conducted after Diet passage  of the fiscal 1994 state budget.    "It is appropriate (to reshuffle the cabinet) after the Diet  passes the fiscal 1994 budget or after the current regular Diet  session ends," the SDP chief told a news conference.    The budget is expected to get parliamentary approval around  April. The Diet, which convened its regular session on January  31, is to wrap up its 150-day session on June 29.    The SDP is the biggest force in the seven-party coalition  government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. Its objection  to the cabinet revamping proposed by Hosokawa has been deemed  the biggest obstacle to realization of the proposal.    "The cabinet reshuffle comes under the jurisdiction of the  prime minister, so we will back it if he is determined to do  so," Murayama said.    Meanwhile, Wataru Kubo, the right-hand man of Murayama, said  on a Sunday television program that he cannot help dropping his  earlier dissent if Hosokawa believes the reshuffle is necessary  to eliminate policy differences within the cabinet.    SDP Secretary General Kubo, however, balked at a growing  move  to merge coalition parties into a new party to make it easier to  field joint candidates in the newly created 300 single-seat  constituencies for an upcoming general election.    "It is difficult for coalition partners to form a unified  party in view of (the differences in) their perceptions of the  nation and political ideologies," he said.    However, he called for coalition parties to make efforts to  field joint candidates in the new House of Representatives  constituencies to defeat the Liberal Democratic Party and other  opposition parties.</p>

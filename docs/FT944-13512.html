			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Observer: Tunnel vision Cliff Walker, chief executive of BM Group, has seen the light at the end of tunnel. After a year of desperate measures to reduce the engineering company's Pounds 160m debt mountain, Walker has decided to make a clean break with the past by renaming his company Brunel Holdings. Apparently, the idea came to him when he was stuck in a railway tunnel near the company's West Country headquarters - built by none other than the legendary engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Suppose anything's better than re-adopting the old Blackwood Hodge name?</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading A SQUEEZE helped the near month contract in Footsie futures close above the 2,800 level for the first time this year, in a session which saw an improvement in turnover, writes Joel Kibazo. Trading in the December contract on the FT-SE began tentatively at 2,782, some 15 points below Monday's close but quickly improved and was soon hovering around the 2,800 level after buying from independent traders. Profit-taking saw it return to 2,782 and it traded in the narrow range up to 2,790 until lunchtime. A sizeable order from a large securities house took other dealers by surprise and December jumped forward to the day's high of 2,812. The rest of the afternoon's trading was dominated by Wall Street, the contract losing momentum when New York eased and then following it upwards. December closed at 2,807, up 10 on its previous close and around 9 points above its fair value premium to cash of about 4. Turnover improved on recent levels and reached 9,195 contracts. A healthy premium was maintained throughout the session. In traded options, the volume in FT-SE 100 options improved on recent levels reaching 11,359 lots. However, the overall total at 26,838 contracts was poor. Rolls-Royce was the most actively dealt stock option with a total of 1,389 trades, and was followed by Hanson at 1,138 lots.</p>

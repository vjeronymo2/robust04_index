			<p>941010 FT  10 OCT 94 / Observer: Taxing break Chief financial officers of US companies know a good thing when they see it. For a few days last week they were able to save millions of dollars on their securities registration fees, thanks to a congressional delay in approving the Securities and Exchange Commission's new budget. The delay meant the SEC was temporarily unable to charge companies its usual fees for registering securities. Instead of the normal 0.035 per cent, the agency was forced - by the rules of a temporary funding bill passed earlier this year - to charge only 0.02 per cent. Chicken-feed. Mind you, these are big broilers. Chrysler rushed to register Dollars 18.6bn of securities, saving itself a handsome Dollars 2.7m in fees. General Motors saved Dollars 1.4m on Dollars 7.1bn of securities. Blame two Republican senators for holding up the new budget. They wanted to attach to the funding bill a measure giving married couples a bigger tax break, worth an extra Dollars 1,750, on their savings. Meanwhile, who will count the millions of corporate dollars saved at the expense of US taxpayers?</p>

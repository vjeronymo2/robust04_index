Hwang Chang-yop, North Korean Workers' Party secretary in  charge of international affairs, visited Vietnam from March 7-10  to find out how Hanoi improved relations with Washington in  resuming economic cooperation.    Vietnam's example in enhancing relations with the United  States may have served as a valuable case study for North Korea,  an official at the National Unification Board (NUB) said.    Hwang met with senior officials from the Vietnamese  Communist  Party to discuss the issue of returning the remains of U.S.  soldiers killed during the Korean war (1950-53).    After visiting Vietnam, Hwang stopped over in Laos on March  11 to negotiate North Korean purchases of Laotian rice.    The NUB official said, "we are taking note that Hwang, who  is  a mastermind of North Korean diplomacy, visited these countries  shortly before the meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly is  to be held."    The Assembly usually meets to deal with party reorganization  and the budget and to make decisions on important matters.</p>

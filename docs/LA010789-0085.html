			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: MADDEN HIT IT OFF WITH CO-STARS  </P> <P> Remember those old Miller Lite commercials with John Madden crashing through a  paper poster?  </P> <P> Madden, talking about that commercial the other day, said: "The thing that  concerned me was I wanted to be sure and break the paper. You can imagine what  the other guys would have said if I couldn't break the paper.  </P> <P> "So on the first take, I go flying through with both hands flailing away.  Sitting at a table right in front are Billy Martin on the left and Dick Butkus  on the right.  </P> <P> "I hit Martin with one hand right in the face, and catch Butkus with the other.  </P> <P> "Of all the guys you don't want to hit in the face, these two have got to be at  the top of the list."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Mike Ditka played 12 seasons in the National Football League, 6  with the Bears. What other two teams did he play for? (Answer below.)  </P> <P> Wedding bells: Steve Garvey says he's getting married again. Garvey, whose  first marriage ended in divorce, is engaged to marry Rebecka Mendenhal, 33, who  works for CNN in Atlanta.  </P> <P> Garvey said they met a couple of years ago when he was at CNN to do an  interview.  </P> <P> "I gave her the ring just before Christmas so it wouldn't spoil the other  presents," Garvey said.  </P> <P> From Norman Chad of the Washington Post: "NBC analyst Merlin Olsen, who was  fairly innocuous for much of the day, bolted into inanity toward the end of the  Fiesta Bowl with this statement: 'You sense in this ballgame the reality of  football -- somebody wins and somebody loses.' "  </P> <P> Practice makes perfect: A lot of basketball players just go through the motions  while doing layups during pregame warm-ups. But not the North Carolina Tar  Heels.  </P> <P> Coach Dean Smith doesn't want his players to develop any bad habits, so he has  an assistant coach chart the layups, keeping track of the misses.  </P> <P> From Phil Jackman of the Baltimore Evening Sun: "A college coach, defending his  school's program, said proudly: 'My players take shop, and advanced shop. Shop  is when you build a chair. Advanced shop is when you paint it.' "  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Ditka, who was with the Bears from 1961-66, played for the  Philadelphia Eagles in 1967-68 and the Dallas Cowboys from 1969-72.  </P> <P> Where would you rather live, in warm Phoenix or cold Buffalo?  </P> <P> Buffalo strong safety Leonard Smith, who was acquired Sept. 20 in a trade with  the Phoenix Cardinals, says he prefers Buffalo.  </P> <P> "I never really had a chance to get adjusted to the climate out there," he  said. "Besides, I'm happy here."  </P> <P> The drop of a hat: Would you believe a hat trick within 33 seconds? Perry  Ganchar of the Muskegon (Mich.) Lumberjacks did it the other night in an  International Hockey League game against the Denver Rangers. He scored his  goals at 2:16, 2:25 and 2:49 of the first period and sent Muskegon on its way  to a 10-3 victory.  </P> <P> It is believed to be the fastest hat trick by a minor league hockey player.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Jack Kemp, the new U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development: "Pro  football gave me a good sense of perspective when I entered the political  arena. I had already been booed, cheered, cut, sold, traded and hung in  effigy."  </P></p>

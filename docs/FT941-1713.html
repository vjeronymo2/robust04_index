			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Pollution control earns trade surplus British environmental technology companies generate a trade surplus of Pounds 234m annually, a government report said yesterday, Bronwen Maddox writes. The world market for pollution control equipment and services is worth about Dollars 210bn (Pounds 144bn) and will grow to about Dollars 320bn by 2000 and Dollars 570bn by 2010, the report estimates. 'The view that the UK is unsuccessful in overseas markets for environmental equipment is clearly a myth,' it says. The UK is particularly strong in water treatment, according to the report, prepared by the consultancy Ecotec and a research group. The UK's expertise in water technology has developed during the industry's modernisation programme, which could cost about Pounds 40bn this decade. Western Europe accounts for 29 per cent of the UK's exports and North America 48 per cent. The UK Environmental Industry: succeeding in the changing global market. DTI and DoE. HMSO. Pounds 29.</p>

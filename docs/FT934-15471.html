			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Safety put first in coastal defence MRS Gillian Shephard, the agriculture minister, yesterday announced that priority in the Pounds 300m annual coastal defence budget for England and Wales will be given to measures which safeguard lives. Her announcement was at the launch in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, of a national strategy for flood and coastal defence. It will mean that most spending will be on flood-warning systems and urban coastal and flood defences. The lowest priority will be given to rural coastal defence and drainage. The strategy has been drawn up jointly by the agriculture ministry and the Welsh Office, with consultation from local authorities.</p>

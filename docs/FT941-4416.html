			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / MPs' data network urged A data and video network should be provided for all MPs and their staff at a cost of some Pounds 5m over four years, the Commons information committee recommended yesterday. It would give MPs access to television channels, teletext and the Commons announcements system as well as the proceedings in the chamber. It would also enable MPs to have close contact with their constituency offices and with Commons library information. The committee said: 'Most large organisations in the public and private sector now operate a network to enable those working there to do so more effectively. 'Parliament is obviously different in a multitude of ways from other bodies and the role and working practices of MPs cannot easily be compared with those of any other group of people in this country. 'We recommend the phased introduction of a full parliamentary data and video network. It is a principal function of parliament to oversee the actions of the executive.' It added: 'MPs have a responsibility to represent their constituents effectively. The provision of a full network would increase the efficiency with which the House operates and the capacity of MPs to cope with increasing workloads.' , The service might also have the ability to receive satellite channels and news services, and the capacity to receive regional television channels. There may also be scope for replays-on-demand of video tapes of Commons debates.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Wilson Neill decides against brewery sale WILSON Neill, the New Zealand liquor group, has decided against selling the Tasmanian Cascade Brewery. The decision was announced as the group reported net losses of NZDollars 33.96m (USDollars 18.3m) for the year to June 30, compared with losses of NZDollars 54.7m for the previous 15 months. It said the losses were due to depressed trading conditions, high interest costs and write-downs on assets and brand values. The directors said that, after spending nine months looking for a suitable buyer, Cascade would not be sold. A price of NZDollars 140m had been expected.</p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A bus filled with workers ran off a road and rolled down a 900-foot slope in  South Africa, killing about 50 people and injuring 30. The bus was returning  black laborers and domestic workers to the black homeland of Transkei for the  weekend when the accident occurred near Port Shepstone, 60 miles southwest of  Durban in Natal province. There had been heavy rain in the region during the  day, but it was not immediately known whether weather was a factor in the  accident.  </P></p>

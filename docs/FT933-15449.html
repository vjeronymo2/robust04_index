			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Money Markets: French rates lower FRENCH franc interest rate futures enjoyed a small rise yesterday following the curr-ency's slightly stronger per-formance on the foreign exchanges, writes James Blitz. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said earlier this week that German inflation was slowly moving towards the bank's target level of 2 per cent. This comment continued to have a strong effect on the market, and dealers continued to speculate that the Bundesbank might cut its official interest rates before it starts its summer recess on July 29. France might then be able to reduce its intervention rate, currently at 6.75 per cent. The September French franc contract rose 8 basis points to close at 93.55, while the December contract moved up 6 basis points to finish at 94.27. Three-month French cash also dropped back slightly after appreciating strongly earlier in the week: yesterday it closed at around 7 per cent on the bid side, having been at around 7.06 per cent earlier in the day. There was little change in German markets following what appeared to be a neutral money market operation by the Bundesbank. A fixed rate repo of 7.30 per cent had already been announced last week for shorter dated maturities, and the variable rate facility was put at 7.33 per cent. The only issue concerning dealers yesterday was the size of the allocation of funds: but this amounted to a net drain of DM5.6bn, which was widely seen as a neutral move. The bullishness in UK markets about another base rate reduction continued yesterday, with futures dealers looking for another  1/2 percentage point in the winter. However, the short-dated contracts took a small fall after Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, said at the G7 summit that cuts in German rates did not imply cuts in UK rates. The September contract closed 4 basis points down at 94.29, and the December contract was 3 basis points off at 94.44. There was little change in three-month money, which again closed at 5 7/8 per cent. But again there were difficulties removing a Pounds 1.55bn shortage, because dealers were unwilling to offer bills to the Bank of England amid rumours of base rate cuts. The overnight rate was as high as 7.70 per cent at one stage.</p>

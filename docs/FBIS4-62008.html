			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] A statement by Adolfas Slezevicius, prime  minister and chairman of the ruling Democratic Labour Party, was  made public today.    The statement says that in the current situation of fragile  stability in the state of Lithuania, the idea of early Seimas  elections proposed by the Tautininkai Union and the Democratic  Party has in essence been dictated by petty party interests and  not by the interests of the state and the nation.    The most important thing now is stability in the state, the  prime minister maintains. According to him, signs of economic  and political stability can now be clearly seen in Lithuania,  and this is testified by the significantly reduced inflation,  stable national currency, and the formation of governmental  structures.    Adolfas Slezevicius says that western confidence in  Lithuania  is growing and that investments are growing, too. This is the  prospect for improving the currently hard life, the leader of  the ruling party said.    According to the statement, early Seimas elections would be  bring about yet more political and spiritual confusion,  unnecessary budget expenditure, and would waste people's  efforts.

			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / New town offers Pounds 25m assets sale The Irvine Development Corporation yesterday announced that it was putting its industrial assets up for sale in September at a price of Pounds 20m-Pounds 25m. The sale of the 1m sq ft of industrial buildings and development land will be a step towards the winding-up of the Ayrshire new town, which is planned for the end of 1996. The corporation's shops and office property portfolio will be put on the market in the autumn of 1995. The corporation said that this was the biggest sale of a Scottish new town's industrial assets and the first time a new town's industrial assets had been offered for purchase by a single buyer. The industrial portfolio consists of six industrial estates and three groups of workshops. So far there have been six sales of industrial estates in Scottish new towns, which have involved the sale of more than 3.5m sq ft of factories and development land, raising more than Pounds 50m. Last October Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, announced that the wind-up dates of Irvine new town, designated as Scotland's fifth new town in 1966, had been brought forward by three years. Livingstone and Cumbernauld new towns are also due to be wound-up in December 1996. East Kilbride and Glenrothes are scheduled for wind-up by December 1995.</p>

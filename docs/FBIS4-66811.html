			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stanley Theodore: "BJP Moots Panel To Decide on </F> Disinvestment"; first paragraph is THE STATESMAN introduction]    [Text] Hyderabad, March 21--Meanwhile, the pro-Advani group  at the BJP executive meeting has thwarted a move to amend the  party constitution to make the president's term of three years.    The Bharatiya Janata Party today demanded that a  "disinvestment commission" be set up by the Centre to decide on  the mode and timing of disinvestment of public sector units.    The party leader, Mr Murli Manohar Joshi, briefing the Press  on the second day of the party's national executive meeting  here, said that this commission should comprise financial  experts, bankers, share brokers, trade union leaders, investors  and Government nominees.    He said that though this step would lead to privatization,  it  had to be related to the exit policy. He said that the aims of  disinvestment should be made clear.    The BJP today released a statement calling for a total  rejection of the GATT proposals. Mr Joshi said that India can  get out of GATT and cited China as an example.    While adopting a resolution on the Union Budget, the BJP  demanded the following:     -  A ceiling on borrowings--both internal and  external--through a legislation under Article 195 of the  Constitution.    -  "Preferential treatment" given to multinationals  vis-a-vis domestic industries be stopped.    -  A complete ban on  entry of multinationals into the consumer goods sector.    -  The  proceeds from the dis-investment in PSUs [public sector units]  be used exclusively for retiring national debt so that the  interest liability could be reduced.     Agencies report: Meanwhile, the pro-Advani group in the  party  has succeeded in thwarting the move to amend the party  constitution to make the party president's term of three years  instead of the existing two consecutive terms of two years each.    This amendment had been proposed by the S.S. Bhandari  committee and has been the subject of heated debate in the party.    This and other amendments were circulated among the BJP  leaders late last night, and were to be discussed today. But  later, this amendment was deleted.    Nuclear deterrant: The party president, Mr L.K.  Advani, today said that India had "no option but to develop a  nuclear deterrant in view of the hostile attitude of its  neighbours."    He told reporters here that Pakistan had been claiming that  it possessed nuclear weapons and recent newspaper reports in the  United States had only confirmed this. He added that with the  United States deciding to supply F-16 fighter aircraft to  Pakistan, the arms race in the sub-continent would escalate  further. He added that Pakistan was not likely to go in for a  "hot war" with India since it would not get much mileage out of  it.    Pakistan's decision to close down its consulate in Bombay,  Mr  Advani said, was prompted by its setback at the human rights  meeting in Geneva recently.    Kashmir issue: Mr Advani said that the victory at  Geneva had not brought the country "an inch closer" to finding a  solution to the Kashmir problem. He added: "Anyone can  appreciate that the jawans cannot win a war with their hands  tied behind their backs, as it exists now."    Alliance: Asked if the BJP would sound the  All-India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam for an alliance in Tamil  Nadu, Mr Advani said elections in 10 States this year would be  discussed at the party meeting later today. All the party units  in these States had been asked to concentrate on building up the  party and not think of alliances, he said.</p>

			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (8): Dismal start to decade - Industry FOR the giants of Japanese industry, the 1990s have got off to a dismal start. The most obvious problem is the bursting of the asset bubble, which has caused severe damage to balance sheets and sharply raised the cost of finance. But in more fundamental terms, it is striking how many of Japan's key industrial sectors face quite specific difficulties of their own. The effects of a falling stock market, while real enough, may with luck prove temporary. Among the most publicised victims of the crash are companies which took advantage of soaring share prices in the late 1980s to raise cheap bond finance with stock warrants attached. Since the warrants are now worthless, the bonds must be refinanced at very much higher rates of interest - say, 6 per cent instead of 0.5 per cent. Some estimates put the sums involved at Dollars 140bn over the next four years, with the peak for refunding due next year. Formidable though this sounds, there seems little doubt that it can be afforded. First, as the Long Term Credit Bank of Japan argues, the money repaid will go back to the bond market. It will then presumably be reinvested in the new bonds which the companies issue to pay for the old. In addition, says Mr Yasuo Kanzaki of Nikko Securities, Japanese companies still carry huge amounts of cash on their balance sheets. 'A lot of companies still remember the days of 20 years ago when it was hard to raise money. So they still maintain unnecessary liquidity. That means they do not have to make demands on the banking system'. The problems of individual industries are another matter. Some of these may prove merely cyclical. Others may have to do with basic changes in Japanese patterns of work and consumption, which the bursting of the bubble has served merely to accelerate. In the traditional Japanese arena of consumer electronics, for instance, the problem is one of a glut of old products and a shortage of new ones. Mr Frank Ohgai, planning director of the audio-video business of the electronics giant Matsushita, gives the background. 'In the audio-visual business, it usually takes ten years for a product to get from introduction to maturity. The period 1945-55 brought the switch to transistor radios. In 1955-65 it was black and white TV, then in 1965-75 colour TV, then in 1976 video cassette recorders came along. In 1985 it was the turn of the compact disc. Now the audio-visual industry lacks a locomotive'. Mr Ohgai pins great faith on the success of high definition television to take up the running in the mid-1990s. In addition, he is optimistic about what are known in the industry as multi-media products, meaning home computers combined with audio-visual equipment. But as Mr Ohgai concedes, if these do not take off, the industry is in trouble. According to the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), if the electronics industry were to carry on solely with its existing products, the Japanese market would shrink by two thirds between now and the year 2000. As it is, the EIAJ forecasts that the market of will grow 2 1/2 times by then, which means it will have to consist almost wholly of products which do not yet exist. It seems a tall order. Similarly, the Japanese car industry is facing contraction in its domestic market for the first time in its history. In the old days, it would have responded by expanding its sales overseas. Now it faces two problems. First, the sharp increase in trade friction in the past decade, particularly acute in the US market, puts aggressive exporting out of the question. Second, Japanese car manufacturers are now huge overseas producers themselves. Honda, for example, makes more cars in the US than it does in Japan. For the Japanese construction industry, much hope is pinned on a surge in infrastructure and housing spending in the 1990s. Certainly, it seems plausible that in a country where only 44 per cent of houses are connected with a main sewer, there should be a great deal of catching up to do. But according to Mr Yoichi Uchida, senior economist with the Research Institute of Construction and Economy, it is not that simple. The 10-year programme concluded between Japan and the US under the Structural Impediment Agreement promises spending of Y430,000bn (Dollars 3,500bn) on infrastructure between 1991 and 2001. But that, says Mr Uchida, involves raising public investment by 6.3 per cent a year in real terms over the 10 years. Official projections are for growth in the Japanese economy of only 4.75 per cent over the period. In other words, public investment has to increase as a proportion of economic activity. But history, says Mr Uchida, points the other way. In the 1960s, public investment rose much faster than GNP. In the 1970s, it grew at about the same rate. In the 1980s it lagged behind. To reverse the trend would mean either an increase in the burden of taxation or a rise in government borrowing. The first is unpopular with the public, the second with the government itself. Behind all these individual problems are a group of familiar themes to do with shifts in Japanese society and the increase in trade friction. Japanese companies, it is now said, should pay more attention to generating return on equity than to expanding market share. Working hours should be reduced. The Japanese quality of life should be raised to reflect the country's standing in the world. Proclaiming the end of the Japanese industrial miracle has been fashionable for years. Since the bursting of the asset bubble - surely a transitory phenomenon - it has become more popular than ever. Those who underestimate the fundamental strength of the Japanese industrial machine do so at their peril. But there is no escaping the sense that the machine is becoming more mature and less different from its western rivals than it used to be. The bubble may only have hastened the process of change. But one way or another, large chunks of Japanese industry may never be the same again.</p>

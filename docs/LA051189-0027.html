			<p><P> May 11, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> Radio and television broadcasting in Britain was severely disrupted for the  second day in a row Wednesday as British Broadcasting Corp. journalists  continued a 48-hour strike. Most live broadcasts were canceled as senior  journalists, talk-show hosts and disc jockeys joined picket lines to demand 16%  wage increases. The state-funded corporation has refused to boost an offer of  7% although annual inflation has reached 7.9% and is expected to rise further.  BBC staff complain they earn considerably less than commercial television  employees doing comparable jobs. There was also a 24-hour strike last month.  ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

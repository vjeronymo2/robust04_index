			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAB COMPANY REQUESTS 18% FARE INCREASE  </P> <P> Saying it is faced with rising maintenance, labor and insurance costs, one of  the largest taxicab companies in Orange County wants to raise fares 18% in the  12 cities it serves.  </P> <P> Orange Coast Yellow Cab, which has more than 100 taxis, has proposed increasing  the charge for the first mile from $3.10 to $3.30, and raising the rate for  each additional mile from $1.40 to $1.60. The company has also proposed raising  the hourly waiting fee from $15 to $20.  </P> <P> By the proposed rates, the cost of taking a cab from the Newporter Inn in  Newport Beach to John Wayne Airport, for example, would rise from about $8.70  to $9.50.  </P> <P> "Drivers have had no increase in pay in at least three years, and everything is  going up on us, such as insurance and maintenance," said Bill Craig, manager of  taxi operations for Yellow Cab.  </P> <P> Orange Coast Yellow Cab serves Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Garden Grove,  Huntington Beach, Irvine, Newport Beach, Orange, Santa Ana, Seal Beach,  Stanton, Tustin and Westminster. The rate increase must be approved by each  city.  </P> <P> Without debate Monday night, the Newport Beach City Council voted 7 to 0 to  approve the increase. It is the first city to take up the proposal. Newport  Beach approved similar rate increases for the company in 1981 and 1985. The  change would apply to all cab companies operating in the city -- Diamond Cab,  California Sunshine Cab and West Coast Cab.  </P> <P> Craig said the company plans to have all the necessary approvals by Dec. 1 and  to raise all the rates at once.  </P></p>

			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Mexico to arrest seven officials MEXICO'S Attorney-General has ordered the arrest of seven former top officials of Seguros La Republica, the Mexican insurance company in which Commercial Union of the UK has a major stake. The officials are accused of falsifying financial information. Commercial Union says that it lost less than 1 per cent of group assets of Pounds 1.2bn as a result of misrepresentation of information both when it bought its stake and during the course of operations. Comercial Union has been forced to diloute its original stake of 46 per cent in the company after a Mexican partner injected capital to keep the company afloat. The fraud came to light last year, after Mr Carlos Hank Rhon, a Mexican businessman, bought out Mexican partners. He found that losses were much higher than had been reported - leading to an investigation and subsequent order of arrests of the former director-general, and other senior officials. Mr Jim Raffray, head of the international side of Commercial Union, said earlier this year that he was pleased with the 'very forceful' response of the Mexican authorities to the fraud. But he recommended future investors in Mexico make 'an extremely tough due diligence.' He said the Mexican government has not 'fully modernised their way of regulating the insurance industry.</p>

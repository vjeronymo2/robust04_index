			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / World Bond Markets: New York Last Friday's rally, which sent the 30-year yield back below 8 per cent, may not carry through into this week. Analysts expect that for the next month or so a weak dollar, renewed upward pressure on commodity prices, and another tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve will steadily push bond yields up towards 8.25 per cent or 8.5 per cent. Yields, in fact, may go above 8 per cent this week, which is packed with the sort of data that could unnerve investors if they contain hints of resurgent inflation or unexpectedly strong economic growth. The October employment report, due on Friday, will be the highlight. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette analysts forecast that non-farm payrolls will have risen by 230,000 in October. Growth above 270,000 could send bonds tumbling. The market will also have to absorb the National Association of Purchasing Management's index for October, and September personal income, manufacturers orders, leading economic indicators and single family home sales. If any of these figures are stronger than expected, the bond yield will probably breach 8 per cent again. The consensus is that the Fed will tighten policy on November 15, when its open market committee meets, by raising the Fed funds rate target by 50 basis points to 5.25 per cent.</p>

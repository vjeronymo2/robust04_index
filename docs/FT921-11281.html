			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities firmer on increased demand A LONDON stock market showing increasing confidence on the domestic outlook moved ahead strongly yesterday, brushing off potentially negative developments elsewhere in Europe and the US. Institutional buyers were noted again and the Footsie Index received a further boost from Rank Organisation, whose maintained dividend has helped confidence across the range of equities. London opened sharply higher behind a good performance from Wall Street overnight and took further encouragement from the stock index futures. The March contract on the Footsie, which has traded at a strong premium against cash all week, closed above 2,600 last night. At the day's best, the FT-SE Index itself was ahead by nearly 30 points at 2,580.2, the best level since October 18. Last October, confidence began to crack in the UK stock market as the Labour opposition party established a seven point lead in the public opinion polls and doubts were cast over Wall Street's performance. There was no immediate response in the London market yesterday to the strike decision by the German steel unions. However, share prices came off the top in late afternoon when Wall Street opened eight Dow points off in UK hours as Trans World Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection. At the close, the FT-SE Index was 20.4 higher on the day at 2,571.2. The first week of the equity trading account has seen the Footsie rise by 60.8 or about 2.4 per cent as opinion polls have indicated an improvement in the ratings of Mr Major's government. The economic outlook has remained less certain, with the Confederation of British Industry reporting falling confidence among its members. Trading volume, after falling away at first, has increased, and the Seaq system yesterday recorded 668.5m shares, comparing well with Thursday's 680.5m. More significantly, Stock Exchange statistics showed that retail, or customer business in equities, rose to Pounds 1.3bn on Thursday and traders believed that yesterday will confirm this improvement in genuine investment activity. Mr Ian Harnett of Strauss Turnbull commented that, with a relatively light corporate reporting list ahead and few testing levels nearby, the UK market could well attempt FT-SE 2,600 in the near future. But the UK bond market had a nervous session, closing with prices little changed from overnight as UK investors reacted to the uncertain trends on the US bond market. Some London analysts speculated whether the strike vote in Germany might provoke the Bundesbank to raise interest rates. Retail, or customer, volume in equities has begun to improve again and is now running well above last year's daily averages.</p>

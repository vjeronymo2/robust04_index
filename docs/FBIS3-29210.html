			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between Tokiwa University Professor Tomoaki Iwai </F> and Keio University Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi, moderated by  Meiji Gakuin University Professor Minoru Nakano, on 17 January  1994; place not given]    [Text] [Nakano] Let us start with the trend toward  political re-realignment.    [Iwai] Without the combination of the movements toward  splitting and unity, realignment will not occur. For the time  being, the trend toward splitting will not stop. I think a  "survival game" will continue for awhile.    [Nakano] I agree that the tendency to split is strong, and  integration will occur after the next general election. But I  also feel that if discussion on the division of election  districts occurs and the cabinet is reshuffled, then some  integration could take place.    [Kobayashi] My reading is different from Mr. Iwai's. I  think things will head in the direction of integration. Under  the single-seat election district system, one cannot win unless  he comes in first. Therefore, victory will be determined by  what the catchup [who against whom] is. There will be people,  in the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and in the coalition  government parties, who will lose their seats [be unable to  secure a candidacy] in the single seat electoral districts. [In  that sense] we can say that realignment has already begun in a  different direction, away from the previous framework. Take the  "Democrats," for instance. The Social Democratic Party of Japan  and the Japan New Party will be heading in the direction of  merger. It is also a fact that the Sakigake [Harbinger] Party  and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] have been meeting.    [Nakano] There are also some external factors: the  corruption scandals involving the major construction companies  have produced a ripple effect on the central political world.    [Kobayashi] That effect is significant. If the LDP receives  a great blow [from the scandals], the coalition government  parties may split into two groups. If the blow is not too  great, however, the coalition government parties will be obliged  to stick together. Under the single-seat electoral district  system, by next year at the earliest, in the fall of 1996 at the  latest, realignment will take place. This realignment will take  place before the general election rather than after. With  single-seat electoral districts, the result will be clear before  the election. With the single-seat districts, since everyone  wants to be on the winning side, they will go over to the more  advantageous side, regardless of its virtues.    [Iwai] Realignment will certainly be triggered by the  single-seat electoral district system, but I do not think the  parties will suddenly become integrated. In the provinces,  head-on fights of one against one may not be avoided, but in the  urban areas, each party will have an equal chance to fight. So  even under the single-seat electoral system, three to five  parties will emerge.    [Kobayashi] Splits will occur only on the premise that  integration will follow. It means that they will not just  temporarily disintegrate. I also do not think that there will  be a nationwide, unified integration right from the beginning.    [Nakano] We three have three different ideas, but they are  not all that far apart. I think, as Mr. Kobayashi said, that  splits and integration will occur in tandem. But still, it will  take some time before a permanent new "system" will be  established. It will not be clear after only one general  election. It is questionable if a system for political funding  and support will come into place in a year or so. Also, it is  unclear who the "top leader" will be.    [Kobayashi] As you say, a "structure" such as the 1955 one  will not be created in 1994. That will have to wait until after  the upper house election of July next year and the following  general election. It will become clear in a decade or so  whether that happened in 1996 or 1997.    [Iwai] The key will be whether they can tie a support  association-backed election race to the local political party  branch. They are still groping for [a way to secure] political  funds. But it is not certain whether political party  [financial] assistance can be an important factor for  integration. Still, overlapping candidacy is permitted, so 90  percent of those elected will come from single-seat electoral  districts. Therefore, basically, representatives from  single-seat electoral districts, as a system, will act as a  unifying force. The bulk of the struggle will be over the  single-seat constituencies.    [Kobayashi] The support associations will [make the  transition] smoothly. Political party subsidies will be  received, not by the party headquarters, but by the branch units  in each city, town, and village. Moreover, there will be  multiple regional branches, such as the youth and women's  divisions. Therefore, there will be as many as 120,000  recipient organizations. Hence, in contrast, the  representative's existing support organizations will continue to  exist. I think that a "division of labor" is quite possible.  What the problem is, rather, is whether this will lead to  regulations which will govern political funding or political  reform.  <H5>  Combinations for Political World Realignment </H5>   [Nakano] What do you think about combinations [of parties]  for realignment of the political world?    [Iwai] The simulations in every newspaper are based on  ideology. But the situation is more complex, including among  other things the existence of study groups. There are cases,  when adjustment of candidates is carried out skillfully, where  the situation is more advantageous without integration. The  Shinseito-Komeito relationship is a good example. Elections are  fought not by two major parties but by multiple parties. Yet,  when it comes to forming a government, the composition of LDP  against non-LDP will not change as long as the LDP is the  largest force. However, when it comes to policy decisions,  things can move beyond the framework of the parties. The  combining [of parties] is not simple. It has become clear that  the restraint [on members] by party decisions is an illusion.  This kind of trend will not be reversed. In [forming] a  government, some [party] combining will emerge, but combining  policies will be another matter.    [Kobayashi] As for the Heiritsu system [a combination of  single-seat districts and proportional representation], it is  possible for some parties to allocate candidates for both  single-seat districts and the proportional representation list.  But for other parties, it is not possible. A representative of  one of the coalition government parties said that "the  proportional district will be sufficient. Do not make me battle  the LDP in a single-seat election district." Unlike Mr. Iwai, I  do think that Shinseito and Komeito would have difficulty  pursuing their own courses. When Komeito runs a candidate in a  single-seat district, I am not sure if the Shinseito supporters  will vote for him without hesitation. It is easier to make an  allocation whereby Shinseito competes in the single-seat  election districts, and Komeito competes in the proportional  contest. Combinations will be determined by what the voters  want. Regrettably, political ideology will not likely be a key  factor.    [Iwai] The Japanese people feel that realignment of the  political world is mainly a subject of concern for Nagata-cho.  The newspapers wrote that "there will be a second act in the  new year," but nothing has fundamentally changed. It is more  like "act one, scene two."    [Kobayashi] On the contrary, restraint by party decision  will become more strict. That is the difference between the  Heiritsu system and the medium-sized election district system.  Victory in an election is only possible through cooperation  between parties. Independent activities cannot be permitted.  The [electorate] votes for a party in the proportional  competition. So here, subsidies to the parties will work as  shackles [on individual members].    [Iwai] As for funding, it cannot help but become tighter.  Because of the emergence of the multiple parties, it has become  a seller's market for candidates. For the next year or two we  do not know what will happen.    [Nakano] To begin with, the incentive for combining forces  is the election, and there are two "levels," namely, the  individual and party levels. The question is what is going to  happen so far as forming the government is concerned. First,  everyone wants to get reelected and, if possible, wants to gain  government power for the party he belongs to. That is the  representatives' true intention. What is deficient is that  policy is put forth only as a means or as a matter of  expediency, though sooner or later policy will become an issue.  That is where the voters are betrayed.  <H5>  Lack of Ideology/Ideas </H5>   [Nakano] Ideology and ideas are lacking in today's political  world. The important subjects today are countercyclical  measures and political reform. How should they be dealt with?    [Kobayashi] A political party should make its opinions clear  and should be bound by them. But in reality, this has not been  the practice. There is a saying that "for political parties and  politicians, election victory is an end in itself, and policy is  formulated to facilitate election victory." If one says  anything too radical, he cannot receive votes. So everyone's  policy becomes similar. Just as there is hardly any difference  between the Democratic and Republican Parties in the United  States, everyone becomes similarly moderate in each election  district. [The similarity of viewpoints is shown by the  following examples:] The rice issue has already been settled and  is at the stage to hand over subsidy money to the farmers. And  the UN issue is one everyone feels important. No one has an  answer for the countercyclical measure. I wonder if a more  clear-cut confrontation will occur not among the political  parties but, rather, between regions.    [Nakano] The Thatcher government in Great Britain tried  drastically to change the Labor Party's policy. But looking at  the budget, it was not all that different where welfare was  concerned. It was clear that policy was contracting in a  converging manner. Confrontation between political parties,  except with the Japan Communist Party [JCP], will not come up.    [Kobayashi] Opinion surveys, with relevance to political  realignment, have dealt with: first, the economic issue, whether  to emphasize national interests and eliminate monopolies or to  pursue deregulation and a free economy; second, the welfare  issue, whether to support the great burden of a high level of  welfare or a low level of welfare; and third, the constitutional  issue which includes the UN and Self-Defense Forces questions.  As for the first two issues, there are no clear differences of  view. In the single-seat electoral district in the United  states, the Democrats and Republicans say the same thing, so  elections are perfunctory. In Japan also, it is questionable  how much choice the voters have. Will democracy function [under  such circumstances]?    [Nakano] In three aspects -- between generations, between  regions, and against external pressures -- confrontations will  necessarily emerge. But none will arise from within the  political parties.    [Iwai] Japanese society prefers inclusive political  parties. In addition, everyone wants to appear agreeable in the  single-seat district system. So party positions will become  very similar. How much unity can they have when the trend is  that each Diet member will act on his own in making policy  decisions. When I analyze the United States, where there is  absolutely no party discipline, I find that there is party unity  for Congressional activities when it comes to issues on the tax  system, government versus private business, countercyclical  measures, and welfare. There is the issue of the  Constitution/Security Treaty that places special conditions on  Japan. The current realignment contains an excessively strong  personal element. Just as Shigeru Yoshida and Ichiro Hatoyama  united in the 1955 structure, logic which transcends [personal  differences] is needed. When elections, political power, and  actual parliamentary activities are not coherent, the voters  will be confused. It is a question as to what kind of verdict  the voters will hand out on the convenience of the politicians.  Ideals are important, but the question is how will they judge  achievements.    [Kobayashi] I am more pessimistic about Japan than about the  United States. There are hardly any national or local  referendums in Japan. In the United States, the regional and  class gap in society is coming to the surface. But in the  Japanese framework, very little regulatory power for dealing  with regional differences and economic classes is found in the  LDP or in the coalition government parties. Each party has its  own party constraints, but I think they are heading in the  direction of not absorbing the differences in the ideals held by  the voters, more so than in the United States. Moreover, from  the beginning, they have abandoned the framework of direct  democracy which could compensate for this deficiency.    [Nakano] If party politics cannot deal with such a  discrepancy, what can?    [Kobayashi] It is difficult under the single-seat district  system, because they cannot win an election unless the oppressed  class reaches the 51 percent line. It means that minority  opinion will be excluded more than ever.    [Nakano] What about the bureaucratic system?    [Kobayashi] The bureaucratic system will be strengthened. I  do not know whether two or three major parties will emerge. But  in the situation of a power struggle, the bureaucratic presence  will grow. When MITI opposes, political power will be stalled.  Bureaucratic power will keep growing, and the bureaucrats and  vocal people, rather than the voters, will have their way.    [Nakano] I agree. Under a bureaucratic system, the minority  will have an easier time riding the tyranny of the special  interests. Under the current political reform, the ideals of  party politics will go further away.    [Iwai] The bureaucratic system has been fiercely seeking  legitimacy under the imperial system, the GHQ [General  Headquarters of the U.S. occupation forces in Japan after World  War II], and the LDP. Now Mr. Ichiro Ozawa intervenes in  bureaucratic personnel matters, and tries to increase the number  of parliamentary vice ministers. The bureaucrats' keiretsu  phenomenon will probably occur too, and conflict between the  bureaucracy and politicians will arise. The bureaucrats will  emerge representing the interests of the silent majority, whom  the political party can not rescue. The composition of  bureaucratic control will become more and more ingenious with  the support of the public opinion.  <H5>  The Future of Japanese-Style Democracy </H5>   [Nakano] What do we think about the future of Japanese-style  democracy? As for the party political system, last year, Prime  Minister Hosokawa predicted that "it would be a moderate  multiple-party system." Will it be a two-major-party system or  a multiple-party system? Will it be like the American system  where slogans are just words and the important factor is the  individual politician himself, or will it be like the British  system where the party plays the greatest role? Or will it be  satisfactory to continue with the current bureaucracy-dependent  style? Absolutely no discussion has been made on these points.  What worries me the most is that every party talks about, yet,  in actuality, has nothing to do with, an international  perspective.    [Kobayashi] As for the ideal form, it should be one placing  priority on the people, rather than on party, politics, or  bureaucracy. Whether it be two major parties or three, the  choices of parties would be only three or four that have a  policy on every issue. As for the "moderate multiple-party  system," what constitutes a multiparty system? In reality, it  will be two plus the JCP or three plus the JCP. Whichever it  is, it will inevitably be a party-oriented rather than  politician-oriented system. Unlike in the United States, we do  not have primary elections. So the party, rather then the  electorate will determine the candidates. If one opposes the  party leadership, one cannot become a candidate.    [Nakano] What about the central and regional relationship?    [Kobayashi] There would not be much change in the central  versus regional relationship. The regional governments have no  autonomous authority to levy taxes. Only Tokyo, Osaka,  Kanagawa, and Aichi could have fiscal independence.    [Iwai] The Ministry of Finance will not let go of their  authority to levy taxes. And the regional governments will not  want to involve themselves because they have neither the human  resources nor the know-how.    [Nakano] It would be different if the system were  changed from the current one of local municipalities to a  broader area block system such as the Do-Shu system [similar to  a state system].    [Kobayashi] Even if Shikoku is made into a block, for  instance, it will have a much smaller tax base when compared to  the capital region.    [Iwai] I think it would be easier to obtain a national  consensus on securing equality rather than admitting inequity  among regions. What kind of equality do we want to secure?  Would it be better to switch to the American/European type  right away? We must grope for a form of regional autonomy  different from the current one and must secure vitality and  equality.    [Kobayashi] I agree. We can tolerate private enterprises  going bankrupt, but not the local regions, because the whole  premise is that if that happens equal competition can not be  possible.    [Iwai] When we disperse authority, the concentration of  power in one place occurs in reverse. As for the fields of  transportation and communications alone, the cost is higher in  the local areas. We should have bold ideas, such as adopting a  flat fee throughout Japan.    [Nakano] Still, the centralization of power is too strong.  I think we could have a little more diversification of power.    [Iwai] It is not clear how we can define Japanese-style  democracy. The slogan came first, but no definition has been  made.  <H5>  Will People's Political Consciousness Change? </H5>   [Nakano] Will the Japanese people's political consciousness  change through electoral system reform?    [Kobayashi] I think affirmatively about the point that the  people can choose the governing authority under the Heiritsu  system. The opposition parties have no choice but to unite. The  kind of irresponsible policies we have experienced in the past  will not be established, in the sense that people can choose a  governing authority which submits achievable policies. In this  sense, the people's consciousness will change. What I want to  ask, rather, is if the politician's consciousness will change by  this reform.    [Iwai] In last year's general election, the voting rate was  really low. We can also say that it has become a theatrical  style. If the people who participate in exercising their choice  become a minority, the voice of the silent majority will be  heard even less. If there is no party the people can choose, the  distance between the Japanese people and society will develop  further. Every party will try to please everybody and will  become the interest-induction type.    [Kobayashi] Responsibility lies on the side of the parties.  Even if there are voters who do not want to choose a party and  the rate of voter abstention goes up, there is no damaging  effect for the parties or for the politicians. Unless we set a  minimum number of votes one must obtain to get elected, no  politician will suffer.    [Nakano] When I look at the years when a change of  government took place, namely 1976, 1979, 1983, 1986, and 1993,  the inconsistencies contained in Japanese style democracy gushed  to the surface, triggered by the tax hike and the large scale  political corruption. What would be the points that will surely  emerge under the new system?    [Iwai] The fact that we can choose the governing power is a  great factor, so the politicians will have to be serious and  tense. If it is to be party-dominated politics, I think it would  be better that the interest distribution should be left to the  greater discretion [for the party]. For instance, give them  power over personnel in the bureaucracy.    [Kobayashi] Under the position-seeking system in the United  States, those who gave in the election campaign openly join the  administration.    [Nakano] What do you think about having the Ministry of  Finance's budget making authority handed over to the parties?    [Kobayashi] It would be different if we are to adopt the  presidential system, but then, what would we do with the  imperial system? Coexistence would be difficult. Japanese  politics would improve if we placed greater expectations on the  electorate rather than on the political parties, through the  introduction of national referendums and so on.    [Iwai] Anyway, such a supplemental system is necessary.    [Nakano] Only the problem is that those who decide that are  also the politicians.</p>

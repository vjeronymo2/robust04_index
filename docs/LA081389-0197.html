			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY DOGS TUSTIN FIRM'S LASERS  </P> <P> Enamored of the magic of lasers, Wall Street a year ago believed that Trimedyne  Inc., a small Orange County biotech company, would burn a sure path to success.  It grew rapidly after winning the race to market the first laser designed to  open plaque-clogged arteries.  </P> <P> But today, the company that set out to revolutionize the treatment of  cardiovascular disease has fallen on hard times, proving that it takes more to  win the following of the medical profession than a sales seal of approval from  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> The stock in the Tustin firm, after soaring to $24 a share last August, has  plunged to $6.75 in the wake of the decline in business. Sales and earnings  have been sliding for nine months, and after eight consecutive profitable  quarters, the company reported a loss: $546,000 for the fiscal third quarter  ended June 30.  </P> <P> Trimedyne officials say that profits are depressed in part because the company  has substantially stepped up its spending for marketing and new product  research and development to prepare for the future. Wall Street was "spoiled"  by the company's extraordinary earnings growth last year, they say. But far  more troubling for the company's prospects is a dispute that has emerged over  the effectiveness of the technology on which Trimedyne has built its business.  </P> <P> "There have been mixed results. There is no lack of controversy" over the value  of the technology, said David L. Duclos, medical technology analyst with  Wessels, Arnold &amp; Henderson, a securities brokerage in Minneapolis.  </P> <P> It did not begin that way. In March, 1987, Trimedyne obtained permission from  the FDA to begin marketing the first laser device that could sear through  clogged leg arteries.  </P> <P> Trimedyne promoted the device as a breakthrough in the fight against  cardiovascular disease. Cardiovascular problems, through strokes and heart  attacks, are the leading cause of death in this country, and they account for  $85 billion of the nation's annual health-care budget.  </P> <P> Trimedyne's laser-heated metal probe held the promise of being able to bore  through otherwise impassable arteries, thus making bypass surgery unnecessary.  With the laser, it was hoped, patients could be treated at far less cost and  with much less pain. Laser-assisted treatment of blocked arteries costs $6,000  to $8,000, Trimedyne says; the cost of bypass surgery, by contrast, is $20,000  to $35,000.  </P> <P> Although the FDA approved the Trimedyne probe only as a treatment for  arteriosclerosis in the legs, the company was expected to soon penetrate the  much larger and lucrative market for treatment of blocked heart arteries.  Trimedyne has estimated potential laser-system sales of $1 billion a year for  leg and heart applications together.  </P> <P> As soon as the FDA determined that the Trimedyne laser was safe and effective  enough, sales of the device exploded. In little more than two years, the  company has sold 550 lasers to medical centers worldwide and more than 25,000  patients have been treated with them, the company says.  </P> <P> The initial welcome that the medical profession offered the laser technology  was enough to take the company's sales from $12 million for its fiscal 1987 to  $31 million for its fiscal 1988, and also to prompt the company to move to  larger quarters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sales Fell Off  </P> <P> But laser sales began tapering off last winter amid reports that many of the  doctors who had plunked down $96,000 apiece for the lasers were using them  little, if at all.  </P> <P> In addition, reports of studies conducted at UCI Medical Center and at Mount  Sinai Medical Center in New York concluded that the Trimedyne laser probe  causes complications that include perforations of artery walls and that it may  not be any more effective than older mechanical and much less expensive  treatments such as angioplasty.  </P> <P> Trimedyne also began facing competition. Another company recently obtained FDA  approval to market a raw laser energy system for treating leg arteries, and  many other competitors are developing devices that they predict will cut into  Trimedyne's market share.  </P> <P> Before the Trimedyne laser, physicians were treating blocked arteries without  surgery using a technique called "balloon angioplasty," in which a tiny balloon  is threaded through an artery on a catheter, then expanded to crush the plaque  and open a path for blood to flow.  </P> <P> The Trimedyne laser has not replaced balloon angioplasty; rather, it works in  tandem. The Trimedyne device is a catheter tipped with metal that is heated by  laser energy, and it is intended to open a passageway through the most densely  clogged arteries; after the passageway is opened, a balloon catheter can be  inserted.  </P> <P> It was hoped that the laser could open arteries that balloon angioplasty alone  could not and that it would significantly reduce the high incidence of  recurring blockages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Results of UCI Study  </P> <P> Dr. Jonathan Tobis, a cardiologist at UC Irvine, said the hypothesis was that  the laser-heated probe would bore through the middle of an artery by vaporizing  the calcified plaque in its path. Instead, he said, a study at UCI, published  in the June issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, shows  that the laser probe vaporizes very little plaque and that it takes a path of  least resistance through arteries in much the same way a purely mechanical  device such as a wire would.  </P> <P> Tobis said he found that although the laser does not penetrate plaque, it will  sometimes burn holes in the artery itself.  </P> <P> Even more detrimental to Trimedyne's stature on Wall Street was a report on a  clinical study of the Trimedyne laser presented by Dr. Martin Harrington of  Mount Sinai Medical Center. Harrington made his remarks at a meeting of the  International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery in June in New York.  </P> <P> The study tracked the results of Trimedyne laser treatments on 64 patients. In  some, according to a summary, the treatment resulted in puncture wounds and  bleeding that in one case led to death.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Should Be Studied'  </P> <P> Harrington said in an interview that in 20% of the cases, the laser probe was  not able to cut through the plaque. "And in about half of the cases in which  the laser opened the artery," he said, "the passage blocked up again within  eight months."  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that they probably have to do more work on the laser,"  Harrington said. "We think it is something that should be studied in a few  centers. I wouldn't say every hospital in town or even every city should have  one."  </P> <P> Howard Cooper, Trimedyne president and chief executive, bristles at the mention  of the Mount Sinai report, which precipitated an immediate drop in Trimedyne's  stock price. He said the study involved exceptionally severe cases of artery  disease. He also contends that the results "are more positive than portrayed,"  because, he said, in most instances the laser therapy prevented the need for  amputation. He argued that the results of most other clinical studies of the  Trimedyne laser have been favorable.  </P> <P> Cooper defends the importance of the Trimedyne laser, but he also acknowledges  that current laser technology is such that it cannot be seen as the cure for  artery blockages.  </P> <P> "Initially, when we got FDA approval, we were optimistic that every leg" with  an artery blockage "could be treated with the laser," he said. "Now it looks as  if we could treat 30% of the cases."  </P> <P> He says he also would like to see a lower recurrence rate for blockages in legs  treated with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. It ranges from 7% to 45%, he  said, depending on the severity of the original blockage.  </P> <P> Doctors said they were not surprised by the shortcomings of the Trimedyne  laser, which they consider a first-generation technology. They point out,  though, that they often have difficulty convincing their patients that lasers  are not perfect.  </P> <P> "We have patients who read articles in the newspapers who think lasers are the  miracle cure for vascular disease, and there is no question they are not," said  Dr. Barry T. Katzen, director of the Miami Vascular Institute.  </P> <P> Dr. Richard Doering, a vascular surgeon at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, said  the hospital owns a Trimedyne laser system but that it has used it in fewer  than "a dozen cases" in the last year and a half. "I'm convinced it has a very  limited place in the treatment of patients with obstructed arteries," he said.  </P> <P> By contrast, Dr. Ted Diethrich, cardiovascular surgeon and medical director of  the Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix, has used the Trimedyne laser in more  patients -- 1,800 -- than any other physician. Diethrich says that it has  helped to clear 75% of leg arteries that otherwise would be impenetrable. He  adds that the recurrence of artery blockage with the laser-assisted treatment  is only 10% less than occurs after using balloon angioplasty alone.  </P> <P> Whether the Trimedyne laser system is effective for the heart is even more  uncertain, vascular surgeons and cardiologists say. The uncertainty is partly  because fewer procedures have been performed in the heart. Application of a hot  laser probe in the heart is more difficult, they say, because heart arteries  are narrower, they twist more, and any mishap would pose considerably more  danger.  </P> <P> Diethrich said that he has participated in surgical trials using the Trimedyne  laser-heated probe in the heart for two years and that he is "not too  enthusiastic" about the results. "We can't get across the lesions" with the  Laserprobe "in a high percentage of cases" he said.  </P> <P> "I think the major disappointment with the Trimedyne system is that it probably  is not going to be useful in the heart," said Dr. Frank Litvack, co-director of  the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los  Angeles. There is concern, he said, that a hot probe inserted in a tiny  coronary artery can cause spasms or clotting.  </P> <P> Still, Trimedyne, which has been testing a coronary laser in human clinical  trials since 1986, expects to file an application for FDA marketing approval  before the end of the year, Cooper said.  </P> <P> Marvin Loeb, Trimedyne's chairman and founder, predicted that if such approval  is obtained, the company's earnings would again increase dramatically.  </P> <P> Litvack, however, said he believes that the Trimedyne technology "will be  supplanted by simpler and more effective technology both in the laser field and  in non-laser mechanical devices."  </P> <P> Litvack said he is a consultant to a company that is developing an excimer  laser, a so-called "cold laser" that cuts through plaque with short bursts of  ultraviolet light. This laser eliminates the heat that may damage an artery.  </P> <P> Trimedyne officials responded that most of such touted new technologies have  not been proven. Moreover, they stress that Trimedyne is not standing still.  </P> <P> Since obtaining FDA approval for the first laser-heated probe, Trimedyne has  obtained clearance to market 10 more leg artery probes of different sizes. It  also has begun marketing a newer device that combines laser heat with the  emission of a bare laser light that they believe shows more promise in cutting  through calcified plaque. And further down the Trimedyne research and  development pipeline is a cold laser system of its own.  </P> <P> "Everybody thinks once you've got an FDA approval, you don't need to do any  more research and development," Cooper said. "High technology doesn't work that  way, particularly in the biomedical field."  </P> <P> Cooper said that Trimedyne is still a developing-stage company that should not  be expected to sustain the quarter-to-quarter growth that impresses Wall Street  investors. He said that the company has a strong balance sheet and that it is  paying for all of its research from revenue, without taking on debt.  </P> <P> Trimedyne's decision to go public in 1982 was necessary to help it raise funds  to develop its laser technology and enter commercial production, Cooper said.  In all, the company has raised $11.8 million through a combination of private  and public stock sales and warrants.  </P> <P> He agrees that Trimedyne must sell more lasers and persuade doctors to use the  lasers they have. Trimedyne's long-term business strategy relies heavily on  repeat business from the sale of probes, which cost $460 to $625 apiece and are  disposed of after each use.  </P> <P> The company refuses to say how many probes it has sold by quarter, which would  show just how often the lasers are being used.  </P> <P> Cooper acknowledges, however, that "short-term expectations were too high. We  had a lot to learn about the market. It is a matter of educating the doctors."  </P> <P> TRIMEDYNE: FALLING ON HARD TIMES  </P> <P> A year ago Trimedyne, an Orange County bio-tech company, was headed for  success. The excitement was centered on its approval to begin marketing the  first laser-assisted device to open clogged arteries.  </P> <P> THE LASERPROBE: HOW IT WORKS  </P> <P> 1. The physician creates a needlelike puncture and threads a thin catheter into  the artery.  </P> <P> 2. The Laserprobe is inserted through the catheter. The laser's heat burns a  tiny path through the artery.  </P> <P> 3. The laser is withdrawn and a tiny balloon is threaded through the artery to  widen the channel that the Laserprobe has created.  </P> <P> Source: Trimedyne  </P> <P> THE LASERPROBE: COMPLICATIONS  </P> <P> Studies conducted at UC Irvine Medical Center and Mount Sinai Medical Center in  New York show that the Laserprobe can deflect off the hardest plaque, in some  cases perforating the artery.  </P> <P> Source: UC Irvine Medical Center  </P></p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Painful decision of a friend and pragmatist It was always the most likely outcome. After three weeks of agonising Mr Gordon Brown has accepted that he cannot become leader of the Labour party - at least this time round. Mr Brown's fulsome statement of support for Mr Tony Blair, his main rival on the party's ascendant modernist wing, is in line with their longstanding political alliance. It also underlines the continuing friendship between the two men, although their relationship has been strained by Mr Blair's emergence as the runaway leadership favourite. Most of all, however, Mr Brown's announcement reflects his reluctant acceptance of the Labour party's judgment that Mr Blair looks more likely to win a general election. It was a painful decision for a man who has devoted his adult life to the Labour party, and who was regarded until recently as a more heavyweight figure than Mr Blair. Mr Brown, shadow chancellor, has borne the brunt of Labour's determination to avoid damaging spending commitments before the next election. His handling of the key economics portfolio has avoided the spending traps that cost Labour dear at the 1992 election - but left him looking mean and cautious to the party rank and file. By contrast, Mr Blair, shadow home secretary, has built a reputation for common sense and moderation with an effective attack on government law and order policies. Mr Brown's friends said he wanted to avoid a battle with Mr Blair which could have done 'enormous damage' to the winner's hopes of defeating the Tories in the next general election. They admitted that he was trailing Mr Blair among constituencies and union members, but claimed that support was equally split among backbench MPs, shadow ministers and union leaders. One close friend said: 'He believes he could have beaten Tony over the six weeks of the campaign, but it would have been too damaging to the party.' Much of this was taken with a pinch of salt by supporters of rival candidates, who believe that Mr Blair has established an almost unassailable lead in all sections of the party. There was also some irritation at the timing of the announcement, which will inevitably detract from coverage of Labour's European election campaign. One MP said acidly: 'I thought the agreement that no-one would comment on the leadership covered withdrawals from the race as well as campaign statements.' The mood of the party was more accurately expressed by Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, who was a prominent supporter of Mr Brown. Mr Dewar, who will now switch his support to Mr Blair, said the decision would remove uncertainty and enhance Mr Brown's position and stature in the party. It will certainly do that. As part of a deal with Mr Blair, Mr Brown has been guaranteed the job of shadow chancellor until the next election, and chancellor if Labour wins. That was expected. But he will also have control of Labour's wider economic policy, including issues such as business competitiveness and social justice. This wider brief will make Mr Brown by far the most influential member of Mr Blair's team. If it works, it could promote a cohesive economic approach across the shadow cabinet. But it could also lead to clashes with other shadow ministers, including Mr John Prescott, employment spokesman, and Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary. The two men, both seen as traditionalists, have a difficult relationship with Mr Brown and there have been angry arguments about the development of economic policy. Both remain potential candidates for either the leadership or deputy leadership, with Mrs Margaret Beckett, the traditionalist acting leader, and Mr Jack Cunningham, the rightwing shadow foreign secretary. Labour MPs said all four were still considering their positions, although Mr Cunningham was regarded as highly unlikely to risk contesting either post. Mr Cook is being wooed by Mr Blair's camp, which believes that his support would remove any lingering doubts about the outcome of the election. Mrs Beckett is widely expected to stand for re-election as deputy leader, possibly as part of a balanced left/right ticket with Mr Blair. Mr Prescott's friends say he is determined to stand for one of the leadership posts, if only to force the modernists to debate the party's future before Mr Blair is crowned leader. Mr Prescott is unlikely to defeat either Mr Blair or Mrs Beckett, but his standing might be strengthened if he were seen to have prevented a ritual anointment of the new leader. For Mr Brown, the immediate battle is over. He will work for Mr Blair in the knowledge that victory for the shadow home secretary would leave the party's modernists in virtually unchallenged control. But if the battle is over, the war is not. If Mr Blair won the leadership but lost the general election his hold on the job would be vulnerable to challenge within three years. If Mr Blair won the election he could be Labour leader for a decade. But at 43, Mr Brown could be in the party's top ranks for another 20 years. He knows that his time may come.</p>

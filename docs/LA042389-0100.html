			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EGYPT TO VOTE UNDER NEW SYSTEM  </P> <P> President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday dissolved Egypt's upper house, the  consultative Shura Council, and called for elections in June under a new system  aimed at making it more democratic.  </P> <P> The council, one-third of whose members are appointed by the government, has no  legislative powers but studies government financial bills and recommends new  regulations to the People's Assembly (Parliament).  </P> <P> The elections will be held under amended electoral rules designed to counter  challenges to the validity of the law under which the council was elected nine  years ago.  </P> <P> Political parties and independents will be allowed to stand for election to a  new 258-seat council, expanded from 210 members.  </P></p>

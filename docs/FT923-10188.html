			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / London economy expected to decline GREATER LONDON will show the weakest economic performance of the main British regions this year, with a fall in output of 0.8 per cent, according BSL Business Strategies, an economic consultancy. Its latest regional outlook forecasts that the UK economy as a whole will grow by a minimal 0.1 per cent this year. Output will rise slightly in the second half, with growth of UK gross domestic product quickening to 2.8 per cent next year. BSL says regional growth differentials will remain relatively small as growth gets under way, contrasting with experience in the 1980s. Mr David Fell, BSL's principal economist, said: 'We do not expect the re-emergence of a strong north-south divide.' BSL expects that East Anglia and the north-west will head the regional growth league this year with GDP increases of 1 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively. It believes that the south-east will be the strongest-growing area in 1993, with 3.3 per cent growth, although within that region Greater London will continue to perform relatively badly. Greater London's GDP is expected to grow at the national average rate of 2.8 per cent next year. Job losses in the capital since 1988 will have totalled 450,000 by next year.

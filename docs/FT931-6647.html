			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Revelations fuel senior employees' concerns THE REVELATIONS of alleged fraud this week has fuelled concern among senior Salvation Army employees. They believe that a recent restructuring, which separated the UK financial operations from international operations, allowed the scandal to take place, a senior source close to the charity said last night. Although the leadership is not accused of any wrongdoing, there is concern in the organisation about its management style. 'The news has come as a real shock to us workers,' a Salvation Army worker said yesterday as he stood stacking hymn sheets in a dusty church hall. 'But then perhaps we don't really understand the money side of things as well as we should.' Founded in the early 19th century by Victorian phil-anthropist William Booth, the charity first made its name fighting urban poverty. A century later its task remains broadly similar. With an overall membership of 2m, the charity conducts work among the poor, dispossessed and homeless in 94 countries. It claims to be one of the largest voluntary groups in the world, and in Britain is the second-largest provider of social services. Nevertheless, the central tenets of the organisation remain little changed - workers speak of their crusade as a 'war', in which discipline is paramount. The result is a management style which, as a charity accountant noted, is distinctly 'autocratic'. Adherents claim these values create commitment. Critics say that it has made many in the organisation dangerously trusting over finances. So far obedience has dampened open dissent, and officers have been told not to talk to the press. Captain Charles King, editor of the organisation's vividly named War Cry magazine, said: 'The general attitude is that we should get on with the work we're doing. We don't exist to make a profit, but to help people.' But debate is growing, fuelled by the forthcoming election of the 'general'  -the highest rank in the charity. Recent issues of the charity's Salvationist journal have printed letters calling for greater transparency in financial and management matters. One worker in London said yesterday: 'All our accounts are published. But human nature being what it is people just don't bother to read them.' Salvation Army workers deny the affair has caused a decrease in donations or affected their annual collecting campaign.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Wickes confident despite Pounds 6.72m loss WICKES, the DIY and timber group which ran into severe financial problems as a result of an ill-judged acquisition, yesterday said it was turning round in spite of the continuing recession and an annual pre-tax deficit of Pounds 6.72m. In the second half, the group produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 6.2m, although this was not sufficient to offset a first half deficit of Pounds 12.9m. Last year it incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 7.85m. Sales in the year fell from Pounds 623.9m to Pounds 526.8m. Losses per share were reduced to 2.1p (3.5p). No dividend is declared although the company said it was its intention to resume dividends in 1992. Mr Henry Sweetbaum, chairman, said the turnround was the result of corrective action taken at the end of 1990 to sort out its troubled Hunter and Malden timber businesses. 'As both these business move into profit the bleeding that has been so painful over the past 18 months will come to a stop,' he said. Wickes's core DIY retailing businesses continued to perform strongly with its UK division increasing pre-tax profits by 24 per cent. The operations in mainland Europe produced an 80 per cent improvement in pre-tax profits. During the first half of this year the group will open Wickes was able to cut borrowings substantially following a rights issue in March. Debt fell by Pounds 53m to Pounds 87.9m. Mr Sweetbaum said there had been little sign of economic recovery but he was nevertheless confident of an improving trend in profitability. COMMENT The strength of Wickes's core business has never been in doubt even though its disastrous diversification into timber threatened its very survival. And with the numbers on the timber side eventually heading the right way, Wickes is re-emerging as a plausible recovery play. The company's specialist niche at the heavy end of the DIY market has protected it from the flak of the price war that has recently beset the mainstream DIY sector and it has continued to make encouraging progress in mainland Europe. Assuming no further nasty lurches in the economy, analysts are looking for pre-tax profits of Pounds 15m in the current year which offers a prospective multiple of almost 17 on yesterday's share price, which was 2p higher at 66p. Wickes's attractions have hardly gone unnoticed by the market but the shares may still offer good value on any weakness.</p>

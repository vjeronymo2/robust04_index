			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (1): Political heat grows - In business, politics and culture, Canada's francophone province has become one of North America's most vibrant regions / A look at Quebec's assertive industrial strategy and some bulwarks of its economy POLITICAL TURMOIL has always been among the least troubling concerns for anyone doing business in Canada, but not this year. The question whether this vast country will remain in one piece and, even if it does, how it will in future be governed, is worrying business people and politicians alike. The ups and downs of the currency and bond markets in Toronto and Montreal are explained these days as much by the mood in the hothouse of constitution-writing as by the latest GDP or CPI numbers. At the centre of Canada's latest and most searing identity crisis is French-speaking Quebec - as it has been at almost every period of stress in the Canadian federation for the past 125 years. The linguistic and cultural divide between Canada's 'two solitudes' has opened a similar rift on economic and political issues between the 6.5m Quebecers (about four in five of whom are French-speaking) and their 20m English-speaking countrymen. As their horizons have broadened over the past 30 years, Quebecers have gained confidence in their ability to be maitres chez nous (masters of our own house). At the same time, however, the insecurity that comes from trying to sustain a distinct culture in North America makes Quebecers nervous of compromise, especially with Canada's nine other provinces. A hard-core group of separatists, supported by about 20 per cent of Quebecers, has found a wider audience over the past two years for their dream of a quasi-independent state. A sovereign Quebec, so the nationalists argue, would not only guarantee a secure future for the French language and culture in North America, but could generally run its affairs without the inefficient interference of Ottawa or the other provinces. Events over the past two years have provided fertile ground for the dreams of the separatist Parti Quebecois. A rash of petty anti-French incidents in other parts of Canada, most memorably a group of elderly bigots in rural Ontario stomping over a Quebec flag, played into the hands of the separatists. So did the collapse in June 1990 of the Meech Lake accord, which would have given Quebec a number of extra powers and recognised its distinct identity, in exchange for its signature on the 1982 Canadian constitution. Besides feeling rejected by the rest of the country, many Quebecers had ample reason in 1990 to believe that the cost of going it alone would be easy to bear. Buoyed by the successes of a new generation of assertive French-speaking entrepreneurs, the corporatist state of Quebec Inc. was riding high. No other Canadian province was more enthusiastic about the 1989 US-Canada free trade agreement. Quebecers were assured that their economy was as big and robust as Austria's or Denmark's. Often more at home with Americans than with English-speaking Canadians, Quebecers assumed that the economic costs of a break with Canada could be compensated for by closer links with the US. Yet although by late 1990 and through much of 1991 a clear majority of Quebecers was tilting towards some form of independence, the pendulum has recently started to swing in the other direction, and much of the enthusiasm for a break-up has dissipated. Quebec is set to hold a referendum on its political future by the end of October. Whether the question will invite an outright yes or no to sovereignty, or whether it will merely gauge support for proposals from the rest of Canada for a new constitution, there is a growing sense that Canada will survive in one piece - at least for the time being. A split, if it does happen, is less likely to be caused by any hell-bent desire for independence on the part of Quebec, than by regional jealousies in other parts of the country, especially the western province of Alberta. Canada, including Quebec, is still sadly lacking in politicians bold enough to put the national interest ahead of their narrow, regional biases. In fairness, the recent turnaround in public opinion within Quebec does owe almost as much to cooler heads in the rest of the country as it does to disenchantment with separatism. The separatists' cause has been damaged, too, by political and economic developments, some of their own making. With the exception of neighbouring Ontario, Quebec has been hit harder by the recession than any other part of Canada. Unemployment in the province is now above 12 per cent, and is likely to stay in double digits for some time. Forestry and mining, two cornerstones of the provincial economy, are struggling to overcome not only a worldwide drop in commodity prices, but also their own high costs. The province's vulnerability to forces beyond its control was underlined last March, when the New York Power Authority cancelled a CDollars 17bn electricity contract with Hydro-Quebec, the huge government-owned power utility. The cancellation means, at best, a two-year delay on the next stage of the world's biggest hydro-electric scheme on the rivers flowing into Hudson Bay. Meanwhile, federalist business leaders in Quebec, both English and French-speaking, are becoming more outspoken in warning of the costs of a split. 'No one is suggesting for one minute that the battle is won,' says one prominent Montreal businessman. 'But things are definitely going in the right direction.' Although the separatists can draw on innumerable studies to claim that an independent Quebec would not be much worse off, they have had difficulty demonstrating that a break from Canada would bring tangible benefits. Federalists, on the other hand, can tick off a long list of likely costs, from the loss of federal civil-service jobs to the possibility that Quebec would have to renegotiate the free trade agreement with the US, and the threat of ugly border disputes with Canada and with Quebec's own aboriginal people. The separatists have weakened their own cause by trying to have it both ways. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the Parti Quebecois leader, has suggested for instance that an independent Quebec would want to retain the Canadian dollar. Banks already report a stream of inquiries from Quebecers worried that their savings might suddenly be converted into a new - and probably weaker - currency. Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister and himself a bilingual Quebecer, has seized on such fears to warn that Canada is not a 'buffet' from which they can pick and choose. There is a growing realisation on all sides that independence negotiations would be a messy, and probably nasty, business. The message of the bloody break-ups of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union has not been lost on Quebec, or, for that matter, on the rest of Canada. The separatists' cause was further hurt in early May by political scandal. Mr Claude Morin, one of most senior ministers in the Parti Quebecois government in the late 1970s, admitted that he was a paid mole for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Some of the credit for Quebecers' new willingness to strike a deal with the rest of the country belongs to Mr Robert Bourassa, the province's premier since 1985. Mr Bourassa is one of Canada's most shrewd politicians. One foreign diplomat likens him to a crab: 'He keeps moving sideways, but always seems to get to where he wants to go.' After years of Delphic comments on his own attitude towards independence, Mr Bourassa and his ministers have recently made some gentle gestures towards the rest of the country. Quebec has signalled a softer line, for instance, on its French-only language laws, notably Bill 178, which requires French-only signs on buildings, store-fronts and billboards. Mr Bourassa's decision in 1987 to override a Supreme Court ruling against Bill 178, was a milestone in souring English-speaking Canadians' mood towards Quebec. Fatigue with the interminable constitutional wrangle has itself improved prospects for a settlement later this year, but the risk is that a solution produced by compromise instead of leadership will be unwieldy, and thus not very durable. In response to Quebec's demands, whatever deal is put together will include a transfer of powers - notably worker training and culture - from an already weak federal government to the increasingly assertive provinces. Western and Atlantic provinces are likely to burden the parliamentary process with new checks and balances, notably a more powerful Senate, consisting for the first time of elected members. A Quebec comedian once quipped that 'what Quebecers want is an independent Quebec within a strong and united Canada'. It would be a sad irony if, after all these years of soul-searching and negotiating, they ended up with neither.</p>

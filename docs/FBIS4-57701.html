			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 23 May (AFP) -- The Front for  Haiti's Advance and Progress [FRAPH], Haiti's leading  neo-Duvalierist organization, today called on its militants to  "mobilize" and resist with arms any attempt at invasion by the  United States.    FRAPH Secretary General Emmanuel Constant said in a news  conference: "In the event of a U.S. invasion, FRAPH would  automatically become an `Armed Revolutionary Front' of the  Haitian people." Constant, who condemned any attempt at an  invasion, said his militants would fight an eventual enemy with  "machetes, sticks, rocks, and so on."    The secretary general, who describes himself as "center  rightist" rather than "far rightist, the group that includes  wealthy, heartless people," asked the government of Emile  Jonassaint, the new provisional but unrecognized president, to  enforce "a true, undemagogic social justice."    Constant expressed his desire for administrative and  judicial  reforms, the Army's professionalization, the separation between  the Army and the police, and "an urgent program to discipline  the people to deal with the genocidal embargo." Constant  pointed out that UN Security Council Resolution No. 917, which  established a total embargo on the Haitian military government,  demands the resignation of the police chief, Lieutenant Colonel  Joseph Michel Francois. "The Governors Island agreement, and the  parliamentarian plan to overcome the crisis as well, only  provided for changes in the framework of the Army."    Referring to the international demand for the resignation of  Haiti's entire general command, he wondered: "With whom are we  going to negotiate Resolution No. 917. Let us be serious.  Aristide (Jean Bertrand, the constitutional president in exile)  cannot return (to Haiti), not because of the military, but  rather because he has lost popularity in the presence of a  powerful center rightist popular force," he concluded.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Brazil president seeks to restore credibility BRAZIL'S President Itamar Franco, his government almost paralysed by corruption allegations in Congress, yesterday made an important gesture to try to restore the credibility of the country's institutions by ordering that anyone in an elected or official post should reveal their property and income before taking the job. The measure, which also applies to acting members of the executive, congress and judiciary, is the first time many elected and government officials will be open to scrutiny. The law is expected to come into effect soon. President Franco's actions follow mounting concern among political leaders that corruption hearings under way, which are investigating allegations that a group of up to 30 politicians and ministers profited from fees and other payments channeled through the government's budget, are undermining the credibility of all the country's leaders. So far one minister has resigned over the scandal, which is thought to involve several million US dollars, and the bank accounts of over 50 individuals and organisations have been opened to scrutiny. Brazil's constitutional revision, seen as vital to solving some of the country's economic problems, was stalled again yesterday because of political problems stemming from the corruption hearings. The rules and working arrangements for the revision, which were due to be approved several weeks ago, were delayed again after corruption allegations threatened to bring down Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, a leading politician and the elected 'reporter' or senior clerk for the revision. Mr Pinheiro, the former president of Brazil's lower house and an important leader of the country's biggest political party, the Party of the Brazilian Democratic Movement, is the most senior figure to be linked directly to the corruption hearings. He was a leading figure in the investigation of separate corruption allegations which led to last year's downfall of ex-president Fernando Collor. Mr Pinheiro is alleged to have received about Dollars 40,000 from another parliamentarian, Mr Genebaldo Correia, himself accused of receiving money from the alleged ringleader of the scheme, Mr Joao Alves. Mr Pinheiro has claimed the payments were legal and transparent, although he has been unable or unwilling to remember why he received the money. He has claimed the allegations have been made by political enemies at a time when, because of excitement over the corruption hearings, it is difficult for individuals to prove their innocence.</p>

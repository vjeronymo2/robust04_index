			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / TUC cheered by the promised return of prodigal sons THE TRADES Union Congress has something to cheer about at last, after yesterday's overwhelming vote by members of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union for affiliation to the TUC. AEEU officials were taken aback by the strength of support for the proposal. They had expected that a significant minority would see no reason why the union should pay about Pounds 1m a year in affiliation fees. There was also the danger that apathy would produce a low turnout, but the 37 per cent participation was high for a postal ballot. After 13 years of decline, which has seen the TUC's affiliated membership fall to 7.7m from 12.1m and trade union penetration to 38 per cent of the workforce from 56 per cent, the knowledge that workers are ready to back the TUC in a ballot is seen as cause for celebration. During the 1980s the EETPU electrical union was a spiky and controversial force inside the TUC. Under Mr Frank - now Lord - Chapple and then Mr Eric Hammond, it pioneered 'new unionism' based on single-union and no-strike deals. Expelled in 1988 for defying TUC rules over poaching of members from other unions, its return as a section of the AEEU could sharpen debate about the future of the union movement. Even if the electricians' achievements were less impressive than they had hoped, they forced more hidebound unions to follow suit at a time of falling memberships. Mr Paul Gallagher, head of the electrical section of the AEEU, is as rightwing as his predecessors but seems less sure of his position in the wider world of the AEEU. It is likely that the engineering section will shape the union's ethos and direction. In spite of the public joy at the prospect of the electricians' return to the TUC family, not all is sweetness and light beneath the surface. Mr John Aitkin, general secretary of the 5,500-strong Electrical and Plumbing Industries Union - established after the electricians were expelled from the TUC - welcomed the AEEU but emphasised that it must stick to TUC rules and not seek to destroy his union. He said AEEU officials had last week walked out of a meeting at which it was outvoted by other big unions on whether the EPIU should join the National Engineering Construction Council, a union body. Lengthy and possibly difficult negotiations still lie ahead before the AEEU returns to the TUC. As many as 16 unions have lodged complaints with the TUC alleging poaching of members by the electricians while they were free of TUC rules. Even Mr Aitkin is optimistic that this will not hinder the AEEU's arrival in the TUC in time for the September annual congress. The final word will come from AEEU executive committee members, more than three quarters of whom have to agree on the terms of TUC entry.</p>

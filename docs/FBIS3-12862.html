			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams-al-Din, deputy chairman  of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council, has renewed his accusation  that Israel engineered the massacre at Sayyidat al-Najat Church.  He stressed that this is a type of crime that only Israel  commits. He did not rule out the possibility that the  perpetrators may be Lebanese Christians, Maronites, or Muslims,  adding: We exonerate no one; the crime happened and its  perpetrators are at large in our society. And Israel has tools  and agents in Lebanon. He went on to call on the government to  uncover the criminals because we want to learn the identity of  these tools of Israel.    Grand Ja'farite Mufti Shaykh 'Abd-al-Amir Qabalan has said  that the total condemnation of the Sayyidat al-Najah Church  crime has fortified Lebanon anew, enhanced the Lebanese people's  vigilance and cohesion, and consolidated their national unity.</p>

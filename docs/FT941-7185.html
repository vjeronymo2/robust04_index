			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sealink behind surge at Stena Line Stena Line, the world's largest ferry operator, yesterday unveiled a SKr273m (Dollars 37.1m) profit after financial items for 1993, up 66 per cent from the year-earlier level. It also announced plans to raise up to SKr930m through share and convertible issues to fund orders for two high-speed ferries. The vessels may be deployed in UK waters, including the Dover-Calais route where they would compete with the Channel Tunnel. The group attributed its improved result to a strong performance from its UK operation, Stena Sealink, and lower financial costs. These helped to offset lower profits from its Scandinavian operations which were hit by recession, the weak krona and higher household savings levels. Stena Sealink benefited from higher volumes and cost-cutting and accounted for about half of group profit, said Mr Bo Lerenius, Stena Line chief executive. The UK unit has staged a big recovery since 1991 when its losses dragged Stena Line deep into the red. The group expects a further improvement in profits this year due to another good performance in the UK and the benefits of cost-cutting. It acknowledges the Channel Tunnel will have an impact on performance but is less worried about the prospect of a price war since Eurotunnel published its fares structure last month. Turnover rose 13 per cent to SKr9.0bn, due to currency factors and volume growth. Passenger numbers were 2 per cent higher at 14.3m while freight units rose 7 per cent to 840,000. A SKr1 per share dividend is proposed, the company's first pay-out since 1990. The company hopes to place orders for two 40-knot catamarans, which can carry 1,500 passengers each, before June.</p>

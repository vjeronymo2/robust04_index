			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Contraction seen in venture capital THE VENTURE capital industry contracted sharply in the second half of last year, according to accountant Levy Gee. UK Venture Capital Database, the firm's computerised directory of venture funds, showed 17 venture funds ran out of cash to invest and one new fund was set up. This represented a decline of about 10 per cent in the number of funds still active. A total of 146 funds responded to the latest six-monthly update of the database. The figures reflect a marked acceleration in the decline of the venture capital industry. The preceding survey, published in June last year, showed seven companies had withdrawn from the market in the first half of last year while four new funds had started up. Venture capitalists have been hit by a combination of the recession and the poor performance of many funds in the 1980s, making it difficult for fund managers to raise new money from institutional investors. Manufacturing and service companies remained the most favoured investments for venture capitalists, but their relative popularity declined slightly. Wholesale and distribution companies gained ground. 3i, the venture capital group, yesterday announced plans to promote the idea of rights issues for unquoted businesses as a means of making venture capital more palatable to small and medium-sized companies. The rights issue plan would allow existing shareholders to increase their investment in their company and to avoid the dilution of their holding which normally accompanies the injection of venture capital into a company. 3i would underwrite an issue of new shares taking up any not bought by existing shareholders. Its target market is private and family-owned businesses with annual pre-tax profits of Pounds 250,000 or more. Many of these companies have previously resisted the idea of venture capital.</p>

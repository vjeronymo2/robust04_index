			<p>BFN     [Text] Mustafa al-Natshah began discharging his duties as  mayor of Hebron this afternoon, after the Civil Administration  informed him that he had been appointed to the job at 'Arafat's  request and that his fellow city councilmen would be returning  to the positions from which they were fired eight years ago.    Civil Administration officials gave al-Natshah and his  colleagues a report about the municipality's financial situation  and other documents. Al-Natshah then went to the municipality  offices and began discharging his duties. He told our  correspondent Moti Amir that he had asked the Civil  Administration to remove the curfew and the closure on Hebron in  order to ease the lot of the population, and that the Israeli  officials had promised him they would look into the matter.    The outgoing mayor, who had been appointed by the Civil  Administration and discharged his job until this morning, was  asked to vacate his office and hand it over to al-Natshah.</p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / People: Thorn EMI Security and Electronics John Hakes, chief executive of Thorn EMI Security and Electronics, the company's defence electronics arm, is to take immediate 'early retirement' as part of a radical shake-up at Thorn EMI's defence arm. The changes follow Thorn EMI's failure to sell its defence electronics business to GEC, despite months of negotiation. For at least a year it has been clear that Thorn wants to concentrate on its music and rental businesses, and to dispose of non-core activities. However, it seems that Lord Weinstock was unprepared to pay anything like Thorn's asking price, which is thought to have been in the Pounds 150m range. Hakes' retirement follows the resignation last month of John Taylor, the company's former defence systems managing director.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jonathan Eyal, director of studies at the Royal </F> United Services Institute, London: "It's Foreign Policy,  Stupid!"]    [Text] If Washington's claims are to be believed, 1994  will be the year of Europe. Apart from Monday's [10 January]  NATO summit, President Bill Clinton plans three further European  forays in the next 12 months. Yet the frequency with which the  White House reminds the Europeans about the President's many  coming engagements is a sure sign of transatlantic problems.    The Administration claims that, despite all the criticism,  its foreign policy remains a success. Washington is now at the  forefront of efforts to reform the NATO alliance and its  unstinting support for Russia's reforms is bearing fruit. In  fact, the last year has been marked by a litany of errors and  badly executed policies which have only increased the Europeans'  doubts about the Administration's competence.    A president elected on the slogan "It's the economy,  stupid!"  displayed little interest in foreign matters and an alarming  capacity to giggle every time he answered foreign policy  questions. Ronald Reagan was hardly an intellectual giant, but  he compensated for his deficiencies by choosing the right people  for the appropriate slots. Not so with Mr Clinton. For months  on end, the Administration did not fill the middle-level  positions in the State Department, and those expected to run  foreign and security policies assumed that they were still on  the university benches. Hefty documents poured out of the White  House, all advocating "engagement" or the "enlargement of  democracy." Beautifully crafted, they nevertheless remained  irrelevant: abstract notions intended to paper over confusion  and weak personalities. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  remains the lawyer he always was: good with a client's brief;  useless without one.    Most of the animosity generated in transatlantic relations  remains of the worst kind: carelessness born out of sloppiness.  Mr Christopher's remarks last November that America's policies  have been unduly Eurocentric and need to be redirected towards  Asia was followed by a flood of statistics on trade, all  supposedly indicating that, at least in economic terms, Europe's  importance is eclipsed by the potential of the Pacific "tigers."  While it is true that America trades more with Asia than with  Europe, the same applies to the European Union, which exported  goods worth $73 billion to Asia last year, compared with only  $67 billion to the United States. Constructing a new security  pecking order out of this is childish and counterproductive.    Furthermore, co-ordination on foreign policy with the  Europeans continues to be appalling. The Germans, for instance,  who sent troops to Somalia after a long and anguished debate at  home, learnt of Mr Clinton's decision to withdraw U.S. soldiers  from the area not in a diplomatic communication but from the  media. Careless talk, coupled with sudden shifts: Mr Clinton  and his foreign policy advisers have given the concept of  megaphone diplomacy a new meaning.    Washington's dispute with the Europeans over the handling of  the Yugoslav war is another example of misunderstandings. Like  the Europeans, Mr Clinton thought that the Balkans civil war  challenged basic security principles. But, like the Europeans,  he wished to see someone else's soldiers punish the Serbs. One  moment the Administration swore it would not tolerate any  further outrages; the next day its officials asserted that  Bosnia was not, after all, America's concern. The result was  the worst of both worlds.    Insisting on the principle that aggression must not be  allowed to succeed, Washington scuppered two peace plans for  Yugoslavia but offered no viable alternative apart from the  traditional drop of food parcels intended to expiate everyone's  consciences. An offer of peacekeeping forces was quietly  withdrawn, but this did not prevent the Administration from  unleashing a barrage of accusations against spineless Europeans,  supposedly unable to "solve" conflicts in their own backyard.  Have the Americans done better in their own vicinity, in places  such as Cuba, Haiti, or much of Latin America? The dispute over  Yugoslavia would have been entirely avoidable if Mr Clinton had  understood that, the moment he ruled out the introduction of  American ground forces in the Balkans, he also forfeited the  right to lead the West in that conflict.    Yet there is a more fundamental problem with Mr Clinton's  European policy which the tussle over Yugoslavia also exposed.  Americans respond well to grand visions and clearly defined  dangers, such as those prevailing during the Cold War. The  U.S., however, is ill-equipped to deal with the much more  ambiguous challenges of today's Europe. For a country created  by people who chose to leave their nationalism behind, ethnic  and territorial disputes are regarded as diseases of the past,  problems artificially encouraged by unscrupulous leaders.  Remove Slobodan Milosevic and people in Yugoslavia would live  happily ever after; support Boris Yeltsin and all will be well.  The search for simple solutions for Europe's complex problems  is an old American trait. Current American policies reveal the  same mixture of New World idealism and detachment from realities.    Mr Clinton's proposal for the reform of NATO is appealing  -- on the surface. The countries of East Europe cannot join the  alliance immediately: the proposed Partnership for Peace  programme neither promises nor precludes future membership, but  offers all former Communist states time to accustom themselves  to military cooperation with the West. Yet, far from avoiding a  new division of Europe, as Washington likes to claim, the plan  simply maintains the old East-West division, the lowest common  denominator on which all NATO partners can agree.    But the problem with the Partnership for Peace goes much  deeper. The U.S. Administration assumes that it could dictate  the pace of change in NATO, carefully calibrating its interests  against commitments. Far from it. Washington or London may  have the luxury of musing about the future, but Germany, as the  frontline state most exposed to potential trouble from the East,  does not.    Either NATO tackles these problems collectively, or it will  become irrelevant for the most important European member,  Germany. By refusing to understand this, the Americans may be  forfeiting their ability to influence European events for a long  time to come.    Leaving the East Europeans in suspended animation will bring  no security to either Russia or the West. Without a firm  anchoring in NATO, the region will only descend into turmoil and  a competition for spheres of influence. The Americans have an  opportunity to fashion Europe's new security structure, but seem  unable to seize it.    Having announced his Partnership for Peace without  consulting  anyone, Mr Clinton is now reduced to hoping that the East  Europeans will accept this paper exercise, thereby sparing his  embarrassment. But it is curious that a plan intended to solve  the security problems of the region is mistrusted by precisely  the people who are expected to benefit from it. Partnership for  Peace will achieve only a brief postponement of Europe's real  security debate.    Yet everything pales into insignificance compared with  Washington's relations with Russia. Its single-minded obsession  with supporting Mr Yeltsin is not a policy but a religion, faith  that Russia will become a democracy, because it must become a  democracy. Having spent 40 years confronting a strong Soviet  Union, America is now concentrating on appeasing a weak Russia.  The Russian economy is collapsing not because it was subjected  to shock therapy, but because it was exposed to little real  economic change. Now, though, the U.S. is counselling a  slowdown in the pace of economic reform, and blames  international financial institutions for failing to help. But it  was Washington which first insisted on strict aid conditions,  and it was the White House which limited the powers of the  European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to extend aid  according to political rather than purely financial  considerations.    Moreover, America's concentration on limiting the  proliferation of nuclear weapons, the only systems that can hit  the U.S. directly, has succeeded only in alienating Ukraine.  What would the U.S. do if, after giving up its nuclear arsenal,  Ukraine were destabilised from within by the same techniques  Russia has already employed in the Caucasian republics and  Central Asia? Send Secretary of State Warren Christopher on a  "goodwill" mission or convene a solemn meeting of the  Partnership for Peace? A policy which consistently views Russia  as the central interlocutor and conveniently ignores Mr  Yeltsin's ever-growing demands for a sphere of influence  throughout the former Soviet empire will lead to disaster.    To be sure, confusion about foreign policy is not confined  to  the United States. But the U.S. is not just any state;  leadership of the West carries special responsibilities and a  high price. By seeking to conduct a foreign policy on the  cheap, by doggedly upholding the rosiest of scenarios about the  future of Russia, Mr Clinton's policies may end in catastrophe.  The chances are that the biggest question this "domestic"  president will face in his next electoral campaign will be "Who  lost Europe?" East and West. By then, something considerably  more than giggles will be required.</p>

			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report New York nearby raw SUGAR futures climbed above 10 cents a lb in early trading yesterday. Analysts said heavy trade shortcovering in the nearby contract led the market higher. Funds and commission houses, already known to be heavily long, were said to have beefed up positions at the open and at several subsequent chart points. Dealers in London, where raws prices were at 16-month highs in late trading, said that although the Thai crop looks set to be large this year a significant proportion has been refined into white sugar, limiting availability of raws. A drought in South Africa is also set to restrict the supply of raw sugar. Most of the available nearby supplies also seem to have made their way into 'strong hands' and it may not be long before the market hits 11 cents a lb, basis May New York. On the LME ZINC continued to be underpinned by technical tightness, notably for June delivery metal. The premium for cash metal over three-month widened to Dollars 44 a tonne from Wednesday's Dollars 29.50. The main objective is Dollars 1,300 a tonne for three-month metal, dealers said. LME warehouse stocks are expected to rise today. Compiled from Reuters</p>

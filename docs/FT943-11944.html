			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Coal sector gains boost Cyprus Amax Minerals Cyprus Amax Minerals, the US mining group, reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 32m, or 30 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 697m, up from Dollars 23m, or 49 cents, on sales of Dollars 453m in the corresponding 1993 quarter, disregarding large one-time gains recorded in last year's second quarter. In the first half, on a comparable basis, Cyprus Amax earned Dollars 60m, or 55 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.3bn, up from Dollars 19m, or 39 cents, on sales of Dollars 828m in the first half of 1993. The income gains reflect operating improvements, particularly in the coal sector, that followed the merger of Cyprus Minerals and Amax late last year. Coal operations had record production of 20m tons in the quarter, with earnings at Dollars 34m. The company's copper operations earned Dollars 35m in the quarter on sales of 173m pounds of copper, up from Dollars 10m in the same 1993 quarter, benefiting from cost reductions and higher copper prices. Asarco, another large US copper producer, reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 5.4m, or 13 cents a share, up from a loss of Dollars 24.1m, or 58 cents, in the same 1993 quarter. Sales in the quarter were Dollars 487.8m, compared with Dollars 416.6m.</p>

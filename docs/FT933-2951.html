			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Technology: Something to shout about - The voice recognition systems ready to hit the mass market The concept of 'voice recognition' - the capability of computers to understand human speech - has been around for some time, but the limited success of computers in comprehending complex spoken phrases has kept this technology from the mass market. This may be about to change, as companies turn away from the goal of complete computer fluency to more simplistic applications. 'Until now, most of the focus has been on esoteric systems for nuclear submarines, jet aircraft and computers which understand complicated, spoken sentences,' says Jerry Gutterman, chief financial officer for Voice Powered Technology, a California company which is working on voice activation for home appliances. 'But in its simpler form, voice recognition technology is already reliable enough to be introduced into the mass market.' It is not surprising that one of the first mass-market sectors to embrace this technology is telecommunications. AT&amp;T, the US long-distance carrier, Nynex, the regional telephone company for the north-east of the US, Northern Telecom, Canada's telephone giant and Motorola, the American communications group, are all heavily involved in voice recognition research, and most already have products on the market. Several automatic dialling systems using voice recognition have started operation. Nynex has introduced the system to 160 customers in Long Island, New York, where the company claims it has met with success. Instead of pressing buttons by hand, the system allows users to programme up to 50 numbers into their telephone. Each number has a corresponding voice command, such as 'home', or 'work'. The telephone memorises the command, and the next time the customer picks up the receiver and says the word, the telephone will dial the number automatically. Nynex hopes to offer the service to most of its customers by the end of 1994 for between Dollars 4 and Dollars 6 a month. The Lexus car uses a similar system for its Motorola-supplied telephone. The driver of this luxury car does not even need to pick up the receiver. Saying the word 'on' is sufficient to receive a dial tone. When the conversation is over, the word 'off' will disconnect the line. AT&amp;T also markets a cellular telephone with voice-dialling capabilities. Voice dialling is a relatively simplistic application because it relies on 'speaker dependent' systems. Under this approach, the computer is trained to recognise a single voice. Nynex is considering use of the system to reduce telephone fraud. 'If we had telephone cards and cellular telephones that respond only to a specific voice, only one person could use them,' says George Vysotsky, technical director of advanced speech systems at the company. The new system would not only provide a new product for customers; it could also save the group money. Nynex says it loses Dollars 1.8m (Pounds 1.2m) a month from telephone fraud. Ultimately, voice-recognition may be used by the telephone sector not so much to offer a new product to customers, but as a means of saving company money. Providing operators to service users is expensive for telephone groups, and their dream is to replace many operator functions with a voice-recognition device. Both AT&amp;T and Nynex hope to introduce shortly a system which would recognise simple commands such as 'collect call' and 'person-to-person'. One challenge is in teaching computers to screen out irrelevant words. 'People don't always use these systems in real life as they do in the lab,' says David Roe, supervisor of speech research at AT&amp;T/Bell Labs. 'The computer may ask: 'Would you like to make a collect call?', and the customer will respond, 'Huh? Is this the phone company?' The computer has to be trained to recognise this response as irrelevant, and repeat the question.' Another problem, even with the simplest of speaker independent systems, is coping with a wide range of accents and voice intonations. 'It's difficult for a computer to recognise strong accents,' says Vysotsky. 'Even elderly people and teenagers can pose a challenge.' To overcome the hurdle, Nynex has created 'model' words, formed by mixing recordings of about 300 people from various ethnic backgrounds, and age groups. 'By synthesising that many versions of a word, we can come up with a pretty good model of what the word 'collect' really sounds like, for instance,' Vysotsky explains. Recognising simple words like 'collect call', though, is just a first step. The goal of the telephone groups is to use speaker independent systems for directory inquiries. Telephone companies in the US and Canada spend vast sums providing directory information. 'When voice recognition technology first came up, people thought it would be used for data entry,' says Vysotsky. 'But that's not very realistic. People get just as tired of talking all day as they get of typing all day. The best application is for information dissemination.' Still, the use of voice recognition for directory assistance presents daunting hurdles. 'Besides the problems of making a computer which will recognise so many names, it's extremely difficult to build up such a large database,' says Vysotsky. Northern Telecom of Canada believes it can crack the problem with a new voice recognition technique known as 'phoneme recognition'. Instead of training a computer to recognise specific words and phrases, the company is training its systems to recognise individual sounds, or 'phonemes'. The English language, for instance, is made up of 40 phonemes. 'If you use phonemes, as well as a few basic grammar rules, the programming is easier and the ability of the computer to understand becomes far greater,' says Pierre Boisseau, a specialist at Bell-Northern Research, the research and development subsidiary of Northern Telecom. The company has used the new system in an experiment to provide stock quotations to callers over the past year. The computer recognised 2,500 company names by thousands of callers successfully, according to the group. By the end of 1994, Northern Telecom plans to use the phoneme recognition system in limited applications for directory assistance. Once its directory assistance system is in place, the group plans to concentrate on an even more sophisticated product, a 'personal telephone secretary'. This system would be capable of screening and forwarding calls. For instance, the computer could be programmed to accept calls from a single person or group of people. Most callers would be told that the person they want to reach is busy, however, it would recognise certain names and put them through. This technology is probably years from the marketplace. However, voice recognition in its simplest form is already being used by the telephone companies, and is likely to grow in popularity and sophistication. Telephone groups hope that one day, operators will be obsolete, and every telephone customer can access complex voice recognition technology at home.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> RAIL WORKERS TOLD NOT TO AID STRIKE  </P> <P> In a defeat for workers on strike against Eastern Airlines, a federal judge  today issued an order barring New York railroad employees from honoring any  Eastern picket lines as long as the dispute continues.  </P> <P> The permanent injunction by U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson stops rail  workers from "engaging in sympathy strikes, slowdowns or other concerted labor  activity" in connection with picketing by striking Eastern workers. The ruling  does not prohibit striking Eastern workers from setting up pickets at railroad  stations but forces railroad workers to cross those picket lines.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by State Council Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze at the </F> inaugural meeting of the Abkhazia regional branch of the  Citizen's Union of Georgia at the Rustaveli theater in Tbilisi  on 5 January -- recorded]    [Text] With all my heart and soul I would like to welcome  the founding of the Abkhazia organization of the Citizens' Union  of Georgia and to say at the outset that I regard this event as  a very promising beginning along the way toward achieving our  common goal and objective which is the victory of justice, that  is, our dignified return to Abkhazia. Owing to reasons which  are easy to understand, I have come to you feeling certain  emotions. It was not easy for me to take this podium because  the loss of Abkhazia, be it a temporary loss, is a great pain  for the whole of Georgia and you, in the first place, for your  friends and relatives, and for all Georgians and non-Georgians  who have been expelled from Abkhazia.    I would like to start by saying I'm sorry. I am the leader  of this country and I want to tell you frankly that I bear a  very big share of the responsibility for what has happened, for  this great disaster and tragedy. Things could have turned out  differently had all levels of the Georgian leadership been up to  snuff. We did not enter Abkhazia to fight. One cannot fight in  one's own country and cannot deploy troops in an area unless  there is an emergency there. We entered there to establish  order. Unfortunately, the most difficult and unexpected thing  has happened. I would like you to include me among the people  who are now called refugees. Let me assure you that I am  dreaming of returning to Abkhazia, as does each of you who has  lost your home. I have the same emotions as each of you. I  repeat: I consider myself a refugee until you and I return to  Abkhazia. All my colleagues in the present leadership and the  Citizens' Union of Georgia feel the same.    I profoundly believe that our meeting today and the founding  of the Abkhazia branch of the Citizens' Union will not simply be  a formal event. We will become a political force which will  lead Georgia into a big arena, a force which will guarantee  Georgia's unity, integrity, the unity of the Georgian people,  the unity of all people living in Georgia, and it will guarantee  Georgia's strength and future. If I did not believe in this, I  would not spend the rest of my years with this organization. I  profoundly believe in this and I also want you to believe.    It was said here quite rightly that the first thing to be  done in the new year is to establish order in the whole of  Georgia. First of all, a real Georgian army should be created.  One of the main reasons for the loss of Abkhazia was our  failure to create a real Georgian army, a national army. Those  who were with me there -- I can see that Batoni [honorific  title] Tamaz is present, as well as many others with whom I  spent most difficult days, hours, and minutes -- can confirm  that there was heroism, bravery, selflessness, and sacrifice,  but I cannot say that there was a Georgian army. It was not an  army. Judging numerically and qualitatively, if we consider  each young man individually, judging by equipment and armaments,  we should not have lost that war. Unfortunately, we lost it  because there was no single and well- organized force.    In my short New Year's interview, I said that one of our  priority tasks is to create a Georgian army in the next few  months, in the next two or three months. The material and the  means to do it exist. The main thing is to ensure good  organization. As the head of state and the commander in chief  of our army, I want to assure you that I will do everything to  have such an army in Georgia. It is not accidental that I am  saying this. Why I am saying this I will tell you towards the  end.    The disaster which has befallen us was not accidental. I  want  us to look with self-criticism into our affairs and life. We  have made so many errors. Did we not create a terrible  phenomenon of modern times which is provincial fascism? I often  say this and will often repeat it in future. We ourselves  brought fascism, fascist forces, to power. We inculcated this  ideology for several years. There will be a congress of the  Citizens' Union of Georgia where we will show the whole country  how this terrible disease was gaining ground in Georgia  ideologically, psychologically, and philosophically.    I have recently asked my colleagues to select some  newspapers, brochures, and books published at the time, so that  I could leaf through them. They go even further than Hitler's  Mein Kampf. And this was happening here in Georgia. And we were  applauding this. Eighty-seven percent voted for this fascism. We  were punished. We should have been punished and were punished.    The same fascism took root in Abkhazia. Even a worse brand  of  fascism. If provincial fascism had not existed here, then the  Ardzinba regime would not have dominated Abkhazia. Our fascism  legitimized that terrible electoral law which in practice meant  apartheid, one nation oppressing another and the discrimination  of one nation by another. This was fascism at work in Georgia.    This was followed by everything we have witnessed, the  executions, including Zhiuli Shartava [chairman of the Council  of Ministers of Abkhazia, who was killed in September 1993], the  town mayor... [70 second loss of reception]    We were robbing them, is it true or not? Unfortunately, all  this has happened.    Let us also remember how we drove Ossetians out of Tbilisi.  After all, these people made up only one or two percent of the  population here. You remember how we drove them out, how we  fired and dismissed them from jobs, how we evicted them from  their homes. And now they are living in the northern Caucasus.  These were people who had been brought up in Georgian schools.  Many of them wrote poems and stories in Georgian, worked in our  laboratories and were engaged in work. I was brought up and have  worked with many of them. They were wonderful people. How could  we have expelled them from here? How could we have expelled  them from the Borjomi gorge [in southern Georgia]. This was one  of the areas known for its fertile land and hard-working people.  Like gendarmes they [Georgians] took them and expelled them,  and now these people are sheltering somewhere. How we tortured  Ossetians. They also tortured Georgians, but how we tortured  Ossetians. How we gouged out their eyes. How we committed  terrible deeds. Was it fascism or not? Yes, it was.    This fascism gave Ardzinba that electoral law. It agreed  with his aspirations. Therefore, we must say, as I said in my  New Year's interview, that the year 1993 was, in a way, a year  of purification. This purification must continue. We, the  Georgian people, must be purified of sins. The sins which have  been committed must be admitted. God will only be on the side  of an honest man, an honest people and nation. This is a law of  history and this is a lesson of history.    I think that we have swallowed a lot of bitter pills in our  life, and 1992 and 1993 were years of drawing conclusions from  bitter lessons. We have committed many other sins. We want all  this to be discussed at the congress of our union. It will be  discussed in a manly, direct, and resolute manner. If we do  this, the Citizens' Union will become established in our society  and will be a guarantor of our country's future.    We are making grave mistakes even today and I think this  must  also be mentioned. Most of you are now living in Tbilisi. I am  not talking about hardship. It has affected everyone, both the  refugees and locals. I know about many cases of people starving  to death. It is difficult to imagine a disaster greater than  that. However, let us talk about the New Year. Things are  gradually improving but the New Year's fun was killed by endless  shooting on New Year's eve. They were shooting from cannons,  self-made guns, rifles, machine gun, from everything. One might  think that it was the end, or, rather, the beginning of the  storming of Berlin, or, rather, that the Berlin operation was  under way. It was terrible.    I think that in a short while we will restore the kind of  order which will allow the whole world to say that it is  possible in Georgia, or, rather, that normal people live in  Georgia. We are tarnishing our reputation by doing this.  [applause]    It was a terrible night. The new year is a time of joy, but  this time it was terrible.    At a meeting with people of Tbilisi I said that those who  are  confronting us, regardless of their rank, reputation -- and I am  not speaking here about illegal armed formations whom I have  already challenged to fight a duel -- will not be forgiven.  This disaster will be over. [applause]    Reclaiming Abkhazia starts in Tbilisi, reclaiming Abkhazia  starts in Samegrelo. I shall tell you one more truth. Had we not  made so many mistakes in Samegrelo [Mengrelia], had we not given  away Samegrelo to those people who did not deserve it, then  nothing would have happened to Abkhazia, we would not have lost  Abkhazia. Samegrelo was, in effect lost for Georgia and she was  paralyzed. This is what Samegrelo means to Georgia. And you know  what, the most difficult days...[pauses], I have the right to  say that I am one of the refugees. I did not leave Sukhumi for  one moment even when we seemingly gained a victory in the month  of March nor when we were being defeated. Many of you probably  left [Sukhumi] at the end and I was one of those people who  escaped in the nick of time. To tell you the truth, I was  dreaming of not leaving it [Sukhumi]. It just did not work out.  I still think I was right to leave. But I witnessed...[pauses]  When we had the biggest crisis, we should not have been  defeated. We had everything that we needed: manpower, arms, and  the population of Sukhumi was disposed to fight, but units after  units disengaged themselves from combat posts. There are people  from Sukhumi, they will confirm it. Is it not true? They used to  disengage themselves and flee.    I shall not forget one session. We used to gather every  night  at 0200 and sum up the day's results until 0300 to 0400. I shall  never forget this session. I shall not give away the name of the  young man, he may not be alive or perhaps he is hiding in  mountains; the Sukhumi funicular, the key strategic center -- if  it is within your view then you control Sukhumi -- a 60 to  70-strong unit was standing there. I asked at the session what  the situation was like at the funicular. The leader got up and  told me, do not worry, everything is well, it is guarded safely.  The next morning, before the dawn, at 0500, I was told that the  unit had disengaged itself and left the funicular. In half an  hour mountain peoples and others went up there and occupied the  funicular. Thirty-five of the best youths fell in the battles to  recapture the funicular, but in vain, because it had already  been captured by others and it was the beginning of the fall of  Sukhumi.    Battalion after battalion used to disengage themselves from  combat positions and at the end as we had no other option. Jaba  Ioseliani, myself and two or three more men, we were begging  with our hands up -- I cannot use a gun, I am not a shooter --  standing in the street: Please, units, get back, get back --  but they were fleeing like a flock of sheep.    What had happened? Why were they fleeing? Because there was  an order from the ex-president, if Sukhumi falls, Shevardnadze's  government will fall too. Is it not a betrayal? That is why I  am saying that we must look into our hearts, our sins, our  misfortune. Had we been united, a united Georgia, or had Loti  Kobalia come in good time -- we had given him arms; Kitovani and  others had given him and others three-fourths of the arms; they  had given them everything there was, they were armed to the  teeth and he did not budge. It was so easy to cross the Kodori  river, there were only 1,500 men there. Karkarashvili had  crossed over and back. They [Kobalia and his army] did not want  to cross over. They were dreaming that Sukhumi would fall and  they would come back to power. It is a dirty careerism. It is  authentic fascism. It was the real cause.    Of course, there was a betrayal from Russia's reactionary  forces which helped the rebels, supplied them with arms and  plans but despite all this, Sukhumi would not have fallen by any  means, had it not been for the betrayal.    Citizens' Union of Georgia must become the force which will  tell everybody the truth, whenever, whatever the difficulties  may be, however unpalatable the truth may be, it will tell the  truth and it is for the first time that I am telling the truth  about the Sukhumi disaster.    The key cause lies in ourselves, our betrayal, the dual  nature and the duplicity of some Georgians who had allowed the  unity of the country, the fate of the country, the salvation of  Sukhumi and Abkhazia for the fall of a dream for a career. This  is the trouble.    You know, we have been punished but not forever. They are  dead ringers, like the two drops of water, the only difference  being in the fact that in the first instance the matter is  Abkhazians and in the second one it is Georgians. This is what  the ideological preparation was like for what became to be known  as the Abkhaz tragedy and disaster as well as the tragedy which  had taken place in Georgia.    I am saying all this because the session of the Citizens'  Union of Georgia is analyzing everything now and will tell the  truth, the whole truth.    Georgia is now once again in the limelight not only because  of the Sukhumi affair previously and other events; it is once  again in the limelight. Why? Because fascism as such, is  emerging as an event not only in one small corner and country  but also on a larger scale.    The fascist force has come to the fore in Russia. When I was  in Ashgabat, I felt a terrible alarm by the leaders of  Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Moldova, Uzbekistan, our neighbors, and  many others who were voicing a big fear over the emerging of the  fascist force so boldly, obviously, in such an up-front manner,  so unexpectedly in the arena. When they looked around, they  said that Georgia had the greatest and most interesting  experience in fighting fascism.    I said then and I say now that we have sorted out our  fascism, we have defeated our fascism and now we must all unite  in the CIS so that fascism does not win in Russia. If fascism  were to win in Russia, it will be the burial of not only Russia,  but Georgia as well. It will be a disaster. We shall not be  able to stay away from these processes.    Therefore, the example of our fight, I do not mean only a  physical fight, literally, but an ideological fight as well; and  destroying fascism is our duty as it will help everybody.  Fascism is one of the greatest dangers for the today's world in  the same way as is separatism about which I used to talk much  before and am still talking.    They have comprehended in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and other  countries that separatism is charged with an equally explosive  bomb as an atomic one. They have just comprehended it. Can you  imagine what will happen in Kazakhstan where it is 40 percent  Kazakh and 60 percent other nationalities? What will happen if  separatism spreads its wings there? Or what will happen in  Ukraine where there are 15 million people of other nationalities  and at that in the best organized and highly developed regions?  What will happen if separatism is revived there as well as in  other countries? Here, too, although bitter but still, an  experience of fighting separatism has been accumulated in  Georgia. I mean aggressive, fascist separatism but all this is  the past.    We must still talk about today and tomorrow. I have said  already and it is my analysis, not just an accidental phrase  that the year 1994 must become the year of the beginning of a  great turn, a turn towards progress, it must become the year of  a serious turn. I have confidence. This is the result of our  analysis and the conclusion from that analysis.    When proving this, I am also pinning hopes on the formation  of such a strong political force as the Citizen' Union of  Georgia. I trust that the Citizens' Union will be able to offer  the public and Georgia solutions for the crisis. It must happen  at our congress which will probably take place in February: how  to bring Georgia out of the economic and political crisis, the  social hardship and many other disasters that descended on us.  There are solutions for it. The main thing is to find these  ways properly and show people that we are not predestined, that  the situation is not that hopeless; and that if we do not give  up, if we get down to work and choose proper ways, there are  solutions and the country will be saved. I hope that the  citizens' Union will be the very political force which will  create such a program and present it to the public.    The Citizens' Union, as I have already told you, will  present to the public an analysis of the events which took place  in recent years. It will be a serious analysis and serious  summary. The Citizens' Union must manage -- and I am sure we  shall all unite in order to achieve this -- to offer the public  the program of restoring justice in Abkhazia and returning to  Abkhazia; not by using slogans, demagogy, populist appeals and  drumming more support and creating a heroic name for oneself and  so on, but a realistic, scientific program for reclaiming  Abkhazia. I am sure we shall manage it.    I have said many times and I am repeating once again that  there are two solutions. They were there before and remain in  force now. There are two solutions. We cannot afford refusing  political means for settling the conflict, if they [political  means] correspond to our interests. I know the disposition of  some of you. Please, do not take offense if I am say this  because several times our hopes had been dashed and it cost us  very dear, the aftermath was grave. Still, life keeps changing,  there are slightly different conditions now. International  organizations are more active and there are more hopes for their  support. We have new friends, Georgia has new friends -- they  have emerged, supervisors and observers of this process -- the  United States of America, France, the Federal Republic of  Germany, and Russia simultaneously with those negotiations held  under the auspices of the UN.    Deep in my heart I believe that Russia herself, in the long  run, has been assured; anyway this is my impression judging from  the conversation with the president, that Georgia's losing  Abkhazia means the beginning of Russia's disintegration.    I had been saying this for a long time before but  unfortunately not everybody heard it and failed to hear it  properly. If Russia were to follow democracy and the Russian  president assured all of us -- the leaders of the CIS countries  -- that there was no other solution and Russia's current  constitution provides with a possibility that Russia will  develop in a democratic way, then Russia must become our ally in  reclaiming Abkhazia.    Our first and foremost task is the speediest return of all  refugees. As soon as the refugees return, as soon as everybody  returns to their homes -- some houses had been burned to the  ground, some survived, most of them have been looted and  destroyed, we shall still restore them, all of us, together --  then the Abkhaz issue will be resolved because then, only  elections must follow it and you know very well what the results  of the elections will be.    There are other terms as well. I consider joining the CIS as  one of the important events. Let them say whatever they please  and smirk wickedly, I still think that I was the first to have  taken this step. I am right in my choice. I have not made a  mistake and in Ashgabat I got assured once again that my  colleagues and myself and those who think in the same way as I  do, those who share my point of view, that we are right. We  have not made a mistake.    At the closed session of the heads of states it was said  that  the CIS would be a viable organism only if it creates  appropriate guarantees for the territorial integrity and the  stability of the countries. A specific mechanism has already  been created, it is being created. There is such a phrase in  the document which all of us signed together, we all signed it  unanimously.    This is one of the guarantees that the situation will  change.    I must say that many countries did not understand our stance  in connection with Abkhazia at the beginning stage, especially  the central Asian countries; there was a misinterpretation in  the beginning in Ukraine, and in Russia, of course. Today, as  everybody has already seen what aggressive separatism means in  reality and in action, nearly all these countries are on  Georgia's side. It is a very important event; not to mention  anything about the world support.    Friends, we all owe -- and I am not saying it in order to  just pay tribute -- we really owe the refugees. We know how  hard it is for you and even more for those who are not here, who  could not come. I know all about it very well. Probably we  must settle whatever needs settling. Unfortunately the coupon  has no value but we must still double, triple the payment so  that people heave a little sigh of relief and humanitarian aid  will be reinforced. I shall have the possibility to specially  summon the vice-premier, Batoni Irakli Menagharishvili -- many  of you know him. I have delegated to him to create a system  which would be just so that not a single gram of medicine or  food be lost and that it reaches refugees in the form in which  it is sent from the United States, France, Iran, Israel,  Germany, and other countries. There will be a little help in  the immediate future.    Many organizations are being established abroad whose aim is  to save Georgia and her democracy. You know that the former  secretaries of state, Shultz and Baker, have set up such an  organization which includes quite influential people. Former  President Carter expressed the wish to become an honorary  chairman of the organization. A movement is starting in the  Federal Republic of Germany and so on. But I think that by the  time they do their job, we shall have returned to Abkhazia.    There is one threat... [pauses] Maybe as a nickname, we  shall  call the Citizens' Union the organization for returning to  Abkhazia. This threat, as they say, has been inborn with our  people and it is still there -- the split. There is no time for  anybody's ambitions. Let nobody seek and attempt drumming up  popularity at the expense of the people who are living in  hardship, let nobody attempt it.    I think that all of you who are present must agree with me  that there are two ways. I told you about one way. There is  another way. It is not accidental that I started to talk about  creating an army, a real army, an army which will not desert  positions without an order from the commander in chief. If  necessary, it will die, but will never retreat. Unless there is  such an army, the other way, the way of a military solution is  very difficult. We can talk endlessly that there is only a  military solution, but we will achieve nothing without a real  force, unless there is a real army which has been trained  morally, psychologically, and militarily. Such an army is being  created. Work to achieve this is under way. A little time is  necessary. However, I want you to know that this is still on the  agenda. People who are calling on the Georgians to arm  themselves and go today are wrong because it is not so easy. All  this is in the center of our attention and we are working to  achieve this.    I think that in 10 or 15 days you will learn about some of  the measures which will lead us to the creation of an army that  will fight until the last drop of blood and achieve its task.  [applause]]    A few more words now. I welcome...[pauses] I wanted Batoni  Lorik Marshania [ethnic Abkhazian who was in the pro-Georgian  Abkhazian government] to be with us today but he is away on a  special assignment. I am very glad that his daughter, Kalbatoni  [honorific title] Ada, delivered a speech. She did it in a very  good, clever, and resolute manner. You know that her father and  herself had to share the same fortune with each of you, and with  us. It is good that there are Abkhazians among us. There are  many Abkhazians in Moscow, Kiev, Sochi, and other towns with  whom I am maintaining ties and I will never break these ties. I  believe that the Abkhazians who have the right position are our  brothers, they are and will remain our flesh and blood. We will  live together. This is a law. I do not have in mind here one or  two people or the group which has led us to this disaster.    I have said it before and, on behalf of our union, I will  state again at this meeting that the democratic state of Georgia  binds itself to guarantee not only the preservation, but also  the development of the national identity of the Abkhazians and  Ossetians. This may be in the form of autonomy or another form  of statehood. We will together arrive at a decision which will  be acceptable for the Georgians, Abkhazians, Ossetians, and  other peoples. We give them a full guarantee of human rights  protection and full equality in our free, independent, and  democratic Georgia. Everybody should know and understand this.    We, the Georgians, are a hot-tempered people, but we are  also  a generous people. We will return to Abkhazia, however, we will  return not for new bloodshed or vengeance, but to restore the  justice of history, so that Georgians live together with  Abkhazians and other peoples on that land and so that our  children and grandchildren build a better and more beautiful  Abkhazia within Georgia.    And this is how I would like to finish. It is possible that,  -- one group has told me this recently, so it is not my own idea  -- it is possible that a political process will not bring us the  necessary result. The creation of an army may be delayed, which  may result in other negative aspects. Your apartments and homes  in Abkhazia are being misappropriated.    I would not rule out that the whole of Georgia will rise. I  want this to be broadcast by television and to reach the UN and  all other organizations. The whole of Georgia will rise. I  will lead it. It would be hundreds of thousands, millions of  people. They may be unarmed. We will start from the Inguri  River -- there will be hundreds of thousands, millions -- and we  will reach the Psou River. Even if we are unarmed.    This would be an unprecedented march, such as the world has  never heard of. It would be a demonstration of the Georgians'  will. The whole world will learn who and what the Georgians  are. Half of us could perish. That is possible. But nothing  is more supreme and sacred for us, including the Union of  Georgian Citizens, than Georgia's unity, integrity, and happy  future.    This is how I would like to finish my speech.</p>

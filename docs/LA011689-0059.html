			<p><P> January 16, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE DRUG-RECOGNITION TRAINING YIELDS 28 ARRESTS  </P> <P> Patrol officers, collaborating with police specially trained to recognize drug  use, arrested 28 people in North Hollywood this weekend, Los Angeles police  said Sunday.  </P> <P> The sweep Friday and Saturday nights was the first time Los Angeles police  officers in the field had worked side by side with drug-recognition experts and  trainees, said Capt. Dan Watson.  </P> <P> Those arrested were booked at Van Nuys Jail on suspicion of using, possessing  or driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, police said. At least one  person also was booked on suspicion of possessing drugs with the intent to sell  them, Watson said.  </P> <P> He said 15 officers "hit pre-selected locations known for gang members and  narcotic sales and use" and conducted field sobriety tests.  </P> <P> The suspects -- including seven gang members -- were further tested at the  North Hollywood station by a dozen drug-recognition officers, Watson said.  </P> <P> The tests revealed use of PCP, cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, Valium, marijuana  and alcohol, said Officer Sonny Medina, one of the drug-recognition experts.  </P> <P> Using PCP, heroin and cocaine is a misdemeanor on the first offense and carries  a mandatory 90-day jail sentence, Watson said.  </P> <P> "If we can get some 90-day sentences for gang members, we can take them off the  streets for a fairly substantial amount of time for a fairly simple arrest," he  said.  </P> <P> Officers from the Los Angeles, Glendale, Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks and Beverly  Hills police departments and the Ventura County Sheriff's Department who are  training to become drug-recognition experts conducted the tests under the  supervision of Los Angeles police drug-recognition instructors, authorities  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Training, Fieldwork  </P> <P> Becoming a drug-recognition expert requires 56 hours of classroom training and  40 hours of fieldwork, Medina said.  </P> <P> The 12-step tests, which can last an hour or more, include measurements of the  pulse, blood pressure, temperature, coordination, eye functions and other  medical conditions to learn whether someone is impaired because of drug use  and, if so, the drug involved.  </P> <P> Testing is 98% accurate in determining if someone is under the influence and  93% accurate in identifying the drug, Watson said.  </P></p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / International Company News: Detroit motors to head of the pack - The big three US carmakers are back to strength The big three US carmakers may have all achieved record quarterly earnings in the second quarter, but General Motors, Ford and Chrysler believe the best is still to come. The absolute level of the second-quarter profits may not be matched in the remainder of this year - the second quarter is traditionally the most profitable - but US carmakers dismiss some analysts' fears that the recovery is already approaching its peak. 'We think the cycle still has several years to go,' says Mr David McCammon, Ford vice-president and treasurer. 'We are early in the cycle in the United States - still in the first half of the cycle, in my view. And in Europe, we're just at the beginning of the recovery.' The view from Detroit is much rosier than from Tokyo, Nagoya, Turin or Wolfsburg. While rivals such as Nissan, Mazda, Volkswagen and Fiat are still battling to staunch the flow of red ink, the US carmakers have put the record losses and upheavals of the early 1990s firmly behind them. Ford's second-quarter results - net profits more than doubled to a record Dollars 1.71bn - marked the sixth straight quarterly earnings improvement. General Motors' second-quarter net profit of Dollars 1.9bn compares with income of Dollars 889m in the corresponding period a year ago, and a paltry Dollars 46m in the second quarter of 1992, the only term that year in which it scraped marginally into the black. In 1991m, all three were heavily in loss. GM, the stumbling giant of the world auto industry, suffered losses for three years in succession from 1990 to 1992. The pace of the US carmakers' financial turnround pays eloquent testimony to the volume sensitivities of the world's leading automakers. New car sales worldwide are expected to rise by more than 5 per cent this year, ending three years of falling demand, though the recovery has been very uneven. In the US, car and truck sales are already in their third year of recovery: Ford is forecasting US industry sales of around 15.5m in 1994, compared with 14.2m last year and a 12.5m nadir in 1991. The previous peak was 16.3m reached in 1986. In western Europe, new car sales have started to pick up in the first six months, with an increase year-on-year of 7 per cent. However, the industry is still struggling to overcome the shock of last year's precipitous 15 per cent decline, the steepest fall of the post-war period. Japanese carmakers are still desperately waiting for some reassurance that the recession in Japan has finally bottomed out, as they suffer an unprecedented fourth successive year of falling domestic sales and production. While Japanese vehicle makers, and some of their competitors in Europe, are still grappling with domestic plants working at very low capacity, in the US the assembly lines are humming, with many plants working overtime and several operating round the clock. Ford was working at 116 per cent of its so-called 'available straight-time capacity' in the second quarter, compared with an average of 103 per cent in the whole of 1993 and only 80 per cent in 1991. Assembly capacity in North America has risen steadily, from 3.97m in the 1985 model year to 5.02m in 1993, and capacity is set to increase further to 5.6m in 1997/98. Chrysler is also adding capacity over the next three years to meet rising demand. As demand grows, all three US carmakers are gaining from the benefits of reduced marketing costs. The discounts and rebates needed to 'move the metal' in the bad times are being scaled down. At Ford, retail incentives were down to Dollars 550 a vehicle in the second quarter from Dollars 755 a year ago and Dollars 1,150 in the final quarter of 1992. At the same time, the share of low-profit sales to big fleets, in particular to the daily rental companies, is falling. US carmakers can now sell more of their output through the more profitable retail channels. The profitability of the US carmakers is also being helped by the the sharp appreciation of the yen. As Japanese producers have been forced to make significant price increases, the big US three have been able to keep price rises modest, enhancing competitiveness in the showroom. However, the climb to record earnings by the US carmakers is not only a result of rising sales volumes and high plant capacity utilisation. All three have undergone painful restructuring, emerging in much better shape to do battle in the fiercely competitive global auto industry. Chrysler, the smallest of the big three, has taken the laurels to date. Only four years ago it was still regarded as a hopeless case, and unlikely to survive to the end of the 1990s as an independent force. Today, after radical reforms that have transformed all aspects of operation, it has set new standards in the world industry. It is now the lowest cost producer among the big three. In the second quarter, Ford earned an after-tax profit of Dollars 945 a vehicle, well below Chrysler's profit of Dollars 1,360 for the period. 'We had a good second quarter, but it isn't good enough,' said Mr McCammon.</p>

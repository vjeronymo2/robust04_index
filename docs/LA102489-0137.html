			<p><P> October 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> SURVIVOR OF NIMITZ IS OFF CRITICAL LIST  </P> <P> Buck Helm, the beefy earthquake survivor who stunned the world by living nearly  90 hours under an avalanche of concrete and steel, amazed his doctors once  again Monday by signaling that he was feeling no pain despite severe injuries  resulting from his ordeal.  </P> <P> Unable to talk because of a breathing tube down his throat, the 57-year-old  Helm still managed to move his head from side to side when asked if anything  hurt.  </P> <P> "He shook his head, and everyone was incredulous," said Dr. Floyd Huen, medical  director at Highland General Hospital. Helm has been there since Saturday, when  rescue workers pried him from the squashed remains of his tiny Chevrolet Sprint  in the ruins of the Nimitz Freeway.  </P> <P> Though suffering from broken ribs, bruised lungs, a skull fracture and kidney  failure, Helm was taken off the critical list Monday. His condition was  upgraded to "serious but stable."  </P> <P> Huen said his kidneys, which doctors at first feared had sustained permanent  damage, appear to be regaining normal function. Still, Huen said that Helm will  need to spend a few more days on a respirator and that his body still shows  signs of infection.  </P> <P> "In the next 24 to 48 hours, if he continues the way he is now, he will be out  of the woods," Huen said.  </P> <P> Doctors may have been surprised by Helm's resilience, but Lorene Helm, his  ex-wife and still close friend, was not. "We've been divorced for four years,  and he hasn't given up on me yet," she told reporters during a brief hospital  news conference. "I guess you could say that's positive."  </P> <P> Like Cecelia Cichan, the 4-year-old "miracle child" who was the lone survivor  of a 1987 Northwest Airlines jet crash in Detroit that killed 156 others, Helm  has become a source of inspiration for many in the Bay Area still reeling from  the effects of last week's quake.  </P> <P> For instance, at the New Orleans Room in the posh Fairmount Hotel on Monday,  bandleader Jimmy Price premiered what he called "The Ballad of Buck Helm:"  </P> <P> "Hey Buck, we're pulling for you. Your heart is pulling us through. Our hopes  were down, but you opened our eyes to tomorrow."  </P> <P> "They call him Lucky Bucky," said Will Fry, another of Helm's physicians. "It  seems appropriate."  </P> <P> A burly, rough-edged eccentric, Helm would seem a ready-made candidate to fill  the role of folk hero.  </P> <P> Although he lives in Weaverville, 250 miles north of Oakland in rural Trinity  County, he spends weekdays working at the docks in Oakland.  </P> <P> When in Oakland, he apparently slept in a rusty yellow panel truck parked at  the docks and showered each morning at a nearby YMCA. The truck, with the words  "Weaverville Flash" painted in orange on the side, was loaded with a mattress,  a Snoopy sleeping bag, some clothes and pictures of his four children, the  Associated Press reported.  </P> <P> When the upper deck of the Nimitz collapsed around him last Tuesday, Helm was  on his way to a legal gambling parlor in Emeryville for a night of poker.  </P> <P> Despite his improving condition, doctors said Monday that they are monitoring  Helm closely for any signs of a relapse of his kidney condition. Sometimes,  they said, the kidneys of patients who suffer the kind of injuries that Helm  did have trouble readjusting to solid food and water.  </P> <P> Although Helm was being fed through a tube on Monday, doctors said they  discontinued kidney dialysis. They said he was lapsing in and out of  consciousness but that he occasionally smiled and wrote notes to friends from  his bed in the hospital's fourth-floor intensive care unit.  </P> <P> Soble reported from Oakland and Secter from Los Angeles.  </P></p>

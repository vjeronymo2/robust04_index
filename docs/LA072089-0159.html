			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORST U.S. PLANE ACCIDENT KILLED 273 IN CHICAGO  </P> <P> The worst disaster in U.S. aviation history occurred 10 years ago when an  American Airlines DC-10 crashed on takeoff from O'Hare International Airport.  </P> <P> Flight 191 lost an engine on May 25, 1979, banked sideways out of control and  slammed into a nearby field, exploding into an inferno. The furrow plowed in  the field by the jetliner's left wing is still visible.  </P> <P> The jetliner was reduced to scattered debris. All 258 passengers and 13 crew  members were killed, as well as two people on the ground.  </P> <P> "To this day, it's something that's hard to comprehend, how a big plane like  that could disintegrate into little pieces," said Ray Devito of Mokena, who had  driven his girlfriend to the airport to catch the ill-fated Los Angeles-bound  flight.  </P> <P> The crash Wednesday in Sioux City, Iowa, is the first major domestic accident  involving a DC-10 since the Chicago disaster a decade ago.  </P> <P> The National Transportation Safety Board laid the primary blame for the 1979  crash on the airline, citing "maintenance-induced damage" -- a 10-inch crack in  the engine mount -- that caused the left engine to tear loose. It also  criticized McDonnell Douglas' design as vulnerable to maintenance damage.  </P> <P> The safety board also said the Federal Aviation Administration had been remiss  by not learning that a similar crack had recently been repaired in a  Continental Airlines DC-10.  </P> <P> Since the accident, the FAA has been "very specific about what has to be  reported to us and what doesn't," spokesman Fred Farrar said last spring.  </P> <P> Elaine Bendell, a spokeswoman for McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach, said the  only change made in the DC-10 pylon design was a shift to flathead rather than  raised-head bolts.  </P></p>

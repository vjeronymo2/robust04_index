			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: LME acts to contain VAT row A FESTERING problem for London Metal Exchange traders and their clients over changes to the European Community's value added tax regulations erupted yesterday when the exchange temporarily disenfranchised its warehouses in France. A decision to change the Community rules was taken late in December and this took effect in January. The new regulations implied that VAT would have to be paid any time metal of European origin changed hands in the EC, even if it was not removed from warehouse. Although the VAT could be reclaimed, the implications for traders' cash flows were vast. One trader estimated his organisation would have to find an extra Dollars 100m for VAT if the rules were not changed. Traders reacted by diverting thousands of tonnes of metal from Europe to LME warehouses in other parts of the world. The LME executive consulted the European Commission, identified a solution to the problem and has been putting this to the authorities in those EC countries where the exchange has warehouses. Agreement has already been reached in the Netherlands and Belgium, where the biggest tonnage of LME metal is stored. Mr David King, the exchange's chief executive, said yesterday: 'We have already made substantial progress, given the magnitude of this problem.' However, he suggested the French 'are being less pragmatic than the Dutch and Belgians and so far have not been inclined to change their rules.' As it was the LME's policy to have its approved warehouses open to all its listed brands of metal without restriction of taxes and duties, it would no longer permit delivery of any metal - whether from the EC or elsewhere - into the French warehouses in Dunkirk. Dunkirk is not one of the LME's important locations. About 5,160 tonnes of metal is on warrant there compared with 1.75m tonnes in Rotterdam and 450,000 tonnes in Antwerp. Mr King said contacts had been made with the authorities in Italy, Germany and Spain but so far there had not been enough time for the problem to be fully discussed there.</p>

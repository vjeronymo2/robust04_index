			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Germany and Italy express concern about Delors budget: Opposition to EC spending rise of Ecu20bn FINANCE ministers from Italy and Germany yesterday voiced their deep concerns about Mr Jacques Delors' five-year EC budget plan. Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, told the European Commission president and his EC colleagues that the budget package - which would run from 1993 to 1997 - was 'not acceptable in its present form'. Mr Guido Carli, Italy's finance minister, echoed a confidential Italian treasury document which suggests that an enlarged EC budget is 'incompatible' with parallel demands on Italy to shrink its public debt. Germany's principal objections to the package focus on the call by southern member states' for EC money to fund closer 'cohesion' with their wealthier northern counterparts. Germany - itself under pressure because of the cost of unification of east and west - argues there is a risk that cohesion money will be considered the only instrument for encouraging convergence of EC economies. Mr Waigel said the 1993 start-date for the plan gave member states plenty of time for a closer analysis of the budget. Supporters of the so-called Delors package want any debate over its content to be resolved by the Lisbon summit of EC leaders at the end of June. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the French finance minister, is holding fire on the Delors proposals while they are examined by the French treasury. The finance ministers - discussing the package for the first time - did not examine the budget plans in detail, but a number of member states voiced objections to the proposals, which envisage an annual increase in EC spending of nearly Ecu20bn (Pounds 14.2bn) by 1997. The sceptics even included federalist Belgium. Mr Philippe Maystadt, the finance minister, said that although Belgium respected the commitments made at the Maastricht summit last December, the projected figures in the budget looked enormous and were not completely justified. 'Wanting to control expenditure does not mean one is necessarily in the British camp,' he said - a reference to Britain's vocal opposition to budget increases. On the other hand, Mr Noel Treacy minister of state at the Irish department of finance, said Ireland welcomed the Commission proposals as a good starting point. Ireland believes substantially increased funding for less developed EC members is essential to give force to the Maastricht treaty's commitments on economic and monetary union.</p>

			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Electronic Data slips to Pounds 2.34m ELECTRONIC DATA Processing, the Sheffield-based computer software and services group, reported flat interim profits yesterday. At the same time, the company announced two new software products underlining its shift in focus to higher margin software publishing. Pre-tax profits in the six months to March 31 slipped from Pounds 2.41m to Pounds 2.34m, on turnover which declined to Pounds 7.35m (Pounds 7.47m). The slight fall in turnover came despite a first time contribution of Pounds 400,000 from the group's two new US acquisitions, Via Systems and Open, acquired in November, which partly offset an 8 per cent decline in UK turnover reflecting the continued slide in hardware prices. Operating profit from existing operations edged ahead to Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 2.04m), but was offset by an Pounds 11,000 loss posted by the recent acquisitions and a decline in net interest received which fell to Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 366,000). EDP has been refocusing its business away from low margin hardware distribution, which accounted for about 40 per cent of turnover in the latest period, towards software publishing and services provision. Service revenues, which include both equipment maintenance fees and recurring revenues through licensing the group's highly successful Merchant software for wholesale distributors, are now running at an annualised rate of Pounds 8m. The company has invested heavily in research and development in recent years to design new software which will work with 'open systems'. It has spent Pounds 2.5m developing UniVision, an advanced database management software product for PICK programmes, and Axiom, a portable graphical user interface (GUI) programme initially developed by Via Systems. Despite the continuing investment in R&amp;D, the group ended March with cash balances of Pounds 10.4m and Mr Richard Jowitt, chief executive, said the group was still looking for possible acquisitions. Earnings per share slipped to 18.07p (18.83p), out of which the group is paying an unchanged interim dividend of 2p per share.</p>

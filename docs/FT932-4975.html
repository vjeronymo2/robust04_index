			<p>930607 FT  07 JUN 93 / Venezuela's new president adopts a cautious line SENATOR Ramon Jose Velasquez, 76, was sworn in at the weekend as Venezuela's interim president to complete the last eight months of the five-year presidency of Mr Carlos Andres Perez, who was suspended from office last month to face corruption charges. A widely respected historian, journalist and public figure, Mr Velasquez will serve until the troubled, oil-exporting republic elects a new president in national elections next December. Mr Velasquez said he would consult members of the cabinet and experts before making decisions on government policy. It was not immediately clear if he planned changes in the unpopular free-market policies initiated by Mr Perez four years ago. He said he would do everything within his power to solve problems troubling Venezuelans, but warned that his government would not be a 'miracle factory'. Venezuela was passing through a difficult period of growth and transformation, and fiscal and economic problems were 'rooted in the payment of its external debt and a tradition of (government) wastefulness'. Admitting that he was not an economics expert, Mr Velasquez said he would set up permanent advisory councils on economic and financial matters, among other things. He also asked professionals who normally shunned political jobs and government posts to provide advice on key economic issues. Members of the two majority political parties said they would not place members in the new cabinet, thus giving Mr Velasquez the opportunity to seek independent political figures. However, the two parties pledged to support the new president in approving key economic legislation that has been mired down in Congress. Mr Velasquez, who worked for several years as a newspaper reporter and editor, has made only one change in his cabinet so far. On Saturday he named Mr Ramon Espinoza, head of a group that promotes Venezuelan nationalism, minister of the presidential secretariat and presidential chief of staff. The new president's victory was largely due to the support of Venezuela's two largest political parties - Democratic Action (AD), of which Mr Velasquez is a member, and the Christian Democrat Copei party - which together hold about 81 per cent of the seats in the upper and lower chambers of Congress.</p>

			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Hualon charge dismays backers Government officials yesterday appeared to be backing away from their unequivocal endorsement of the controversial plan by Hualon Corporation of Taiwan to build a Pounds 160m textile plant outside Belfast. The Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board is seeking information from Taiwanese officials about the repercussions for the Hualon Corporation of the indictment on Wednesday of Mr Oung Ta-ming, the effective head of the Hualon group, and 33 businessmen linked to him on share manipulation and other fraud charges. A British official said yesterday: 'The Hualon project is clearly fraught with problems, no doubt about that. We said we were dealing with a respectable and successful company. Now we have this.' The development board confirmed it was delaying giving approval to the start-up of construction of the plant until the outcome of legal action in the European Court in which European textile and clothing manufacturers are challenging a Pounds 61m government grant to Hualon. The case is expected to take about 18 months. Construction was originally due to begin by autumn this year. The development board said it was 'monitoring developments in Taiwan closely' and 'seeking clarification' to establish what involvement, if any, those indicted had with the Hualon project in Northern Ireland. It added that the indictment of Mr Oung was expected to be among factors 'taken on board' by the European Court. Mrs Jennifer d'Abo, a former development board director who resigned last month in protest at the project, said last night that it should now be scrapped. Mrs d'Abo said that before she resigned she had written to senior officials of the development board asking for information about pending criminal proceedings against Hualon executives, but had never received a satisfactory answer. The Hualon Teijran Corp, which announced the Northern Ireland investment earlier this year, was not named in indictment documents. Mr Oung is thought to control the company, however, and was present in June at a ceremony marking the announcement.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 28 (YONHAP) -- Nuclear Ambassador Kim  Sam-hun said Tuesday that Seoul and Washington have not changed  their positions one iota on seeking a thorough and broad  solution to the North Korean nuclear dispute.    Meeting reporters just a day before departing for Washington  to meet with American officials on the upcoming U.S.-North Korea  talks in Geneva, Kim said the focus would be on persuading  Pyongyang to guarantee the transparency of its past, present and  future nuclear activities.    Asked about the U.S.-North Korea talks in Geneva, Kim  replied  that "we should closely watch how the discussions proceed." He  added that inspection of the historical records of North Korea's  nuclear program and U.S. aid for its installation of light-water  reactors would be top issues.    On the historical records of North Korea's nuclear  development program, he stressed that the communist state must  reveal the amount of plutonium extracted from spent fuel rods in  the past and allow UN inspections of two undeclared sites at  Yongbyon and the spent fuel rods taken recently from a  5-megawatt experimental reactor, as well as permit the  application of improved inspection technology by UN experts.    "If the inter-Korean summit proceeds so well that the Korean  peninsula denuclearization declaration and mutual nuclear  inspections between South and North Korea become positive issues  of discussion, the summit will have a positive influence on the  upcoming U.S.-North Korea talks," he observed.    Speaking of the Washington-Pyongyang talks in Geneva, Kim  said, "North Korea will host on July 8 and the United States the  following day. After a break on Sunday (July 10) to receive  instructions from their respective home governments, they will  sit down again on July 11."    While in Washington, Kim will meet the chief American  delegate to the Geneva meeting, Robert Gallucci, and Asian  Affairs Bureau Director Yutaka Kawashima of Japan's Foreign  Ministry, who is also visiting the U.S. capital to discuss the  nuclear dispute with North Korea.    Kim will return home on July 4.</p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / London Stock Exchange: Glaxo hit by patent setback THE PRICE of Glaxo shares ticked off sharply yesterday as the market got wind of news that rival SmithKline Beecham had won an important patent case. The case revolved around Zofran, Glaxo's potential blockbuster drug, and could, according to one analyst, involve 'tens of millions of pounds'. SmithKline Beecham has been granted European patent rights on the anti-emetic use of the drug. It is now expected that the company will demand royalty payment from Glaxo for the rights to continue administering it to cancer patients. Agency broker James Capel was one of the first financial houses to get a whiff of the news and analyst Mr Robin Gilbert discussed the implications with clients immediately. Consequently, Glaxo fell 25 at one stage while SmithKline firmed 7. However, Strauss Turnbull said the news was no more than mildly negative for Glaxo and mildly positive for its rival. Also, Gruntal Financial, the New York broking house, was giving Glaxo a push yesterday afternoon. The gap between the two stock prices had narrowed by the close when Glaxo was 20 1/2 off at 786 1/2 p with 8.4m traded and SmithKline 2 higher in the 'A' at 538p with 4.6m dealt. After the London market closed, Glaxo said it believed it was entitled to the relevant US, European and Japanese patents and would continue to defend its position vigorously. Redland upset The worst performance among the Footsie constituents came from building materials group Redland whose shares dropped 5.8 per cent. The stock fell after institutions adopted an even more bearish stance on the building materials sector following a presentation given by rival RMC at BZW on Tuesday. RMC shares were down some 3.6 per cent. At the presentation, RMC representatives told institutions of a worsening economic picture in continental Europe, emphasising the deterioration in France and Spain where the company is thought to have spoken of expected volume reductions of around 10 per cent next year. RMC retreated to close 18 off at 487p, albeit in relatively thin turnover of 609,000. Redland were heavily sold as the bearish stories on Europe circulated and the shares closed 21 lower at 343p on 2m traded. Laporte falls Consideration of Laporte following a visit by analysts and fund managers to the company's plant in Widnes led to some cuts in profit forecasts by analysts and the shares fell 22 to 593p. Smith New Court reduced its estimate for 1992 to Pounds 87m from Pounds 92m and for the following year to Pounds 90m from Pounds 95m after making a greater allowance for currency devaluation. However, Smiths likes the fundamentals and says output is rising strongly. The house is happy to pick up stock on weakness. Despite positive full-year figures from Kwik Save, the shares fell initially as the market took a negative view of the group's strategy in what it perceived as a rapidly saturating market. The stock market continued to fear that Kwik Save's margins would come under pressure as competition increased. However, a meeting with analysts changed perceptions, with the group's impressive earnings growth coming to the fore, and the shares rebounded. Kwik Save also tried to reassure the market that its expansion policy would target new areas, such as Scotland and East Anglia. Analysts suggested the group might target unwanted Gateway Stores, north of the border. Most brokers upgraded forecasts for next year to around Pounds 130m. The shares, off 20 at one stage, closed 4 down at 748p. A series of important board changes, including the splitting of the role of chairman and chief executive, plus a growing feeling that the company will maintain its interim dividend at 4p, drove BPB shares higher. The market expects the group's half-time profits to either break even or come in marginally higher than those during the same period last year when profits were Pounds 24m. County NatWest is forecasting profits of around Pounds 20m while BZW expects a small rise in profits to around the Pounds 27m-mark. BPB shares closed 5 firmer at 190p, the highest level since May this year with turnover a hefty 6.3m shares. Heywood Williams slipped 3 to 147p after one leading UK broking house was said to adopted a more bearish line on the stock. Pilkington, where some of the market's extreme bears are said to be forecasting a decline to 60p by Christmas, dipped 3 to 75p on good turnover of 44p. Tarmac, whose shares ran up from a low of 53p in September this year to 98 1/2 p early this month on a mixture of recovery and takeover hopes, dropped back sharply to close a net 7 down at 88p. Utilities fell across the board with the power generators still said to be feeling the effects of the bearish view adopted by Smith New Court and the water stocks upset by the slightly disappointing interim figures released by North West Water. The latter closed 12 down at 481p. Rothmans International lifted 12 to 610p after announcing half-year profits that were flat but at the higher end of forecasts. A statement by Fisons that it had agreed to sell its US and Canadian Consumer Health businesses to Ciba-Geigy for about Dollars 140m (Pounds 92.7m), well above expectations, came too late to help the shares which closed unchanged at 199p. ICI remained without support and fell through the Pounds 10 barrier for the first time since February 1991. The shares closed 15 off at 994p. Inchcape, by far the biggest company in the business services sector of the market, fell 17 to 485p as the market responded to hints that the group may be about to launch a sizeable rights issue, possibly to fund an acquisition. Inchcape shares fell 17 to 485p after trade of 1m shares. Guinness stayed under selling pressure as County NatWest advised clients to take profits in the short-term. The shares tumbled 13 to 520p. Despite a fall in profits, shares in Tate and Lyle moved forward as the market discounted the setbacks which were well signalled and blamed largely on the weather and on abnormal market conditions. While some analysts declared themselves disappointed, the company was said to have produced a good defence at the post-results meeting. Forecasts ranged from Pounds 230 to Pounds 240m for next year. The shares rose 12 to 368p. Worries over the potential for recovery in the hotel sector hit both Forte and Ladbroke as Kleinwort Benson surveyed the effects of US tourism on the UK market. Kleinwort forecasts a 6 per cent rise in US tourists next year will be offset by an increase in hotel rooms. Arguing that both shares should be sold, Mr Paul Slattery at Kleinwort said: 'Forte and Ladbroke are on a very high multiple on expectations of a recovery in the hotel market underpinned by a big increase in US visitors. This will simply not happen.' Forte dropped 6 to 172p and Ladbroke the same to 182p. Television group TVS lost 3 at 25 1/2 p after announcing that one potential bidder had dropped out. Shares in aero-engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce were volatile with broker Smith New Court early sellers sending the shares 3 lower to 89p. However, bargain hunting, the winning of a number of small orders and the possibility of further engine orders, left the shares 4 up at 96p, with turnover at 7.2m. The market was relieved that plans to slow production of several Boeing lines excluded the Boeing 737. Shares in Smiths Industries, a supplier of 737 parts, gained 3 to 315p with sentiment boosted by talk that new aircraft orders may lead to more orders for Smiths. A first half loss of Pounds 1.48m at M L Holdings sent the shares sliding 6 to 15p. NEW HIGHS AND LOWS FOR 1992 NEW HIGHS (89). AMERICANS (14) Amer.

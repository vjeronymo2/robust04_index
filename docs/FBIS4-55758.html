			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, May 19 (BTA) -- A Foreign Ministry spokesman  today denied a REUTER report from Ankara, concerning a stand  taken by Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov on the  commitment of Turkish troops to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At a news conference in Ankara, cited as  a source by the authoritative news agency, Foreign Minister  Daskalov confirmed Bulgaria's principled position against the  involvement of neighbouring and Balkan countries in UNPROFOR in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, says a press release received at BTA. It  was also stressed that this position was directed neither  against Turkey nor against any other country in the region, the  spokesman said.    On May 17 REUTER reported: "Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov said Bulgaria in principle opposed the  involvement of Balkan countries in the conflict but did not  object to Turkey sending troops to join a UN peacekeeping force  in Bosnia."</p>

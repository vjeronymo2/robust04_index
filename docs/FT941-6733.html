			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / French unemployment rise slows: Opposition accuses government of undermining minimum wage The rate of increase in France's record unemployment is slowing, but the politics of how it is ever to be reduced is hotting up, with the Socialist opposition and unions accusing the conservative Balladur government of undermining the minimum wage. Insee, the official government statistics agency, said yesterday that the number of unemployed rose by 4,800 in January to 3.307m, leaving the overall jobless rate at 12.2 per cent. Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister, said this showed a 'clear deceleration', because for the third successive month fewer than 5,000 people had joined the dole queue, compared to monthly increases of more than 30,000 in January-June 1993 and of more than 15,000 last autumn. Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, yesterday reacted to the January job news in the tentative tone he always adopts in discussing this chief bugbear of his government. His goal of reducing unemployment in 1995, when France elects a new president, 'is perhaps not out of reach', he said. Mr Balladur went on to complain of 'false debates based on false information' that he was undercutting the country's so-called Smic minimum wage for young people. The row was sparked by last week's publication of decrees implementing Mr Giraud's new employment law. This allows companies to pay workers under the age of 25 less than the Smic level, but generally requires them to spend the saving on training the young workers. Despite a student union's call for a protest and the threat of a further row when the government and unions discuss employment on Thursday, Mr Giraud said he had no intention of changing the law voted by parliament last autumn. Nor, however, was Mr Giraud in favour of a specially low 'youth wage' to price young workers into jobs. This is in contrast to the more radical deregulatory views of the British conservative government whose employment minister, Mr David Hunt, will visit Mr Giraud in Paris this week. French national output in the last quarter of 1993 rose by 0.2 per cent over its level in July-September, Insee reported yesterday, showing an overall 0.7 per cent drop for 1993 in the French economy compared to 1992.</p>

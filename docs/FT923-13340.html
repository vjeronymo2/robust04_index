			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / New Delhi defied over Hindu temple MR S B Chavan, the Indian home minister, said yesterday the Uttar Pradesh government had defied a directive from India's highest court by permitting the start of construction of a Hindu temple near the site of a 16th-century mosque at Ayodhya, located in the state. Mr Chavan, who was forced to make a statement in the house, ruled out the possibility of an immediate action against the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) whose government had flouted the ruling of the courts, saying that 'the final decision of the Supreme Court would have to be awaited.' BJP is the largest opposition group in the Indian parliament. Last week, the supreme court admitted a writ petitioning against the construction. A hearing is set to begin this week. Hindu militants began building the temple last week, reopening a dispute which has led to more than 2,000 deaths during the past three years. The issue has been dormant for the past six months. Mr Chavan, who visited Ayodhya at the weekend, told a noisy house that he had offered Mr Kalyan Singh, the state chief minister, more security to ensure that the disputed land was not encroached upon, but Mr Singh declined the offer. Paramilitary forces guarding the ancient Babri Masjid mosque have been watching helplessly as hundreds of Hindu devotees continue to pour into the town they believe is the birthplace of the god, Ram. The Supreme Court had directed the central government and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister to 'maintain status quo' in the disputed complex on November 15 last year. Opposition parties accused the government of having no concrete plan to stop the violation of the court order by Mr Singh's state government, which had overtly allowed the construction to begin, amid elaborate rituals. The BJP, which has used the temple issue to become the largest opposition party at the centre and to wrest power in Uttar Pradesh, accused other opposition parties of 'playing with the sentiments' of the minority Moslem community. Mr Ram Vilas Paswan of the opposition's Janata Dal party, demanded the resignation of the Narasimha Rao government because it had failed to stop construction on the disputed site and had therefore 'violated the constitution'. MPs earlier yesterday cast votes - all but 14 of the 710 members voted  - in the tenth presidential elections to choose a successor to Mr Ramaswamy Venkataraman. Counting will begin on July 16, and a new president named on July 25.</p>

The  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] sent 173 men, including  the first 61 soldiers to have turned up at Chipanzane assembly  point in Inhambane Province. Only one of the 14 troop  confinement centers allocated to Renamo remains empty. Eight of  the government's 21 assembly points also remain empty.    Only 58 government soldiers have arrived at their assembly  points since the beginning of this year. By contrast, Renamo  has sent in 1,167 men over the same period. A total of 8,338  government soldiers and 5,222 Renamo men have been confined so  far, representing 24 percent of the expected total. Renamo is  using 68 percent of the capacity of its centers, as opposed to  33 percent by the government.    So far, there has been no explanation for the slow turnout  of  government forces at troop confinement points.</p>

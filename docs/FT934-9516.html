			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: NMC jumps 52% as US carton side expands NMC, the London-based packaging group, yesterday reported a 52 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.34m for the half year to end-September. The advance reflected a continuing strong performance from UPC, the core US folding carton operation, together with a return to profit by the UK activity. Basic earnings per share rose from 2.01p to 4.44p and the interim dividend is being lifted from 0.5p to 1.25p. The directors looked forward to 'continued growth in earnings' in the second half. Turnover totalled Pounds 64.86m (Pounds 52.12m) of which the US operation contributed Pounds 57.7m (Pounds 42.98m). The UK figure fell to Pounds 7.18m (Pounds 9.14m), although Pounds 2.5m of the 1992 figure stemmed from a now discontinued operation. Interest charges increased from Pounds 738,000 to Pounds 1.23m and tax from Pounds 771,000 to Pounds 1.26m. The US operation benefited from a stronger dollar while the UK side was expected to continue profitable trading. The shares put on 4p to 120p.</p>

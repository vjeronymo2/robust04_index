			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Switch trend hits insurers: Customers more likely to shop around as premiums increase CONSUMERS ARE increasingly likely to shop around for cheaper insurance policies in the face of rising premiums, a survey says today. The number of people switching to another insurer almost doubled between September 1991 and March this year, from 1m to nearly 2m, NOP Corporate &amp; Financial, the market research company, says in the survey. NOP, whose survey is based on interviews with 30,000 people, says sharp increases in premium rates had been the biggest factor. Rises in premiums for motor and household policies averaged 20 per cent a year in 1991 and 1992, but many policyholders have faced much greater increases as companies have changed the way they rate risks. Some householders living in areas judged to be prone to subsidence or storm damage have faced increases of more than 100 per cent. Drivers of faster or fashionable cars, which are more likely to be stolen, as well as younger drivers who tend to have more accidents, have been hit by steep increases. Different insurance companies often rate the same risk in a different way, with correspondingly wide variations in quotes. A random sample of six risks by SelectDirect, a telephone-based company jointly owned by Rollins Hudig Hall, the insurance broker, and General Accident, the composite insurer, showed variations of more than 100 per cent. Mr Peter Friend, managing director of SelectDirect, said that the differences reflected the limitations of the data available to insurers. Decisions are often taken on the basis of claims to the insurance company rather than market-wide figures. Mr Friend added: 'Every underwriter believes he is right. The fact is that at the end of the day they all make different decisions because they have all got partial information.' Policyholders who switch their household cover tend to be younger and from the ABC1 social classes, with the C1 group being most likely to switch, the survey says. In the motor insurance market switchers tend to be very young and from the C2DE social classes. Londoners are most likely to switch their policy in the household markets, while those in the Midlands and Wales are the most likely to change motor insurer. The survey adds that women are more likely to switch household policies, while men are more likely to switch their motor insurance policy. Most policyholders are still unlikely to change their cover. The survey shows that 60 per cent of household policyholders and 39 per cent of motor policyholders were unlikely to seek alternative cover. Ms Heather McAdam, NOP director, said: 'There is still an awful lot of inertia in the marketplace.' The Consumers' Association, which has accused insurance companies of charging their customers for past mistakes, welcomed the trend. Mr Roger Taylor, a senior researcher, said: 'It's excellent news. We have been saying for some time that some insurance companies are charging outrageous premiums and our advice has always been that people should shop around.'  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      THE COST OF INSURANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Household risk Building: Sum insured - pounds80,000.

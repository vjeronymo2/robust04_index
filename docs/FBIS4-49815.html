			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon, the provincial party committee  and government convened a province-wide televised teleconference  to mobilize party committees and governments at all levels, as  well as various departments, to effectively take the maintenance  of social stability as a prominent and urgent task at present,  and to ensure sustained, rapid, and healthy economic growth and  achieve victories in economic development and social stability  by paying keen attention to stability.    Governor Jia Zhijie, deputy secretary of the provincial  party  committee, and Vice Governor Meng Qingping made speeches. Hui  Liangyu, deputy secretary of the provincial party committee,  stressed several questions. Vice Governor Zhang Baojiang, the  mayor of Wuhan, attended the meeting.    First of all, Jia Zhijie made an analysis of our province's  political and economic situation, saying: Like the other parts  of the country, our province's political and economic situation  is fine on the whole. The party Central Committee's principle  of grasping opportunity, deepening reform, opening wider,  promoting development, and maintaining stability has become the  consensus of the people throughout the province. The several  major reform measures adopted by the central authorities are  being implemented smoothly. The economy is developing a cycle  of sustained, rapid, and healthy growth. The momentum of  agricultural production is gratifying. Summer grain and  oil-bearing crops are doing well universally, and a bumper  harvest is in the offing. Town and township enterprises  continue to maintain their breakthrough development momentum.  With a relatively good takeoff at the beginning of this year,  industrial production maintained comparatively high growth for  the second time since the Seventh Five-Year Plan was  implemented. The market is brisk, with the sales of major  commodities increasing by a wide margin. The financial  situation is generally stable. Foreign trade exports have  registered rapid expansion. What is commendable is that party  committees and governments at all levels, as well as various  departments, trades, and professions are trying to overtake each  other in friendly emulation. They are in high spirits, full of  drive in vying with each other in the race against time, and  going all-out for development. Nevertheless, we also must  notice that this year is of crucial importance to deepening  reform and establishing a socialist market economy structure.  Contradictions in various aspects of our endeavor are  complicated. Some temporary difficulties in economic life are  relatively pronounced. Some destabilizing factors in social  life are growing in number. If they are not remedied in real  earnest, they possibly may affect social stability.    Therefore, he particularly stressed the need to handle  correctly the relationship between reform, development, and  stability. He pointed out: Stability is the most important  task at present. As for the relationship between stability, on  the one hand, and reform and development, on the other,  stability is of overriding importance. He said: The most  pronounced issue affecting stability at present is that  state-owned enterprises are not invigorated, the amount of  losses suffered by loss-making enterprises is increasing, and  the number of enterprises completely or partially suspending  production is expanding continuously. This being the case, the  province should mobilize itself urgently and do its utmost to  invigorate state-owned enterprises and help them get out of  their dilemma so as to ensure social stability. He pointed out:  The fundamental way to invigorate state-owned enterprises is to  deepen reform and effectively change the way they operate. In  light of current conditions, however, we should adopt emergency  measures in accordance with the principle of taking both stopgap  and radical measures. First, we should solve the current most  pronounced fund- shortage problem, raise funds through various  channels, and regenerate those enterprises completely or  partially suspending production. So far, the provincial  authorities have raised one billion yuan in funds and will use  the money to regenerate some enterprises that have completely or  partially suspended production and to solve the "triangle debt"  problem among enterprises. Second, we should firmly lighten the  burdens of enterprises. Third, we should adopt supporting  measures in policy terms. He especially pointed out: We should  practice a policy of tilting to large and medium-sized  state-owned cotton textile industrial enterprises. Currently, we  should devote great efforts to organizing cotton supplies and  help a number of selected cotton spinning enterprises overcome  their cotton shortages.    He went on to stress: Party committees and governments at  all levels must strengthen leadership over the work of  maintaining stability, with the principal leading comrades  taking up the job personally. On the one hand, they must solve  the pronounced problems in social life. On the other, they  should invigorate state-owned enterprises, lighten enterprise  burdens, and carry out in a down-to-earth manner the various  measures designed to maintain stability, right down to the  grass-roots units. Efforts should be made to promote the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy and to achieve our province's overall goal of  overfulfilling the plan, catching up with the nation, lifting  the economy to a new level, and every trade and profession  making a new breakthrough.    Vice Governor Meng Qingping made a speech specially dealing  with the contradictions and problems currently facing  enterprises. He emphatically pointed out: It is necessary to  attach great importance to the problem of demanding forced  donations from enterprises, thus placing unreasonable burdens on  them, and to take it as an important task of implementing the  central authorities' principles and maintaining social stability  to curb the collection of apportionments of expenses and to  lighten enterprise burdens.    In conclusion, Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the  provincial party committee, stressed: Currently, we must  effectively cut the number of meetings to a minimum, go down to  the grass-roots units, keep in touch with the masses, devote  great efforts to maintaining stability, and ensure reform and  development with stability. He went on to stress: A solid job  should be done in the propaganda orientation of public opinion  and in the comprehensive management of public security.</p>

			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> More than two years after a judge ruled that Mississippi's method of electing  judges violated the federal Voting Rights Act, eight black judicial candidates  are on the ballot in elections today. Also on the ballot are three proposed  constitutional amendments. One would eliminate the long unenforced poll tax  law. In April, 1987, U.S. District Judge William H. Barbour Jr. of Jackson,  Miss., ruled that the state's judicial districts discriminated against blacks  and ordered some districts redrawn. The ruling was upheld by the U.S. 5th  Circuit Court of Appeals.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Love Letters to Screen: A. R. Gurney's intimate, two-character play "Love  Letters" is also going Hollywood.  </P> <P> The popular play is set for a movie version, to be produced for Columbia  Pictures by Leonard Goldberg and Martin Starger. No cast has been announced.  Gurney's agent, Gilbert Parker, said that the playwright, who wrote "The  Cocktail Hour" and who has never before sold a play for a feature film  adaptation, will not be involved in the project. "Love Letters," which is  currently playing in Beverly Hills, with Jill Eikenberry and Michael Tucker of  "L.A. Law," is unusual for its constantly changing casts. It has played in 25  American cities and internationally. CLAUDIA PUIG  </P></p>

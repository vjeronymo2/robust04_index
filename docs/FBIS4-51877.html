In his report at the meeting, Chu Song-il, chairman of the  Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of  Korea, praised Comrade Kim Chong-il's work as a unique and  revolutionary, great charter of the trade union movement in that  it consummated the theory of building the trade unions and their  activities in the present time and developed them to completion.

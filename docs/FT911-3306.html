			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Spanish bank in share swap with Banco di Roma HISPANO Americano, one of Spain's largest commercial banks, is hoping to complete a share swap with the big Italian bank, Banco di Roma, which could result in each bank holding about 5 per cent of the other by the end of this year, writes Peter Bruce in Madrid. Mr Jose Maria de Amesategui, Hispano's president, said yesterday the operation could go ahead once the merger of Banco di Roma and Banco di Santo Espirito is finalised. The two banks, along with Commerzbank and Credit Lyonnaise, are members of Europartners, an informal banking consortium. The share swap was first mooted a year ago, but has been complicated by efforts to restructure the Italian banking industry. At the time, Commerzbank was also considering joining in an interchange of shares. Commerzbank owns 10 per cent of Hispano which, in turn, bought 5 per cent of the German bank in 1989. The two have just agreed to establish a new bank in Gibraltar.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ryan Hotels falls IPounds 1.2m into the red DOUBLED INTEREST charges and 'unfavourable market conditions' led to increased pre-tax losses of IPounds 1.19m (Pounds 1.09m) at Ryan Hotels for the six months to April 30. Last time losses amounted to IPounds 509,000. Interest payments increased to IPounds 1.08m (IPounds 533,000). Losses per share totalled 1.93p (1.11p) but the interim dividend is being held at 0.5p. The Dublin-based hotels operator increased turnover to IPounds 8.38m (IPounds 7.02m) mainly because of the inclusion of Carat Hotel and the opening of the Killarney Ryan in winter months. The company said cost cutting exercises had been introduced throughout the group and significant reductions had already been achieved. The savings would not be fully reflected until the first half next year as the associated costs were being charged as they occurred.</p>

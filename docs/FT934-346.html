			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Management: RSA inquiry to publish interim findings in February At the beginning of this year the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA) challenged a number of British companies to take a fresh look at the role of business, its underlying purpose, how it operates, how its performance is measured and its role in society. The original inspiration, according to the RSA, was a lecture by Charles Handy (see article above) entitled 'What is a company for?' The result was the establishment of the RSA's three-year inquiry - Tomorrow's Company: the role of business in a changing world - backed by 25 participating companies ranging from Cable and Wireless, Cadbury and Unipart to IBM, Manpower and National Westminster Bank. Their collective aim is to look at the issues from the perspective of different stakeholders - customers, suppliers, providers of capital, employees and community - and to try to develop a shared vision of the future. At the same time a network of more than 400 interested individuals - drawn mainly from large and small businesses - was formed to assist the participating senior executives in their task. The RSA hopes to widen the debate in mid-February when the inquiry team publishes its interim findings. The first major platform for discussing them will be at the Tomorrow's Company National Conference on March 17 at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds. This occasion will be an opportunity for the team to test its ideas in preparation for the final report, due to be published in 1995. For further information on the RSA Inquiry call Anna Gorely on 071-930-5115 and for information on the conference call Gay Webb on 0532-832600.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Eurofighter report 'misleading' Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, yesterday told the parliamentary defence committee that a report by the federal audit court which alleged overspending on the four-nation European fighter was 'completely misleading' and insisted that the project was on course. The audit report has said the fighter is likely to cost DM150m (Pounds 62m) a piece, a figure which Mr Ruhe rejected. The defence ministry said it was still working to reduce the unit price of the Eurofighter from DM134m, in line with a 1992 agreement between the defence ministers of Germany, Britain, Italy and Spain. German industry most recently said the aircraft could be built for about DM103m, Mr Ruhe said. The opposition Social Democratic party has repeatedly said it will withdraw from the project if it wins the October elections but some observers are doubtful about the party's pledge because of the number of jobs at stake.</p>

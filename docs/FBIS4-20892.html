			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Lt. Gen. Oleksiy Kryzhko by Senior Lt. </F> Zhurets: "Nuclear Disarmament Has Already Started, But It  Unfortunately Will Not Get By Without Flies in the Ointment"]    [Text] A minimum of 200 nuclear warheads from  strategic missiles will be shipped from the territory of Ukraine  to Russian reprocessing plants over ten months of this year.  That is the amount stipulated by the trilateral declaration  signed by the presidents of Ukraine, the United States and  Russia in Moscow.    After the dispatch of the first sixty weapons from the  strategic missiles located in Ukraine to Russia, however, the  leadership of the MO [Ministry of Defense] of Ukraine had to  clarify and alter the schedules already approved for the later  transport of the nuclear ordnance. Why was this done, and will  it have any consequences? Our correspondent posed those  questions to the chief of the Center for Administrative  Management of the Strategic Forces of the Ministry of Defense of  Ukraine, Lt. Gen. Oleksiy Kryzhko.    O. Kryzhko: The process of withdrawing the  ordnance is a very crucial matter; both for the state and for  the people. And it has to be done under certain conditions that  ensure nuclear security, chief among which is confidentiality.  These issues, with references to well-informed sources in the  Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation, are unfortunately  being covered in great detail in the pages of the press both  here and in the Russian Federation, as well as on television,  right down to indicating the timetables and destinations, if  there are warheads and how many, and what routes will be taken.  This in no way conforms to the conditions under which this  process has to take place. I believe that it is enough for the  broad public to know that the process of the removal of nuclear  weapons from Ukraine has begun on a nationwide scale.    S. Zhurets: Is this circumspection connected with  the possibility of the threat of terrorist acts?    O. Kryzhko: It is connected with literally  everything. I do not have in mind here only the threat of  terrorism. This is a question of the normal process of ensuring  nuclear security. It is necessary, after all, to prepare a  railroad with all of its services, guarantee the fulfillment of  measures pertaining to ensuring nuclear security, and prepare  our combat services with the support personnel, the bases from  which the warheads are sent, and the bases that are receiving  them. It is a very broad circle of issues, in the resolution of  which chance cannot be tolerated.    S. Zhurets: Recent statements by the press service  of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on this score are saying  that certain forces in Russia have a vested interest in slowing  down, or even breaking off, the planned withdrawal of nuclear  weapons from Ukraine, so as ultimately to accuse Ukraine of  slowing down the process of nuclear disarmament. I would like to  know your point of view.    O. Kryzhko: That is the first time I have  encountered that interpretation. I have constantly felt pressure  on the part of the Russian Federation, for the last year and a  half, that Ukraine begin the withdrawal of nuclear weapons from  its territory as quickly as possible. We saw the same strivings  in the negotiations on the nuclear problem with specialists from  Russia. And today, at the level of the technical fulfillment of  the decisions that have been made, we all feel the same striving  toward accelerating, and not slowing down, the process of  withdrawal of nuclear warheads from Ukraine.    S. Zhurets: Nonetheless, Ukraine is now forced to  specify the routes and schedules for transporting the nuclear  combat units. Doesn't that specification of the schedules affect  Ukraine's fulfillment of its obligations with regard to  deadlines?    O. Kryzhko: No, it in no way affects it. Ukraine  is fulfilling the obligations it has assumed.    S. Zhurets; Does the 43rd Army have sufficient  capabilities with regard to manpower and equipment so that the  process of deactivating the strategic missiles and withdrawing  the nuclear warheads to Russia can take place without any  deviations and tensions?    O. Kryzhko: As for the technical aspect, we have  everything necessary, with the exception of a sufficient  quantity of power resources -- fuels and electric power. We have  lately begun to receive fuel from the Americans; true, a rather  small amount, in accordance with agreements and signed treaties  -- several tonnes of gasoline and diesel fuel. They are  promising to supply us with an additional quantity of fuel at  the end of March. We are seeking out every opportunity to  fulfill our obligations as stipulated in the trilateral  declaration. So that we do not look to all the world as people  who say one thing and do another.    S. Zhurets: Thank you for the interview.</p>

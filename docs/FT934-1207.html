			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / IMF shrugs off setback: US and Germany fail to pledge cash for loan fund The International Monetary Fund is to press ahead with its new subsidised loan fund to help the world's poorest countries restructure their economies, even though it has failed to win cash pledges from the US and Germany. The IMF board has decided to set up the new fund, a successor to its enhanced structural adjustment facility, and hopes to start lending from it by the end of February. IMF officials have been looking for SDR5bn (Pounds 4.71bn) for the new ESAF's capital account, on which contributors receive interest, and a separate account of SDR2.1bn to subsidise the interest rates it charges to borrowers down to the minimal level of 0.5 per cent. Some of the money for the subsidy account is to come from the IMF's surplus funds, but the Washington-based institution has been looking for about SDR1.5bn of donations from richer countries. Mr Jack Boorman, director of the IMF's policy development and review department, said pledges had been received from 37 countries to cover 83 per cent of the amount needed for the subsidy account. Other Washington officials said, however, that some of these pledges were at least implicitly conditional on Bonn and Washington taking a fair share of the burden. Like other countries, Germany and the US face sharp constraints on overseas aid budgets. Germany, in particular, believes it has borne more than its share of the burden of helping eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In addition, financial officials in Washington say the developing countries which receive ESAF loans need to make it clearer to donor governments how much they need the facility. They have often been their own worst enemies by lobbying more strongly for bilateral aid, which may have fewer strings attached to it than ESAF loans.</p>

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: New opera house finished at last - John Allison attends the inauguration in Helsinki After long delays of up to 70 years, Helsinki's new opera house opened last month with the first Finnish performance of Aullis Sallinen's Kullervo. The opera was commissioned for the new house and completed in 1988, but as construction got further behind schedule its premiere was moved to Los Angeles in February 1992 (reviewed by Max Loppert). The inauguration - celebrated lavishly - is of great significance for Finland. In spite of a modern opera boom unparalleled anywhere, the country has until now lacked a purpose-built opera house. Many new works have been premiered in the courtyard of Savonlinna's castle, home to the renowned summer festival and since 1919, Finnish National Opera itself has occupied Helsinki's 500-seat Alexander Theatre, built in 1879 for the Russian garrison, charming but hopelessly inadequate. Since the 1920s, successive plans have been mooted and then shelved. The final stage began as long ago as 1975 with the launch of an architectural competition. The winning team, led by Eero Hyvamaki, was announced in 1977, but even then construction did not commence until 1986. As the project neared completion, so the controversy it inspired increased: with Finland in the grip of a severe recession, people baulked at the cost, in the region of Pounds 100 million. The state provides 85 per cent of FNO's income, with ticket sales and sponsorship funding the balance. Top ticket prices are a little over Pounds 20. Cultural provision in Finland - a country whose total population is about half that of London - puts levels of arts subsidy in the UK to shame. Though the stark, white-tiled and glass facade perhaps has the look of a 1970s design built in the 1980s, the opera house blends well with the scenery on the city's Toolonlahti Bay. Not far from Alvar Aalto's Finlandia Hall, and across the water from the Helsinki City Theatre, the building is dominated by its huge fly-tower, but to keep the surrounding park as green as possible, the service areas are all underground. Cool, Nordic modernism predominates inside. The foyers, white with blue-grey marble floors, are spacious and the auditorium suggests an honest, modern response to the traditional horseshoe shape, its curved lines ensuring intimacy. Red beechwood panelling adds warmth, and the hard materials used throughout help the excellent acoustics. These are matched by good sightlines - no-one is far from the wide stage and its adjustable proscenium. The theatre's versatile facilities are suited to a wide repertory (it is shared with Finnish National ballet). It also boasts a small second auditorium, which doubles as a rehearsal stage and a venue for experimental works. The move has necessitated expanding the orchestra and chorus, and on the evidence of this Kullervo performance at least, both have found the measure of their new home. They responded magnificently to the baton of Ulf Soderblom, the midwife of countless new Finnish operas who retired in the summer as FNO's chief conductor after 20 years. Kalle Holmberg's production  -by all accounts essentially the same as in the Los Angeles premiere - filled the new stage with fluid movement and allowed Kullervo to unfold with inexorable dramatic thrust. Though Kullervo's sources lie in Finnish myth and romantic drama this is no 'fur-hat opera': the powerfully-drawn characters all have modern resonance, but the composer leaves recognition of this to his audience. The title role, a sympathetic portrait of an angry youth trapped by society, is tailored to the talents of Jorma Hynninen, Finland's foremost baritone and one of the world's great singing-actors. His dark, full-toned instrument seems ideal for the troubled Kullervo. Though Hynninen compels attention, Kullervo is above all an ensemble opera, and there were outstanding performances from Jorma Silvasti as a plaintive Kimmo, Kullervo's friend, and Eeva-Liisa Saarinen, unbearably poignant as Kullervo's mother. Anna-Lisa Jakobsson sang lustrously as the Smith's Young Wife, and as the Blind Singer, Vesa-Marti Loiri crooned the ballad on which the whole plot hinges with peculiar intensity. A single change from the Los Angeles (and CD) cast brought Tapani Valtasaari into the role of the weak-willed Unto. This performance revealed Finnish opera at its richest. The country has long been blessed with great singers and composers, and at last it has an opera house worthy of them. In repertory until January 7</p>

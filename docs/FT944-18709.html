			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Israel expects boom in investment as ban ends Israel is expecting a rise in foreign investment following this weekend's announcement by Saudi Arabia and the other five members of the Gulf Co-operation Council that they will no longer boycott companies that trade with Israel. The GCC decision to end the so-called 'secondary' and 'tertiary' boycotts on international companies that trade directly and indirectly with Israel was announced after talks between the Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, and GCC foreign ministers in New York. The GCC states also promised to support any move in the Arab League to cancel the continuing direct boycott of trade with Israel by much of the Arab world. Israel's finance minister, Mr Avraham Shochat, predicted a significant boost for the Israeli economy, with multinational companies reassessing their positions. Some analysts claimed that national economy could expect a 1 to 2 per cent boost in annual growth. Others calculated that the cumulative damage to the Israeli economy of the Arab boycott over the decades amounted to between Dollars 20bn and Dollars 40bn. The GCC decision was immediately attacked by the Syrian, Lebanese, Iranian and Libyan governments, with Syria's foreign minister, Mr Farouq a-Shara, arguing that the move was 'not timely'. The boycott is administered from offices in Damascus. The Syrian criticism undermined the political significance of the move. Mr Christopher had been trying for months to win Syrian backing for an end to the boycott, saying this would create a more positive atmosphere in Israel, enabling Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, to win more support among the Israeli electorate for peace moves with Syrian involving territorial compromise on the Golan Heights. The Israeli media highlighted GCC commitments soon to allow direct mail to and from Israel, the entry of tourists and businessmen with Israeli stamps in their passports, and the use of their air space by foreign aircraft flying to and from Israel. Tunisia yesterday took the first step towards normalising relations with Israel by opening an interest section in Tel Aviv and allowing Israel to open a similar office in Tunis. Initially, the representation will be handled by Belgian diplomats. But Mr Peres and his Tunisian counterpart, Mr Habib Ben-Yahia, agreed at a meeting in New York that Israeli and Tunisian diplomats would be appointed within a few months.</p>

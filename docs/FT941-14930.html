			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Right balance for investment regulation Sir, It is all too easy to accuse the life industry, particularly the Prudential and now Standard Life, of rocking the Personal Investment Authority boat and consequently its efforts to achieve effective regulation of the retail investment sector. A row about whether industry interests, or consumer interests, should have a majority on the new PIA board may seem to many to be akin to the 'angels dancing on a pin' debate. But the dispute is a symptom of a wider industry concern: either investment regulation is on a statutory basis in the UK, with proper reporting and accountability to Parliament, or regulation should be by the industry itself  -it is already paying for it - with the ability for consumers, and their representatives, to criticise publicly, and have unrestricted access to the Securities and Investments Board, if they believe that the industry's own attempts at regulation are ineffective. An eminent retired civil servant, Sir Kenneth Clucas, with no axe to grind, concluded that a self-regulatory body with a balance between product providers, independent advisers and consumers, with no one sector having predominance, was in the best interests of retail investment regulation. He came to that conclusion in the knowledge that the primary regulator, SIB, already had a majority of public interest members and, at the end of the day, SIB is the ultimate arbiter of self-regulating organisations' developments. It is Andrew Large, the SIB chairman, who has chosen to overthrow this delicate balance which is a fundamental constituent of self-regulation within a statutory framework. So it is not Jim Stretton of Standard Life who is upsetting the regulatory applecart: he is merely pursuing the logic of self-regulation and emphasising that Mr Large's course has no ultimate destination other than statutory regulation with accountability to Parliament.

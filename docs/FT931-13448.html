			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Barings exits from Liffe floor trading BARINGS, the privately-controlled UK merchant banking group yesterday pulled out of trading on the floor of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe), continuing the retrenchment of its operations. Although Barings will remain a member of Liffe, enabling it to clear futures transactions in its own name and on behalf of its clients, it has decided to stop executing trades on the floor of the exchange in order to cut costs. Barings has made 19 traders and desk staff redundant, saying that in future it will place orders through other brokers on the floor of the exchange. 'This will mean a significant cost saving for us,' said a director at Barings yesterday. In September, Barings announced the decision to shed 108 employees at its securities trading subsidiary, Baring Securities, in order to stem heavy losses.</p>

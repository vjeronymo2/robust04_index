			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Kiev Radio Ukraine World Service in  Ukrainian at 1500 GMT on 6 May broadcasts a 6-minute live relay  of a meeting with veterans in Kiev on the occasion of the  Victory Day, where President Leonid Kravchuk made a short  address. The following is the text of the address:    "Dear veterans, let me first of all congratulate you on the  49th anniversary of the victory. There are dates in the history  of humankind that are of immortal significance. It is there  where the victory belongs and it is one of those events that the  victory in the Great Patriotic War is.    "Its role and significance are above all in that it saved  civilization. It -- and you as its participants -- saved our  land and our people, and it is our victory and your direct  participation in it that made it possible for us today -- with  such difficulty and even in torment -- to engage in  nation-building and the construction of a new society. This is  why whole generations are grateful to you for the victory and  your great, honorable deed."</p>

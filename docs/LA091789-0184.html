			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEEPER, DEEPER IN THE BUDGET HOLE  </P> <P> No one wants to say it, but the nation's budget deficit problem is getting  worse, not better. Congress and the Bush Administration have joined in cooking  the books so that it appears the federal government is meeting the Gramm-Rudman  budget-deficit reduction targets. But that is largely sham, based on accounting  gimmicks, questionable economic assumptions and on counting billions of dollars  as income when it should not be counted.  </P> <P> Some of the gimmicks seem harmless enough. For instance, one way to make the  1990 budget outlook appear brighter is for the Defense Department to meet its  Oct. 1 payroll in September, just before the new fiscal year starts. A billion  here and a billion there add up.  </P> <P> Even ignoring the biggest charade of all, the Congressional Budget Office  believes 1990 spending will create a deficit of $141 billion in the fiscal  year. Add to that some $60 billion in Social Security receipts that should not  be considered as income, and the deficit rises to a real figure of about $200  billion.  </P> <P> The fact is that very little has changed since Gramm-Rudman was adopted back in  1985, when the budget deficit crisis really seemed to be a crisis. Every year,  Congress and the Administration have scraped for perceived savings so as to  slip, technically, just under the deficit limit. The situation was made even  worse this year when Congress and the Administration agreed to keep portions of  the savings-and-loan industry bailout off the budget so they would not trigger  automatic budget cuts.  </P> <P> There are many reasons, of course, that neither Democrats nor Republicans are  saying much about the deficit these days. In President Bush's first year,  Democratic are not as quick to try to embarrass Bush as they were Ronald  Reagan. Bush is struggling to keep his no-new-taxes pledge through his first  year. Democrats are being agreeable in hopes of setting the framework for some  sort of bipartisan tax hike next year.  </P> <P> Democrats, on the other hand, will not risk being branded as taxers and  spenders again by going it alone on a tax hike. And neither party has been  willing to take the political heat involved in challenging the automatic  increases in entitlement programs such as Social Security and medical services.  Until they do, there can be no substantial relief from budget deficits.  Meanwhile, the debt keeps getting bigger, thus compounding the federal interest  payments that must be made annually. Net interest this year will cost about  $170 billion.  </P> <P> The real cost to the nation is far greater, than just the interest expense. The  respected Committee for Economic Development notes in a new report that the  federal budget deficit, combined with the annual trade debt, jeopardize  American economic standing in the world. They consume American investment  income and force the United States to rely on foreign capital. They keep real  interest rates higher than they should be. With such massive deficits in a  period of virtual full employment, there is no flexibility for dealing with the  costs of a possible recession other than watch the deficit soar even higher.  </P> <P> The solution is a relatively modest combination of reductions and reforms  throughout the budget, selective tax increases that will not harm the economy,  a considerable dose of political will and a willingness to share the political  pain. First, however, Washington needs to be prodded into acknowledging that  the deficit problem has not gone away.  </P></p>

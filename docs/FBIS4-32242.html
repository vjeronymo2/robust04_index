			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on results of the 19 June local elections in Poland,  from media sources monitored by Warsaw Bureau.  <H5>  Recap of Election Results, Geographical Distribution </H5>   Warsaw GAZETA WYBORCZA in Polish on 21 June in a page 1  article devoted to the local election results reports that there  is no decisive winner in the self-government elections. Among  the parties that won majorities of the mandates, are the Freedom  Union (UW), the Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and some  right-wing coalitions. On 20 June, the State Electoral  Commission obtained results from 36 out of the 50 existing  voivodships (large administrative units). The average turnout  was 36 percent, and it was higher in rural areas (38.5 percent)  than in municipalities (29.2 percent). The highest turnout was  recorded in Leszno and Poznan Voivodships (43, and 42 percent,  respectively), while the lowest turnout was in Lomza, Gorzow,  and Slupsk (23-24 percent). GAZETA WYBORCZA states that "In the  majority of big cities, there are no definite winners, but SLD,  the right wing, and UW, predominate. The Confederation for an  Independent Poland (KPN), the Union of Labor (UP), and the  Polish Peasant Party (PSL) scored poor results. SLD gained the  largest number of mandates in 17 voivodship cities. That was  the case in Lodz, Kalisz, Czestochowa, Olsztyn, Suwalki,  Koszalin, Slupsk, Legnica, Szczecin, Radom, Kielce, Ciechanow,  Bydgoszcz, Sieradz, Ostroleka, Plock, and Zielona Gora." GAZETA  WYBORCZA reports that "Right-wing parties gained the largest  number of votes in six voivodship capitals: Bialystok, Lomza,  Rzeszow, Krosno, Siedlce, and Lublin. UW won in six voivodship  cities: Warsaw, Gdansk, Poznan, Krakow, Bielsko-Biala, and  Wroclaw. PSL does not count in big cities. KPN was defeated in  places where it did not form a coalition with the center  right-wing. UP also received poor results." The daily adds that  "The conclusion from election arithmetic is that the winners  will be in power on their own only in a small number of cities,  and therefore coalitions will be required almost everywhere."  <H5>  Politicians Comment </H5>   RZECZPOSPOLITA on 21 June reports on page 2 that in cities,  the number of voters was generally lower than in rural gminas  (small administrative units), and the low turnout is bound to  have an impact on the composition of future councils. According  to politicians, only the most disciplined voters and those with  clear political values, decided to vote on 19 June. The daily  notes that according to UW's Henryk Wujec, supporters of SLD and  PSL are the most disciplined members of the electorate. Wujec  also says that the two parties have enough money, as well as the  appropriate structures to conduct elections, enabling them to  partially regain the positions they had lost in the 1990  elections. But that does not mean that it will be easy for PSL  or SLD to establish gmina councils, since their prevalence is  not that big. As for UW, it won the elections in the cities,  which is where it has always enjoyed high support.  RZECZPOSPOLITA quotes Wujec: "The voters were deprived of  information regarding the meaning of the elections themselves,  as well as the candidates. That is the reason for the low  turnout. Among others, this demonstrates that society does not  feel like a participant in a democratic system." According to  the paper, PSL's Dobrosz describes the low turnout in cities as  follows: "It means that 70 percent of society does not want to  bear responsibility for power sharing. It is a very bad trend  that should be understood as a vote of no confidence for  everybody."    The 21 June edition of ZYCIE WARSZAWY on page 3 cites SLD's  Aleksander Kwasniewski who points out that his party is "quite  satisfied, having obtained 10 times more councillors than we had  before the elections." Kwasniewski adds: "The trend from the  parliamentary elections, was maintained." The daily notes that  according to Pawel Piskorski, a member of the UW Presidium, "the  post-"Solidarity" parties did not repeat their mistake from the  parliamentary elections -- they were united this time."  Kazimierz Ujazdowski of the Conservative Coalition -- which ran  in the elections under "Alliance for Poland" -- describes the  elections as a "success." "The right wing has its natural,  substantial electorate, and when united, it scores a success,"  Ujazdowski notes. In his view, the turnout was better in towns,  with their efficiently functioning municipal councils. Romuald  Szeremietiew of the Movement for the Republic expresses the view  that the local elections should strengthen some uniting  tendencies present in the right-wing camp. He is glad the  elections had "a political character" and that those  unassociated with political parties were not successful; he sees  this as "a good future sign for Polish democracy."    ZYCIE WARSZAWY continues its report, pointing out that  Rafal Zienkiewicz, a representative of the Union for Real  Politics, is less enthusiastic about the election results, which  "did improve the party's standing but did not meet its  expectations." He is surprised by the low turnout among the  young generation, and he maintains that none of the existing  parties are able to "win people's souls." "We need new faces in  politics, and a new vision for Poland," says Zienkiewicz.  <H5>  Newspapers Comment </H5>   GAZETA WYBORCZA on 21 June carries a page 1 editorial by  editor in chief Adam Michnik. Michnik notes that "local  governments have slipped out of the control of the ruling  coalition comprised of SLD and PSL." Since there is no decisive  winner, everything now depends on who will enter into what kind  of arrangement with whom. Michnik places major responsibility  on UW's behavior in seeking coalition partners for itself,  stating: "Everything depends on UW, and on whether it is able to  find the best partners in the right- or left- wing bloc, since  only UW is in a position to talk to both sides." Michnik also  stresses that "specific issues and pragmatism, as well as  persistently rational programs and real abilities, must outweigh  ideological arguments" in the process of forming the  newly-elected self-governments.    RZECZPOSPOLITA on 21 June on page 2 under the "Observations"  rubric carries a commentary by Bozena Wawrzewska noting that in  the elections, party tickets prevailed over coalitions of  residents, self-governmental activists, and citizens' groups.  According to Wawrzewska, there could be several possible  reasons for such an occurrence: A weak self-government  mentality or a poor understanding of the essence of local  authorities as opposed to central authorities, clear trends  toward a centralization of the state demonstrated by the  governing coalition, social disappointment with those  self-government structures that have been in office thus far, or  finally, a lack of clarity regarding the present situation, the  programs, or of who is who in the political scene. Wawrzewska  predicts that the parties forming the governing coalition will  gain the largest number of mandates but she also notes one  important difference between these elections and the September  1993 elections: This time, the victory will not be as  overwhelming since the right wing has now marked its presence  much more clearly. It is possible that in forming the various  coalitions, right-wing parties drew the proper conclusion from  last year's defeat when each right-wing party ran separately.  Wawrzewska also notes that UW most probably confirmed its place  on the political scene -- despite unclear programs and ambiguous  behavior -- while UP's poor results are a real surprise,  especially since it proclaims itself to be a "modern left-wing"  party.    TRYBUNA on 21 June carries on pages 1 and 2 an article by  Dr.  Jacek Raciborski, a Warsaw University sociologist, where he  notes: "It can be presumed preliminarily, that both the  coalition and the opposition electorates have demobilized  themselves by quite equal parts. This is demonstrated by the  configuration of votes in Warsaw, which was similar to those of  the parliamentary elections." Dr. Raciborski believes that "The  election campaign was not intensive enough, there was not enough  civic education to mobilize people to participate in the  elections. But one must also emphasize the weak reflection of  the configuration of the political scene in the social  mentality. In addition, local councils are not perceived as  important elements of the power structure. It is part of the  crisis in citizen mentality. "I suppose the coalition will  strengthen its position in many cities but it will fail to gain  a dominant influence over local councils. In my view, the  coalition will lose the elections, for instance, in the  Malopolska region. Regional authorities will not be a direct  reflection of the Sejm arrangement," adds Dr. Raciborski.</p>

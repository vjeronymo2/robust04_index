			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Japan's consumers spurn rice fit for an emperor Emperor Akihito has consented to eat it. Mr Eijiro Hata, Japan's farm minister, tried it yesterday and found it 'tasty in its own way'. But a public suspicious of the foreign rice now on sale in the country prefers to queue for up to two hours for the more expensive domestic equivalent. As Mr Hata toured Tokyo stores to try to end panic buying of domestic rice, the Imperial Household Agency said it had bought samples of US, Chinese and Thai rice and the emperor had consented to eat the varieties mixed with domestic rice. Indeed, for general sale the government will require the blending of foreign and domestic rice, so consumers will not be in a position to discriminate against the imported crop. A first wave of buying began a few weeks ago after reports that only 30 per cent of the rice marketed would be domestic. The Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, a poor rice crop due to typhoons and a cold summer have forced the government into covering the shortage with imports. Rumours of cigarette butts and rodents found in foreign rice exacerbated fears about the imported product, already suspected in Japan of being unsafe because of the pesticides and fungicides used. However, even the imported rice for blending has been delayed in reaching national retailers, and a second wave of buying has even spread to foreign rice. Long queues now form in front of supermarkets on the day they receive their rice supply from wholesalers. 'People are buying two to three times as much as they usually do,' says Mr Yoshiro Takahashi of Rice Data Bank, which provides information on rice distribution. He says some wholesalers and distributors are hoarding rice in the hope that the price will rise further. However, many of the older generation insist they would rather eat bread and noodles than imported rice. Some retailers say a number of consumers seem to be put off from eating rice due to the confusion. The Tokyo stock market has reacted to the current chaos in its own frenetic way. Bakery and flour mill stocks have surged during the past week in anticipation of a rise in bread consumption due to the rice shortage.</p>

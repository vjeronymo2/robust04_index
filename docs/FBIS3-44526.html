The GNP growth rate for 1994 has been set at 9 percent  (industry will be 15 percent and agriculture 3 percent).  <H3>  Deng Again Urges Seizing Opportunities and Developing the  Economy </H3>   Recently, Deng Xiaoping said to CPC leaders: The  document adopted by the 14th CPC Central Committee at its Third  Plenary Session is pretty good. It has novelty. What counts is  to see how many solid things will be done next year (1994) in  accordance with this line of thinking to lay a solid foundation  for greater development in the last years of this century. As I  see it, in the coming year, we must still seize opportunities  and accelerate reform and development, naturally, with  efficiency. Reform is aimed at solving this problem. The  current international and domestic situation is to our  advantage. Without too much trouble facing us, now is precisely  a good opportunity for us to concentrate our energy on  developing the economy. Your tasks in the coming year are not  easy. While we old people are still around and can still make  suggestions on certain issues and offer help if some big  problems occur, you (Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu Rongji, and  others) must boldly do your work and not be afraid of dangers.  Overall, in 1992 and 1993, we did pretty well, witnessed  economic development, political stability, national unity, and  social progress, and achieved great successes. We must continue  to work hard in the coming year. We are happy and so are the  people throughout the country.... These remarks of "great  encouragement" from Deng Xiaoping served as a stimulus to the  CPC's top leadership in working out a plan for work in 1994.    However, what merits attention is that, although in 1994 the  CPC will take bigger moves and more measures than in any  previous years to carry forward economic structural reform, this  has not evoked any great enthusiastic response among the common  people on the mainland. On the contrary, quite a considerable  number of people are indifferent. Answers and statistics  acquired from the questionnaire-based sample survey on "the  attitude of the common people across the country toward  supporting reform," which was recently conducted by some  mainland sociologists, shows that the common people's sense of  participation in reform is far below that of the early 1980's.  People have expressed strong dissatisfaction over such problems  as "unfairness in distribution," "the widening of the gap  between rich and poor," "corruption among officials," "poor  social order and practices," "the wild spread of political  preaching," and "attempting and accomplishing nothing in  political structural reform." The sociologists maintained: The  CPC's decisionmaking body has landed in an error zone: The  mainland's socialist system is thought to be good in all aspects  other than weakness in economic strength. The sociologists  pointed out: If the CPC top leadership does not get out of this  zone, while carrying out the overall plan for economic  structural reform on a large scale, they will find it difficult  to handle social contradictions and crises using other means  once the plan suffers setbacks. What is worrying is that while  the mainland is preparing to energetically implement the  economic reform plan in 1994 and is inadequately prepared in  terms of public opinion and ideology, "commemorative" activities  were conducted on a large scale by capitalizing on the "birth  centenary of Mao Zedong" and activities were sponsored to show  "100 films on education in patriotism and revolution" in an  attempt to restore and reestablish the ethical standards and  norms of traditional socialism and win popular support by means  of uncritical, non-analytical, and blind eulogies and  glorification. If this situation continues, this is bound to  present a serious psychological and mental hindrance to economic  reform. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy's foreign debt under review by Moody's ITALY'S foreign debt has been placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's, the US rating agency, following the uncertainty surrounding the future of European monetary union. Around Dollars 21bn of foreign debt is affected. Just under a year ago, Moody's downgraded Italy's long-term debt from triple-A to double-A1. The debt is rated double-A plus by Standard &amp; Poor's, the other leading credit rating agency. Moody's cited two main reasons for the review: the continuing growth of Italy's debt burden, and the difficulties of overcoming fiscal problems. Fiscal packages in 1991 only succeeded in holding the public sector deficit at the same level as in 1990 (10.7 per cent of gross domestic product), while income and expenditure trends suggest the deficit will continue to grow as a percentage of GDP. 'It may be increasingly difficult to reverse the underlying fiscal trends,' Moody's said. Italian interest rates are expected to rise on doubts over the progress of monetary union, following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. The fragmentation of the Italian parliament following April's elections will also make the consensus needed to cut the deficit even harder to find. News of the review prompted Italian debt prices to weaken. Spreads of Italian Eurobonds widened by about five basis points relative to the US Treasury market. Italy's 9 5/8 Eurobonds due 1999, for example, widened to 40 basis points over the curve. Outstanding bonds are suffering from some decline in liquidity as Italy has not tapped the international bond market in over a year, relying instead on its domestic bond market.</p>

In the first part of his address, Comrade Do Muoi emphasized  the following three points:    1. We must thoroughly understand the resolution of the  recent midterm national party conference. We use the working  class stance as a base to examine the situation. By doing so,  we will be able to see more clearly that the entire  revolutionary line of our party faithfully reflects the  Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh Thought, the law of  evolution of history, and the desire of the laboring people and  all the oppressed people. That is why we must resolve to  struggle against all distorting allegations and must properly  apply and develop the Marxist-Leninist doctrine and Ho Chi Minh  Thought under the new situation in Vietnam.    2. Our party is the party of the working class. It  faithfully represents the interest of the working class, the  laboring people, and the nation as a whole.    3. Far from being abstract notions, the ideas of liberating  the nation, liberating the classes, and making the people  masters of their own country have been translated into life by  our party in a very copious and vivid fashion. This has brought  about realistic benefits for the people such as making peasants  the owners of the pieces of land which they till, workers the  owners of the factories in which they work, and the laboring  people the owners of their means of production. We have  encouraged the people to enrich themselves legally along with  efforts to eradicate hunger and reduce poverty, carry out the  motto of building a powerful country and a prosperous people,  and ensure the all-people great unity bloc.    The resolution of the mid-term national party conference and  other resolutions of the Seventh Party Central Committee's  plenums have been institutionalized into laws and substantive  policies. These are essential issues which the comrade general  secretary asked the military delegates to firmly grasp when they  study to fully understand the resolution of the midterm national  party conference.    Comrade Do Muoi went on by pointing out successes scored by  our country over the past a little more than two years in  implementing the renovation policy set forth by the Seventh  Party Congress. He also emphasized two essential points needed  for socioeconomic development in our country:    1. We must effect a change in the economic structure,  redistribute our work force, and socialize our production  process intensively and extensively in order to mobilize to the  fullest all social resources for development. This is to create  a groundwork for steady development with high results for the  entire national economy.    2. Industrialization must be linked with modernization by  fundamentally carrying out gradual technological renovation, by  seizing opportunities to shorten our development process, and by  shaping spearhead movements to acquire the high standards of  science and technology in the world.    At this conference, the comrade general secretary cited the  many great achievements scored by the armed forces. He said  that they have firmly defended the fatherland while effectively  engaging in economic construction. Together with the entire  party and people, they have helped foil all the peaceful  evolution strategy-related schemes of hostile forces.    Touching on the duty of the armed forces toward the cause of  building and defending the fatherland in the period ahead,  Comrade General Secretary Do Muoi said:    Various party organizations and command echelons must  concentrate on making the armed forces strong politically,  ideologically, and organizationally. These things can be used  as a foundation to increase integrated qualities and militancy.  We must firmly grasp the enemies' schemes, together with the  people in various localities, to maintain the initiative in  defense under all circumstances. We must continue to step up  building an all-people national defense and must effect a  profound change in the thinking of each party cadre and member  and of the people regarding the enemies' schemes in order to  defend the fatherland and safeguard our party, state, and  regime. We must ensure technical equipment for the armed forces  and must increase party leadership and state management over the  cause of national defense and security.    In the period ahead, we must carry out the system of  leadership by the party and operational management by the state  in a more close-knit and proper fashion. Various party  committees and the party-youth union cadre affairs sections of  various state organs must clearly realize their functions and  duty to provide leadership and guidance in the field of national  defense and security.    Various government ministries and sectors must clearly  reaffirm and satisfactorily carry out their state management  functions in terms of national defense and security.    The Ministries of National Defense and Interior must clearly  reafirm their state management functions. They must act as an  advisory body for the party and the state while directly  exercising their state management functions in accordance with  their assigned duty and powers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, June 22, INA -- Member of the visiting  French businessmen delegation, Mr. Folon Stephan, affirmed the  delegation's substantial mission was to furnish the French  National Assembly with a clear picture of the Iraqi people's  sufferings caused by the unjust blockade and thus to urge it  reconsidering its erroneous policies towards Iraq .    The French businessman told AL-THAWRAH daily for today that  the 28-firm delegation, of different specializations, was  seeking to conclude and to renew their agreements with the Iraqi  counter sides as well as to approach viewpoints between the  Iraqi and French officials with the intent of restoring normal  relations between the two countries.    The UN-imposed blockade on Iraq would soon be lifted and  Iraq  would regain its weight among world nations, Mr Folon  anticipated . He concluded that world's major companies were  looking forward to have contracts with Iraq anew, especially the  French ones, which has found Iraq the friend who always meets  its commitments.</p>

			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Observer: A paradoxical business If you've written one book selling 8m copies, isn't it a trifle hubristic aiming for the jackpot again? Not for John Naisbitt, 65, now circling the globe on behalf of his latest offering, called Global Paradox. At 39, Naisbitt left IBM to go into consultancy. He then made his name in the 1980s with Megatrends, now featuring on MBA reading lists everywhere. Global Paradox threatens to be even bigger, thanks to its teasing sub-title: 'the bigger the world economy, the more powerful its smallest players'. In London, where economic angst has become almost second nature, Naisbitt pooh-poohed the suggestion that Britain has slumped to south European status but without the benefit of regular sunshine; though he does rather fancy Latin America's emerging markets. 'There's a renaissance in UK entrepreneurial activity, which isn't happening in continental Europe,' he says. Quick - there goes another paradox] UK plc mounting a revival as a post-industrial emerging market.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / TUC invites CBI chief to congress THE Trades Union Congress has for the first time invited the top official at the Confederation of British Industry to address its annual congress. Mr Howard Davies, the new director-general of the CBI, has accepted the invitation to the Congress at Blackpool in September. The TUC has been marginalised in recent years but hopes, through the invitation, to underline its embrace of 'social partnership' and readiness to build bridges with employers and the government on issues such as training, health and safety. The invitation also reflects the belief of many union leaders that they have more in common with Mr Davies than with his predecessor, Sir John Banham. Some union leaders have spoken at CBI annual conferences, but the CBI said yesterday there were no plans to invite Mr Norman Willis, general secretary of the TUC. It also emerged that Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, will not address this year's TUC congress. Mr Smith told TUC officials that he wanted to make his first big speech to the Labour party. TUC officials said this was not a 'snub' and that past Labour leaders had often declined the open invitation to address the congress. However, union leaders worried that Mr Smith may be tempted to move too far in cutting union links with the party will not be re-assured by his decision. The main argument at this year's congress is likely to centre on a motion from the NUJ journalists' union opposing the return of the former EETPU electricians' union to the TUC through its merger with the AEU engineering union.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government of Tajikistan has banned the  celebration of anniversaries and other events of a mass  character from 14 April until further notice. In the view of  the Tajik leadership, this ban will make it possible to save  considerable amounts of money and food and to reduce the  obligatory slaughter of private and public livestock.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 19 (XINHUA) -- A number of UK peers on  Wednesday [18 May] criticized British Government's policy on  Hong Kong, warning that it could bring about serious  consequences to Hong Kong and to the relationship between  Britain and China as well.    Speaking at a House of Lords debate on Hong Kong, Lord  Cromer, a leading British businessman in Hong Kong, said, "It is  my view, and a view I would add that is shared by much of the  community in Hong Kong, that her Majesty's government has  embarked on a policy in Hong Kong that is seriously flawed."    "It is a policy that is aiming to bring to Hong Kong a  political system which...[ellipses as received] May not  ultimately be compatible with Hong Kong's aspirations," he said.    "It is also a policy which flies in the face of an immensely  painstaking and ultimately highly successful series of  negotiations...[ellipses as received] Which led to the signing  of the joint declaration in 1984," he added.    Refuting Chris Patten's claim that there was a "clear wish"  in Hong Kong for further movement towards democracy, Lord Cromer  said that no one has yet been able to provide any evidence that  there was any such clear wish among the great majority of the  people in Hong Kong.    "What Hong Kong people want is prosperity, not democracy,"  he  told the House.    He pointed out that by insisting on constitutional changes  in  Hong Kong against Chinese objections, "the British side has  chosen a path that has led to confrontation" with China.    "Why have we put at risk a relationship with the world's  most  populous nation in order to offer something to the people of  Hong Kong that is not within our power to deliver?" he asked.    In his speech at the debate, former Hong Kong Governor Lord  MacLehose said that he was "critical of manner in which the  attempted reforms have been approached at this time."    Chris Patten's constitutional initiative had proved to be a  "serious mistake" and was "unlikely to do the people of Hong  Kong any good," he commented.    He warned that "there may be a mood of disillusionment with  Britain and with the British Government when it becomes apparent  that all these activities on the constitutional front have so  little practical content for the people of Hong Kong."    Another former Hong Kong governor, Lord Wilson, reminded his  fellow Lords that the Chinese Government had made it clear that  if there is no agreement between the two countries, any new  arrangements in Hong Kong will not survive 1997.    "That statement, I believe, needs to be taken seriously," he  said.    He pointed out that to ensure smooth transition and to  maintain stability and prosperity in Hong Kong before and after  1997, the "guiding star" for the British policy "must surely be  not the short term, but the medium and long term."    "We must do as much as we possibly can, wherever possible in  co-operation with China, to achieve what is right and beneficial  for the people of Hong Kong and for the success of the Hong Kong  special administrative region after 1997," he said.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> JAILED SPUR'S HOME BROKEN INTO  </P> <P> An intruder broke into the home of San Antonio Spurs guard David Wingate and  left a sinister calling card -- a female doll pierced by needles, police said.  </P> <P> San Antonio police said they were called to Wingate's home shortly after noon  Tuesday when a neighbor reported hearing an alarm go off.  </P> <P> Wingate, 26, was jailed Monday in Columbia, Md., after he was charged with  second-degree rape, battery and a fourth-degree sexual offense. He was freed on  $10,000 bond.  </P> <P> He was accused of raping a 17-year-old female Sunday at a party at his Maryland  apartment, court records state. Wingate told Howard County police he had sex  with her but said it was with her consent.  </P> <P> San Antonio police said Tuesday that they found a message scrawled in lipstick  on a mirror in a bathroom adjacent to the master bedroom in Wingate's home.  Investigators did not say what the message was, but they did say they believe  it was written by a woman.  </P> <P> According to a police report, the doll had been left on a plate in "what  appeared to be sugar or salt. The granulated substance was in the figure of a  pentagram," the report stated.  </P></p>

			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / Fokker finds a way to flex its wings: Dasa is the strong partner the Dutch group needs to launch a new generation of aircraft In 1917, the Red Baron, the German World War I flying ace, turned to Anthony Fokker of the Netherlands when he needed quick, flexible flying machines to outmanoeuvre and ultimately shoot down his larger opponents. Now, 75 years later, the German aircraft industry is poised to take control of Fokker's legacy, the Amsterdam-based Fokker aerospace group, in a bid to boost its role in civil aircraft. For Fokker, which is itself a past master at waging - and surviving - fierce dog fights with its bigger competitors in the crowded skies of the global aerospace industry, the deal spells the end of its independence. But the company is counting on the financial support of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) to help it realise its goal of spawning a 'Fokker JetLine' range of regional jets, based on its existing 100-seater Fokker 100. The Fl 880m (Pounds 317m) deal, which will give Dasa 51 per cent control of Fokker, took nearly 10 months to arrange, reflecting Dutch sensitivity to the prospects of one of the country's proudest industrial names being transferred to German control. The government, whose 32 per cent stake in Fokker gave it the power of veto, worked hard during the negotiations to ensure the Dutch company would not be downgraded to a mere 'screwdriver' assembly plant. For Fokker's management, the prize was Dasa's promise that Fokker would play the leading role in looking after present and future aircraft in the 65-seat to 130-seat range. 'This means Fokker will have responsibility for the management and profitability of the entire production process, from conceptual design to customer-related product support activities,' the company says. In essence, the accord gives Fokker the go-ahead to develop the Fokker 70, a 70-seater aircraft which will draw heavily on the existing Fokker 100 and which may be launched as early as 1994. It also brings closer to reality Dutch ambitions for a Fokker 130 in 1997, creating a three-member 'jet family' bearing the Fokker name by the turn of the century. The Dutch government, which came to Fokker's rescue in 1987, told the company from the start it would need a strong industrial partner if it wanted to launch a new generation of aircraft. Fokker has found precisely that in Dasa, part of the Daimler-Benz industrial group. The German-Dutch link grew out of talks aimed at persuading Dasa - whose Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm subsidiary builds fuselages for the Fokker 100 - to participate in the 130-seater aircraft. Specifically, Fokker hoped to lure Dasa from plans for a rival aircraft to be built with its two partners in the 'Regioliner' venture, Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Fokker says it will now be the nucleus of the European regional jet industry. But it knows Dasa has not dropped Aerospatiale or Alenia. Far from it, Dasa will be inviting the French and Italians to take over part of its Fokker stake later in the 1990s, creating a strong European consortium for regional jets of which the Dutch company will simply be one, albeit important, part. The secure outlook for Fokker's role in jets with between 65 and 130 seats contrasts sharply with prospects for its second existing aircraft, the 50-seater turboprop Fokker 50. The aircraft's biggest competitor is the ATR 42, a joint effort between Fokker's future minority shareholders, Aerospatiale and Alenia. In the past, Fokker complained that the Fokker 50 was failing to break into the important US market because national subsidies in France and Italy gave the ATR 42 an unfair price advantage. Presumably, it will be a lot less free to criticise in future. The outlook for the Fokker 50 was the last obstacle in the way of this week's accord between Dasa and the Dutch government. In the end, it was agreed the aircraft's future would be determined primarily by market forces, and that its production could be ended, if necessary, as long as this did not threaten Fokker's survival. 'I was never aiming for water-tight guarantees,' Mr Koos Andriessen, minister of economic affairs, said of his negotiations with Dasa. 'I know only too well that there has to be a certain restructuring in that segment of the market, but if you take away the aeroplane now, the company will disappear.' The government will retain certain rights to help determine policy at Fokker until the year 2000. But, ultimately, the sale of a 51 per cent stake (through the disposal of the state's holding and a planned private placement) means Fokker's future is inextricably bound to that of Dasa. The German company, which recently announced more than 7,000 job losses, is facing troubles of its own, not least uncertainty about the Euro-fighter project and difficulties confronting the entire civil aircraft sector. With British Aerospace looking to Taiwan for a partnership and with the rest of the industry in a state of flux, Fokker's decision to join the Daimler-Benz fold will not shield it entirely from the turbulence besetting the aircraft market, even now that it will be flying in formation with its bigger European colleagues.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Survey of Poland (2): Little room to manoeuvre - The fragile economic situation AFTER months of increasingly irrelevant debate in Poland about the virtues of more or less expansionary monetary and economic policies the World Bank issued a report on the Polish economy earlier this year which made brutally clear how limited the real room for manoeuvre was and is. 'The fiscal situation has worsened to the point where hyperinflation is an immediate danger. Unemployment has reached a level that cannot be tolerated for long. Investment in infrastructure and human resource development has shrunk to levels that, if maintained, will undermine the prospects for sustained growth,' the report says. In blunt words addressed to politicians even more than economists it added: 'None of the long-term supply side reforms stands any chance of success if Poland slides back into hyperinflation, or if its economy continues to decline as dramatically as it has in the last two years.' At the heart of the problem lies the nature of the state-dominated economy inherited from 45 years of Soviet-style central planning. In spite of the explosion of private enterprise, concentrated mainly in retailing, trade and construction where only small amounts of capital are required, the bulk of economic activity is still carried out by state or municipally-owned enterprises. Privatisation, in a country where private savings were virtually eliminated by hyper-inflation and the 1990 economic stabilisation programme, is proving more difficult than anticipated. Allowing bankrupt state enterprises to close is also difficult when entire communities and their infrastructure often depend on one or two large plants where workers' councils exert strong influence on management unversed in the ways of the market. But the continuing existence of large numbers of bankrupt state enterprises exerts large negative pressures on the economy, adding to inflation and absorbing productive resources which could be better used elsewhere. Thousands of state-owned enterprises have survived by not paying their bills and building up inter-enterprise credits or debts to a banking system overburdened with non-performing and non-collectable loans and in need of reform and re-financing. The overall picture is not quite as bleak as suggested by the nearly 40 per cent drop in industrial output and 20 per cent decline in official GDP over the past two years. The official statistics fail to take fully into account dynamic growth in the private sector and much of the output no longer produced by the state sector was of poor quality or unsellable. Furthermore, some state-owned enterprises have managed to increase their exports to the west and cut costs by shedding labour and selling assets. Even so the overall crisis of the state sector is the crucial factor behind a fiscal crisis which underlines the narrow margin of manoeuvre for policy-makers. This is because the 8,000 state sector enterprises traditionally provided around 80 per cent of government revenue. The collapse in their profitability caused government income to plummet from 44.5 per cent of GDP to 33.6 per cent last year. At the same time, unemployment rose from virtually zero to more than 2.1m people, or 11 per cent of the workforce. Social security costs were further bloated by highly advantageous early retirement and disability pension regulations. The scissors effect of declining revenue and rising spending risked pushing the budget deficit up to 11 per cent of GDP this year if unchecked. It was with this prospect in mind that the international institutions issued their warnings about the dangers of hyperinflation - as well as their strictures on the need for a better taxation system to bring the private sector more securely into the tax net. The government is already shifting the balance from income to consumption taxes: it plans to introduce a Value Added Tax at the beginning of next year. The signal that fiscal rectitude had taken priority over selective stimulation of state industry, as originally advocated by the prime minister, Mr Jan Olszewski, and his economic policy chief, Mr Jerzy Eysymontt, came in March with the appointment as finance minister of Mr Andrzej Olechowski. After visiting Washington, Mr Olechowski pushed through cabinet a commitment to social security and other spending cuts designed to keep the budget deficit to a limit of 65,500bn zlotys or 5 per cent of GDP. Subsidies to enterprises will be cut in real terms by 46 per cent to 1.7 per cent of GDP and farmers, another vociferous group well represented in government, will also see their aid further cut in real terms. It will not be easy to keep to the new policy anchor, not least because the projected tight rein on government spending will see a continuation of the recession and a remorseless climb in unemployment. Morgan Guaranty recently forecast a further 6 per cent decline in GDP this year accompanied by a rise in unemployment to 17 per cent of the workforce against the background of high inflation and a deteriorating current account deficit. This is hard to swallow for a fragile coalition government which gained power largely through its criticism of the allegedly tough monetary policies associated with Mr Leszek Balcerowicz, finance minister in the first two post-communist governments. Mr Eysymontt, who was a leading critic of the former finance minister for not paying sufficient attention to the impact of his policies on the state enterprises, still hopes that growth in the construction, trade and service sectors will help to bring the economy out of its tailspin. Ideally he would like to see 1992 end as a year of zero growth and poised for recovery in 1993. But with a 14 per cent decline in output over the first two months of this year he concedes that reaching this target 'will not be easy' in spite of the boost to exports hoped for by allowing the exchange rate to fall more closely in line with domestic inflation this year. Real incomes actually rose last year in spite of the drop in GDP, largely because the zloty did not depreciate less than last year's 60 per cent inflation. The currency's appreciation against the dollar resulted in a flood of western consumer imports, including more than 300,000 new or used cars. This put further pressure on domestic producers and reinforced that contrast between the glittering shops and depressed factories which is proving so politically unsettling. Mr Olechowski, who appears to have established a good working relationship with Mr Eysymontt, has no illusions about the difficult economic times ahead and fears that further cuts in government spending may be required. 'I can't exclude that there'll be strikes, demands for higher wages, capital flight. It could become a real problem. Then we might have to cut back further.' Poland is already suffering a capital flight of several tens of millions of dollars a month, he added, and will need substantial foreign funding to finance the projected 5 per cent budget deficit and prevent the economy falling further. 'We expect to finance about one third of the deficit from the central bank and about a sixth from capital markets but we'll have to get capital from abroad or we'll crowd out the private sector,' he warns. Until now, in spite of last year's Paris Club agreement to write down over 50 per cent of the Dollars 33bn official debt, loan commitments of more than Dollars 2bn by the World Bank and associate membership of the European Community, post-communist Poland has not been able to attract private equity investment consonant with its strategic importance. The danger, underlined by the World Bank, is that without greater efficiency in the public sector and higher investment in the private sector the recession will deepen to create politically destabilising unemployment and levels of debt in the public sector which would make enterprises impossible to privatise. The next few months will be critical.</p>

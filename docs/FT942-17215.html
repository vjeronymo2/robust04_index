			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Personal View: Rethink of the regulator's role Privatised industries representing some 20 per cent of UK gross domestic product are now subject to regulatory regimes. It is important that they are well regulated in the interests of customers and to ensure the long-term health of the industries themselves. In deciding how this might best be done, we started in typical British fashion by defining what we didn't want - the US system. There, each state has its own multi-member regulatory commission that deals with several businesses - electricity, gas, water etc - setting prices according to the required rate of return. The method is legalistic but with opportunity for public participation. Regulatory decisions are frequently appealed to the courts. In practice, the US system is burdensome, does little to encourage efficiency, and tends to promote central planning at the expense of enterprise. In contrast, the British regulatory system is meant to be light, muscular and unbureaucratic. The primary duty of the regulator is to promote competition. For monopolies, price-capping is preferred to rate-of-return regulation, with price increases restricted to less than the rate of inflation (RPI-x). Each industry is regulated separately. A single regulator replaces the tribunal in the search for a speedy, unbureaucratic process. There are no public hearings. The regulators work behind closed doors, they do not have to justify their decisions, and appeals against them are discouraged. The industry has to acquiesce or accept a full Monopolies and Mergers Commissions review. Were we right to depart from the American way? I believe we were - particularly in the fundamental emphasis the UK places on putting the creation of competitive markets ahead of the restraint of monopoly. The evidence of the privatised electricity industry is compelling in that the creation of a competitive environment with open access to the market has been instrumental in shaking up management, slicing out costs, and reducing prices. Nevertheless, the British regulatory system could learn something from the Americans. There are six areas where improvements could be made. First, we need to define more precisely the role of regulation. The founding statutes give little guidance as to its objectives. Regulators are instructed to 'promote competition'. But to what extent? For example, are the regulators there to create a lot of players with predetermined small market shares, or alternatively to create the market conditions to allow competition to flourish? Second, regulators should publish their 'strategic plan' for regulating the industries under their jurisdiction. Where management of a regulated business knows its regulator's objectives in some detail, it can plan accordingly. Third, the regulatory process should be more open to scrutiny. Currently, it is not very clear how or why each regulator views evidence, weighs the arguments, or comes to decisions. Some public hearings are necessary, and regulators' work would benefit from public examination. Quick appeals procedures, such as an ad hoc panel of the MMC, would enable the regulator and regulated to test each other's arguments. Fourth, replace the single regulator with a tribunal of three or five members to remove the 'cult of personality' from the discussions between the regulator and the regulated. This would discourage newspapers from adopting a 'league-table' approach to regulation: who has the most brownie points for being the toughest regulator. More important, it might make the job more do-able, rather than leaving a single person to regulate large and complex industries. A small tribunal could bring diversified experience to bear. Fifth, bring the various regulators together into a common organisation to enable the quality of support staff to be raised and to transfer experience between industries. Common issues, such as the cost of capital or the treatment of external costs like environmental impacts, could be more readily addressed. Sixth, much more work needs to be done on the impact that the regulators are having on the investment, efficiency, and quality of service of the industries. Are regulators achieving their goals? Are prices lower, efficiency higher and customers better off than they might otherwise have been? It is time to move away from chatter about the personality of the regulators to concern about what their objectives really should be and the impact they are having. Simple faith in such tools as RPI-x is not an adequate regulatory formula. The author is chief executive, National Power</p>

			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / A little more to gnaw away: Bernard Simon on separatist pressures resurfacing in Quebec Every Quebec nationalist remembers the evening of May 20 1980. The Parti Quebecois government had lost a referendum in which it had hoped to gain a mandate to separate from Canada. At the end of an emotional speech to thousands of downcast supporters at a Montreal arena, the PQ's leader, Mr Rene Levesque, sounded a consoling note: 'A la prochaine.' Till next time. The drive towards that next time is set to begin on Monday. If opinion polls are correct, Quebeckers will sweep the separatists back into power in a provincial election, ending nine years of rule by the Liberal party, which wants Quebec to remain part of Canada. The PQ has promised it will immediately prepare for another referendum in 1995 to decide whether Quebec, the uniquely French-speaking corner of North America, should go it alone. The possibility that the world's second biggest country will split up is likely to heighten nervousness among investors holding Canadian bonds and doing business in Quebec. Already there is evidence that the uncertainty is having an economic cost: Quebec's bonds offer a higher return than any of Canada's other nine provinces, except impoverished Newfoundland. Changes in Quebec and in its relations with the rest of Canada over the past 14 years have undoubtedly narrowed the odds on an eventual break-up. Quebeckers already regard themselves in many ways as a separate nation. Their blue-and-white fleur-de-lys flag is more in evidence on the streets of Montreal and Quebec City than the Canadian maple leaf. 'The only reason countries stay together is because they share a common vision and a culture,' says Ms Rita Dionne-Marsolais, who is expected to be a minister in the new PQ government. The tide of nationalism is sufficiently strong that Mr Daniel Johnson, the current Quebec premier expected to lead the Liberals to defeat, felt obliged to apologise in the campaign for having said he was first and foremost a Canadian. Quebec separatism was fuelled in the 1980s by the federal Conservative government under Mr Brian Mulroney who, unlike Mr Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s, sympathised with Quebec's demands for greater autonomy. Mr Mulroney's Conservatives also depended on Quebec nationalists for election victories in 1984 and 1988. Mr Johnson and other present-day federalists have had difficulty countering the separatists' argument that the rest of Canada has become a burden on Quebec. Ottawa's debt has swollen to the point where one-third of revenues are channelled into debt-service payments. The separatists also point to costly duplication of services between the federal and provincial governments, among them skills training. And a panoply of internal non-tariff trade barriers, such as provincial government procurement preferences, often makes it more difficult for Canadian companies to trade across provincial borders than to export to the US. 'There is one government too many,' says a senior PQ official. Many Quebeckers also bristle at real and perceived slights from English-speaking Canadians. Bilingual signs in faraway Calgary and Vancouver are dismissed as tokenism. 'There's more interest in learning French in New York or in San Francisco than in Toronto,' says Ms Dionne-Marsolais. Federalists hope Monday's election result will reflect little more than Quebeckers' wish for a change of government. Despite the ebullience of nationalists, opinion polls confirm a clear (and growing) majority of Quebeckers is opposed to a total break from Canada. The business community has kept a low profile during the election campaign. 'I'm not nervous at all,' says the head of one of the province's biggest financial institutions. 'There's a consensus among French-speaking businessmen that this is an election, not a referendum. The real fight will be the referendum.' But the risk is that the separatists, once in office, will be well placed to influence public opinion. The PQ has pledged immediately to pass a 'solemn declaration' in Quebec's national assembly affirming its desire for negotiations leading to independence and to draft a new constitution. A separatist government is also expected to provoke confrontation with the rest of the country to prove its point that Canada is unworkable in its present form. The PQ's current leader, Mr Jacques Parizeau, has, for example, given notice that he has little interest in talks on reforming Canada's social-security and healthcare systems, which are ad-ministered by the prov-inces but largely funded by Ottawa. Unlike in 1980, the PQ will be backed by a sizeable contingent of separatists in the federal parliament in Ottawa. Its recently created federal counterpart, the Bloc Quebecois, won 54 seats in last year's general election, making it the official opposition. The BQ's leader, Mr Lucien Bouchard, is widely considered the shrewdest political leader in Quebec. One big stumbling block for the PQ, however, is that its strategy for independence depends heavily on co-operation from the rest of Canada. The PQ hopes Ottawa would support a sovereign Quebec's admission to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). It would expect an amicable division of the federal debt. And the PQ envisages that an independent Quebec would still use the Canadian dollar, and that Quebeckers would not lose their Canadian passports. 'I don't expect goodwill, I just expect reasonableness,' says one senior PQ official. But such reasonableness cannot be assumed. A raft of potentially explosive issues is bound to surface. Aboriginal people, who claim title to vast tracts of Quebec, are opposed to independence and the PQ cannot take the loyalty of French-speakers in Canada's armed forces for granted. Perhaps most worrying for ordinary Quebeckers is whether their government pensions, as well as their retirement savings held by Toronto-based financial institutions, are secure. Many remember the capital flight from Quebec before the 1980 referendum which helped accelerate Montreal's replacement by Toronto as Canada's financial centre. With both sides wielding such powerful arguments, a referendum - if it takes place at all - will undoubtedly be a more bitter affair than Monday's election. One sure bet is that the uncertainty which will prevail as Mr Levesque's 'next time' approaches will do neither Quebec nor the rest of Canada much good.</p>

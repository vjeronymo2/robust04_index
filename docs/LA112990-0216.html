			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> It may still be too early to decorate your own Christmas tree, but you can plug  into a large dose of holiday spirit this weekend if you head to Altadena and  help string electric lights on the 105-year-old deodar trees that line  Christmas Tree Lane.  </P> <P> The mile-long section of Santa Rosa Avenue has been known as Christmas Tree  Lane since the early 1920s, when Pasadena department store owner F. C. Nash  first lit the more than 100 evergreens lining the residential street.  </P> <P> The 40-foot strings of lights are hauled up into the 90-foot trees by a pulley  system and each tree has its own electrical power box, said Bill Caulfield, who  has lived on Santa Rosa for 34 years and is a past president of the Christmas  Tree Lane Assn.  </P> <P> Volunteers spend about six Saturdays working the pulleys, placing the light  strings and putting in the colored bulbs that illuminate the towering trees for  two weeks during the Christmas season, Caulfield said. "It used to be that the  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers would send 75 or 100 men out on a Saturday  and they'd get the whole job done in  </P> <P> one day," Caulfield said, "but those days are gone."  </P> <P> Now, the project could not be completed without hundreds of volunteers. It is  financed by the nonprofit association with an annual budget of about $1,500, he  said.  </P> <P> Estimates have been made that more than 100,000 carloads of people drive  through the lane each year to marvel at the towering deodars, he said.  </P> <P> So, if you want to stock up on some goodwill and holiday cheer, go up to Santa  Rosa between Woodbury Road and Altadena Drive on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 2:30  p.m. to get in on the decorating fun.  </P> <P> The trees, which this year have been designated a California Historic Landmark  and placed on the National Register of Historic Places, will be lighted in a  ceremony on Dec. 14 at 6 p.m. and will be lit through New Year's Day.  </P> <P> Volunteers should look for the yellow flag on Santa Rosa, where the work will  be going on. Adults and older children, junior high school age and up, are  welcome. Lunch will be served. KAREN E. KLEIN  </P></p>

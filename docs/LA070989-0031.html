			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: BARRY MANILOW "BARRY MANILOW." ARISTA ***;  </P> <P> POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD  VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> On his first pop-oriented album in four years, Manilow has largely dispensed  with the Big Finish -- the booming, crashing climax that was long his  trademark. The Big Finish contributed to Manilow's long string of hits in the  '70s, but also hastened his decline in the '80s as many fans tired of the  tightly constructed formula. The best songs on Manilow's new album, including  the tender ballads "Keep Each Other Warm" and "Some Good Things Never Last,"  are looser and more fluid. The increased subtlety and restraint give the album  a more contemporary sensibility. The quality of the songs -- Manilow had a hand  in writing only two -- doesn't compare with his best '70s work, but the sound  rethinking of his approach is encouraging. PAUL GREIN  </P></p>

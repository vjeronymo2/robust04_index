			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAY INCREASES FOR FEDERAL RETIREES  </P> <P> Mr. Keith, if you believe that through your double or triple dipping you are  overpaid, you are probably right and have the privilege of refusing one of your  pensions or returning it to the proper authorities. On the other hand, you have  the right to use the surplus to help the homeless or any other unfortunates.  </P> <P> However, I beg you to cease this effort to stop COLA increases since you  obviously do not know what you are doing.  </P> <P> I worked very hard to earn a government pension. I certainly earned much more  than the $21,850 salary you mention, and my pension is less than half that  amount with COLAs. What's more, my Social Security pension is cut in proportion  to the amount of government pension I receive with the result that my Social  Security check is chicken feed. In fact, it would not support a chickadee.  </P> <P> By combining my pensions with those of my husband, including COLAs, we are  barely able to keep our heads above water and keep bread sans butter on the  table.  </P> <P> I have been retired only four years and already I have had to dip into savings  for such things as car and home repairs.  </P> <P> Without COLAs, we would lose all hope of surviving and soon join the homeless.  </P> <P> BARBARA G. THOMAS  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

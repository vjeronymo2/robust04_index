			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / People: Airport shops take off BAA's commitment to retailing as a core source of future growth has been sealed by the promotion of Barry Gibson, group retailing director, to the main board, with the airport operator aiming to earn more than half of its revenue from Gibson's area by the end of next year. Gibson, 40, who joined BAA in 1989, worked initially as commercial director at Heathrow Airport. There he began the 'value-for money' drive and also started to introduce 'branded retailing concepts that the public recognises'. At the end of last year, shortly after industry regulator CAA unveiled its pricing formula for BAA's traditional revenue source of airport charges, he was moved into a newly created job, in charge of group retailing. While BAA cannot claim to remain unscathed by the recession, its captive audience of relatively high-spending consumers has helped to insulate it; half of the passengers passing through BAA airports are foreign, and of the domestic portion, over half are from the AB social groups. With plans to add half a million square feet of retailing space between now and 1996, Gibson says the thrust is to replace the anonymous Skyshops and the like with branded retailers and caterers. Before joining BAA, Gibson had cut his teeth in retailing at Littlewoods and then at Burton, where he had been retail director of Top Shop. In 1983, he launched what he now refers to as a 'me-too Top Shop', Surprise, a 'typically 1980's BES enterprise' sold in 1987 to Barker &amp; Dobson. He spent a year at Vivat Holdings, preparing Jean Machine for sale, before joining BAA. ***** David Bucks, a former deputy chairman of Hill Samuel Bank, has joined the board of troubled chemicals group MTM as non-executive deputy chairman. Bucks, who retired from Hill Samuel in June 1991, says that despite the manifest problems, he is joining a virtually new management team of 'very competent people who are well versed in the chemical industry'. He was introduced to chief executive Ken Schofield and chairman David Swallow through his old merchant bank, which has picked up MTM as a client since the management restructuring earlier this year. Other non-executive directorships that Bucks, 58, has picked up since retiring include First Leisure and Dobson Park Industries. He is also chairman of Grosvenor Development Capital. Hugh Hughes and Roger Hornett, European equity specialists who had been toying with the idea of launching their own boutique, have joined Societe Generale, to set up a London brokerage unit. Societe Generale Equities International (SGEI) will provide research, trading and sales for cross-border transactions in continental European equities. Notwithstanding low trading volumes and highly uncertain times for Europe's bourses, Hughes, the new chief executive of SGEI, says SocGen is proceeding with its plan to pull together its capital market operations on the continent, thereby hoping to capture a slice of the 'pan-European generalist' business. SGEI will be based in London rather than Paris, operating from the offices of, but remaining separate from, UK equities broker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. Hughes, 40, says the aim is to attract clients 'who want to talk about Europe as a one market - and a lot of those clients still like to be managed out of London'. The former European director of Savory Milln, who says his wife is French - 'which means I speak a modicum of French' - had spent a year with Paribas in London after leaving Swiss Bank Corporation (which had acquired Savoury Milln). Roger Hornett, 45, formerly international director of James Capel, had moved on to the UK arm of Singapore-based stockbrokers Sassoon, but left last year. The two were planning to set up their own business when SocGen approached Hughes to do some consultancy work, from which the new unit and two job offers emerged.</p>

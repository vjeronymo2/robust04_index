			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Ulster talks MR James Molyneaux, the Ulster Unionist leader, yesterday said that the Hume-Adams political initiative was designed to wreck hopes of Northern Ireland having its own government. As SDLP leader Mr John Hume prepares to brief the Irish government on proposals which he and the Sinn Fein president Mr Gerry Adams believe could be the start of a process to end the violence, Mr Molyneaux said the two nationalist leaders were involved in a conspiracy. He said their aim was to kill off any prospect of a workable form of devolution.</p>

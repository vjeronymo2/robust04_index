			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Mexican inflation at 17-year low MEXICO'S inflation rate fell to 11.9 per cent last year, the lowest for 17 years, although still higher than the government's single-digit forecast. The Mexican government has made the reduction of inflation the central plank of macro-economic policy, and may be disappointed that the figure for December was 4 per cent. It would have been worse had the government not arrested in mid-December the leader of the 16,000 tortilla producers for trying to raise prices of the maize-based staple food. The government subsequently closed or fined 572 tortilla outlets. The inflation rate implies the peso appreciated in real terms by about 6 per cent last year, building on real appreciation in previous years. President Carlos Salinas and US President-elect Bill Clinton were due to meet yesterday in Austin, Texas. The two leaders expected to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the details of Mr Clinton's proposed parallel agreements on labour and the environment.</p>

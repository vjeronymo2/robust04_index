			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Inflation warning on UK rates UK interest rates will have to be raised by a full percentage point in the coming months if inflation is to be kept below the government's target of 4 per cent, a leading economic research body warned yesterday. Raising rates might be politically unwelcome for the government, but the new climate of openness means that the Bank of England increasingly has the upper hand in setting inflation policy, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research says. '(The government) has allowed a situation to develop in which it is difficult for the bank's advice on interest rate moves to be rejected,' the report adds, saying the bank is increasingly inclined to approve increases.

However,  because some departments and units have treated in an improper  manner enterprises' right to use export commodity trademarks,  many disputes have occurred concerning trademark use, causing a  certain amount of confusion in the domestic and international  markets, damage to the reputations of the relevant trademarks,  and a negative impact on the relevant enterprises' operations  and development. To prevent the recurrence of this situation  in the course of structural change and to make it easier for the  relevant departments and units to handle the trademark problem  properly, the following circular is issued:    1. Registered trademark proprietors can dispose of the  use of their trademarks within the framework of the Trademark  Law and the relevant regulations; no department or unit is  allowed to interfere.    2. If an enterprise establishes another type of  foreign trade enterprise and wishes to use the registered  trademarks of others for foreign-related business operations, it  must obtain approval from the registered trademark proprietors,  and in accordance with the law, sign contracts approving the use  of such trademarks. The unapproved use of the registered  trademarks of others is prohibited.    3. Both signatories are responsible for the quality of  the commodities bearing the approved trademarks. The approved  enterprise is subject to the coordination, supervision, and  management by the relevant department and by the approving  enterprise with respect to sales market, customer, and price.    The approved enterprise must have its name shown on the  packing of the commodities bearing the registered trademarks of  others.    4. In changing its structure or establishing other  economic organizations, should an enterprise wish to transfer a  domestically or foreign-registered trademark, it should abide by  the principle of compensatory transfer (with the exception of  those having an agreement).    5. Enterprise groups or other types of economic  combination organizations the members of which are independent  legal persons are not allowed to force these members to transfer  their registered trademarks, nor is the higher administrative  department allowed to force them to transfer their registered  trademarks.    6. In principle, an enterprise using its registered  trademark as investment capital cannot change its status as the  main trademark proprietor.    All levels of administrative departments are required to  implement these provisions and to mediate in enterprises'  trademark disputes according to the law in the course of foreign  trade structural change. Serious violations of the Trademark  Law and regulations, or infringements of the trademark  proprietorship of others, must be stopped resolutely. If the  higher administrative department violates the Trademark Law and  regulations, or if it interferes in the normal use and  management of registered trademarks, enterprises have the right  to ask people's courts for legal protection.    [Signed] Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and  Trade    16 June 1992.</p>

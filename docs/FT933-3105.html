			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / International Company News: Viacom stock falls on news of chief's deal SHARES in Viacom, the cable television operator which is seeking to buy Paramount Communications, fell sharply yesterday as it emerged that chairman Mr Sumner Redstone had been a big buyer of his company's shares in recent months. The slide pushed down the value of Viacom's bid, mainly for shares, to Dollars 7.6bn from Dollars 8.2bn at the time the deal was announced at the weekend, apparently increasing the chance that a rival bidder for Paramount may step in. Viacom said that Mr Redstone's purchases 'complied with all applicable laws and regulations'. The purchases 'had been fully disclosed to Paramount' and were 'never intended to affect the price of Viacom stock', it added. In New York, Viacom's B shares closed down Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 55 3/8 yesterday, while its A shares slid Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 61 1/2. Paramount shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 63 1/8 .</p>

According to a report by JIEFANGJUN JIANKANG ZAZHI [PLA  HEALTH JOURNAL], at a meeting with German Chancellor Kohl in  1984, Deng Xiaoping revealed his method of keeping in good  health. On that occasion, Kohl asked Deng about his secret for  achieving longevity, Deng answered: "I am always optimistic,  and I am not afraid of the sky falling."    Deng Xiaoping added: "I am taking care of fewer and fewer  things, and letting other people take care of more things. I  want to live a few years longer. My greatest hope is to live  beyond 1997."    Deng Xiaoping told Kohl that he still swims and plays  bridge.  Deng said that playing bridge was the best way to rest after  being busy with state affairs, because he could forget  everything else after taking up the cards.    The report also quoted Deng as saying: "In the past 10  years, I have not even caught a cold. One of the reasons for my  good health is that I take a cold shower every morning."</p>

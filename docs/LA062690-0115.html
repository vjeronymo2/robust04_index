			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PSYCHOLOGISTS WIN HIGH COURT RULING ON HOSPITAL SUPERVISION;  </P> <P> MEDICINE: DECISION ALLOWS THEM TO OVERSEE TREATMENT OF HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS.  PSYCHIATRISTS HAD FOUGHT TO BAR THE PRACTICE.  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court on Monday settled a hard-fought mental health turf war,  ruling that hospitals may permit clinical psychologists, like medically trained  psychiatrists, to supervise the treatment of their hospitalized patients.  </P> <P> The court, by a vote of 4 to 3, rejected claims by medical groups, who had  argued that psychologists, because they are not medical doctors, do not have  the legal authority to care for the mentally ill in hospitals.  </P> <P> Two state statutes -- one recognizing psychology as an "independent health  profession," the other barring "discrimination" against psychologists -- permit  hospitals to allow psychologists on their staffs to supervise the admission,  diagnosis, treatment and discharge of their patients, the court said in an  opinion by Justice Allen E. Broussard.  </P> <P> The ruling came in a lengthy dispute between psychiatrists -- who as physicians  may perform surgery, prescribe drugs and order shock treatment -- and  psychologists, who may not perform those tasks but may conduct testing,  counseling and psychotherapy.  </P> <P> Psychiatrists, backed by the 280,000-member American Medical Assn. and the  35,000-member American Psychiatric Assn., contended that psychologists lack the  broad training and experience of doctors and should not be allowed to supervise  their patients when their condition is serious enough to warrant  hospitalization.  </P> <P> Psychologists, led by the 70,000-member American Psychological Assn. and its  10,000-member California affiliate, argued that such restrictions denied  patients free choice and would reduce competition, thus contributing to  escalating health care costs.  </P> <P> Monday's ruling was welcomed warmly by Michele H. Licht of Sherman Oaks, an  attorney for the California Assn. of Psychology Providers. "This is clearly a  victory for patients and consumers, who will benefit from having more  competition in the health care field," Licht said. "Patients should have the  right to be under the care of their own psychologist, and not be cut off at the  hospital door."  </P> <P> Ellis J. Horvitz of Encino, attorney for a coalition of medical organizations,  expressed several concerns about the potential impact of expanding the  authority of psychologists.  </P> <P> Horvitz noted that much of the treatment of hospitalized mental patients  requires the use of medications, which must be prescribed by physicians. He  added that hospitals could open themselves to liability for medical malpractice  if they granted staff privileges to an unqualified psychologist.  </P> <P> The case arose in 1984 after state health officials issued regulations  prohibiting hospitals from permitting a psychologist to take primary  responsibility for diagnosis and treatment of hospitalized patients.  </P> <P> A group of psychologists brought suit, contending the regulations violated  state laws passed in 1978 and 1980 that appeared to ease previous restrictions  on psychologists. In 1985, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge agreed with the  psychologists and overturned the regulations. But three years later, a state  Court of Appeal reversed that ruling and placed the prime responsibility back  in the hands of psychiatrists.  </P> <P> In Monday's ruling, the state high court concluded the law was intended to  leave it up to hospitals whether to permit psychologists to perform the same  functions that they performed in outpatient practice.  </P> <P> The justices acknowledged the concerns of the medical profession about placing  authority in the hands of psychologists. "Such disputes over the competence of  the professions must be decided by the Legislature, not the courts," Broussard  wrote in an opinion joined by Justices Stanley Mosk and David N. Eagleson and  Appellate Justice Steven J. Stone, sitting temporarily by special assignment.  </P> <P> The court noted that physicians must still be available at a hospital to  determine if a patient needs medical treatment.  </P> <P> Justice Joyce L. Kennard, joined by Chief Justice Malcolm M. Lucas and Justice  Edward A. Panelli, dissented.  </P></p>

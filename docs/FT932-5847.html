			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / S African politicians fight to keep talks on track SOUTH African politicians last night battled to keep the constitutional negotiating process on track as negotiators finally began to discuss fundamental issues such as the process for writing a new constitution. Negotiators acknowledged that they had failed to achieve sufficient progress on constitutional issues to announce a firm date for the first multi-racial elections tomorrow, as had been expected. They postponed a meeting of the 208-member negotiating forum, charged with announcing a date, until 25 June. But they held out hopes that a target election date could be announced instead, with the date to be finalised only once agreement had been reached on a constitution under which elections could be held. The government and the ANC are keen to announce a date by their self-imposed deadline of tomorrow - even if it is just a target date - to avoid a threatened outbreak of mass action and violence. The ANC's youth leader, Mr Peter Mokaba, had threatened that black youngsters would make the country ungovernable unless an election date was set by Thursday. Negotiators from the 26 parties represented at the multi-party forum yesterday took a step towards narrowing the differences between them on constitutional issues when the Inkatha Freedom Party agreed in principle to accept an elected constituent assembly to draft a final constitution. This represents a fundamental shift in the negotiating position of Inkatha; but final agreement will be conditional on agreement to grant significant powers to regional government under a new constitution. Negotiators are due to discuss this issue, the crux of the constitutional problem, tomorrow. The ANC also made a significant concession, agreeing that the powers of regional governments should be agreed by the 26-party forum rather than an elected assembly. This process is likely to favour the interests of Inkatha. Meanwhile, negotiators faced further delays over the issue of whether the Pan Africanist Congress should be excluded from the talks. Government insists that the PAC should be ejected from the talks because it has refused to abandon its armed struggle.</p>

			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Improved ferry safety urged The Royal Institution of Naval Architects yesterday called for urgent action to improve safety standards on roll-on-roll-off passenger ferries. The sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic last month with the loss of more than 900 lives gave added weight to the call for tighter standards, it said. The institution first made a plea for improvements in 1988.</p>

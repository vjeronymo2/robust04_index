			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / TGWU gives backing to electoral reform THE prospect of Labour endorsing some version of proportional representation came closer yesterday when the biggest union affiliated to the party gave strong backing to electoral reform. Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU general union, said the party could no longer support a status quo which continued to return governments backed by only a minority of the popular vote. 'The electoral options should be actively examined,' he said. 'I would not be averse to seeing some sort of new arrangement, but exactly which system I do not know.' Mr Morris stressed that this was the consensus of an internal union debate on the subject. 'The great weight of opinion has shifted in favour of some sort of change', he said. The union's change of position may have a significant influence on the final outcome of Labour's commission on electoral reform under Lord Plant. A two-day meeting to discuss systems for the Commons ended inconclusively yesterday with the committee reporting that it was examining three systems. One is the existing first-past-the-post system; a second is the alternative vote system in which voters number candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate wins more than 50 per cent of the votes then the votes for the candidate at the bottom of the poll are reallocated among all the other candidates until somebody acquires more than 50 per cent. But the system thought most likely to be adopted if first-past-the-post is rejected is a version of the alternative member system in which 150 Commons seats would be reserved for 'best losers' and allocated by means of an equation intended to reflect the performance of parties on a proportional basis. A final report to the national executive committee is due to be submitted in April. Support for proportional representation from the left-of-centre TGWU has taken some observers by surprise as the union continues to be associated with conservative positions on many other issues, such as links with the unions. The union seems more disillusioned than many others with the Labour party. It is to scale down its affiliation with the party, reflecting both its falling membership and a change in its political priorities, although it will still wield 10 per cent of the vote at this year's party conference. Of the other large unions the GMB general union continues to support a first-past-the-post system while the AEEU engineering and electricians' union has long been a supporter of electoral reform.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: BCI to strengthen links with other banks Banca Commerciale Italiana, the recently privatised Italian bank, is planning to strengthen cross-shareholdings with Commerzbank of Germany and Creditanstalt of Austria. The BCI board yesterday authorised negotiations for the purchase of a 1 per cent stake in Commerzbank, which already owns just under 3 per cent of the Italian bank and is represented on the board. BCI said talks were already under way with the German bank. BCI also said last night that it was interested in buying 3 per cent of the voting shares of Creditanstalt, a holding equivalent to 2 per cent of the overall capital of the Vienna-based institution, which is being privatised. Creditanstalt, which also has a representative on the BCI board, has been a BCI shareholder since the Italian bank was founded last century. BCI's name had already been mentioned in rumours about the formation of a consortium to buy into the capital of the Austrian bank to prevent control falling into unfriendly hands. BCI said last night that it had simply declared its willingness to buy shares, and it would be up to the Austrians to decide how such an operation should be carried out.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Labour in control of council body LABOUR HAS won overall control of the Association of County Councils for the first time in the organisation's 104-year history, John Authers writes. The development - which follows the Conservatives' disastrous showing in last month's county council elections when they lost control of all but one of the 20 counties they were defending - intensifies the difficulties facing Mr John Gummer, the new environment secretary, in his dealings with local government. Labour's majority was assured yesterday when a selection panel at hung Cheshire county council gave the party two seats on the ACC executive, with one each for the Tories and the Liberal Democrats. This ensures the party of an overall majority of five seats on the ACC's executive council. The Conservatives are now the ACC's third-largest party. This puts Labour in charge of three of the four main representative bodies for local government in mainland Britain. The Association of Metropolitan Authorities and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are Labour controlled, while the Association of District Councils remains under a minority Tory leadership. Labour's strength on the ACC was boosted last week by a decision of Labour-controlled Derbyshire county council to rejoin the association after a 12-year gap, giving the party an extra three seats.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Observer: Late developers If one judges merchant banking boutiques by the glitter of the names, one would find it hard to beat the newly formed J Rothschild, Wolfensohn &amp; Co. Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, will be chairman, and Lord Rothschild, Jim Wolfensohn and Sir Mark Weinberg will be on the board. All it needs is Sir Jimmy Goldsmith's name on the letterhead and it would be hard to better the boardroom connections. That said, the Transatlantic combination is slightly odd. What have Lord Rothschild, 55, and Jim Wolfensohn, 58, got in common? Although both men are regarded by some as establishment figures, they are also outsiders. Australian-born Wolfensohn made his mark in the US after he missed out on the top job at Schroders. Lord Rothschild is remembered for his takeover tilt at BAT Industries rather than his impressive merchant banking career. Wolfensohn has acted purely as an adviser, unhindered by conflicts of interest, whereas Lord Rothschild has often acted as a principal in transactions. Interesting to see whether the proposed combination lives up to its early promise, given the inbuilt tensions.</p>

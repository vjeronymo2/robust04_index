			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Belarusian Defense Minister Pavel Kazlowski </F> by Yuriy Bekhterev; place and date not given: "Defense Is More  Reliable With the Ruble"]    [Text] [Bekhterev] Pavel Pavlovich, you participated in  the Moscow CIS leaders summit which discussed the improvement of  the collective security system. This aspect of the meeting,  however, has been kept in the background. Neither Russian nor  Belarusian papers have provided any details on the negotiations  and agreements signed at the summit. Is this a military secret?    [Kazlowski] Not everything is secret. The agreements, as  far as I know, are not secret, and they will be made public.  Journalists are simply more interested in economic, social, or  national issues than in military cooperation which has recently  become unfashionable. This is, as the saying goes, a matter of  taste however.    Two packages of military issues have been discussed at the  Moscow meeting. The first one concerns measures for stabilizing  the situation on the Tajikistani-Afghan border and timetables,  the number, and the tasks of the peacekeeping forces in the  Republic of Tajikistan.    However, since Belarus had not signed an agreement on  sending  peacekeeping contingents, we did not participate in the debate  on these issues.    Also signed at the meeting were a resolution on the Council  of CIS States Defense Ministers and an agreement on cooperation  in mobilizing the economies of CIS countries.    Documents from the second package were also aimed at  strengthening the CIS collective security system.    These were draft declarations of members of the Treaty on  Collective Security, draft regulations regarding procedures of  the Collective Security Council, draft documents regulating  activities of the council's secretariat, and draft agreement on  its location.    The defense ministers initialed the drafts, but due to the  fact that the agenda of the meeting of state and government  leaders was very tight, documents from "the second military  package" were not included in it. Perhaps they will be  discussed at another meeting of state leaders, which is supposed  to be held in early September.    Even though economic issues dominated the Moscow summit and  they virtually drove back military aspects, I do not see  anything dangerous in this. It is important today to stabilize  the situation in industry and the agricultural sector. If this  is accomplished, defense problems will be resolved more  successfully.    [Bekhterev] Nevertheless, relations between national armies  should also develop dynamically. Is it possible that this  process will be slowed down, because the most important  documents were not signed?    [Kazlowski] Regardless of specific results of the meeting --  whether specific documents were signed or not -- the work aimed  at improving cooperation and integration between national armies  is continuing. First of all, the pace of this work is currently  being determined by such a strictly civil process as the  unification of Belarusian and Russian monetary systems. If this  process, as the saying goes, proceeds, it will also be much  easier for servicemen to develop relations in their area. We  also lose a lot due to the disruption of economic ties.    It should be enough to say that 80 percent of all Defense  Ministry expenditures goes to Russia. This amounts to billions  and billions of rubles.    This figure is astronomically high not because we waste this  money. We purchase only essential equipment without which our  Army would no longer be an army. The problem is that Russian  enterprises charge us three times as much as they do at Russia's  internal market. If there is a common ruble and economic zone,  it will be easier for us to supply the Army, train personnel,  and earn experience....    [Bekhterev] Yet, Pavel Pavlovich, it is not a long way from  the common ruble to a common army with Russia?    [Kazlowski] Nobody says that there will be any unified CIS  armed forces. The status of our Army is defined by the  Constitution and the policy of neutrality, which has been  conducted by our young state. There is no need to change this.  While the independent Belarusian state exists, it will  definitely have its own army.    Another thing is that today we are unable to defend our  sovereignty alone, either from military or political or economic  viewpoints. Yes, Belarus is a state which proceeds toward  neutrality, but not toward self-isolation!    Why should we disrupt the unified antiaircraft defense  system  with Russia? Without Russian radars we would end up totally  undefended against airstrikes by modern planes and missiles. It  is technically impossible to develop any system of early warning  on a small territory. I do not mention using satellites without  which efficient defense and military command is unthinkable.    Let us look at personnel training. To train, for example,  pilots, it is necessary to create completely new structures,  which would cost millions of dollars. The development of  military science and new equipment... The list can go on and  on. I would briefly respond to your question that Belarus needs  a national army included in the CIS collective security system.  The deeper the military integration the more reliable the  defense of our state.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Telecom Eireann falls by IPounds 3m Telecom Eireann, the state-owned Irish telecommunications monopoly, reported a drop of IPounds 3m to IPounds 91m (Pounds 85.5m), in pre-tax profits for the year to April 2 1992. Turnover rose IPounds 6m to IPounds 788m despite revenues being constrained by the impact of price reductions introduced last January and reduced overseas contract work. The price reductions will cost IPounds 50m in revenues in a full year. Operating profits fell IPounds 16m to IPounds 189m but financing costs also dropped - by IPounds 13m. Net debt fell IPounds 55m to IPounds 998m, the first time since 1986 that it has been below IPounds 1bn. In 1985, Telecom was incurring losses of IPounds 65m.</p>

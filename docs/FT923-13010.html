			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Miyazawa works hard to rally faithful THERE was no doubt yesterday about the voting intention of the 77-year-old with the black string tie: 'Of course I support Mr Nakasone. How could I not support him? I went to the same primary school as his father.' A little Japanese flag resting in his lap, the Liberal Democratic Party supporter had come to listen to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, who reassured the local faithful that their man, Mr Hirofumi Nakasone, was worthy of a vote in elections on July 26. The vote, for half the seats in the upper house of parliament, is seen as a test of voter confidence in the ruling party which has been tainted by scandal, troubled by internal divisions and faced with opposition to legislation allowing military personnel to join overseas peacekeeping missions. But for all the anguished debate this year over Japan's international role, the issues that yesterday most troubled the people of Gunma Prefecture, north of Tokyo, were bridges, motorways and other public works projects of the pork-barrel variety. As the well-meaning Mr Miyazawa gave a mostly elderly audience a rundown of his experiences at the Group of Seven summit last week and of his concerns about Russian inflation and Cambodia, a few of the little Japanese flags slipped from freckled hands and eyes gently closed. What stirs the locals was better understood by Mr Nakasone, 46, son of Yasuhiro Nakasone, the former prime minister, who began his speech with a polite reference to his respected father and gave a commitment to the eradication of traffic jams in Gunma. The candidacy of Mr Nakasone is itself a sign of the small-town nature of Japanese politics. There are 13 sons of politicians competing for seats and the people of Gunma who have supported Yasuhiro are inclined to support Hirofumi in his campaign for re-election. Japan's electoral system works against politicians who neglect the small town. Mr Nakasone is one of four candidates competing for two seats representing the Gunma district, and his main competition is coming from a local member of his own party, Mr Kosei Ueno. The two other candidates are from the Japan Communist Party and Rengo, the trade union party, and are also supported by the Social Democratic Party and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist Party. LDP officials hope to retain both seats, but one may go to the Rengo representative, Mr Yoshiro Akane, vice-president of the Gunma Sailing Association. With that outcome in mind, the two LDP candidates are running separate campaigns with separate headquarters, forcing Mr Miyazawa to give two separate Gunma speeches. Meanwhile, Mr Miyazawa will continue his course around the country over the next week, attempting to convince his polite if unmoved audiences that Russia really matters and that Cambodia does count, and remaining slightly irrelevant to the electoral process.</p>

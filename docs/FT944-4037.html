			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Delors' competition plan finds favour - even with UK Industrialists' ambitions to wield greater influence over European Union policies and legislation which affect their fortunes were given a substantial political boost at the opening session of the summit yesterday. A proposal to establish an international council of expert advisers on competitiveness, tabled by Mr Jacques Delors, outgoing Commission president, was given an unexpectedly warm welcome by EU leaders. Although Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, appeared uneasy about allowing too intimate a link between ministers and commerce, Mr Delors' suggestion of a six-person 'advisory council' was generally accepted as an important element in an emergent policy to address the European economy's structural difficulties. A similarly enthusiastic endorsement was awarded to Monday's agreement among finance and economic ministers on guidelines for improving conditions in the labour market. According to a senior Commission official, the European leaders were demonstrating increased sensitivity to the argument that a cyclical economic recovery would not generate enough jobs to have a significant impact on the European Union's jobless total of 17m. 'I was really quite surprised to see how consensual it all was,' he said. Mr John Major, the British prime minister, for once enthusiastic about a suggestion from the Commission president, urged that the summit should agree on the spot to set up its 'advisory board on European competitiveness'. In return, Commission officials said, Mr Delors offered some flattering remarks on progress made in Britain on stimulating employment. German officials, however, said the proposed 'council for global competitiveness' had first to be discussed in the council of ministers. Mr Delors' outline idea is that a group of six people, comprising experienced business leaders with international experience and possibly an eminent economics expert, should be appointed to advise EU ministers on ways of competing effectively with newly-industrialised countries. Although UK officials claimed the notion was spawned at talks between Mr Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany this spring, it bears a striking resemblance to a series of proposals from Unice, the European employers' association, and the European Round Table, a group representing 40 multinationals based in the EU. Unice's appeal last month called for a 12-member advisory group of industrialists, labour representatives and academics which would 'act as a watchdog by subjecting policy proposals and new regulations to the test of international competitiveness'. Any suggestion that an outside group be allowed such influence over the formulation of legislation is certain to rouse resistance, not least in Germany. Britain, meanwhile, appeared eager yesterday to establish a team which would be invited to scrutinise draft legislation and offer advice on the basis of its potential impact on business. However, the lack of any fundamental disagreement among the governments of the Twelve that European competitiveness is failing, suggests that some sort of international benchmarking group will be established. Benchmarking is a technique in which a manufacturer or service provider examines globally available products, identifies the best according to a wide range of cost and performance criteria, and adapts its own methods to compete. Britain also claimed the lion's share of the credit for this week's package of labour market measures approved by economics and finance ministers on Monday. The ideas, including increased wage flexibility, more mobile labour forces, more training, lower indirect labour costs and restructured social benefit systems, and special measures for the long-term jobless all stemmed from the UK, London officials claimed. One reason for the popularity of such notions is that they impose far lower burdens on tight national budgets than traditional work creation schemes. They are becoming particularly popular in Germany, where the government is under intense pressure from the Bundesbank to rein in spending.</p>

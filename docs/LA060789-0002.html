			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROLLING FIREARMS  </P> <P> It was interesting to note Sen. Davis' rationale for proposing legislation  which would allow random car searches for weapons. The senator, who represents  Valencia, stated, "Even some of our nicest suburbs are getting gang shootings  and gang violence."  </P> <P> My rhetorical question is why do we wait until the problem affects "the  suburbs" before attempts are made to deal with it. Drive-by gang shootings and  rampant drug dealing by gang members have been problems in our urban  communities for years.  </P> <P> Yet, it is only after someone gets shot in Westwood, or Stockton or Valencia  that we see efforts from our Legislature to deal with problems that we have  been complaining about for years. Isn't Compton entitled to the same protection  and concern as Valencia?  </P> <P> KELVIN D. FILER  </P> <P> Compton  </P></p>

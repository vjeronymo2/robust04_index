			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Sherwood blames slack demand for 23% fall Shares in Sherwood Group fell by 12p to 99p yesterday after the clothing and lace manufacturer blamed weak UK demand for a 23 per cent decline in first half profits. Increased competition and sluggish orders for the company's socks and lingerie helped push down pre-tax profits from Pounds 7.76m to Pounds 5.96m, despite increased turnover of Pounds 76.4m (Pounds 69.3m), including Pounds 2.25m from acquisitions. Although earnings per share fell from 4.8p to 3.1p in the six months to July 1, the dividend is raised to 1.15p (1p). Justifying the rise, Mr David Parker, chairman, said: 'Sales have picked up and we're now more optimistic about the second half.' He also pointed out that the first half figures were depressed by reorganisation costs in the UK and among its subsidiary lace manufacturers in continental Europe. The group has cut its European workforce by 18 per cent to 450 and plans to close a factory in Germany, at a cost of Pounds 550,000. It has also spent Pounds 200,000 reorganising its domestic garments business, which will no longer produce children's clothing. The division's operating profits fell by 16 per cent, from Pounds 4.41m to Pounds 3.7m, following losses in children's outerwear and lower sales of socks and lingerie. Sales, however, rose 13 per cent to Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 30.5m) thanks to increased contributions from Lepel, the Italian lingerie manufacturer acquired last year. Profits in the lace division fell from Pounds 4.64m to Pounds 3.42m despite modestly increased turnover of Pounds 42.7m (Pounds 39.9m). Net borrowings, meanwhile, rose from Pounds 22.9m to Pounds 37.2m, equivalent to gearing of 57 per cent, following payment of a deferred consideration for Lapel and the acquisition of Intimate Touch, the US lace distributor, in February. The group also spent Pounds 7.1m on new equipment and facilities, which Mr Parker predicted would enable it to exploit any increase in demand. COMMENT Analysts were rightly dismayed by these results and made swingeing cuts in their full-year forecasts. On even the best expectations, profits are unlikely to exceed Pounds 16m, some 24 per cent below earlier forecasts of about Pounds 21m. The shares look cheap on a forward multiple of 12, but it would take a brave investor to back a clothing company relying on lace - a mature business - and garment sales which have fallen sharply. The problem for Sherwood is that it has relatively little exposure to Marks and Spencer, the most lucrative customer for clothing manufacturers. Its rivals tend to be more aggressive with their suppliers, and it shows in the number of cancelled orders. The shares should stabilise if sales pick up in the second half, but a return to last year's peak looks remote.</p>

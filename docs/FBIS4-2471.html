			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, April 10 (XINHUA) -- Hangzhou, the  capital of east China's Zhejiang Province and a major site of  scenic beauty, has recently launched a massive campaign to  improve its road networks.    The ten projects on the drawing board or under construction  include a third bridge over the Qiantang River, an expressway  around the city, two highway passenger stations, the expansion  of the road to Xinanjiang city, the expressway to Shanghai and  Ningbo, and the dredging of the grand canal.    Though the city's economy has been growing rapidly, city  officials said, the ancient city's antiquated traffic networks  had been imposing an adverse effect on the development of its  tourism and other economic sectors.    This explains why the traffic sector has 10 of the 17 major  projects on the city government's top agenda from 1993 to the  year 2000.    The officials said the 2.3 billion yuan fund for these  projects would be raised by many means besides government  investment.    For example, they said, the expressway around the city would  be built using three million U.S. dollars and four million yuan  from a Hong Kong company.    By leasing a piece of land to overseas banking groups, the  city acquired 225 million yuan for the building of the Qiantang  Bridge.    According to the officials, four of the projects, including  the bridge, the highway to Xinanjiang and others, will be built  and managed by independent commercial companies.    Most of these projects are now under way, and the rest will  begin soon, the officials added.</p>

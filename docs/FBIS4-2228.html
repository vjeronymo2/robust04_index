			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Wen Jihua (2429 4949 5478)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 7 Apr (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, vice  chairman of the Central Military Commission, met with Harold  Brown, former U.S. secretary of defense and adviser to the U.S.  Center for Strategic and International Studies, and his party at  the Diaoyutai Guesthouse this afternoon. The host and guests  exchanged views on bilateral relations and on other issues of  common interest.    Liu Huaqing said to Brown: Ten years ago when you were U.S.  secretary of defense, you made positive contributions to  developing friendship between the two countries and our two  armed forces. He noted that Brown's current visit to China will  be conducive to developing Sino-U.S. relations.    Liu Huaqing said: China and the United States have no  fundamental conflicts of interest. The two armed forces should  maintain regular contacts. Bilateral contacts, however, are now  fairly limited owing to reasons on the U.S. side. He noted that  he welcomed more U.S. friends to visit China to have a look.    He said: The 21st century is not far away. China hopes that  the next century will be one of peace and development. Both  China and the United State should make common efforts to  contribute to realizing this goal.    Liu Huaqing said: The Chinese Armed Forces are responsible  for defending the national sovereignty and territorial integrity  and for maintaining national security and stability. He  stressed that China's military strategy is purely defensive.    As for the Korean nuclear issue, Liu Huaqing reiterated that  China hopes to see a stable Korean peninsula. He said that  China has consistently stood for the denuclearization of the  Korean peninsula and for the settlement of the nuclear issue  through patient dialogue between all the relevant parties. He  added that imposing pressure can only make things more  complicated.    Brown expressed the hope that China and the United States  will continue to improve their relations and strengthen  bilateral cooperation in regional, international security, and  other areas.    Also in the afternoon, Zhang Wannian, chief of the Chinese  People's Liberation Army General Staff, met with Brown and his  party.    Brown and the other U.S. guests are visiting China at the  invitation of the China Center for International Studies.</p>

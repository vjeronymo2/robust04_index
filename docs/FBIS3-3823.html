			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By the LIEN HO PAO news team] </F>   [Text] Li Peng, the premier of mainland China, will visit  Mongolia and four former Soviet republics in Central Asia in  late April. Li Peng originally planned to visit the five  countries in the summer of 1993, but the visit was postponed for  health reasons. It is said that the nationality issue will be  the main subject to be discussed during the upcoming visit.    The Republic of Mongolia [as published] attaches importance  to Li Peng's visit. Senior Mongolian officials will visit  Beijing in early April to discuss the arrangements for Li Peng's  visit with the mainland Chinese authorities. Although the  Mainland Chinese authorities recognize Mongolia's independent  status, few senior Chinese officials have visited Mongolia in  the past, and Mongolia has always kept a wary eye on China. Li  Peng's visit will be the first visit by a Chinese premier to  Mongolia, and this is of great significance for Mongolia.    In the Cold War period, Mongolia survived amid the balance  of  the two great powers, the Soviet Union and mainland China.  Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's  influence in Mongolia decreased, and mainland China's influence  gradually increased. In recent years, large numbers of Chinese  people entered Mongolia, and this gave the Mongolian authorities  cause for serious concern, as they feared that Beijing might  increase its control over Mongolia along with the increasing  Chinese immigrants to the country.    On the other hand, Mongolia needs mainland China's  cooperation in the field of economic development. For example,  the Tumen Jiang Development Project -- which incorporates the  joint participation of mainland China, Russia, Japan, and North  and South Korea -- will give Mongolia an important opportunity  to seek a maritime outlet for its inland economy, and Mongolia  has consistently been enthusiastic about the project.    Li Peng will also visit four Central Asian republics of the  former Soviet Union, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and  Uzbekistan. In recent years, radical Muslim movements have been  prevailing in various Central Asian countries and have had a  major impact on China's Muslim-inhabited areas. There have been  increasing conflicts between Muslims and Han people in China,  and Chinese Muslims have developed stronger separatist ideas.  Reportedly, during his visit, Li Peng will discuss this issue  with leaders of the Central Asian countries and will try to seek  a way to check communication between radical Muslims in Central  Asia and Muslims within China.</p>

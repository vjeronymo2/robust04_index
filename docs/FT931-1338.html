			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Barclays acts faster against stolen cards A COMPUTER system which is designed to block fraudsters as they attempt to misuse Barclaycards will be launched by Barclays bank on April 1. The system is the first of its kind and aims to reduce credit card crime. Last year Barclays, the largest issuer, accounting for up to 40 per cent of the UK market, suffered worldwide losses from credit card fraud of Pounds 31.1m, down from the peak of Pounds 33m in 1991. Total plastic card fraud in the UK last year amounted to Pounds 165m. The new computer system - known as Fraud 2000 - will first compare the purchase being made to a number of common indicators of card fraud, such as the number of transactions made in one day or the amount being spent. If its electronic eyebrows are raised, it will then compare the purchase with the normal pattern of spending by the customer. Barclays says this process will take only one fifth of a second. If it still senses that fraud is involved, it will alert Barclaycard's 24-hour fraud referral unit. A member of staff will speak to the customer over the telephone and will alert police during the conversation if they decide that the card is being used fraudulently. In most cases, Barclays expects the criminal to leave and abandon the stolen card. But it also hopes the system will lead to 20 arrests a day. The bank predicts that its losses from credit card fraud will be brought down by Pounds 4m in the system's first year. 'The difference is that we are analysing the data live,' said Barclays. 'Our existing Fraudwatch computer system spots unusual changes in cardholders' spending patterns once we receive the vouchers from the retailer, but that means we are always a few days behind.' 'Unusual' behaviour includes using the card frequently where it had been used sparsely before, making purchases of televisions and videos more than once within a short period or buying at shops not usually visited by the customer. Barclays says that the information is not used for marketing purposes, but solely to detect fraud. The system will be operable only in the 20 per cent of transactions in which banks are contacted for authorisation. Barclays says it aims to increase the number of authorised transactions to one in four this year and to half the number of transactions by 1996. However, the Consumers' Association, while welcoming the initiative yesterday, said it was concerned that bona fide customers could find themselves in potentially embarrassing situations if they had to give identification details in front of other customers over the telephone. Barclays said yesterday that this was unlikely. 'The last thing we would want is to lose the goodwill of our customers,' it added. Observer, Page 21</p>

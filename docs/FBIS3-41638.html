			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Brussels, Dec 3 (AFP) -- European Community  environment ministers remained deadlocked here Friday [3  December] over how to handle the 50 million tonnes of packaging  waste generated each year in the 12-nation EC.    In an 18-hour meeting that started Thursday [2 December],  Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands refused to accept a  proposal that EC countries should be made to recycle up to an  initial 45 percent of paper, glass and aluminium packaging.    The three countries said the target was too low, and meant  that they would have to relax their own recycling laws and thus  produce more waste.    ``It is absurd to try to impose ceilings which would  increase  the waste produced by some countries,'' German Secretary of  State Clemens Stroetmann said.    He refused to accept a compromise proposal which would allow  some countries to exceed the recycling limits, on the grounds  that they would then have to show they have adequate recycling  capacity.    Germany is currently involved in a row with some of its EC  neighbours because it produces more recyclable waste than it can  process, and exports much of it for treatment, notably to France  and Spain.    The EC's poorer southern members, meanwhile, argued that  they  should be exempted from the recycling norms because they could  not afford the necessary recycling capacity.    EC Environment Commissioner Ioannis Paleokrassas said  failure  to establish recycling norms would result in legal battles  between neighbouring countries.    The European Commission maintains that harmonisation is  necessary because, under EC single market laws, no country is  supposed to impose regulations that impede the free market of  products around the community.    However, the European Court of Justice has said Denmark is  justified in banning imports of aluminium cans because the Danes  do not have sufficient recycling capacity to handle them.    The Belgian chairman of the environment ministers' council,  Magda de Galan, called a special meeting for 13 December in a  bid to find a compromise.    She said that meeting would also debate a controversial  proposal to institute a tax on energy and carbon fuels as a way  of fighting global warming.    The meeting could not agree Friday on a joint ratification  of  the Rio convention on climatic change by the year-end, despite  their commitment to do so at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro  in June 1992.    Germany, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and  Luxembourg have demanded that ratification should go  hand-in-hand with a decision to impose an energy tax. But  Britain has refused to accept such a tax.    Earlier, the ministers agreed to cut the production of  methyl  bromide, a toxic fumigant and pesticide, by 25 percent before 1  January 1998.    And they decided to speed up the phasing out of  hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which is used mainly in refrigeration  and is harmful to the earth's ozone layer. Production will be  cut 35 percent by 2004 and stopped entirely by 2015.</p>

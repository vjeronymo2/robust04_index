Accompanied  by (Wang Houjun), secretary of the Qiqihar City Party Committee,  and Chi Jianfu, mayor of the city, they went to the (Huangan)  Industrial Corporation, the (Heping) machinery plant, and the  (Jianhua) machinery plant, three major armament industrial  plants in Qiqihar, to listen to their detailed reports. They  also went to some workshops to inspect the production situation  and had contact with many cadres, staff, and workers. They also  convened several forums with workers, scientific and  technological personnel, and with managerial personnel to listen  to the opinions and voice of the grass roots and to learn about  the difficulties of armament industrial enterprises.    During the forums, Sun Weiben said: In the process of  changing from a planned economy to a market economy, many new  frictions and contradictions will certainly emerge. And,  problems are extremely conspicuous among the armament industrial  enterprises that were completely based on a planned economy in  the past. Therefore, how to orient the armament industrial  enterprises to the markets is a completely new question, and it  is extremely urgent to enable these enterprises to find their  way out under the guidance of the new [words indistinct].    Wherever Sun Weiben went, he introduced the province's  overall development situation. He said: As an energy resources  and raw materials industrial base, Heilongjiang Province is  [words indistinct] in the armament industry, the light industry,  and the trades of grain, coal, and beer. This requires  Heilongjiang people to further emancipate the mind, face up with  realities, and create conditions for overcoming difficulties  with the concerted efforts form higher to lower levels.    After profoundly learning about the situation, Sun Weiben  said: The problems of armament industrial enterprises must be  resolved immediately. To halt the loss of a policy nature, we  need the state support of a policy nature. The burdens on  armament industrial enterprises are very heavy. The wages to  retired personnel alone have taken more than half of their  maintenance funds. Thus, such enterprises should give full  consideration to the issue of reform and should encourage part  of their employees to do business of other trades.    Sun Weiben highly praised armament industrial enterprises  for  their reform measures of producing the products with high added  value [words indistinct] and for their method of supporting the  armament industry by running civilian industries. Sun Weiben  was also extremely satisfied with the projects of the 641  desert-use cars, the forklifts, and [words indistinct]. He  demanded that plants should improve the grade of their products,  expand the scale of production, and occupy markets as quickly as  possible. With regard to the fund problem, Sun Weiben said:  Every possible means should be made to change from accepting  funds to creating funds and seize the current favorable  opportunity to invigorate armament industrial enterprises.  Principal state leaders have been much concerned with the  province's armament industrial enterprises. General Secretary  Jiang Zemin, Vice Premiers Zhu Rongji and Zou Jiahua, and some  other leaders have called on the province to resolve the  problems of some large armament industrial enterprises in  Qiqihar as quickly as possible.    Sun Weiben called on armament industrial enterprises to  seize  the favorable opportunity, carry forward the voluntary spirit,  increase the dynamics of reform, and explore new ways to  invigorate armament industrial enterprises.</p>

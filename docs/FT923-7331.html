			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Wang In one way, Wang's fall into chapter 11 bankruptcy is testament to the savage competition facing computer manufacturers. In another it highlights the weakness of the 1980s argument that high debt is a useful spur to management. Wang made a strategic error when it fell behind in technological development and was slow to move into 'open' interchangeable systems like those of the IBM personal computer. But with the recession upon it, Wang was trapped between high debts and resulting poor cash flow on the one hand and the need to invest in new products on the other. The cause of failure was the inflexibility of debt, as much as management error.</p>

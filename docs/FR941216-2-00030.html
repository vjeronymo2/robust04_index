They also challenged the nonprofit agency's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ability to continue the ongoing product development efforts that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are critical to providing the customer with a paint that is as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective and safe as possible. They noted that such development  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been facilitated by the competition among paint firms to obtain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future contracts: competition that would no longer exist if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints were added to the Procurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several other points made by more than one commenter related to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential problems associated with the lack of continuing competition if the tree marking paints were added to the Procurement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> List for future provision by only one organization and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preferred supplier(s). The problems cited include the inability of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Government to continue to realize decreasing prices for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints; the absence of backup capability to supply the paints in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the event the nonprofit agency fails to perform; and adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts on the three firms that have invested significant resources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in developing and maintaining the capacity to furnish the paints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters suggested that in light of these concerns, only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a portion of the tree marking paints required by the Government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be added to the Procurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the capability of the nonprofit agency to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tree marking paints in accordance with Governmental requirements, both the central nonprofit agency representing the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency in question and the Government agency which purchases the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints have inspected the nonprofit agency. Both have informed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee that they consider the nonprofit agency capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplying the paints in accordance with Governmental quality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity, and delivery requirements. The customer has also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified that the nonprofit agency's tree marking paints meet its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Qualified Products List requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In regard to the other points, the Committee is satisfied that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to be used by the nonprofit agency in supplying the paints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will avoid the problems raised by the commenters, and has concluded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that splitting the requirement would be inappropriate. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit agency's approach will permit current and past contractors for the paints, as well as other suppliers with expertise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in paint formulation, to compete annually to supply the nonprofit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency with the paints or base concentrates that constitute the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> major part of the end product furnished to the Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The opportunity for continued substantial involvement_on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competitive basis_in supplying the paints should provide ample  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive for profit-making paint contractors to participate in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> future development efforts associated with these particular paints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Committee is also persuaded that the nonprofit agency will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to support ongoing product development efforts because of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> track record in working with paint firms to upgrade and reformulate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other paints being supplied to the Government under the JWOD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Program. In addition, in the unlikely event that none of the three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenting paint firms decides to compete to supply the paint, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonprofit agency has promised to work with another firm (or firms)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to develop a different Qualified Products List tree marking paint.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This will assure that the incentive to continue improving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product to achieve a competitive advantage remains.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Continuing competition among qualified firms to supply the paints  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will also provide the opportunity for further price reductions as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of competition. If such competition produces reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the price of the paints or concentrates, the Committee's fair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market pricing system will pass along those reductions to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to backup capability, the continued involvement of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> three paint firms which commented in supplying materials for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tree marking paints in question, as well as tree marking paint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sales by at least one of those firms to other markets support a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusion that they could assume responsibility for furnishing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product if the nonprofit agency experienced problems. Moreover,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the nonprofit agency has provided information demonstrating backup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capability using one of its other facilities as well as commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aerosol packagers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In considering impact on the three commenting paint firms of adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the tree marking paints to the Procurement List, the Committee  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted that each will retain the opportunity to compete to supply a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial component of the end product. Consequently, any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential impact on those suppliers of placing the tree marking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paints on the Procurement List is significantly less than would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the case if they had no sales prospects associated with the paints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, even in the absence of the opportunity to compete, none of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenting firms will in the Committee's judgment experience  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severe adverse impact as a result of the addition of the paints to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Procurement List.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

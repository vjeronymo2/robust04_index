			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NEXT MUPPETMEISTER?;  </P> <P> WITH JIM HENSON'S DEATH, HIS CREATIVE EMPIRE WAS THROWN INTO DISARRAY; NOW HIS  ELDER SON IS TRYING TO LEAD THE COMPANY BACK  </P> <P> The workshop floor and benches are strewn with turtle masks, body parts and  green latex suits in various stages of preparation. A furry creature's head  sits on a desk, its features contorted into a perpetual snarl. In the corner  two mice, each a foot high, look on unblinkingly, their mouths slightly open in  expressions of wonder.  </P> <P> This is the Creature Shop, one of two creative engine rooms in the late Jim  Henson's puppet empire. Today is a Saturday, but a fair number of employees are  at work -- painting, trimming, fiddling with electronic circuits and bringing  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle puppets to something resembling life.  </P> <P> The mice, Luke and Bruno, are from an earlier exercise in animatronics -- the  art of making remote controlled puppets move and change expressions. They star  in a British-made film "The Witches," adapted from Roald Dahl's best-selling  children's book. Anjelica Huston leads the human faction in the cast.  Distributed by Warner Bros., it opens across the country on Friday.  </P> <P> The brisk work generates a businesslike atmosphere that almost makes one forget  that this is a company only just recovering from a deep shock.  </P> <P> Henson died suddenly of pneumonia in May at age 53. His death came as a  sorrowful blow to his colleagues and to his company.  </P> <P> He had, after all, given the world Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie and the other  Muppets, along with "Sesame Street" and Muppet Babies -- not to mention lesser  achievements like "The Storyteller" and "Fraggle Rock" which others in Jim  Henson's line of work would be proud to call their masterpieces.  </P> <P> Now his elder son Brian surveys from a balcony the work being done on this day  at the Creature Shop. Brian Henson, like the mice in the corner, does not  blink.  </P> <P> "There was a drop in morale when my father died," he says quietly. "A large  percentage of the company was crying about it two weeks later.  </P> <P> "Everyone was in emotional turmoil. But that period also hardened their drive,  and their feelings for what he wanted. Now they're probably more motivated to  keep the dream alive than ever before."  </P> <P> Brian Henson reminds one inevitably of his father. The same shy, lopsided grin  is in evidence, as is a slightly diffident manner and a soft Canadian burr.  Though Brian is clean-shaven, he too has a long face with an aquiline profile,  framed by masses of hair.  </P> <P> He is being spoken of as the keeper of the flame, the man who, at 26, will  carry Jim Henson's vision into the 21st Century. But will it happen?  </P> <P> Brian Henson pauses a long time. "It's too early to say," he says finally. "I'd  been working with my father for eight or nine years -- in production, direction  and here at the shop as performance head.  </P> <P> "I have the same kind of background that he had by this age, but to a lesser  degree. I've developed an interest in performance, in directing and in (puppet)  characters. And I'll also get involved in the company, because . . ." and he  pauses again for a long time, "I have been his apprentice."  </P> <P> Doesn't all that constitute assuming his father's mantle? "To a degree, yes,"  says Henson. "Which is a slightly scary prospect. But it's exciting at the same  time.  </P> <P> "You know, that mantle is not quite as big as people think. People know of my  father's creative work, but what they don't know is the way he chose people to  work with him.  </P> <P> "He wanted the company to run itself so he could still be a performer and a  director. It meant he could be a father figure and not a boss.  </P> <P> "So he chose creative, self-motivated people. He tended to pick people who were  still young, a lot of them under 20, and they'd stick with him. That's how  we're managing to carry on right now, because everyone's so motivated. Here,  we're currently going through our heaviest amount of production ever."  </P> <P> Henson sold many of his Muppet characters and the New York-based Henson  Associates Inc. to Walt Disney Co. last year for an estimated $150-200 million.  But Jim Henson Productions, which runs the Creature Shops here and in New York,  has stayed within the family and functions like an independent production  company, pitching its expertise to would-be collaborators.  </P> <P> The bulk of the London shop's work is being taken up by the sequel to "Teenage  Mutant Ninja Turtles." The huge success of the first movie, also done at the  shop, prompted a decision to mine the same ore quickly, and Creature Shop  craftsmen are working against tight deadlines to ready their creations for the  second movie.  </P> <P> The Henson contingent admit to reservations about the first Turtles film,  feeling it veered uneasily between harmless cartoon-style entertainment for  children and a hard-edged assault on the senses with violent overtones.  </P> <P> "The Witches," says Brian Henson, was a far more challenging and complex task.  Dahl's story is of a boy who uncovers a plot by witches to rid England of small  children by turning them into mice with a specially concocted magic potion.  </P> <P> "Real witches," as Dahl tells it, "dress in ordinary clothes and look very much  like ordinary women . . . that is why they are so hard to catch."  </P> <P> But when the boy hero of the story (played by young Chicago actor Jasen Fisher)  stumbles on a witches' convention at a seaside hotel led by the Grand High  Witch (Huston), he and a boy he befriends are turned into mice before they can  combat their evil plans.  </P> <P> The film is directed by Nicolas Roeg, the maverick Briton whose movies such as  "Bad Timing," "Castaway" and "Track 29" combine a dazzling visual sense, adult  themes and a freewheeling directing style.  </P> <P> A collaboration between Roeg and Jim Henson seemed improbable, to put it  mildly. "One thing everyone knew before hand," says Brian Henson, who was  coordinating puppeteer on "The Witches," working closely with Roeg, "was that  they had no idea what the movie would look like."  </P> <P> Roeg, a father of six, insists he has made a film for children: "It speaks to a  group, the 6 to 12 year olds, who I think have been overlooked," he says.  </P> <P> Still, there are flashes of vintage Roeg brilliance, notably in a highly filmic  sequence (not in Dahl's book) where the two mice are chased by witches under  chairs and tables in the hotel's convention hall, then through air vents below  ground. "One hopes that if it has some kind of truthfulness, all the people  will enjoy it too," concedes Roeg.  </P> <P> Technical problems in make-up and animatronics were immense. Each witch had to  spend an hour each day being transformed from ordinary women. Anjelica Huston,  whose metamorphosis involved latex prostheses including an enormous hooked  nose, chin whiskers and skin so wrinkled it looks scarred, spent two hours  daily being made up.  </P> <P> The Creature Shop had to make electronically controlled mice in three sizes,  said John Stephenson, its creative supervisor. Lifesize mice were created for  long shots; two mice ten or 12 inches high were used in medium shots in which  they had to blink or move their jaws or ears and large hand puppets were  employed for close-ups and emphasizing facial expressions.  </P> <P> The problem was that the script called for a huge amount of mouse movement,"  added Stephenson. "The whole film was difficult."  </P> <P> Though "The Witches" opened in London in May to good business, strong word of  mouth and generally excellent reviews, it has also been marked by controversy.  </P> <P> Roeg's film has infuriated Roald Dahl, who has in general not liked film  adaptations of his work. In the past, he has criticized the movies of "Charlie  and the Chocolate Factory" (released in this country as "Willy Wonka and the  Chocolate Factory") and last year's "Danny, The Champion of the World," which  was shown in the U.S. on the Disney Channel.  </P> <P> As happened with "Danny," the ending of "The Witches" has been changed on film,  and has become more upbeat. Also, the unnamed English boy who narrates the  book's story has been given a name -- Luke -- and has become American.  </P> <P> The film, the 73-year-old Dahl has said, is "utterly appalling." He tried, in  vain, to have his name removed from the credits. He feels that it is aimed at  an audience of adults rather than children, and told an interviewer earlier  this year: "I want it known that I wouldn't allow a child to see it, let alone  encourage one to do so."  </P> <P> (According to a spokeswoman at Puffin Books, Dahl's publishers, he is currently  undergoing hospital tests and was unavailable for further comment.)  </P> <P> Dahl's public comments about the film adaptation of "The Witches" brought an  angry response from its screenwriter, Allan Scott, who in an article written  for the Guardian newspaper called him "curmudgeonly." The film, said Scott,  "is, with the exceptions that apparently offend (Dahl), faithful to the book  and its spirit.  </P> <P> "The effect, impact and nature of a film is utterly different to that of a  novel, and most novelists recognize this difference with good grace or at least  well-remunerated silence."  </P> <P> Scott has written three other films adapted from books and directed by Roeg --  "Castaway," the forthcoming "Cold Heaven" and (with Chris Bryant) the highly  regarded "Don't Look Now."  </P> <P> "All have been faithful to the original material in the sense that they were  serious attempts to recreate in a wholly different medium from which they were  derived," he says.  </P> <P> Scott advised novelists contemplating the sale of a work to the film industry  "to remember that word 'industry' and bid the book goodby.  </P> <P> "If you're not willing to take the risk, refuse the blandishments, the (huge)  sums of money and the fame -- and stick to your own lathe. Even children know  that having your cake and eating it is not a maxim to be tampered with."  </P> <P> Others involved in the film have closed ranks against Dahl's criticisms. "I  like our ending," says Brian Henson. "It helps the film's structure, and it  makes for a more rounded story. Roald Dahl is fabulously talented, but I think  he thinks if anyone else works with his work, it's going to suffer."  </P> <P> Roeg also applauds Dahl's talent, but adds: "This happens when you translate  from one medium to another. (Books) are a medium of total imagination, and  everyone can imagine a character differently. But when you have to show the  Grand High Witch, how can it look like what someone else thinks it should look  like? You have to make that leap."  </P> <P> Clearly, a success in America for "The Witches" would be a strong psychological  boost for the Henson Organization in the wake of its founder's death.  </P> <P> This is why Brian Henson now swivels nervously in his chair on the Creature  Shop balcony, enumerating his worries. Will everything depend on the first  weekend for what is essentially a word-of-mouth movie? Is 16 cities a wide  enough release? Would it have been better to open it last Halloween?  </P> <P> Henson, of course, feels the weight of family expectations on his shoulders.  His four siblings show signs of making the Hensons an all-entertainment  industry family. His eldest sister Lisa is senior vice president of production  at Warner Bros.; Cheryl Henson is a puppeteer and designer, younger brother  John is also a puppeteer and has directed student films, and youngest child  Heather is at Rhode Island School of Design.  </P> <P> "When I say my father was a father figure, it was really true," says Brian. "We  kids would come into the Creature Shops at weekends growing up, and everyone  treated us like they were our aunts and uncles."  </P> <P> John Stephenson is more detached and relaxed about the family firm's future.  "Jim was a subliminal presence, a gentle hand on the tiller," he observes. "He  was quality control -- extremely fussy about what got in front of the camera.  </P> <P> "But we're very busy, there are 10 or 15 projects on the books in the States.  </P> <P> "Jim has left us an awful lot to be going on with."  </P></p>

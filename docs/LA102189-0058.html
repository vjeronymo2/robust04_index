			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAY AREA QUAKE;  </P> <P> STANFORD REPORTS IT HAS $160 MILLION IN DAMAGE  </P> <P> Stanford University on Friday reported at least $160 million in earthquake  damage as college campuses in the Bay Area attempted to find places for  hundreds of students evacuated from unsafe dormitories.  </P> <P> Officials said 26 of the 240 buildings on the Palo Alto campus, including 11  small dormitories that house about 420 students, are closed and access to 36  more is restricted.  </P> <P> Stanford President Donald Kennedy estimated that the school sustained at least  $160 million in structural damage. Damage to contents in the school buildings  is also expected to be heavy.  </P> <P> "Various academic buildings are closed and cannot be safely reoccupied until  structural repairs are made," Kennedy said. "Others will need to be replaced  completely."  </P> <P> At the San Francisco State and San Jose State campuses, the damage from  Tuesday's earthquake was more extensive than first reported, officials said. In  addition, the California State University system's $8-million marine research  laboratory at Moss Landing, north of Monterey, was destroyed.  </P> <P> The two campuses and the lab will require about $45 million in repairs,  according to Cal State spokesman Stephen MacCarthy.  </P> <P> The library at San Francisco State appears to have significant damage, and  inspectors are trying to determine the safety of a 700-bed dormitory and a  parking garage. At San Jose State, the library and a large classroom building,  among other structures, were damaged.  </P> <P> The two campuses originally planned to reopen Monday but that may be delayed,  MacCarthy said.  </P> <P> At UC Santa Cruz, classes will resume Monday. Campus spokeswoman Stephanie Hauk  said only a science building will remain closed for further damage inspection.  However, she said the school sustained a "tremendous amount of content damage  -- books, shelving, chemical spills, water lines." The losses in laboratory  equipment probably total more than $1 million, she said.  </P> <P> Some students whose off-campus residences were badly damaged are being  sheltered on campus in dormitory lounges. "The students are just fine. We have  plenty of water and food for them," she said.  </P> <P> At Stanford, about half the scheduled classes were held Thursday and Friday,  and the university is planning to return to a full teaching load as alternative  classroom sites are found, spokeswoman Kathy O'Toole said.  </P> <P> Among the Stanford buildings heavily damaged and closed are the landmark  Memorial Church and Leland Stanford Jr. Museum, both 100 years old and  survivors of the great quake of 1906.  </P> <P> "They are original campus buildings," said spokeswoman Eileen Walsh. "The  church is the centerpiece of the campus. The steeple was knocked off in the  1906 quake, but it was rebuilt."  </P> <P> Although the chapel's expensive stained-glass windows -- which were being  restored -- escaped damage, chunks of mosaic tile crashed from walls and the  ceiling, splintering pews below.  </P> <P> Stanford has been self-insured against earthquakes since 1985, when the  school's insurance carriers canceled its policy, according to Robert Beth,  director of risk management. Since then the school has accrued only $3.4  million in its earthquake reserve and $3.6 million in a property reserve to  respond to such events as fires or floods, Beth said.  </P> <P> Two years ago, insurance companies offered to provide the university with  earthquake coverage for $5 million a year and later reduced that figure to $3  million. But because of a $100-million deductible and a $125-million maximum  payment above that figure, the university declined the coverage.  </P> <P> University Provost James Rosse said the school may seek loans or federal funds  or use part of its endowment, estimated at $2 billion, to make repairs.  </P> <P> "We never used our borrowing capacity up to the limit because we knew there was  a high probability that we would have to rebuild dorms, laboratories and  classrooms after an earthquake," he said.  </P></p>

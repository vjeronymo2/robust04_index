			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Company News: Handelsbanken on road to recovery SVENSKA Handelsbanken yesterday showed strong evidence that it was on the road to recovery when it announced a preliminary first-quarter profit of more than SKr350m (Dollars 47.3m). There were indications that Gota Bank, another Swedish bank, is past the worst, although it reported a SKr1.4bn loss before state guarantees for the period. Handelsbanken said its result before credit losses rose 30 per cent to SKr2.2bn, while credit losses fell 10 per cent to SKr1.8bn. It did not provide comparative figures because it now reports on a quarterly basis, rather than every four months. Further details will be provided when the bank's interim report is published on May 11. The figures confirmed the optimistic forecast which the bank gave in February and suggested that, unlike its rivals, it will not need state support to weather Sweden's banking crisis. Its A free shares rose SKr5.5 to SKr89 yesterday, more than five times their SKr17 level last November. Last year, the bank posted a SKr840m operating loss and suspended the dividend on its ordinary shares after lending losses rose 150 per cent to SKr8bn. Gota Bank said its operating loss fell to SKr215m in the latest quarter from SKr425m in the same 1992 period. Although the latest figure took into account SKr1.17bn in state guarantees and SKr26m in financial insurance, it was better than the SKr2.91bn loss in the first quarter of 1992. The bank was taken over by the state last December, and in January received a SKr10bn guarantee to ensure it continued to meet international capital adequacy requirements. Gota said credit losses in the first three months shrank to SKr1.22bn from SKr3.13bn in the same 1992 period. It also predicted that credit losses for the whole year would amount to SKr4.9bn, which is substantially lower than last year's SKr12.5bn. However, the volume of non-performing loans, before provisions, amounted to SKr24.68bn at the end of March, which is SKr2.25bn higher than the year-end total. Operating revenue fell in the quarter to SKr707m from SKr1.19bn. The bank's capital ratio at the end of March had fallen to 8.1 per cent, just clearing the 8 per cent minimum level, although SKr2.75bn of the state guarantee remained unutilised. Mr Anders Klien, banking analyst at Enskilda Securities in Stockholm, said: 'Handelsbanken is a special case and it will make a profit this year. The banking sector as a whole will still make a loss although its position will improve from last year.'</p>

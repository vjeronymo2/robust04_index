			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Muhammad 'Abdallah al-Batani, minister of  social security and social affairs, met with UN Secretary  General Butrus-Ghali in Geneva yesterday. He conveyed to him  the greetings and gratitude of brother Lieutenant General 'Ali  'Abdallah Salih, chairman of the Presidential Council. He  explained in detail the situation in our country, particularly  after the war criminal, traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid, has  fomented sedition among the sons of the Armed Forces in order to  attain his treacherous conspiratorial aims. The brother  minister told the UN secretary general that the secessionist  gang does not represent the south or the Socialist Party, but  only itself, and that it broke away from legitimacy and national  unity. He said broad popular sectors as well as all leaders,  members, and cadres of parties and sons of the Yemeni people do  not agree with the secessionist clique's explosion of the  situation or its treacherous secession announcement. He told  him that unity took place peacefully and was blessed by the  people and recognized by the Arabs and the world. He added that  elections took place and a referendum on the constitution was  held and that the claim that the unity was imposed by force is  baseless. On the contrary, he said, there are attempts to  impose secession by force by this deluded secessionist gang. He  indicated that those who demand peace do not want or desire  peace or even the existence of a strong and sound Yemen.    The UN secretary general expressed his desire to convey his  greetings to the brother chairman of the Presidential Council.  He said neither he nor the Security Council is biased toward  any party, but there is right and wrong and there is no  neutrality between the two.    Yahya Jaghman, our ambassador in Geneva, attended the  meeting.</p>

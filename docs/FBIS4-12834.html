			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "New Step To Improve Relations </F> Between Tel Aviv and Ankara"]    [Text] Shim'on Peres, foreign minister of the Zionist  regime, has arrived in Ankara on a three-day official visit.  Tel Aviv and Ankara officials will hold talks on the most  important regional and international issues and the expansion  and strengthening of relations between the Zionist regime and  Turkey during his visit.    The high-ranking mutual visits between Ankara and Tel Aviv  have significantly promoted their bilateral political relations.  They have also promoted their relations on issues relating to  trade, defense, and security. Turkey and the Zionist regime  have reached agreements on free trade, improving bilateral trade  relations, cooperation in the defense industry, improving  relations in tourism, and supplying water from the Manavgat  River to occupied Palestine. The main objective of Peres' visit  to Ankara can be described as reaching a final agreement on the  two countries' plan to supply water to Israel from the Manavgat  River, which is on Turkey's Mediterranean coastline.    One of the main reasons why Tel Aviv wants to improve its  relations with Ankara is the Zionist regime's need for the water  of the Euphrates, Tigris, and Manavgat Rivers in Turkey.  According to the Zionist regime's leading officials, Tel Aviv  can solve the water problem, which stops many Jews resettling in  the occupied land, that is, if that regime can have itself  accepted as a country that shares the region's water resources  with Ankara's support. The Zionist regime's officials are  convinced that Turkey, as a NATO country and a close U.S. ally  in the region, can make a significant contribution to the effort  to step up the pace of the talks on the so-called Middle East  peace plan. That will help the Zionist regime, which still  occupies Jerusalem, to remain and increase its strength in the  region.    That Islamic movements in Turkey and the region are  gradually  gaining strength must not be overlooked. Obviously, it has made  Turkey and Israel uneasy. The recent victory achieved by the  Prosperity Party in the local elections in Turkey is a clear  sign of the strength the Islamic movement has gained in that  country. The issue of Islamic movements has always been a  priority in the talks held between Turkey and Israel.  Undoubtedly, the issue will have priority in the talks that  Shim'on Peres will have in Ankara.    Considering all that, Peres' visit to Turkey can be  described  as a new step to promote bilateral relations and draw the  policies of the two sides closer. The objection of the Islamic  people in Turkey, which is an Islamic country, to the  improvement of Ankara's relations with the Zionist regime has  worried the two sides. Both have identified the psychological  obstacle. But officials of the two countries continue to  promote their relations as much as possible. Political  observers in the region have assessed the demonstrations held by  thousands of Islamic people in Turkey against the United States  and the Zionist regime on the eve of Peres' visit to Ankara as a  warning against Tel Aviv's expansionist and hegemonist policies  in the region.</p>

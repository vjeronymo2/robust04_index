			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Bucking the Trend: A magnificent deal with the greatest of ease - In spite of the widespread gloom in industry, a surprising number of companies are thriving against the odds. This is the first in a series on companies - often small and relatively unknown - which are scoring successes in the recession A TINY North Yorkshire company is tooling up to supply aircraft to the US Air Force against a background of the worst recession to hit the UK's aerospace and defence industries since the Second World War. Slingsby has just landed the most important contract in its 60-year history and its production of small propeller-driven military training aircraft will double. The company is based in a cluster of sheds which looks more like a farm than a factory, just outside Kirkbymoorside on the edge of the north Yorkshire moors. The US Air Force has chosen Slingsby's T-67 Firefly aircraft as its new basic trainer for pilots. Slingsby won an order from the US Air Force for up to 113 Firefly trainers worth about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.1m) after a fierce international competition. To win the order the small Yorkshire company, with annual sales of about Pounds 7m, teamed up with Northrop, one of the giants of the US defence industry. Mr John Dignan, Slingsby's marketing director, said: 'This is really a case of the mouse that roared.' The company will soon start shipping the aircraft kits to the US for assembly by Northrop at Hondo in Texas. The order came at an excellent time for Slingsby. Mr Michael Jones, a group executive of ML Holdings, the engineering group which acquired Slingsby eight years ago, said: 'Like everybody else we have had to cut back this year because of the recession and the lack of work in the aerospace business.' However, Mr Jones said that after reducing its workforce from 202 to 140 people this year, the company's payroll was now expected to rise to 230. Mr David Holt, Slingsby's managing director, said: 'Our production will more than double from about four aircraft a month to nine a month. We've had to gut our factory space and refurbish it to prepare for this big jump in production.' The company was founded in the early 1930s by a carpenter from Scarborough, Mr Fred Slingsby, and originally made gliders and sailplanes. Slingsby is still known locally as 'the glider company', but has evolved in the last 20 years under a series of owners, including Vickers and British Underwater Engineering. It is now a high-technology designer and manufacturer of composite products and components for the aerospace and marine industries. The company supplies parts to some of the world's biggest aerospace manufacturers including Boeing, Airbus and British Aerospace. It also designs and makes parts for airships and underwater equipment and robots for the offshore oil industry. Mr Dignan said: 'It has taken us 10 years to establish the aircraft in the market and we expect we will now win many new orders on the back of the US Air Force deal.' The first 10 Slingsby two-seater aircraft were built of wood on a licence from Fournier, a French light-aircraft manufacturer. In 1983 the North Yorkshire company applied its expertise in composite materials to develop an all-composite version of the aircraft. Since then, excluding the new US contract, the company has sold 104 trainers to 10 countries, including Switzerland, Turkey, Canada, Hong Kong, the Netherlands and Norway. It claims the Firefly is now in a good position to be chosen as the new primary trainer for the Royal Air Force, which is due to decide on an order for 20 aircraft next month. One of the aircraft's selling points is that it can perform, on a small scale, many of the tasks of a sophisticated fighter aircraft. Mr Norrie Grove, Slingsby's chief test pilot and a Spitfire veteran, said: 'This aeroplane is designed to train a pilot at the most important stage of his early career, when he is learning the basic skills.' It is expected that in the next five years 25 countries will replace their primary military trainers, involving about 520 aircraft worth Dollars 300m to Dollars 500m over the next 10 years. Mr Dignan said: 'There are six manufacturers competing for this business and there is not room for everyone.' Slingsby has some advantages. Its labour costs are relatively low and the company is one of the rare manufacturers in an area of small market towns, enabling it to keep a stable local base of skilled labour. In its own tiny way, Slingsby has become the Boeing of Kirkbymoorside.</p>

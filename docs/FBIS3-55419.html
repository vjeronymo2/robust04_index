Dmytro Pavlychko, chairman of the parliamentary Commission  on  International Affairs, said such pressure, which came from  Russia and the United States, could only give a better chance to  radicals at the March 1994 parliamentary election.    "If we're talked to from a position of strength, the only  result will be that we'll want to defend ourselves," he told  reporters in Kiev. Ukraine is a sovereign state, "and we won't  go on our knees before anyone, not even before the president of  America," he said, commenting on a statement by a White House  spokesman, who said on January 5 that U.S.-Ukrainian relations  would remain at their present low level until Ukraine met all  its nuclear disarmament commitments.    Pavlychko said the United States was mainly interested in  Russia, with which Ukraine would, however, find "common  language." "We have lived together and will continue to live  together," he said.</p>

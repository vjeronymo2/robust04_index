			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Observer: Bill ahoy Will President Clinton be travelling on the royal yacht Britannia alongside Queen Elizabeth II en route to France to join in the commemorations for the D-Day landings in 1944 next June? The answer is - yes and no. Says the US embassy in London: 'I can't react to that. The president's schedule is not yet set in concrete.' All right then, has it at least been mooted that Clinton will be on the yacht? 'Don't know.' Buckingham Palace is equally tight-lipped, referring all queries to the Ministry of Defence on the grounds that it's handling all D-Day media. And the MoD won't discuss the movements of VIPs 'for security reasons'. Never mind. Observer can reveal that while Clinton will be on the royal yacht to review what's left of the British fleet in Portsmouth, he then departs for France on his own nuclear aircraft carrier, the USS George Washington. 'You know the Americans - never like to arrive on anyone else's boat,' says our informant.</p>

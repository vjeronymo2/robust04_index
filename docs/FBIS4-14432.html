			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Filippovich Shumeyko, Russian </F> minister of press and mass information, by unidentified  SVOBODNAYA ZONA reporter; place and date not given: "Vladimir  Shumeyko: `The Treaty With Kaliningrad Oblast Will Be Signed'"]    [Text] [Reporter] Vladimir Filippovich, much is currently  being said about the following subject: After the treaty on the  division of power between Tatarstan and the federal organs is  concluded, a similar treaty will be signed with Kaliningrad  Oblast. Who is the initiator of this project?    [Shumeyko] The initiative to conclude the treaty between the  Kaliningrad Oblast administration and the federal government  belongs to the Security Council. I would like to emphasize that  the Potsdam Agreement has no time limit. However, some  politicians use its 50th anniversary to raise the issue of  Kaliningrad's status, claiming that the term of this agreement  expires because the USSR and Stalin no longer exist.  Furthermore, they state that Russia is not the legal heir to  the Soviet Union, and Kaliningrad Oblast could become a German  protectorate or a separate state. At the same time, some  propose setting up a demilitarized zone on the territory of  Kaliningrad Oblast because the presence of troops allegedly  blocks economic development, and so on.    Therefore, the Security Council decided to sign this  agreement.    [Reporter] What provisions will the agreement include? Will  relations be altered?    [Shumeyko] The power and rights to be relegated by the  federal government to the local authorities correspond to the  equivalent volume of power and rights to be handed over by local  authorities to the federal government. Thus, the Security  Council came to the conclusion that currently it is expedient to  relegate as much power as possible to the local administration  to enable it to react operatively and timely to any  developments. Instant and adequate reaction by the local  authorities to every development in this area is of key  importance for Russia.    Hence, we will thoroughly prepare this agreement. We will  properly decide what functions should be relegated and which of  them should remain under the jurisdiction of the Federal  Government.</p>

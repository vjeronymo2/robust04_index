			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: The options MPs will vote twice at the end of the debate. First on the Labour amendment Then on the government motion. If the amendment were carried, the government motion would be dead and MPs would effectively be asked to vote again on the Labour amendment. This calls for the return of the Maastricht bill to be delayed till after December's European summit in Edinburgh. A Yes vote on the Labour amendment by 324 MPs or fewer, depending on the number of abstentions, would carry it. Tory rebels have a number of tactical voting possibilities. They might opt collectively to support the Labour amendment in the first vote. If the amendment were then carried, they could logically support the amended government motion in the second. If the the Labour amendment falls, with or without their support, then hard-line rebels would probably vote against the original government motion, which gives a green light for the Maastricht bill. That represents the rebels' best chance to stymie the process. Soft Tory rebels would probably abstain. The situation is further complicated since a few Tory MPs have made clear that they will not back the Labour amendment even if they subsequently oppose the government motion. Some or all Ulster Unionists might act the same way. This suggests Labour's amendment could fall by a misleadingly wide margin.</p>

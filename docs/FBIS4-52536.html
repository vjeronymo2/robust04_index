			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 11 (YONHAP) -- The Taiwanese Government  decided Wednesday to lift restrictions on fruit imports, paving  the way for South Korea to resume exports of apples and pears to  Taiwan as soon as late this year, the Korea Trade Promotion  Corp. (Kotra) said.    South Korea had exported about 30 million dollars worth of  apples and pears to Taiwan while importing the same amount in  bananas from that nation until August 1992, when the two  countries severed diplomatic ties.    The decision to open its market to apples, pears, grapes and  peaches is part of Taiwan's efforts to preclude possible  problems in joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT), which champions free trade. Kotra said Taiwan must join  GATT this year if it wants to become a member of the World Trade  Organization (WTO), which replaces GATT next year.    The Taiwanese Government will allocate a 20,000-ton import  quota for apples this year to those countries which have been  previously excluded from the quota system, according to Kotra.  Only the United States and Canada had been allowed to export  apples to Taiwan.    Taiwan plans to expand the quota to 30,000 tons next year  and  to 50,000 tons in 1999 before allowing a free flow of apples  into the country in 2000, Kotra said.    The Taiwanese Government will also allocate a 2,000-ton  import quota for pears to Asian countries in 1995 and expand the  quota to 4,000 tons by 2000, Kotra said.    Seoul and Taipei have been negotiating the resumption of  apple and pear exports to Taiwan since January, when the  Taiwanese established a liaison office in the South Korean  capital.</p>

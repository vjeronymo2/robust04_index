			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UC IRVINE PLAN, INCLUDING RESEARCH PARK, IS UNVEILED  </P> <P> UC Irvine officials Wednesday unveiled a 15-year blueprint for growth that  includes development of a long-awaited research park and an urban community  with retail and housing development that would still preserve nearly a third of  the campus' 1,510 acres for woodlands and recreation.  </P> <P> The research park, which is expected to be a magnet for biomedical firms and  other high-technology companies that would work cooperatively with the public  university, is the most innovative and potentially controversial element of the  plan for the 25-year-old school.  </P> <P> Chancellor Jack W. Peltason has referred to the planned research park as the  path of the future for research-oriented universities such as UC Irvine.  Located in the heart of Orange County's growing high-tech corridor, some have  predicted the university park could spur development on the scale of Stanford's  Silicon Valley or the Research Triangle near Duke University in North Carolina.  </P> <P> UCI's Long Range Development Plan, which will be the subject of public hearings  in Irvine and Newport Beach and will be presented to University of California  Regents in September, scales back more aggressive growth plans of 1963 and  1970, when it was anticipated that students eventually would number nearly  30,000, instead of the 14,500 now. Projections now are for 26,500 graduate and  undergraduate students at UCI by 2005.  </P> <P> Because Orange County and the surrounding communities of Irvine and Newport  Beach would have anticipated greater university expansion based on the previous  plans, no significant community opposition is expected, said Ray Catalano,  assistant executive vice chancellor.  </P> <P> "No plan has no enemies," Catalano said. "But we believe our neighbors will be  pleased with this plan."  </P> <P> Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said he sees great potential for community benefit  from UC Irvine's projected growth and the planned research park.  </P> <P> "I assume it is going to be an extraordinarily sophisticated level of research,  and we all understand that there is a synergism created by research at the  university on the one hand, and its application in the private sector," Agran  said. "It can be a real benefit to the community and I'm hopeful that the plan  meets our concerns with regard to traffic generation and other environmental  effects."  </P> <P> The new development plan, in the works since 1985, was completed after pacts  were reached last summer with the city of Irvine to limit university-generated  traffic, and the Irvine Co. to remove a 25-year-old deed restriction that would  allow construction of 2 million square feet of commercial buildings on UC  Irvine land.  </P> <P> At the heart of the plan is something university officials and community  officials have only dreamed about until now: a full-fledged biomedical and  high-tech research park.  </P> <P> Two parcels totaling 235 acres have been set aside for private research  buildings, to be built by research firms and then leased back to them. Based on  the model of UC Irvine's first such venture, the Nelson Research &amp;  Development Co. center built in 1983, the park would offer lease income, space  and materials for research by students and professors and an enhanced potential  to win multimillion-dollar research grants.  </P> <P> Catalano said Wednesday that high-tech and medical research firms already  located in Orange County will do more to drive a Silicon Valley here than UC  Irvine's relatively small research parcels. Still, the campus is likely to be a  magnet for biomedical research firms that want to tap into university  brainpower, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Labour turns on the charm FT-SE Index: 2,470.7 (-5.3) There is an aura of the counterfeit about Mr John Smith's budget red book. It is the same colour and shape as the official Treasury one. It has the same PSBR for 1992-3 and the same commitment to the present central rate in the ERM. As with most counterfeits, however, what you see is not quite what you get. Labour's PSBR assumes the full benefit of the Pounds 8bn of privatisation receipts that the Tories have pencilled in for 1992-3. It is difficult to track down more than Pounds 6bn of receipts that are already in the bag. So, Mr Smith already looks in danger of missing the target before he has even started. He is also strangely silent about the cost of the increased capital allowance, which is conveniently deferred to 1993-4. Even yesterday's programme thus appears to point to further slippage in government finances. That might matter less if the Labour budget contained some clever ruse for boosting growth. The increased capital allowance is unlikely to produce much additional investment when many companies are paying no corporation tax anyway, but it will have a large deadweight cost. The transfer of spending power to the lower paid might provide a boost at the margin, not least by slowing the rate of repossessions which have been concentrated at the lower end of the housing market. The point, however, is as moot as the attempt to redistribute spending power must appear draconian to affluent voters in marginal seats. Perhaps that is why the markets were not particularly bothered.</p>

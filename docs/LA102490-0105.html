			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MILKEN LIED ABOUT DEAL, FORMER CHIEF OF DREXEL IMPLIES  </P> <P> Frederick H. Joseph, Drexel Burnham Lambert's former chief executive,  confronted Michael Milken in court Tuesday for the first time and implied that  Drexel's longtime star employee had lied to him.  </P> <P> Joseph also seemed to damage Milken's case in pre-sentencing hearings by  stating that Milken had violated written company rules on ethics. The Drexel  executive said Milken had done so by giving managers of mutual funds and some  company executives improper personal investment opportunities in a deal  involving highly valuable Storer Communications warrants.  </P> <P> "We had a policy that you could not give favored treatment to employees of  institutional investors accounts" at Drexel, Joseph said. Referring to  distribution of Storer warrants, he said: "I think it violated that rule."  </P> <P> Joseph currently is vice chairman of Drexel, now in bankruptcy proceedings. The  firm collapsed less than a year after Joseph, based at the firm's New York  headquarters, had it plead guilty to six felony counts, all relating to Milken  transactions. At the time of Drexel's plea, Milken supporters considered  Joseph's decision a major betrayal.  </P> <P> But now Milken himself has pleaded guilty to six counts. The hearings are being  held to determine if there is evidence that Milken committed other crimes  besides the six. U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood said she will consider the  evidence in deciding Milken's sentence. He faces up to 28 years in prison.  </P> <P> The court appearance was the first time in about a year that Joseph and Milken  had met face to face, a source said. It proved to be a less-than-epic  confrontation, however: Milken betrayed no emotion in response to Joseph's  testimony. And Joseph didn't heap blame on Milken for the firm's fate. He  simply answered the relatively narrow factual questions that were put to him.  </P> <P> The testimony centered on the distribution of the Storer warrants that were  generated as part of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.'s leveraged buyout of  Storer in 1985. Drexel handled the financing. Prosecutors argue that Milken  secretly arranged for 80% of the warrants to go into a private employee  partnership that he controlled. They also charge that Milken used the warrants  to personally bribe investment fund managers and others into having their funds  or companies buy risky Storer preferred stock that did not pay cash dividends.  </P> <P> Joseph implied that Milken had lied to him about the use of the warrants.  Joseph said that in the spring of 1988, a senior official of the Keystone group  of mutual funds expressed concern to him that Drexel might be involved in  unethical activity by allowing employees of investment funds to invest  personally in lucrative private partnerships established for Milken and other  executives of Drexel's high-yield bond department. Joseph said he then called  Milken and asked if this were true.  </P> <P> "I asked him if any fund managers were in any of (the Drexel employee)  partnerships," Joseph said. "He said to the best of his recollection 'No.' "  </P> <P> Joseph said he later learned that this wasn't true. He said Craig Cogut, a  lawyer who worked for the Beverly Hills-based junk bond department, came to him  a short time later. He said Cogut told him there was a Milken-controlled  partnership "that the firm was unaware of and that the investors included some  fund managers for their own account in situations where the funds they had  managed had purchased (Storer) preferred."  </P> <P> In a separate development, the judge seemed to hint that she would like to see  Milken himself testify. She indicated that she hadn't decided yet whether she  will hold it against him if he doesn't. Defense lawyer Arthur L. Liman said he  was concerned that whatever Milken says might be used against him in criminal  proceedings filed by state authorities. He said Milken probably won't testify  unless he gets blanket immunity. Milken already has immunity from federal  prosecution.  </P> <P> One other witness testified Tuesday, providing the first testimony directly  linking Milken to offering the warrants as personal investments to favored  corporate executives. Richard Grassgreen, who this week agreed to plead guilty  to two felony counts, said Milken had called to offer him some of the warrants.  </P> <P> Grassgreen is former chairman of Enstar Group Inc. and its predecessor,  Kinder-Care. He said, however, that Milken offered him the warrants well after  Kinder-Care had committed to buying the preferred and that there was no  connection to that investment decision. He said neither Milken nor any other  Drexel employee ever tried to use the Storer warrants improperly to pressure  him.  </P> <P> "All of the investments that were made during the time I managed the  (Kinder-Care investment) portfolio were made on the merits and were very  profitable," Grassgreen said.  </P></p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Bonds: Signs of revival in floating-rate note market THE flow of floating-rate notes picked up momentum yesterday, with three offerings by financial institutions based in the US, France, and Japan. A large offering of notes for BankAmerica Corporation, the US bank holding company, provided further signs of a revival of the floating-rate note market. Unlike the recent spate of subordinated floating-rate notes with minimum and maximum coupon levels, aimed at pockets of Swiss retail investors, the latest offers are aimed at a broader market. BankAmerica's Dollars 500m offering of senior notes paying interest of 3/8 point above the London interbank offered rates was targeted at mainstream floating-rate investors, including fund managers, banks and some retail investors, according to lead manager Kidder Peabody. Interest in the FRN market among bank issuers has been boosted by poor swap market conditions: some banks can now achieve cheaper floating-rate funding by tapping the floating-rate sector, than by raising fixed-rate funds and swapping the proceeds. But the depth of investor demand for conventional floating-rate notes has yet to be tested. The FRN market also continues to provide access to capital through the issuance of subordinated debt. Sumitomo Bank yesterday launched two subordinated FRNs, totalling Dollars 500m. The two callable deals, maturing in 2006 and 2007, count as Tier 2 capital under Basle guidelines. The paper was placed in the Far East and is not expected to be actively traded. Meanwhile, Credit Foncier, the French agency, also raised lower Tier 2 capital in the FRN market, using the 'minimax' structure. The Dollars 150m issue pays interest at  1/8 point below Libor, with a minimum interest rate of 5 per cent and a maximum rate of 10 per cent. The deal was arranged by Paribas.</p>

			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: MR. BOFFO: UNCLEAR ON THE CONCEPT BY JOE MARTIN LITTLE,  BROWN: $6.95  </P> <P> Although the drawings are little more than doodles, Martin has developed "Mr.  Boffo" into a highly entertaining comic strip. His befuddled characters remain  stranded in a slightly skewed reality; they'd like to join the normal world,  but they can't seem to get the moves right. Glancing at the desiccated remains  in a bird cage, Mr. Boffo explains: "At first we called him 'Chirpy' . . . then  it was 'Wheezy' . . . then 'Sleepy' . . . then 'Smelly' . . . and now for the  longest time it's been 'Bones.' " Martin's favorite description of his  characters, "People unclear on the concept," is rapidly becoming a popular  catch phrase.  </P></p>

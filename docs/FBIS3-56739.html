Yeltsin Proved  To Have Not Been Ready for Gaydar's, Fedorov's Resignations,  Although Both Could Have Easily Been Predicted"]    [Text] Now that Boris Fedorov has left the Russian Cabinet  of Ministers, the only ideological figure still in the  government is Anatoliy Chubays. His fate is unlikely to be  subject to change before check privatization is completed next  summer.    Both Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov managed to leave the  government nearly gracefully. This should not be misunderstood,  though: Yegor Gaydar made a wrong move last September, and  Boris Fedorov, an ideologist of pragmatism in economic policy  turned "stubborn" monetarist, proved unable to tackle inflation.  Moreover, the excessive strengthening of the ruble, which has  undermined the domestic industry's export capacities, does him  no credit either. This factor could be an example for the former  minister's address in an American university on the occasion of  the complete and final defeat of inflation in Russia, but at  this stage it makes almost no sense at all.    Boris Fedorov's political clout, which was heavily  undermined  in the provinces (by delayed wages and nonpayments for  production delivered under state orders), will apparently be  boosted by the significant fall of the ruble's exchange rate.  This fall, however, should not be perceived as a clear sign of  Russia's "Ukrainization." Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out  that after Gaydar's resignation was accepted, the Finance  Ministry was interested in having the ruble follow the reformer.    Unfortunately, according to the pendulum theory, the  government is indeed doomed to a certain increase in  expenditures once a less prominent bureaucrat takes Fedorov's  place.    What is curious is that Boris Fedorov, like Yegor Gaydar,  did  not have an actual reason for resigning, so he presented an  ultimatum that could not be fulfilled and even went from a  relatively strong faction, "Russia's Choice" (whose  representative could expect to become a government member  following Gaydar's departure at least as a compensation), to a  relatively weak one, as if he were deliberately trying to make  sure that his terms would not be taken seriously.</p>

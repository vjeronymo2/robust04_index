			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Weekend Money (Companies): New issues The flotation of BSkyB, the year's biggest issue, was described by the satellite broadcaster as 'heavily oversubscribed' when details of the pricing were unveiled this week, writes Christopher Price. The price was set at 256p, valuing the group at Pounds 4.4bn, which was towards the upper end of the range implied by the company at the time of the pathfinder prospectus. On Thursday, the first day of conditional trading, prior to the shares being officially listed on December 14, the stock went to a 5 per cent premium with some 45m shares changing hands in just two hours. The group will receive approximately Pounds 824m from the global offer. BSkyB said that there was strong demand for the shares in each of the three tranches of the offer, with market talk of it being five times oversubscribed. Over 36m shares have been allocated to successful applicants of the UK retail offer. As the offer was an open one, those investors who said they did not want to participate over 250p have not been allocated shares. The success of the float will provide a boost to the rating attached to multi-media stocks, which have been the subject of heated debate among industry analysts and institutional investors, particularly in flotations and acquisitions. The range of valuations on BSkyB, for example, ranged from Pounds 2.6bn to Pounds 4.6bn. Elsewhere, this week, Hill Hire, a commercial vehicle rental group, and Datrontech, a supplier of computer components, both postponed flotation plans, blaming adverse market conditions. Hill Hire's delay was caused by prolonged negotiations between Birkby, which owns 60 per cent of the group, and institutional investors. The company hopes its shares will begin trading on December 29. Datrontech said it believed its share placing would take place in the first half of 1995. It was expected to value the company at Pounds 50m and raise about Pounds 5m. Shares in Rap Group, a distributor of rubber and plastics, went to a 3p premium to its flotation price of 142p, when dealing began on Thursday. The market capitalisation at the placing price was Pounds 15.1m, with Pounds 3.55m being raised.</p>

The  Joint Budget Committee has released a note of "clarification to  the nation" in which it denounces the government as the branch  "exclusively" responsible for the lack of a budget law, directly  harming the health, education, transport, and agriculture  sectors.    The note is signed by the representatives of eight parties,  in addition to the committee's president and rapporteur, Senator  Raimundo Lira (PFL-PB) [Liberal Front Party-Paraiba State] and  Deputy Marcelo Barbieri (PMDB-SP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party-Sao Paulo State]. Of the country's main parties, only the  representatives of the PFL and PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy  Party] did not sign the note of criticism. According to one  congressman, the note was due to the "hasty attitude" of the  rapporteur.    Barbieri stated that the motive behind the note was the  "overall lack of satisfaction" on the part of the public  administration with the "penury" of the resources that are  released by the Treasury. "There are several sectors that are  functioning precariously, and they visit Congress to complain  about the lack of funds. The note is to make it clear to the  government that it has not submitted its proposals for study and  voting," Barbieri said. According to the deputy, the government  is "clearly not interested" in approving the budget. "It is  very easy for the government to constrict resources, but in the  end it will be even more expensive with an increase in epidemics  and the closing of hospitals," he said.    In Rio de Janeiro, where he spent the day visiting the BNDES  [National Bank for Economic and Social Development], Planning  Minister Beni Veras dictated to his adviser an answer for the  committee. He guarantees that the vital sectors will have their  resources guaranteed through Provisional Measure No. 441, which  grants one-twelfth per month of the funds for the sectors  pertaining to personnel, social charges, pension benefits,  educational books, scholarships, and the payment of the public  debt. He also states that the payments to hospitals that have  an agreement with Inamps [National Institute for Social Security  Medical Assistance] was attended to through opening an  extraordinary 232 billion cruzeiro line of credit, in accordance  with Provisional Measure No. 447 that was signed on 12 March by  Deputy Inocencio de Oliveira, when he was acting president.    The authors of the Joint Committee's note obtained on 17  March the signatures of the leaders of the main political  parties, with the exception of the PSDB, for urgent voting on  Provisional Measure No. 441.    Deputy Joao Paulo (PT-MG) [Workers Party-Minas Gerais State]  believes that the government acts in an "illegal and  disrespectful" way in order to "belittle" Congress. "The  provisional measure has an article that allows for the  readjustment of the first budget project up to a month before  the resources are released. With this article in hand, a budget  is not needed," he said.</p>

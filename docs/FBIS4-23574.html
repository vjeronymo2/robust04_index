			<p>BFN     [Text] Huambo residents are still victims of the excessive  ambition of the leading class of the Popular Movement for the  Liberation of Angola-Labor Party, which orders the bombing of  the city everyday. On 8 June at least 12 napalm and incendiary  bombs were dropped on Huambo, killing 16 people and wounding 35,  including women, children, and old people. A communique issued  by the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola General Staff,  signed by General Arlindo Chenda Pena Ben-Ben, during the 8 June  air raid, reports that 23 people were burned. The killings were  executed by Su aircraft coming from the Catumbela Air Base.</p>

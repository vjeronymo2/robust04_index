			<p>CSO     [Text] The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT)  has begun to provide assistance to private firms in winning bids  for information infrastructure construction projects in Asia.  The government has established a "Liaison Council for  Coordinating Construction of Information Infrastructure Relative  to Asian Regional Development," chaired by MPT International  Department director Yoshio Uchimi and comprised of 11 companies  such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and NEC and three  academics. The council will participate in the joint preparation  of development plans with target nations and promote  participation in various projects. The initially targeted area  will be China and the Shanghai region and on-site surveys will  start in the first part of June. It aims at recovering ground  lost in the area of infrastructure construction to European and  U.S. firms because of a late start.    The liaison council will also see the participation of  Fujitsu, Taisei Construction, Mitsui and Company, and the Sakura  Research Center. Other members will include three academics such  as Hitotsubashi University professor Takayuki Itami and  government-affiliated agencies such as the Japan Export-Import  Bank. If the projects go smoothly and other organizations desire  to join the council, additional memberships will be approved.    In practice, a joint research forum will be established with  the target nation under the auspices of the MPT for the purpose  of conducting integrated studies on the need for communication  services, status of policies and actual construction work and  overall regional effect of projects. Upon completion of such  studies, the Japanese representatives will propose a  communication infrastructure construction project which  encompasses factors such as installation of public telephones,  cellular communications and satellite communications which are  compatible with local conditions. In so doing, MPT intends to  implement government aid as well as to assist in the winning of  bids for pending projects.    The reason why China was selected as the first target area  was that when Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Koizumi  visited China in May 1993, Japan was formally requested to  extend aid under a plan which visualized the installation of 100  million telephones by the year 2000, or twice current levels,  and which brightened the prospects for major construction  projects. In the future, the MPT hopes to expand candidate areas  beyond China to include Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and  Thailand.    Participation of Japanese firms in the construction of  communications infrastructure in the Asian region had lagged in  the past. A look at the supplier records of digital switching  equipment destined for China shows that NEC and Fujitsu rank  third and fifth respectively and that the combined share of the  two firms is 20 percent. While European firms hold the first and  second ranking positions, U.S. firms which had lagged just like  Japanese firms are now beginning to win major projects.    The recent MPT projects to extend assistance to the private  sector could very well invite criticism from Europe and the  United States that, "Such efforts could distort private-sector  competition."</p>

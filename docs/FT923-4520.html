			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / Arts: Shelley at intervals - Radio SHELLEY'S bicentenary fell last month, and Radio 3 marked it in Promenade interval talks. The first, Shelley and Love, on Monday, was presented by Claire Tomalin. Shelley's idea of love was illuminated in the first selection, 'Epipsychidion', his blast against marriage. Women were his muses, none the less, married or not, and we heard great verses afterwards, addressed to Mary, Claire, and Jane Williams, only one of whom married him. Jonathan Hyde read beautifully. On Tuesday, we had The Mask of Anarchy, introduced by Paul Foot, an expert on Shelley as radical. Nicholas le Prevost read the splendid rap verses that were spurred by the Peterloo 'massacre'. One line remains as vivid as in 1820, 'Ye are many, they are few.' On Wednesday, Professor Kelvin Everest introduced Ode to the West Wind (which Paul Foot reckons another radical poem) and To a Skylark, surely non-political; but alas, I did not hear them. Maurice Baring visualised a mature Shelley as the Conservative MP for Horsham, and just as restrained a view must have been taken by Parry, Delius, Quilter and the rest in the two programmes, Shelley's Soft Voices, of musical settings of his poems. Besides the two hours (including repeat) of the Classic Serial, currently the humorously romantic Miss Marjoribanks by Margaret Oliphant, Radio 4 devotes three half-hours a week to serial plays. Some of these are fine, some less good; one cannot easily organise listening to pursue a story all through. Tuesday gives us a welcome repeat of Christopher Lee's six-part The House, with its background in the Commons, ably directed by Neil Cargill. On Wednesday, there is the glutinously sentimental In Search of Mihailo by Dolores Pala, that I shall not follow further. Thursday evenings offer a great six-part thriller by Nigel Baldwin, Cordoba, that I have praised here. On the whole, we should be grateful. John Reith would not have allowed the Radio 4 Monday series Beyond Belief. Ludovic Kennedy, an avowed atheist, challenges the established religions for accepting what seem impossibilities. He began last week with Lord William Rees-Mogg, a devoted Roman Catholic, but they discussed only the normal beliefs of Christianity - the Virgin Birth, the Resurrection, miracles and so on. Such beliefs being the latchkey into the church, no valid argument was likely. This week, Kennedy examined Kalim Siddiqui, of the Moslem parliament, on the Moslem faith, and I thought Siddiqui did well. Why did Allah, the merciful, ordain that adultresses should be stoned, that thieves should have their hands cut off? Simple: to stop them doing it again. Moslems believe in the Virgin Birth as Catholics do; they accept the Christian prophets as genuine. Mohamad was not divine; he was a messenger from Allah. Kennedy has little chance against the intrinsic believers. The Bible is now finished on Radio 4. Last week, we had Revelations, superbly read by Sir John Gielgud. Now we have a dramatised Pilgrim's Progress, with Mick Ford as Christian. Worth following. Raving (Radio 4, Sunday) was a not-very-deep enquiry into MDMA, the lab name for the drug Ecstasy. 'We're not doing anything,' said sample ravers, 'we're just dancing.' But doctors said there was danger of psychosis, a possible suicidal tendency, danger from heat-stroke or blood-clots. The law said it was a Class A drug. There was a follow-up on Radio 1 on Tuesday, with a helpline.</p>

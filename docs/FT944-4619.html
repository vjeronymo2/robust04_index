			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Survey of Zimbabwe (6): Fingers point in all directions - A look look at the banking scene Money and banking in Zimbabwe today are all about finger-pointing. The process starts with the World Bank, pointing a finger at the IMF for insisting on a tight monetary stance resulting in double-digit real interest rates. For its part the Fund blames the banks for excessive spreads between deposit and lending rates, estimated at around 10 per cent. The banks, in turn, blame the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for using ZDollars 2bn in special bills and, in October, ZDollars 1bn in Treasury Bills to mop up excess liquidity. The central bank points its finger at the government's fiscal indiscipline, wage inflation and foreign currency inflows following exchange control liberalisation. Whoever the real culprit, the result is lending rates of 32 to 37 per cent in a year in which inflation is likely to average 24 per cent. Small wonder, then, that the supply response to economic reform is sluggish, especially in manufacturing; that the real exchange rate appreciated for much of 1994, that the air is thick with warnings of de-industrialisation, while black business complains that the banks are biased against the indigenous business community. The RBZ justifies its tight money stance by pointing to the 46 per cent rate of money supply growth so far this year. That, after 15 months of monetary growth in excess of 40 per cent, inflation is not 10 points higher is something of a surprise. Given the liquidity overhang, the authorities' reluctance to take risks with inflation is understandable. Indeed, the abolition of import controls and of the official exchange rate at a time when the public sector borrowing requirement exceeds 10 per cent of GDP has transformed policy-makers into single club golfers. With the authorities unwilling (or unable) to bite the fiscal bullet and exchange rate policy no longer an option, monetary policy is the last chance saloon. Predictably, this is highly unpopular with business still struggling to throw off the hangover of the 1992 drought. Loosen monetary policy and cut interest rates, says business, optimistic that this will boost import demand, reverse the foreign currency inflows of the past year and revive consumer spending and a sluggish industrial sector. But such are the constraints in the economy, especially savings skills, infrastructure and real, as distinct from nominal, industrial capacity, that an expansionist strategy could all too easily end in tears. This is not the way the script was written; in 1993 inflation more than halved from over 45 to 18.7 per cent, reflecting a 20 per cent fall in the real money supply in 1992 and a further 10 per cent decline in the first half of last year. But then it started to go wrong, with M2 rising 41 per cent in the second half of the year, accelerating to 57 per cent by the third quarter of 1994. Previously, the blame for rapid monetary growth could be laid at government's door, but the new villain of the piece is currency inflows. In mid-1993, M3 of ZDollars 8.4bn was made up of domestic credit of some ZDollars 12bn, partially offset by negative net foreign assets of ZDollars 3.5bn. By September this year, net domestic credit had risen a mere 12 per cent, declining in real terms, but partial exchange control liberalisation attracted substantial currency inflows, resulting in a build-up of foreign reserves. Put simply, of total M3 growth of ZDollars 5.1bn, the country's much healthier external position, contributed ZDollars 3.6bn, or 70 per cent. Government accounted for Dollars 1bn (71 per cent) of the increase in domestic credit, with real private sector borrowing down some 25 per cent, underscoring the fragile nature of the recovery and the impact of high real interest rates. Finger-pointing aside, no-one seems too sure what to do. One partial solution would be to release blocked funds, estimated at Dollars 200m (including so-called divestment bonds), while simultaneously liberalising dividend payments - most pre-1993 foreign investors may not remit more than half their after-tax earnings - and easing up on personal remittances. Taken together, these three moves might slow net inflows, but the real challenge is to get investment and imports growing more rapidly rather than build up foreign reserves that must be sterilised with high interest rates which encourage even greater inflows. Late last month, in an effort to counter the growing pressure for lower rates, the Reserve Bank trimmed its rediscount rate by 0.5 per cent to 29.5 per cent and cut its overnight accommodation rate by three points to 35 per cent, citing slower monetary growth and a slowdown in inflation. At the same time, it instructed banks to provide offshore borrowing facilities to exporters of manufactures for 70 per cent of their working capital requirements, arguing that this would reduce their borrowing costs. Everyone, including the banks themselves, accepts the inevitability of greater competition in financial services: the new financial services bill will level and deregulate the playing field. Although Zimbabwe has far fewer banks than Kenya or even Zambia - five commercial banks, four merchant banks, five finance houses and three building societies - its capital and money markets are more active than any other in sub-Saharan Africa, except South Africa. There is an active money market dominated by three discount houses, with a fourth due to open its doors and, by African standards, a robust secondary market in financial instruments, including government paper. While much is made of the advantages of a sophisticated capital market infrastructure, the cynical view is that the well-developed institutional market, dominated by the South African-based Old Mutual group, has simply made it easier for the government to overspend, overborrow and crowd out private sector investment, the more so since life insurance and pension funds are forced to put 55 per cent of their asset portfolios into government or semi-government paper. The government's enthusiasm for competition in the financial services sector does not yet extend to paying market rates for long-term money. Its drive to open up the market to more competitive banking is increasingly constrained by demands that black investors have a major stake in new financial institutions.</p>

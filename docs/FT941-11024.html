			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Major and Reynolds aim to restore united front The British and Irish prime ministers are to meet in London later this month to restore a common front to efforts to find a political settlement in Northern Ireland. The talks are expected to be on February 19 when Mr Albert Reynolds will be in London for the England-Ireland rugby international. The meeting follows the refusal of Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein leader, to indicate during his controversial New York visit that the IRA was prepared to renounce its campaign of violence. Growing pessimism in London about the prospects of an early end to IRA terrorism in response to December's Downing Street declaration prompted Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, to announce last week that he would table fresh ideas for a political settlement between Ulster's constitutional parties. Sir Patrick's announcement caused irritation in Dublin. The Irish government had indicated privately to London that it would prefer such negotiations to remain on hold until after Sinn Fein's party conference at the end of the month. Last night Mr Reynolds increased pressure on Sinn Fein to give a response to the call for peace. He said time was running out for a response and he expected either acceptance or rejection of the declaration by the time of the party conference. He told a meeting of the Fianna Fail party in Dublin that he had provided 'copious clarification' of the document in response to requests from Mr Adams. Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said that political talks on Northern Ireland will go ahead 'with or without Sinn Fein'. In spite of Britain's determination to press ahead with constitutional talks Mr John Major is anxious that there should be no rift with Mr Reynolds because the process depends on maintaining the united front established by the Downing Street declaration. Mr Major is expected to reassure Mr Reynolds that Britain is not aiming for a 'minimalist' political settlement which would involve no more than the establishment of devolved government in Ulster. That option is being pressed hard by the Ulster Unionist party. But British ministers recognise that the the mainly Roman Catholic Social Democratic and Labour party will not accept the creation of a new assembly unless there is an overall agreement encompassing north-south relations and links between London and Dublin. Mr Major will tell Mr Reynolds that he wants to push ahead with this 'three-stranded' approach. He will also make it clear that the search for a political settlement would not preclude a place at the table for Sinn Fein if the IRA did end its terrorist campaign.</p>

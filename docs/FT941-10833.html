			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / World Trade News: French group in Chinese water deal Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez, the French industrial and utility group, and its Hong Kong-based partner, New World Development, have won a FFr1bn (Pounds 114m) contract to build a drinking water treatment plant in Guangzhou, according to a spokesman for the French company, John Ridding writes from Paris. Sino-French, a joint venture between Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez and New World of China, will build, finance and operate the plant for 30 years. On completion, which is expected in 1996, the plant is expected to supply about 1m cubic metres of drinking water a day and provide about a quarter of the city's water needs. The contract is the first significant commercial agreement for a French company since France and China moved to improve relations last month. France said in January that it would cease the sale of arms to Taiwan, as it had been urged by Beijing.</p>

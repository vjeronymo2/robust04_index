Commenting on a remark which  IZVESTIYA attributed to V. Kryzhanovskiy claiming that "80  dismantled and disassembled nuclear warheads" were dispatched to  Russia, Yakovlev claims that the "ambassador's words do not  correspond to the real state of affairs."    The Press Service of the Ukrainian Embassy in the Russian  Federation is authorized to state that the Ukrainian ambassador  did not make any such remark either during the 23 November press  conference or at any other time. This also becomes obvious on  objective analysis of the transcripts of the press conference --  both the one available to the embassy press service and, for  instance, the one which was prepared and then circulated to  subscribers of the Russian-U.S. FEDERAL NEWS SERVICE agency.  Incidentally, nothing of the sort was reported in the VESTI  broadcast which IZVESTIYA cites (the embassy has the video  recording in its possession). The issue at the press conference  was the Ukrainian side's readiness to start carrying out the  treaty straight after ratification by the parliament, which the  mass media, including the Russian media, reported straight away.    [Signed] The Press Service of the Ukrainian Embassy in  Moscow.</p>

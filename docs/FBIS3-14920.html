			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Latvian Defense Minister Valdis Pavlovskis is highly  critical of Russia's attitude in its negotiations with Latvia.  According to Pavlovskis, Russia is constantly imposing new  conditions for withdrawing its troops from Latvia. Valdis  Pavlovskis is the first Latvian defense minister to visit  Finland after the Second World War.    [Correspondent] A couple of weeks ago, Russia and Latvia  were  already close to agreement on the withdrawal of Russian soldiers  from Latvia. However, the talks came to a sudden halt without  any result.    [Begin Pavlovskis recording, in English] Unfortunately, the  talks have stalled. I think in recent days the Russian attitude  has hardened, has become more negative.

According to him, it is not sufficient for Russia to reach  agreement on the position of the disputed Skrunda high power  radar. Pavlovskis admits that one reason why the talks broke  off was that Latvia did not accept the annual rent of 11 million  marks that Russia had offered. For this money, Russia would  have been allowed to keep the radar for another four years.  According to Defense Minister Pavlovskis, the rent for the  radar station is, however, a matter on which agreement can be  reached in the negotiations if there is the will.    Pavlovskis says that the rise of the conservative forces in  Russia is clearly noticeable in the entire negotiation set-up.  According to him, Russia now wants to argue about whether Russia  invaded Latvia in 1940.    [Begin Pavlovskis recording] Now what the hell was it, if  not  an occupation? It was a historical fact, it was an occupation,  (?but) troops that marched in and took us over...[fades to  correspondents report]    [Correspondent] Pavlovskis demands that Russia should admit  outright that it invaded Latvia and separate this historical  manipulation from the current withdrawal negotiations.</p>

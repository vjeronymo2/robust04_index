			<p>BFN     [Text] Hefei, June 6 (XINHUA) -- The Chang Jiang River  Valley headed by Shanghai is leading in the national economic  and scientific development.    With a total area of 330,000 square kilometers and a  population of 170 million, the valley generates industrial  output value accounting for one-third of the country's total,  and its gross domestic product occupies one-fifth of the  nation's total.    At present, Shanghai and Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei,  Hunan and Sichuan Provinces in the valley have worked out  strategic development plans in line with local conditions while  cooperating with each other in the development and utilization  of natural resources and production factors.    Shanghai is being developed into an international metropolis  featuring commerce, banking and foreign trade; Nanjing, capital  of Jiangsu Province, has focused on chemical and electronics  industries; Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province, is being turned  into a market; and Chongqing, Sichuan Province, is on line to  become the economic center in southwest China.    According to preliminary statistics, areas in the valley  have  loaned and borrowed a sum of 231 billion yuan and traded one  billion yuan worth of goods.    So far, the valley has formed five economic cooperative  areas, which operate independently while maintaining links with  each other.</p>

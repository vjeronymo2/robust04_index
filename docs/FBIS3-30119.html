			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 25 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa reiterated Friday [25 February] he will canvass leaders  of the seven coalition parties before deciding on any cabinet  reshuffle, denying he has already decided on the timing for a  realignment. "I have not yet considered (the timing of a  cabinet reshuffle). It is too early," Hosokawa told reporters at  his official residence.    Hosokawa said he will soon confer again with Social  Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ] Chairman Tomiichi  Murayama and Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) Chairman Keigo  Ouchi, both of whose parties belong to the coalition.    In a meeting Thursday, Murayama and Ouchi told Hosokawa that  an immediate cabinet reshuffle is unnecessary. They renewed  their opposition to a shakeup expected to center on removing  Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his post.    Hosokawa denied reports that he has asked Foreign Minister  and Shinseito head Tsutomu Hata to assume the post of chief  cabinet secretary and Hiroyuki Sonoda, a member of Sakigake  (Harbinger), to take the post of deputy chief cabinet secretary.  "I have never asked them, nor yet considered it. It's too  early," Hosokawa said.    Government sources said Hosokawa is likely to hear from the  ruling party leaders separately sometime over the weekend or  early next week.    The cabinet reshuffle, if realized, will be the first since  Hosokawa launched the coalition government last August after  ousting the now-opposition Liberal Democratic Party after its  38-year rule.    Ouchi, also health and welfare minister, told a regular  press  conference he is opposed to any early cabinet reshuffle that  could "crack the foundations of the coalition government."    Of the coalition's seven parties, the SDPJ, the DSP and  Takemura's Sakigake (Harbinger) have objected to the  restructuring plan while Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and  Komeito [Clean Government Party] support it.    Takemura differs with Hosokawa on the blueprint for Japan's  political future. Hosokawa has reportedly considered working  toward the two-party system called for by Shinseito and Komeito,  but Takemura has voiced objections.    In Oita, southern Japan, Murayama said Hosokawa is likely to  renew his consultations with ruling party leaders, including  himself, in early March to discuss the possible cabinet  reshuffle.    Citing Hosokawa's remarks Thursday that he may consider a  reshuffle after the Diet passes an amendment to the political  reform package, Murayama said, "in case there is a reshuffle,  the premier said he will surely consult (with us)."    Murayama, who was speaking to a labor union's local  convention, said that when he meets Hosokawa again he will  repeat his stance of opposing an early cabinet shakeup.    The chairman of the SDPJ, the largest among the seven ruling  parties, also denied that he would enter a new cabinet, saying  "the SDPJ is not in such a position now."    Murayama said he supports labor leader Akira Yamagishi's  idea  of forming a new liberal party to compete against two  conservative parties expected to be established before the next  general election.    Yamagishi, head of the eight-million-strong Rengo labor  organization, reached a broad agreement on Thursday with  Hokkaido Gov. Takahiro Yokomichi to aim at establishing a new  liberal party.    The new party is likely to be formed by uniting the SDPJ,  the  DSP and Sakigake, possibly under the leadership of Yokomichi,  who once served as SDPJ's House of Representative member before  becoming the governor of Japan's northernmost prefecture.</p>

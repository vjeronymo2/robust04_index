			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / International Company News: Advanced stages reached of planned spin-off of Christiania General Insurance UNI STOREBRAND has reached advanced stages of planning a spin-off of Christiania General Insurance, the group's New York-based reinsurance business, into a separate company listed on the New York Stock Exchange, writes Karen Fossli. Uni said a prospectus for an issue of Christiania General shares was almost complete and that a valuation was almost finished. The company added that limited group resources would in future prevent it from financing the further development of Christiania General. Earlier this year, Uni had considered either disposing of Christiania General or seeking a strategic partner for the entity, but this had been become difficult during a period of consolidation of the US reinsurance market. Credit Suisse First Boston, among others, are advising Uni on the move. Christiania General has assets of Dollars 300m and is ranked 11 among US reinsurers. Last year the unit returned a surplus of about Dollars 120m under US accounting principles, compared with a deficit of Dollars 125m in 1991.</p>

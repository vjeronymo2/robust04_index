			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Now Is Clinton's Time"] </F>   [Text] What Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department's  special coordinator on the Cyprus issue, has achieved in his  meetings with Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas is unknown.  What he has brought is also unknown. However, we could say  that Lamb's conclusions must reach the U.S. President before he  meets Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. We could also say  that the presence of a Turkish Government member in the occupied  areas is not accidental. The U.S. envoy met Tugay Ulucevik  before meeting Denktas for the last time before his departure.    Many hypotheses can be drawn: that Ankara is trying to look  like it is putting pressure on Denktas so that Ciller can avoid  being seriously pressed by Clinton, or that Denktas is trying to  make up reasonable arguments for the excuses he is finding to  waste time.    As we reported yesterday, the U.S. official's lightning trip  would have been more significant if it had been accompanied by a  staggering dilemma: What would happen if Turkey continued to  disobey the UN Security Council [UNSC]? A letter from U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Turkish Foreign  Minister Hikmet Cetin, revealed by HURRIYET, indirectly warned  that the UNSC would adopt measures if the deadlock continued.    Lamb's statement that President Clinton remains firmly  attached to the efforts for a solution is somewhat hopeful.  But, for it to bear fruit, the chief of the White House must  exert all his authority and influence on Ciller, who will find  it difficult to disappoint Clinton if his policy and willingness  appear to be decisive. It is well-known that Greek Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou's meeting with Clinton will follow  Ciller's visit. It is also well known that Hellenism has been  dealt serious blows and has been very bitter about the stance of  the great powers on Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia--FYROM], the intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina with  the participation of Turkish "peacekeepers," and other  incidents...all are equally disappointing. The situation in the  Balkans is heating up and Ankara is trying to penetrate it.    On the other hand, Greek foreign policy took a different  form  expressed with rage. National dignity will not tolerate any  more provocations and the Greek political leadership, united,  stands up to foreign plots and humiliation. The knife has  reached the bone....    In his upcoming meeting with Clinton, Papandreou is expected  to raise all of these issues and with firm arguments support  Hellenism's decision not to tolerate humiliations. It is also  expected that after his talks with Ciller, the U.S. President  will have something more tangible, other than his positive but  theoretical interest, to offer to the Cyprus issue.    We have reached boundary levels and any verbal justification  of Ankara's stance would equal a ridiculing of ourselves and  others. Decisive handling is necessary when deadlines expire  with no results because of proved malevolence, not making things  look good. Now is Clinton's time to turn the page and write  history with a just solution to the Cyprus issue.</p>

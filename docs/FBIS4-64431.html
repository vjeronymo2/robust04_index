			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by UK Trade Minister Richard Needham at a Department </F> of Trade and Industry-sponsored conference at the Confederation  of British Industry in London on 3 May; "Vietnam -- Another  Asian Tiger Says Richard Needham"]    [Text] Vietnam has all the right ingredients to become a  market to be reckoned with, and British firms can no longer  afford to ignore it, Trade Minister Richard Needham told British  companies today.    He said they should be prepared to take the long term view  and make commitments to the country now, rather than waiting  until later when rivals will have put down roots. The UK's  exporting future lies in the dynamic trade area of the Asia  Pacific Rim and Vietnam could be the next Asian tiger.    Speaking , Needham said: "The Vietnamese Government is keen  to work with UK partners and has introduced one of the most  liberal foreign investment laws in Southeast Asia. I strongly  urge anyone considering joint venture activity to make the most  of Vietnam's great potential in the rich butunder-developed  agricultural and mineral sectors.    ``Vietnam has a lot going for it: a wide range of energy and  mineral resources; an increasingly productive agricultural  sector; an important strategic position and -- not least -- a  huge, well educated, resourceful workforce.    ``But Vietnam has still to develop a full commercial  infrastructure. Power, water systems, transport, ports,  airports and communications, some of which will be multinational  aid funded, are all essential if Vietnam is to develop its  industrial base.    ``This need is at the centre of the opportunities for  British  companies to make the most of the expertise and skills they have  developed in equally tough markets.''    Exports to Vietnam started from a low base but are rising  (2.2 million pounds in 1988 to 17 million pounds in 1993.)  Figures for the first two months of this year have already  matched the total for last year -- this does not take into  account indirect exports via Singapore and Hong Kong which could  double these figures.    Needham warned that competition would be tough, particularly  since the lifting of the US embargo. He outlined a number of  steps the government was taking to help improve our chances  against the competition:     -  The UK was the first Western  country to restore medium and longterm export insurance cover  and has offered a mix of aid and export credit to support 50  million pounds of business;    -  10 million pounds has been made  available by the Overseas Development Administration for a  number of technical cooperation projects;    -  The Offshore Supplies  Office of the Department of Trade and Industry [DTI] has  provided advice to the Vietnamese Government on the oil and gas  support industries -- there have been four missions to the  country so far;    -  A DTI export promoter, David Kemp, on secondment  from British Gas, has been appointed to to give advice to  companies on the Vietnamese market.  <H5>  Notes for Editors </H5>   1.

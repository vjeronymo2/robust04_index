			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Oil grant is allocated TOTAL OIL MARINE PLC AND ANOTHER v AMERADA HESS LTD AND OTHERS Court of Appeal (The President, Lord Justice Staughton and Lord Justice Scott): July 23 1992 GRANTS FOR capital expenditure incurred in the construction of an oil terminal by pipeline groups under agreements providing for participation adjustments to be made by proportional debiting and crediting of expenditure and receipts each year, is allocated between groups in proportion to their participation when it is received, not when the capital expense was incurred, and is deducted from expenditure in the calculation of participation adjustment payments. THE Court of Appeal so held (Lord Justice Scott dissenting) when dismissing an appeal by BG United Kingdom Inc and other defendants from Mr Justice Saville's decision on preliminary issues relating to the allocation of regional development grant, in an action by Total Oil Marine plc and another, against Amerada Hess Ltd and others. LORD JUSTICE Staughton said the Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands was supplied with oil and gas by two pipelines from the North Sea. The oil was collected from wells owned by a number of companies. The Ninian pipeline, owned by the Ninian Pipeline Group, was operated on behalf of the companies by BP Petroleum Developments Ltd. The Brent pipeline, owned by the Brent Pipeline Group, was operated by Shell UK Ltd. Membership of each group and the shares of each group and each participating company varied from time to time. Massive capital expenditure was incurred in the construction of the terminal between 1975 and 1980. It qualified for a Pounds 534m grant under the Industry Act 1972. The grant was paid in four amounts between March 1983 and November 1984. On preliminary issues tried in November and December 1990, Mr Justice Saville declared that (a) as between the two pipeline groups, grant should be appropriated in proportion to their respective participation at the time it was received; and (b) grant should be taken into account as negative capital cost in the calculation of participation adjustment payments when received. Mr Stamler for the appellants argued that grant should be allocated in the proportion prevailing when the capital expenditure was incurred; and should not be brought into account in the adjust-ment to past capital expenditure. A 'terminal participants' agreement' and a 'terminal construction agreement' between the two pipeline groups on behalf of themselves and the member companies, were executed on June 28 1976. Each had some retroactive effect. In the participants' agreement, Article V regulated the extent to which each pipeline operator was to bear the cost of capital expenditure in any year. Article VI was concerned primarily with payment to be made by one pipeline group to another when and as often as there was a change in the proportion that each was using or was capable of using the terminal. Article V regulated who should bear capital expenditure on general support facilities, such as main roads in the terminal, in any year. By Article VI whenever there was a change in the proportion of one operator's peak pipeline capacity, there was to be a valuation of all the general support facilities. The operator whose proportion had increased had to pay an appropriate percentage of the value to the operator whose proportion had decreased. The treatment of common facilities, such as pipes and pumps was similar. For both the general support and the common facilities, the procedures required calculation of the 'depreciated replacement value' in accordance with a formula based on replacement value previously determined ('item A'), capital costs expended since that previous determination ('item B'), and an escalation factor based on average earnings and costs ('item E'). By clause 6.06 in Article VI the procedures were to be reviewed from time to time 'to ensure that all pipeline operators shall always bear an equitable share of the cost of the said facilities'. Under the construction agreement BP was appointed constructor. There was to be a joint account by which accounting records were to be sub-divided to enable 'costs and receipts' to be allocated to groups in accordance with the terminal participants' agreement. Attachment C, headed 'Accounting and Control Procedures', provided by clause 3.11.3 that all applications for grants should be channelled through the constructor and credited to the relevant sections of the joint account. The first question was how regional development grants received should have been distributed? The whole tenor of the financial provisions was that there was to be a running account in each year, and that with one exception all expenditure and receipts were to be debited or credited to it in the proportions prevailing that year. Receipts mentioned in Attachment C were meant to be credited in the proportions prevailing during the year of receipt. It seemed a clear inference from clause 3.11.3 that participants should account for grant to operators in the proportions prevailing at time of receipt. In agreement with the judge, it was held that by the terms of the two agreements grant was to be allocated to pipeline groups in the proportions prevailing when it was received. The second question was whether grant was to be taken into account as a deduction or negative capital expenditure, in calculating participation adjustment payments. Common sense suggested that it should be, since the apparent aim of the provisions was to transfer the burden of past capital expenditure to new entrants, or to those whose participation was increased. The agreements contemplated not only grants, but also other receipts such as the proceeds of sale of surplus. It would seem unfair if a new entrant had to pay the historic cost of assets when they had been sold and the proceeds had been received by his predecessor. The inference in clause 6.06 was that it was intended to provide for equitable sharing. When assets were 'removed, replaced or abandoned', the depreciated replacement value was to be adjusted for the future, presumably by removing that element of it which represented the cost of the asset. It would not be right to deduct proceeds of sale when calculating item B in the formula. Owners of the asset would have lost their credit for depreciated replacement value and would have received the proceeds of sale in the proportions currently prevailing. But they should not also have to suffer a deduction of those proceeds of sale from their shares in the value of the remaining assets. It was held that item B in the formula for calculating depreciated replacement value should be subject to a deduction for grant received in the period in question. It followed that, on the next occasion the calculation was made, item A would also be a net figure. The appeal was dismissed. LORD JUSTICE Scott dissenting said that taken overall the provisions in the construction agreement regarding receipts did not support the proposition that grant should be allocated in receipt proportions. The legislative system did not contemplate the benefit of grant being passed on to subsequent purchasers of the asset. Since the contractual provisions did not provide an express answer to the issue, a contractual intention that grants should be allocated in contribution proportions should be imputed to the parties. His Lordship would have allowed the appeal on both questions. THE PRESIDENT agreed with Lord Justice Staughton. For the appellants: Sam Stamler QC and Steven Gee (Herbert Smith) For BP: Anthony Grabiner QC and Laurence Rabinowitz (Gary Hodgson) For Total: Michael Burton QC and Julia Dias (Denton Hall Burgin &amp; Warrens) For Amerada: Marion Simmons (Rowe &amp; Maw)</p>

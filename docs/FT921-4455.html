			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Pledge to promote and protect: The Labour party's policy themes Labour's policies towards the City are heavier on issues that need to be explored than specific pledges of action. At the general level, there are two themes: promoting the City's competitive edge against rival European financial centres; and protecting retail customers. One wider policy theme - discouraging another UK merger wave, and using a broader definition of the public interest in assessing takeover proposals - would also affect the City. Such an approach would reduce the pickings available for corporate financiers and City lawyers, and make it harder for them to plan any individual bid. Otherwise, says Ms Mo Mowlam, a Labour government would stand for: Reformed regulation. 'Regulation is an albatross round our neck. At the moment we have a regulatory system which doesn't work to the advantage of protecting the consumer. It is not cost-effective, it is cumbersome and bureaucratic.' Ms Mowlam leaves her exact reforms unclear, but they are likely to involve fewer regulators; a more explicit statutory framework for the regulators; less chance of products falling between regulators and compensation schemes; better co-ordination of fraud responsibility between Department of Trade and Industry, Serious Fraud Office and the City regulators; and: Tighter consumer protection. Reforms would start from what the Securities and Investments Board retail review, due this week, comes up with, so no detailed promises yet. But she says: 'I clearly have concerns about millions of people who have had a very raw deal (from retail financial services) - they have not had the consumer protection they ought to have had.' Likely areas for attention include: more information (although she says 'I don't think there are any very easy answers' on how to provide for disclosure of commissions); an attempt to preserve and strengthen the independent intermediaries sector; and an expectation that companies that take on tied agents should be responsible for their actions. Insurance reforms. Labour would give with one hand, fighting harder for the insurance industry's cause in Brussels, and take with the other: life insurance companies would be a prime target of the tighter regulation of retail financial services. At times Ms Mowlam seems to be hankering after German-style strict supervision of new insurance products. Lloyd's would also be a potential target. Not only has its chairman, Mr David Coleridge, got 'an attitude problem' in her view, but the whole institution is a symptom of old-style City culture, still far too prevalent. Most of the suggestions in the Rowland report are 'reasonable if a bit minimal', but insiders may have been exploiting the market's outsiders: 'Some of the evidence I have seen makes it look as though churning and dumping (of risks) has gone on.' Accountancy. The tighter accounting standards that the Financial Reporting Council is introducing need a counterpart in tighter supervision of accountants, partly by laymen. Auditors might be asked to report publicly on a company's internal controls, and should have a statutory duty to collect information in a form useful to government statisticians. The Caparo decision restricting auditors' liability should be re-examined, which would lead to a tighter definition of auditors' responsibilities. Labour would be prepared to consider either restricting accountancy firms from doing consultancy for audit clients or insisting that companies rotate their auditors - but only if a review of corporate governance suggests no better way to ensure auditors' independence. Corporate governance. Audit committees should be mandatory. Chief executives should be separate from chairmen. Non-executive directors should be stronger and more independent. There should be better annual reports, in line with those of the best companies, and perhaps more detailed reports to the regulators, as with the 10K reports required in the US. Companies should set out their long-term strategies in their annual reports. Investment institutions should vote more actively at AGMs, especially on directors' pay. But there is no commitment to make any of this legally binding - the only clear promise of statutory action is over reports to employees.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Weekend Economic Commentary" by XINHUA reporter Zhang </F> Jinsheng (1728 6930 0524): "Enterprises Should Do All They Can  To Overcome `Inability To Adapt To Markets'"]    [Text] Beijing, 27 May (XINHUA) -- Along with the gradual  establishment of a socialist market economic structure, the  change from the old to the new system, while bringing along new  development opportunities to Chinese enterprises at large, has  also posed a new challenge to them, that is, how can they adapt  themselves to the turbulent "ocean" of market economy?    Economists hold that while enterprises in the mid-1980's  suffered from low economic efficiency largely as a result of the  "lingering effects" of the planned economy, their "inability to  adapt to markets" today has obviously intensified and become the  major contradiction hampering the economic efficiency of  enterprises in the process of shifting from a product to market  economy.    The results of surveys can fully explain the problem. During  the past two years, along with the progress in the economic  structural reform in all fields and the implementation of the  "regulations [on changing the operating mechanisms of  enterprises]," and along with the strengthening of the  regulatory role of markets, the primary factors affecting  enterprises' economic efficiency have undergone conspicuous  changes. According to a survey of 50 deficit-ridden enterprises  in Beijing, Shenyang, and Tianjin in 1991, the policy,  macro-economic, and enterprise operational factors accounted for  19.4, 47.8, and 32.8 percent, respectively, of the causes for  the losses. However, another survey, conducted two years later  in 1993, of 2,586 enterprises operating in the red in eight  provinces and municipalities -- including Shanghai, Shandong,  and Jilin -- showed that the causes for losses by the policy and  macroeconomic factors both dropped to around 9 percent, while  the factor of enterprise operations rose to 81.7 percent as the  cause.    The differences in the survey results explain that in  raising  economic efficiency, enterprises should give top priority to  focusing attention on internal operation. As we know, the  continuous deepening of reform has resulted in the gradually  rationalized relations between the state and enterprises and has  greatly improved the external environment for enterprise  production and operation. To further improve economic  efficiency, it is necessary for enterprises to focus reforms of  the managerial system and operating mechanisms on rationalizing  the relations between enterprises and their workers and among  various internal departments, reinforcing the incentive  mechanisms and improving the supervisory mechanisms of  enterprises so as to adapt themselves to new market situations  with new systems.    This year is crucial for an all-out effort at reform. Along  with the implementation of numerous measures for establishing a  market economy, enterprises may experience greater "inability to  adapt to markets." The State Statistical Bureau, in analyzing  this year's enterprise economic efficiency trend, has noted the  coexistence of factors for both promoting and hampering  enterprises' economic efficiency while efforts are made to  advance comprehensive reform and to achieve breakthroughs in key  areas this year. Judging from the unfavorable factor, as speed  will remain the major factor affecting the economic efficiency  trend, decrease in the economic growth will, to a certain  degree, lead to a drop in economic efficiency. Judging from  favorable factors, the strengthening of the intensity of reform  in state enterprises, the accelerating of the banking reforms,  and other reform measures will contribute to the overall  improvement of enterprises' economic efficiency.    Enterprises' "inability to adapt to markets" is a normal  phenomenon in economic reform. An enterprise which can seize  the opportunity to promptly overcome the "inability to adapt to  markets" will take the lead in the market and raise the economic  efficiency to a new height. Conversely, one which continues to  suffer from the lingering effects will be eliminated. This  explains the coexistence of opportunities and challenges for  Chinese enterprises in the new era.</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / CIS leaders face key decisions on economic future LEADERS of the Commonwealth of Independent States will face crucial decisions on the creation of a single monetary system and the development of common economic policies within the remnants of the rouble zone when they meet in Kyrgyzstan on Friday. Foreign ministers of the states met in Moscow yesterday to draw up an agenda. One key proposal comes from Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president of Kazakhstan. Mr Nazarbayev has suggested a 'two-speed' CIS with common economic policies for the inner core. But this will leave the 'outer ring' states, especially Ukraine, with the harsh choice of leaving the Commonwealth or delaying plans to introduce their own currencies. The Ukrainian delegation attended yesterday's meeting as observers, reinforcing the likelihood of Ukraine being pushed at least to the edge of the CIS, if not out of it entirely. The Russians and Ukrainians began discussions in Kiev at the weekend on a procedure for the introduction of a new Ukrainian currency. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said after a meeting of CIS foreign ministers in Moscow yesterday that 24 items were on the summit agenda. They included such military questions as the future of the Black Sea fleet, now under joint Ukrainian-Russian jurisdiction, and the future of the strategic missiles in four of the CIS member countries. Mr Kozyrev said that the CIS 'would not be a mechanism for a civilised divorce but an instrument for the further strengthening of joint action between the states'. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the CIS armed forces, told the official news agency Itar Tass last night that the two main military problems were the various 'hot spots', especially Tajikistan, and the future of the strategic forces. He said that he was confident of the positions of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, but could not define the precise position of Ukraine, especially since its change of government. 'We must hope that the position of Ukraine will be matched with the position of the other three (nuclear) states of the CIS,' Marshal Shaposhnikov said.</p>

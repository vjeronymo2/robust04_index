			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Mr Clean goes to polls under heavy guard THE voters trickle into the cavernous school building, converted into a polling station, with the solemnity of people attending Mass. Wailing sirens suddenly puncture the tranquility of this balmy Sunday morning in Palermo. 'He's coming,' a plain-clothes policeman announces importantly and clears the school entrance of curious voters. Then, amid a screech of brakes, a stocky figure steps out of an armour-plated Fiat Croma, surrounded by bodyguards. Mr Leoluca Orlando, former mayor of Palermo and founder of La Rete, the rapidly growing movement for clean government, has come to cast his vote in Italy's ninth post-war referendum. Mr Orlando is bundled forward, scarcely given time to greet a few supporters. An implacable opponent of the Mafia, he is the politician most at risk in Sicily. Inside an upper room, election officials respectfully check his identity card against the electoral register (one for men, another for women). He is handed eight coloured folders, a different one for each of the referendum proposals, then disappears into a small booth. Only his legs are visible. To read the fine print of the proposals should take an average of eight minutes, but he emerges after little more than one. The first slip he casts into the line of eight boxes is yellow - the key ballot for ending proportional representation and introducing a system of majority voting in the Senate. Although he originally backed the referendum movement, led by former Christian Democrat Mr Mario Segni, Mr Orlando has since come out against the majority vote proposal, claiming electoral reform has been hijacked by the traditional parties. 'If the majority system is accepted,' he told a packed crowd on Friday outside Palermo's decaying opera house, 'in the north we will have the regions nearly all represented by the Lombard League and in the south by the (Christian Democrat) old guard. The yes vote will mean that wholly discredited people will be called on to carry out electoral reform.' Mr Orlando has acquired some odd political bedfellows in his campaign - the Mafia, closely linked to the old guard among the Christian Democrats; the neo-fascist MSI, also strong in the south; and some Socialists and elements of the former Communist party. This assortment of protest could well lower the expected margin of victory for majority voting to below the 70 per cent predicted by some opinion polls. Smiling nervously as he comes away from voting, Mr Orlando declines to offer a prediction: 'We concentrated on getting the vote before the poll, we must now concentrate on the counting.' Once he has left, the election officials relax. They have been on duty since 6.30am, greeted the first voter at 7am, and will not be finished until 2pm today collecting the ballots of a segment of Palermo's 562,000 potential voters. 'It's a fine day - who knows how many will come? Whatever the outcome of the vote, change is on the way, even here in Sicily,' says one young woman. 'We owe it to people like Falcone and Borsellino (the two anti-Mafia magistrates assassinated last year).' Mr Paolo Borsellino was killed last July by a huge car bomb while visiting his mother on a quite Sunday not far from the school. Yesterday, the small shrine erected in the street to him and his bodyguards had a bunch of fresh flowers.</p>

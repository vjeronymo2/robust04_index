			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais rejects MGM offer CREDIT Lyonnais, the French bank which owns Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, yesterday said it had no immediate plans to sell the Hollywood film studio following an announcement by Mr William Koch that he plans to make an offer for the company. Mr Koch, winner of the 1992 Americas Cup yacht race, is chairman and biggest shareholder of Kendall Square Research, a supercomputer company. He said yesterday that he had retained International Creative Management (ICM), the powerful Hollywood talent agency, and its chairman to advise him. 'At this point, it is my goal for our team to amass enough information to put together a preliminary offer within the next 30 to 60 days,' he said. Credit Lyonnais took control of MGM last year after forclosing on loans it made to Mr Giancarlo Parretti, an Italian entrepreneur who bought the company in 1990 from Mr Kirk Kerkorian for Dollars 1.3bn. Credit Lyonnais is involved in litigation with Mr Kerkorian. In a letter to MGM's chairman, Mr Frank Mancuso, Credit Lyonnais said last week: 'Everyone at MGM/UA should rest assured MGM/UA is not for sale.' Under US banking law Credit Lyonnais must sell the studio by 1997.</p>

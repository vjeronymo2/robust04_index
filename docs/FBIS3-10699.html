The complaint was made known after city daily CLARIN  published an article on Tuesday [8 March] saying that the  agreement had been reached by SIDE [Secretariat for State  Intelligence] state intelligence agency Secretary Hugo  Anzorregui on a visit to Britain on Monday [7 March].    A document signed by Deputy Antonio Berhongaray said that  the  deputies in question were both "surprised and disapproving" of  the development especially given the recent history of conflict  between Argentina and Britain.    They wrote that even if the service was essential it would  have to pose no danger to "strategic policy and basic  common-sense."    They added: "It seems obvious to the unaware mind that the  training of personnel by foreign intelligence services enables  the country carrying out the task to gain valuable insight into  professional training and the makeup of the other country."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 19 Apr (MTI) -- Hungary defence doctrine  has changed to that of non-aggression since the termination of  the Warsaw Treaty, and the country no longer has an enemy image.    Over the past four years, the army staff has been reduced  from 156,000 to 100,000, and soldiers are now imbued with what  the defence minister describes as a national spirit. The recent  changes are summed up in a book published earlier this year  under the title "Four Years of National Defence: 1990-1994".    Jozsef Antall's government gave priority to restoring  Hungary's sovereignty and withdrawing the country from the  alliance system that hindered this endeavour.    In 1991, at a Hungarian initiative, Warsaw Treaty member  states met in Budapest to wind up the military alliance.  Defence Minister Lajos Fur, who presented the book to the  press, recalled that dissolution talks brought some heavy  clashes between the Hungarian delegation, and Warsaw Treaty  leaders and Soviet military commanders.    Soviet troops, stationed in Hungary for 45 years and  numbering 60,000 in the last phase of their stay here, were  withdrawn under an agreement concluded by Miklos Nemeth's  government in March 1990. The last Soviet soldier left Hungary  on June 19, 1981.    According to current military leadership, four years ago the  Hungarian Army was oversized and had an aggressive nature, while  its technological, organizational and moral standards were  deteriorating. In the first phase, the new leadership  formulated a security policy which no longer implies an enemy  image.    The development of Hungary's defence was subordinated to the  interests of the nation and started from geopolitical realities.    Hungary has concluded military cooperation agreements with  the majority of its neighbours. Despite cool relations with  Romania, the two countries' military leaders are in permanent  contact and assure a successful implementation of the Open Skies  treaty.    Hungary maintains regular relations with NATO, and was the  fifth country to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement.    The real value of funds earmarked for national defence from  the state coffer has decreased since the mid-1980s. As this  trend continued after the collapse of the communist regime in  1990, the defence budget did not meet the need for standard  maintenance of the armed forces. Presently, less than 2 percent  of the gross domestic product is earmarked for defence.    The withdrawal of Soviet troops has particularly weakened  Hungary's anti-aircraft defence. To improve the situation,  Russia repaid part of the former Soviet debts to Hungary in 1993  by 28 MiG- 29 jets valued at $850 million.    Last year, Germany transferred military components from the  arsenal of the one-time East German Army to Hungary free of  charge, with a value of DM 150 million. This year, Hungary  expects to get helicopter parts from Germany.    Hungary's new defence law was enacted, in consensus, last  December. The law left the 12-month compulsory military service  unchaged, but reduced the period of unarmed military service  from 15 to 12 months. Civilian service, where soldiers receive  basic military training and then work in their trade under a  contract between their companies and the army, has been cut from  22 to 18 months. Fathers of two children are called up only for  six months, while those of three or more are entirely exempted  from military service.    In January, military chaplains began to work in the  Hungarian  Army, while in March, approximately 500 officers began to  provide human services, including moral education and  social-welfare support.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Sim Chae-yun] </F>   [Text] Whether or not to rewrite the Status of Forces  Agreement (SOFA) is emerging as a major pending issue between  South Korea and the United States with civil organizations and  activists raising voices for a sweeping reform of the pact which  they claim is uncommonly unfair.    Their demands appear to have gained momentum following the  Tuesday transfer of a U.S. serviceman convicted of killing a  Korean bar hostess to a local prison to begin his 15-year jail  term. The National Campaign for Eradication of Crime by U.S.  Troops in Korea yesterday issued a statement welcoming the  decision to have Pvt. Kenneth Markle, 22, of Keyser, West  Virginia, begin serving his sentence at the Chonan Juvenile  Penitentiary, 150km southwest of Seoul. The body has 24  nationwide activists' organizations as its fraternity members  including the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification,  Korean Federation of University Students, and Korean National  Council of Churches (KNCC). It has led a series of campaigns to  put an end to crimes by U.S. soldiers here and to revise the  SOFA. It plans to hold a public hearing in October on the SOFA  revision with a view to coming up with a singular draft bill to  be submitted to the relevant ministries and the National  Assembly, in addition to a nationwide move to collect signatures  to this end.    What is cited as the most problematic point in the SOFA is  that the government has failed to exercise jurisdiction rights  over crimes committed by U.S. soldiers, campaign leaders said.    According to data compiled by the body, the crimes by U.S.  soldiers from 1967 through 1987 numbered 39,452, of which only  234 or 0.6 percent were handled by the government authorities.  This is extremely unfair compared to the cases in the similar  U.S. agreements with NATO countries, Japan and the Philippines.  The percentage of eases in which the nations exercised  jurisdiction over the U.S. troops marked 32,32 and 22 percent,  respectively.    "As a matter of fact, Koreans are exposed to crimes by U.S.  troops without proper legal means to be protected, due to biased  articles in the SOFA," said Cho Chae-hak, chief secretary of the  body.    Some 850 criminal cases involving U.S. troops occurred from  October, 1992 through last August, with only 10 cases dealt with  by the prosecution authorities, according to the Justice  Ministry report to the National Assembly. In most cases the  Korean government had to transfer American military criminal  suspects to the U.S. military authorities because of the  regulations under the SOFA. Even in cases when the government  authorities exercise jurisdiction, the soldiers can be confined  to facilities in the U.S. bases in accordance with the SOFA.    SOFA was signed in 1967 and was revised in 1991 first to  scrap a clause under which the Korean government shall give up  its jurisdiction if it fails to exercise it within 15 days after  a crime. "But the newly-introduced point is thought to be  virtually moot because it entails exceptions, as it empowers the  U.S. side to remand the U.S. servicemen upon request, thus  depriving the Korean government of the judiciary right," Cho  said.    It also stipulates the Korean government should offer  favorable treatment for the suspected U.S. soldiers upon  request, thus enabling them to the be put into a U.S. jail.  What is a serious problem concerning the "unfair" accord is the  attitude of the prosecution authorities who tend not to be  positive in exercising jurisdiction, even within the possible  scope, Cho claimed.</p>

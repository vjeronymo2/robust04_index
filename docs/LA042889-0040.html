			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE GALLERIES : LA CIENEGA AREA  </P> <P> Ynez Johnston's paintings are sui generis. They are rather like a cross between  tattoos and pieces of embroidery from a proud non-Western culture that abhors  vacuums and loves brightly colored, multifarious detail. Recent works, in oil  and mixed-media (or acrylic and casein) on rice papier-mache mounted on canvas,  have a thickness and porous texture that belie the delicate, continuous drizzle  of imagery. Tiny markings and wandering outlines create rambling, fanciful  universes -- rectangles filled with teeming patterns, picturesque structures  and enigmatic processions -- that are bordered by rows of fanciful outlined  creatures.  </P> <P> In collaboration with her husband, John Berry, the artist -- who will be 79  next month -- also makes tabletop sculptures (she adds the fine details to the  wood carvings he makes after her initial drawings, which are subsequently cast  in bronze). These are structures peppered with tiny three-dimensional beasties  -- balancing on top, posing in little niches -- and a steady drumbeat of  incised pattern. Sometimes mask-like, sometimes animal-like, sometimes  reminiscent of ancient monuments, the chimerical forms these sculptures take  look as though they might have been created by some lost civilization -- which  probably could while away 1,001 nights telling the tales encapsulated in the  works' ornate surfaces and eccentric silhouettes.

			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Powell Duffryn Pounds 3.5m combustion expansion POWELL Duffryn, the industrial group with interests in distribution and specialist engineering, has expanded its combustion activities via the purchase of Airoil-Flaregas from Portals for Pounds 3.5m cash. Airoil-Flaregas supplies combustion equipment to the refining, petrochemical, marine and utility industries and has a strong European presence. The acquisition will further enhance the combustion division of Hamworthy Engineering, Powell Duffryn's largest subsidiary. The division, which has an annual turnover in excess of Pounds 50m, started its expansion last year with the purchases of Dresser Homes in the UK and Peabody Engineering in the US. Over the past 18 months Powell Duffryn has disposed of its quarrying, shipping fleet and foundry interests. The disposals realised over Pounds 50m. Powell Duffryn's shares closed 18p higher yesterday at 484p. One analyst said the rise was attributable to heavier than usual buying in a tightly-held stock.</p>

			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / EU and US in crucial Gatt talks European trade negotiators arrive in Washington today for a two-day meeting with US counterparts that is likely to determine the shape and scope of the Uruguay Round package of world trade reform. 'I am confident now that there will be an agreement by December 15,' the deadline set for an accord, a European Union negotiator said before departure. 'The Washington meeting will decide whether it is a big deal, or something more modest.' While warning that a 'small package' would be much harder for national governments to ratify, he signalled that outstanding differences over protection and subsidies for steel presented a stumbling block. Negotiators would be trying to 'reduce matters to an absolute minimum' - focusing on market access, trade in services, anti-dumping rules, subsidies and disciplines over support for steel and aircraft. The Washington meeting between Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, and Sir Leon Brittan, EU trade commissioner, will allow EU negotiators to learn how events of the past week have influenced US strategy towards completion of the Uruguay Round. The EU has been a spectator during the approval by the US Congress of the North American Free Trade Agreement and the US courtship of Asian nations at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle. US officials said at the weekend they believed that winning congressional approval for Nafta had strengthened their hand in the Uruguay Round negotiations and had improved prospects of congressional support for the Gatt deal. 'A good consequence of the Nafta win is that while we really would like a deal, we don't have a high octane political need for one. When the president says we want a good one, we can mean that,' an administration official said. The Senate voted Nafta through on Saturday by 61-38. A total of 34 Republicans joined 27 Democrats in favour of the measure; 28 Democrats and 10 Republicans opposed it. As the Uruguay Round approaches December 15, after which President Bill Clinton will lose his fast track authority to negotiate without line-by-line congressional oversight, the White House believes that the Nafta battle has re-established a constituency for free trade within Congress. Mr Clinton said that the US would 'not accept a flawed agreement' but added that a good Gatt deal could create 1.4m jobs in the US over 10 years. Tom Burns adds from Madrid: President Francois Mitterrand of France underlined that the road to a Gatt agreement remained rocky when he used bilateral weekend talks with the Spanish government in Madrid to deliver a stinging attack on what he said were bullying US tactics following the Nafta accord. He was supported by Mr Edouard Balladur, prime minister, who warned in a joint press conference with Mr Mitterrand and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, that the US would have to soften its stance on Gatt.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source at the Ministry of Defense has  stated that Armed Forces' units continued their advance  yesterday along the al-'Anad-al-Hawtah axis, crossed all  barriers, and confronted air sorties by the forces of apostasy  and secession. The air defenses forced the aircraft to retreat  and flee, downing one aircraft over the al-'Anad airport.    The forces of unity, democracy, and the protection of  Constitutional legitimacy managed to seize 62 T-55 tanks in the  mountainous paths outside the al-'Anad base, several kilometers  away on the southern front between al-Hawtah and the al-'Anad  base, after these tanks managed to flee the base the day before  yesterday. These tanks were seized by the fist of legitimacy and  the hands of our courageous and devoted forces. Our forces also  managed to seize one 130-mm Howitzer gun battalion during the  units' advance from the al-'Anad base toward the town of  al-Hawtah.    On the Abyan-Aden axis, the valiant Armed Forces' units  continued their advance, and completed the tight siege of the  set targets, from the eastern and northern sides of Aden, after  inflicting great losses on the gangs of the rebellious  secessionist forces and forcing them to retreat toward the final  places of suffocation.    The eagles of the air in the Air Force carried out the  missions assigned to them in their combat sorties, and scored  direct and destructive hits against the set military targets in  a number of collapsing dens of the rebellious secessionist  forces.    Judging from the outcome of the field confrontation of the  forces of apostasy and secession, all field, psychological, and  moral signs about the rebellious gangs of the secessionists  confirm the extent of the grave disappointment and the feelings  of disgrace and bitter frustration overwhelming the  secessionists and guiding their interpretations and rancorous  conduct toward both themselves and all those surrounding them.  This is also revealed by the secessionists' despicable cries  and their distorted and desperate media statements.    In another development, the military source said there is a  daily increase in the numbers of officers, noncommissioned  officers, and soldiers, misled by the gang of rebellion and  secession in the [Yemeni] Socialist Party's leadership, who are  joining our valiant Armed Forces, the forces that protect unity  and champion both Constitutional legitimacy and democracy, after  seeing the real infernal scheme to which they were pushed by the  secessionist gang. This scheme leads to death and to the furnace  of a losing war.    The Yemeni News Agency, SABA', has learned that 250  officers,  noncommissioned officers, and soldiers from the remaining  elements of the 'Abbud Brigade, who fled from the al-Dali'  District, returned to the district and joined the forces of  unity and legitimacy stationed in al-Dali' District. They  expressed their denunciation of the hideous crime committed by  the secessionist gang by initiating war in the homeland and  pushing the sons of the Armed Forces and the comrades in arms  into the furnace of bloody fighting. They also asserted their  readiness to carry out the national duty in the ranks that  champion unity and legitimacy. They were welcomed by their  colleagues in our Armed Forces, the forces of unity and  legitimacy.</p>

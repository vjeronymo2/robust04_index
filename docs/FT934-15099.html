			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Survey of Italian Industry and Technology (3): A sector-by-sector guide - Industry round-up Aerospace: The worldwide downturn in civil and military orders continues to be felt on the main group, state-controlled Alenia, which approved a restructuring plan earlier in the year after strong union resistance. Alenia has warded off threats from McDonnell Douglas to end long-standing contracts, but orders for a French venture on regional turbo transport have been slower than expected. On the military side, the cut-backs and reworking of the Eurofighter project are being felt. But the Italian Air Force may yet boost local industry through lease-purchase of a stop-gap, all-purpose fighter aircraft before the Eurofighter comes into service. Automotive industry: The sector remains depressed, operating at 75 per cent capacity as a result of the drop in international demand and recession at home. Production and sales are expected to be down at least 20 per cent this year, forcing Fiat to raise L6,000bn in capital to offset present and future losses. If demand continues at present levels beyond the first quarter of 1994, plant closures could become a real issue. Focus is on the success of Fiat's 10-year L40,000bn investment programme whose first fruit was the Punto launch in September from the new Melfi plant. Chemicals and Fertilisers: The industry is awaiting plans for reorganisation of Enichem, chemicals arm of ENI, the state oil concern. With first-half losses of L1,000bn, major surgery is anticipated, especially where old plant is concerned and in uneconomic fertiliser production. ENI itself has forged ties with BP. In the private sector, Montedison's reasonable performance in specialised sectors has been overshadowed by the collapse of the controlling Ferruzzi family group. The resolution of the Ferruzzi mess could lead to asset sales including the high-technology US arm, Himont, in which Shell has shown an interest. Civil Engineering: Depressed domestic demand and cuts in government spending have forced companies to turn overseas for a higher proportion of work. Lira devaluation has led to successful bids on a string of contracts, especially in the Middle East - the Ansaldo desalination projects, for example - and also in new markets such as China, as well in mature markets such as the UK. Construction is among the worst-affected sectors, feeling the triple blasts of domestic recession, freezes on government spending and troubles produced by the corruption scandals that have halted as much as 25 per cent of all public works contracts for varying periods during the year. Ownership structures could change with Fiat hinting at the sale of Cogefar-Impresit, its construction arm. State-run Iritecna's fate is also unclear. Defence: There has been enforced reorganisation as a result of the liquidation of Efim, the state industrial holding, in August 1992. Augusta (helicopters), and the armoured vehicles, ordinance and weapons producers Breda and Oto Melara are moving from Efim to rationalise state holdings under Finmeccanica. But Finmeccanica is reluctant to absorb their debt. The reorganisation must reflect a drop of almost one third in overall sales and Italy's declining ability to sustain substantial defence investments. Informatics and office equipment: Olivetti raised L900bn in a rights issue early in the year to help offset losses and fight fierce international competition. Rumours of an impending Olivetti international alliance are constant but have yet to materialise. In 1994, for the second year running, the information technology market in Italy is forecast to grow at only about half the rate of European growth: some 2.4 per cent. Machine tools: This is a traditional area of strength, especially in establishing market niches for specialised machine tools. Production fell 13 per cent in the first half of 1993. But this conceals the way in which a dramatic drop in domestic demand has been offset by an impressive switch to export orders. But the boost from the lira devaluation masks whether production costs have fallen sufficiently and innovation is being sustained. Shipbuilding: The sector is dominated by state-run Fincantieri which is in the process of rationalisation. The workforce is due to be reduced by almost a quarter to cut over-capacity on both the civil and military side, and gradual hiving off of the repairs division to the private sector. Good orders have been won in the promising cruise market. Although the group's finances remain weak, a burden has been lifted by settlement of the long-standing issue of Iraqi naval vessels which were built but whose delivery was embargoed. Steel: This is the industry which faces the biggest immediate shake-up as subsidies are cut and the EC obliges capacity reductions at state-run Ilva. This is to be achieved by breaking up Ilva and privatising, with the threat of 15,000 jobs lost between 1993 and 1995 in primary steel production. Telecommunications: The government has approved a shake-up of the state-controlled sector moving towards a telecoms authority and separation of the manufacturing side (Italtel - equipment manufacture; Sirti - network engineering). Despite the potential demand for new services, telephone investments by Sip, the main telephones company, have been lower than planned this year and could follow a similar pattern next year. The sector, heavily dependent on the Italian market, is unlikely to have a much-needed boost until privatisation plans are clarified. Textiles: Tough competition from low-cost producers in developing countries continue to impact negatively on the lower and middle end of the market. The top end has felt the squeeze from a drop in demand among rich consumers, although where the lira devaluation has given a competitive advantage, such as in Germany and France, market shares have been increased. The sector needs to see more mergers or co-operative ventures among the small- and medium-sized companies to consolidate the future. White Goods: This has been one of the few sectors to buck the trend and, despite slack domestic demand, production increased 3 per cent in the first half. Zanussi and Merloni have both been pressing for more flexible working and production schedules. In this context, Merloni in July chalked up a landmark productivity-related union agreement. The company has also been aggressive in seeking production opportunities overseas, such as Turkey.</p>

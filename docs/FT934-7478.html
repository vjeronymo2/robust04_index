			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Africa's axis THE NEWS from Nigeria and South Africa dramatically illustrates the delicate balance between crisis and recovery in Africa. The army reasserts itself in Nigeria and General Sani Abacha removes the country's civilian head of state on the very day democracy wins in South Africa. Both events have profound importance for the two countries, but their significance is broader. If sub-Saharan Africa is to recover from the disastrous post-independence era, it needs to co-ordinate its efforts and find common interests - whether breaking down internal trade barriers or tackling shared concerns, such as the continent's external debt burden and the need to promote Africa's cause in a more competitive world than greeted newly independent states some three decades ago. Apartheid's end opens up the prospect of a Pretoria-Abuja axis, linking sub-Saharan Africa's two heavyweights, able to play such a co-ordinating role: putting life into the Organisation of African Unity or presenting Africa's case at the United Nations. Yesterday's effective deposing of Chief Ernest Shonekan, a former businessman who was attempting to revive a lapsed economic reform programme, is likely to prove not only a setback to Nigeria's prospects for democracy and growth. As one political crisis follows another, the country's economy declines further. The northern partner in Africa's potential axis is becoming an increasingly enfeebled giant, governed by generals from the ranks of a corrupt, politicised army. Mr Shonekan, who was forced to resign, did not enjoy a legitimate claim to be head of state. If any one can make that claim it is Chief Moshood Abiola, victor of the annulled presidential poll last June. Yet even that process was a dubious exercise in democracy. Would-be presidential candidates were banned, and only two government created parties were permitted to campaign. But the army's decision to abort the poll and extend Chief Shonekan's term in office had less to do with democracy than a reluctance to surrender power. Although General Ibrahim Babangida, who seized office in 1985, stood down, Gen Abacha took his place, albeit in the background. He now has to explain why he has taken centre stage. He has no viable new economic strategy to offer, for there is no alternative to the one pursued by Chief Shonekan. If Gen Abacha proclaims that he is at heart a democrat, President F W de Klerk and Mr Nelson Mandela have shown there are better ways of demonstrating it. Only when Nigeria takes South Africa's route can their potential partnership become a reality.</p>

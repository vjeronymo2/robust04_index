			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: TransTec profits warning Profits dipped sharply during the first half at Trans-Tec, the West Midlands specialist engineering group, and Mr Geoffrey Robinson, chairman, warned that second-half results would not match last year's. The announcement yesterday set off a fall of more than 19 per cent in TransTec's shares. The shares lost 13p to 54p, valuing the company at Pounds 51.7m. The 46 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 5.58m to Pounds 3m checked the fast profits growth that has taken place since the company emerged from Central &amp; Sherwood, the engineering group controlled in the late 1980s by Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Robinson promised in the second half a 'significant improvement over the first half' but he added that, 'given the acute downturn in what has historically been our most profitable segment', it was unlikely to match the second half of last year. The most profitable segment has been the control and manufacturing technology division. Although its turnover rose to Pounds 31.23m from Pounds 21.56m, it turned in a Pounds 41,000 loss against profits of Pounds 3.2m. TransTec attributed the profits decline to 'an absence of new orders from the aerospace sector' and heavy development costs on new products to be introduced in the second half. Mr Robinson said the dearth of orders from aerospace customers became apparent in March. The interim figures were salvaged to some extent by the increase in profits of the automotive division, the problem area of 1993. Pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 3.13 from Pounds 1.42m. Group turnover of Pounds 94.18m compared with Pounds 64.96m. Operating profits declined to Pounds 3.72m from Pounds 6.05m. On earnings per share down at 2.5p from 4.5p, TransTec maintains its interim dividend at 1.3p.</p>

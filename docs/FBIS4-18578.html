			<p>BFN     [Text] High-ranking officials of the Albanian Government  with responsibility for energy issues had talks with the  Greek-Russian company Promitheas Gas in Athens on the sale of  natural gas to the neighboring country.    Heading the Albanian delegation was K. Meksi, bother of the  Albanian prime minister. The meeting aimed at specifying the  conditions for the supply of natural gas following the initial  signing of a protocol between the Albanian Government and  Promitheas Gas in November 1991.    According to a statement by the Greek-Russian company,  Albania is particularly interested in developing the natural gas  market as soon as possible. The supply of natural gas to the  neighboring state will be achieved with the construction of a  pipeline that will go through the area of Ptolemais, thus  allowing for the supply of natural gas to the western Greek  region. For the construction of the pipeline, a study is  already underway with the support of the European Union through  the PHARE [Poland-Hungary Assistance for the Reconstruction of  the Economy] program.    According to reports, Albania is interested in the supply of  1 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year to resume  operations of fertilizer factories in southern Albania that  today are idle due to a lack of raw materials.    As is known, Promitheas Gas was founded by the Russian  company VEP Gasexport, the largest exporter of natural gas in  the world, and the group of companies of Kopelouzou Brothers,  which has the exclusive rights for the sale of natural gas that  transits through Greece to third countries.</p>

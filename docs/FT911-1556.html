			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Britannia buys Crusader life and pensions side Britannia Life, the Glasgow-based subsidiary of Britannia Building Society, yesterday agreed the purchase of the individual life and pensions business of Crusader Insurance, a UK subsidiary of the US insurance group, Cigna Corporation, writes Richard Lapper. Britannia aims to expand its market share of both new business and total funds under management. According to Mr Andrew Scobbie, the managing director of Britannia Life, the purchase 'trebles our funds under management to over Pounds 1bn and will provide very real prospects of achieving very considerable benefits from economies of scale.' Britannia, the ninth largest building society, recently acquired the Mornington Building Society and is keen to expand in the insurance field. It is understood that Cigna will receive a sum well in excess of Pounds 20m, allowing it to pump more resources into its core employee benefits activities. Cigna is aiming to build its share of the rapidly growing health care insurance market, which is currently around 5 per cent and will retain Crusader's employee risk benefits and health care operations. Last year Crusader Life, wrote annual premium income of about Pounds 75m.</p>

			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Upbeat Bayer forecasts 20% profits advance Bayer, the chemicals and drugs group, yesterday brightened the German results season with a confident forecast of profits up to 20 per cent higher in the current year. Mr Manfred Schneider, chairman, said the board had been surprised by the strength of the recent recovery. Sales and earnings had been rising since October, he said. Turnover had increased 6.5 per cent to almost DM7bn (Dollars 4.2bn) in the first two months of the current year, and operating earnings had improved considerably. This followed a 6 per cent rise in sales and an 18 per cent surge in pre-tax earnings in the final quarter of 1993, he said. Mr Schneider credited the group's restructuring and cost-cutting measures with most of the advance, although better exchange rates and the North American recovery had helped. On the debit side, business had continued shrinking in Germany, although sales were down only 1 per cent after two months, compared with a slump of more than 10 per cent in the same period of 1993. A domestic recovery was not expected before the second half of the year, he added. Prices remained 'absolutely unsatisfactory', and he saw little prospect of increases this year. Forecasting a pre-tax earnings increase of between 15 and 20 per cent after last year's record low of DM1.14bn, Mr Schneider said most of the gains would be achieved 'mainly by our own strength'. Further strengthening measures were to follow restructuring and rationalisation, which had reduced fixed costs by DM1.5bn in the past three years. More marketing power and other synergies were expected from the impending merger of the consumer and self-medication products divisions. Bayer had set itself the goal of ending losses in its textile dyes business this year. All manufacturers were faced with the question of whether Europe was the right place to make such products, he said. Plant protection, another problem sector, was also on the list for treatment. The recent merger of Hoechst and Schering's activities in this field was a 'first step', Mr Schneider noted. He gave the spin-off of the fibres businesses into Bayer Faser, with reduced payroll costs and manufacturing capacity, as one example of action designed to foster a lasting turnround in a business which had been losing money 'for years and years'. The group had reduced its payroll by 4,500 last year, and a further 2,100 jobs were to be lost in the current period - all in Germany.</p>

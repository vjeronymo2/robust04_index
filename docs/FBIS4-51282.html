			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Yugoslav Federal  Republic today ruled out the possibility of Joining the NATO  proposed Partnership for Peace program.    Speaking at a press conference here today, Radoje Kontic,  the  prime minister of the Federal Republic, said that his country  maintains a foreign policy of independence, and will not seek  any tie with NATO.    He also said that the country will not join any other  military alliance either.    This is the first time the government of the Yugoslav  Federal  Republic rules out the possibility of joining the NATO  Partnership for Peace program.    Kontic also said that his government supports all peace  proposals that treat the three warring sides in Bosnia on an  equal foot, and respect the interests of the people of all sides.    He also said that any peace proposal should include the  lifting, or at least the reducing, of the current economic  sanctions against his country.    "To continue maintaining the sanctions is to encourage the  Muslims to continue the war," he said, adding that the sanctions  are against humanitarian principles and are damaging the image  of the United Nations.    The sanctions are not only bringing tremendous losses to the  economy of Yugoslavia, but also to its neighboring countries, he  said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Israel agrees in principle to join the UN's  peacekeeping forces. Our political correspondent Shlomo Raz  reports this has been decided in a session chaired by Deputy  Foreign Minister Beilin on a UN request that Israel send a  Medical Corp unit to Angola. Later this week Deputy Minister  Beilin will meet UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali for  discussing the location to which the IDF's [Israel Defense  Forces] representatives are to be sent. The place will be one of  the conflict ridden areas in Africa. Our correspondent notes  that Israel prefers to send soldiers to areas in which it has  strategic interests, such as the Horn of Africa.</p>

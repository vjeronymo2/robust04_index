			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Vigorous defence of MPs' allowance MPs FROM both sides of the Commons yesterday jumped to the defence of their office cost allowances, attacking press reports suggesting the payments were just an extension of their Pounds 31,000 salaries, David Owen writes. Mr Chris Mullin, Labour MP for Sunderland South, called on the government to state that the standard of service provided by MPs was at issue. Many MPs subsidised office costs 'from our own pocket' in the interests of giving constituents quality service, he said. He was supported by Mr John Cunningham, shadow leader of the Commons, who said the 'more misleading' newspaper reports about the allowances paid to MPs should be 'set aside'. Ms Edwina Currie, MP for Derbyshire South, said it was 'disgraceful' for some newspapers to suggest that MPs who employed family members as secretaries should do so on an unpaid basis.</p>

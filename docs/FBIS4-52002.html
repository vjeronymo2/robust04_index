			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Nguyen Phu Trong: "The Party's Role and </F> Leadership Methods Under Present Conditions"]    [Text] One of the issues under discussion at the midterm  national party conference was the need to renovate and revamp  the party. To be more specific, from the very beginning of the  drive to contribute suggestions to the draft political report to  be presented to the conference, party committee echelons,  cadres, party members, scientists, and veteran cadres already  expressed their views on this issue. They all aired heartfelt  and many-sided opinions, thus reflecting their deep concern for  this decisive and important task.    The conference ascertained that party leadership is an issue  of principled character and constitutes the most decisive factor  guaranteeing success for our country's national development  based on socialist orientations. This concept is also one of  the most important lessons drawn from implementing the reform  process over the past many years. As our country shifts to a  market- oriented economy, implements democratization to benefit  society, and broadens relations with the outside world, there is  a greater need to strengthen and renovate the party's  leadership. We renovate the party's leadership but do not  distance ourselves from those issues of principled character or  negate past achievements. We renovate the party's leadership  through rational policies and steps, taking into account  dialectical and many-sided relations. The practical experiences  drawn from a number of countries in the world indicate that just  a little bit of faltering faith and lax leadership by the  Communist Party will instantly create loopholes for hostile and  opposition forces to move forward to disintegrate the party  leadership system, seize power, and shift the country to a  different path. As far as our country is concerned, the  Communist Party of Vietnam [CPV] is the only ruling party. This  is a mandate of history. The party itself has undergone a  protracted and arduous struggle full of challenges and  sacrifices. The administration and achievements we have today  are brought about by tens of thousands of outstanding sons and  daughters of the party and people who have lost their lives. As  far as Vietnam is concerned, our party's leadership is an  objective requirement and a necessary condition for guaranteeing  social order and political stability for the cause of national  construction and development.    Being the ruling party that directs society in shifting to  the market-oriented economy and given the current complicated  international situation, the CPV realizes very clearly its honor  and responsibility toward the country and people. In its  capacity as a ruling party, our party exerts leadership over and  consolidates the administration to make it firm and strong. It  also directs society and takes responsibility before the country  and people. As a ruling party, the party represents not only  the interests of the working class, but also fights for the  interests of laborers as a whole and becomes the vanguard  political brigade of the entire nation. Let us pose the  following question: Over the past 60 years or more, who has led  the people through the ups and downs of an arduous struggle and  sacrificed everything for national independence and freedom as  well as for the people's well-being and happiness? Today, who  has worked night and day on ways to help the country overcome  challenges, firmly safeguard national independence and  sovereignty, make the people rich and the nation powerful, bring  about justice and civilization in society, and reduce poverty in  urban and rural areas? It is crystal clear that nobody other  than the CPV by following the Marxist-Leninist path and Uncle  Ho's ideology has constantly worked and made sacrifices for the  country and people.    Under present conditions, the party's leadership role is  reflected through the formulation of national development  orientations and goals aimed at bringing about prosperity for  the nation and people. Based on the aforementioned orientations  and goals, the party directs the overall political and social  systems, first of all the state apparatus, in materializing at  all costs set goals and tasks. It also directs work aimed at  institutionalizing and legalizing party resolutions, planning  and organizing the mechanisms, training and managing cadres,  overseeing the implementation of party policies and lines, and  reviewing experiences drawn from real life situations and  supplementing or perfecting policies and lines.... All of the  aforementioned tasks have but a single objective, namely  guaranteeing correct political orientations for national  construction and development.    In the economic area, we must ensure that there are  political characteristics in the development of our economy to  ensure that the economy enjoys both a high development rate and  productivity with an increasing production force, and that it  moves correctly in the socialist direction to limit injustice  and exploitation and protects the interests of laborers. This  must be manifested not only at the central management level, but  also in each party cell. Each party installation and every  cadre and party member is responsible for a thorough  understanding of the party's political direction in the  all-around socioeconomic activities. This is a function that  cannot be done by anybody else.    The paramount responsibility of party committees at all  levels is to lead, control, and strive for efficient  implementation of party lines and policies to ensure that the  activities of all economic sectors and social organizations are  in line with the socialist direction. Party committees, primary  party organizations, and party members in joint ventures and  private business are responsible for leading the people and  public organizations in bringing party resolutions and state  laws into life. They must protect the legitimate rights and  interests of workers and laborers. Any party committee or party  organ which does not fulfill these tasks is not correctly  carrying out its functions and duties.    After several years of reform process, our party's  leadership  and working attitude, from the central to grassroots levels,  have improved greatly in the direction of becoming more  democratic, principled, attached to the grassroots, and  practical. They have ensured both a close and efficient party  leadership and have also developed the positive role of state  organs and mass organizations. However, we must admit that the  management quality and operational efficiency of many party  committees are not on par with requirements in the new  situation. Their organizational mechanism is still heavy,  bulky, and overlapping and they are slow to improve their  management and working attitude. Many places, especially in the  grassroots, are having difficulties differentiating the  functions and duties of the party from the government. In  addition to the tendency to heighten the party role to cover  everything, there is also a tendency to lighten and lessen the  party role.    In the current situation, renovating the party's leadership  role means that it must correctly carry out its leading role at  the same time as efforts to strongly develop the role of state  organs, economic units, and mass organizations. The party  committees must not cover and perform the administration  management and coordination tasks.    The party's leadership over the government is to make sure  that our government is a government of the people, by the  people, and for the people and to make it strong and efficient  in which it will actively operate in accordance with the  functions and authorities outlined by law, correctly implement  the party line and conception, and closely associate with the  public. A socialist government is basically different from a  bourgeois government to the point that the former is not the  boss standing above and dominating the people. It is the highest  organ under the leadership of the Communist Party to represent  the right to mastery of the people, who fundamentally consist of  workers, peasants, and intellectuals.    The leadership of the party does not mean that the party  will  substitute for the government in performing state management and  executing administration work, or on behalf of the people to  exert a mastery role over the government. The party is there to  develop all creative public potential and educate and organize  the people to build their own government and to use that  government to transform society and engage the country in the  socialist construction undertaking. The party and state  guarantee and implement the people's right to mastery and to  work for the public interest according to their functions and  methods.    At present, there are conspiracies to divide the party and  state, as well as oppose the party and state against the public  in order to eliminate the party leadership, overthrow the  government, and annihilate our socialist regime. We must  heighten our vigilance against these conspiracies.    We cannot separate or oppose the party and state, nor can we  identify the party with the state. The party leads the state  and the political system, but, at the same time, it is a part of  the political system and a member of the Fatherland Front. The  party provides guidance for forming the Constitution and the  law, and at the same time it operates in conformity with the  Constitution and the law. Party cadres and members are not  above the law and they do not work outside the bounds of the law.    The party leads other organizations in the political system  not only by its lines, but also in organizational structure  under the principle of democratic centralism and the principle  of collective leadership and individual responsibility. The  party exerts its leadership through the party organization --  not through individual party members -- by collective decisions  and by keeping watch, providing guidance, and checking to  encourage the good and correct wrongdoings. The party provides  concrete guidance, but it does not get into the details of  official duties and it does not issue orders. It leads by  democratic methods, not by totalitarianism and arbitrariness.    The party also needs to renovate the content of its  activities and working method to become more democratic,  disciplined, and active. It must reduce the number of meetings  to intensify its control work, mingle at the grass roots, and  stay close to the masses.    Party members are deployed in state organs, economic units,  and mass organizations to work according to the party's platform  and lines and by the principle of democratic centralism. They  must implement party resolutions in an exemplary way, strictly  observe state law, and regularly motivate and persuade the  public to follow suit.    The party mechanism also needs to improve to make it lighter  and more active, efficient, and suitable to the new management  structure. This can be carried out satisfactorily only when it  is done carefully on the basis of reviewing all organizational  models and further concretizing the management method in each  level, sector, and different form of grassroots organization.  This should be done only after careful study and calculation to  avoid unsound "separation" and "integration," which causes waste  and chaos.    With a thorough understanding of the reform principle and  direction outlined by the seventh national party congress and  the midterm national party conference, and the active and  uniform execution of measures to renovate and reorganize the  party, we will definitely enhance the leadership role and  fighting power of the entire party, thus meeting the goal of  reforms and the expectations of the public.</p>

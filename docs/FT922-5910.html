			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philip Morris launches Dollars 3bn share buy-back programme PHILIP Morris, the US tobacco and food group, yesterday announced an additional share buy-back programme which would allow it to purchase up to Dollars 3bn of shares over a two-year period. The company still has available more than half its existing Dollars 2bn facility, launched in November. Together, the two programmes would allow the company to buy up to Dollars 4.1bn of additional stock. Philip Morris has strong cash-flows from its highly profitable tobacco operations. In the past, it has diverted some of this money into diversification, building up a large food and beverage business, and subsequently paying down debts taken on to finance the acquisitions. However, the company has also used spare cash to buy back shares. On Wall Street yesterday, Philip Morris shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 74 3/4.</p>

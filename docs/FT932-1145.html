			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Kymmene halves losses with productivity boost KYMMENE, the Finnish forestry group, halved losses after financial items to FM164m (Dollars 29m) in the first four months, with productivity gains and cost-cutting helping to offset the continuing market depression. The result, which compares with a FM337m loss in the same 1992 period, was achieved on a sales increase to FM5.41bn from FM4.35bn. Operating profits rose to FM547m from FM172m. Despite the improvement, the company still lags its big domestic rivals, Repola, Enso-Gutzeit and Metsa-Serla, which have all recently reported a return to the black for the same period. Kymmene said its recovery had been slowed by the prominence of printing and writing papers in its product range - where prices remain particularly depressed - and the large proportion of its output emanating from France and Germany, which have strong currencies. Like its competitors, Kymmene has benefited from the weaker markka for sales from Finnish mills, but the depreciation pushed up its financial costs for the period to FM658m from FM470m. Market conditions remain tough, but the company is expecting price rises for some products - such as coated magazine paper and newsprint - towards the end of the year. Its result should also benefit from falling interest rates and a plan to lop a further FM500m off annual costs. The group expects seasonal factors to lead to a worsening of its result in the second four months, before sales and earnings pick up again later in the year. Internal measures to improve earnings were proceeding as planned and falling interest rates would reduce financing costs in the coming months, the company said.</p>

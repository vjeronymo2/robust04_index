			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Yun He: "New Sectors Opened to Lure Foreign Investment"] </F>   [Text] China announced new policies last week to lure  foreign investment into such sectors as foreign trade, retail  sales transportation, financial services civil aviation, real  estate and information services.    Some of the sectors, such as civil aviation, are becoming  open for the first time, said a government official who asked  not to be identified.    Also under the new policies, foreign trade will be partially  opened to foreign investors, the official said.    Overseas companies can launch joint ventures with local  partners in bonded areas in China, he said. He declined to give  further details.    The official disclosed that the government is considering  setting up a Sino-foreign civil aviation joint venture company  as a trial programme to enhance competitiveness of the domestic  civil aviation industry on the world market.    The new policies will also open different parts of China's  transportation network to foreign investors. Such things as  expressways, railways, motor vehicle transportation centres and  wharfs will be opened.    The country will drum up foreign investment to set up plants  to manufacture passenger railway coaches and launch restaurants  and motor vehicle maintenance shops along highways.    The official also disclosed that one to two supermarkets can  be set up with foreign investment in each of the major cities  and special economic zones, including Shanghai, Beijing,  Tianjin, Dalian, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou,  Xiamen and Hainan.    The retail stores, however, must be joint ventures including  Chinese partners. No wholly foreign-owned supermarkets will be  allowed, he said.    The government will limit these joint ventures to retail  sales only and they are not allowed to carry out whole sale  business, he added.    To develop the financial and tourism sectors, foreign  companies are now allowed to set up banking institutions in some  coastal cities and build some tourism facilities in  State-approved tourist spots across the country; the official  did not specify which coastal cities would be opened in this way.    In the real estate sector, he said, foreign investment will  be encouraged to help develop large parcels of land.    Overseas capital will not only be allowed in residential  construction but also in the building of key facilities  involving transportation, telecommunications and water supply  systems.    Foreign-funded real estate projects, however, will be  required to undergo a thorough examination by the government.    Other fields opened under the new policies for foreign  investment include leasing, accounting, advertising, information  consultancy, engineering, industrial designing, and schools and  training centres.    The government has managed to guarantee sufficient funds to  domestic enterprises for setting up key joint ventures projects  -- mainly industrial, infrastructural and agricultural ones --  with foreign partners.    In the first five months of this year, China approved 20,230  foreign-invested projects. The pledged foreign input was $32.7  billion.    By the end of last year, the country cumulatively had  approved more than 180,000 foreign-funded ventures with $224  billion worth of pledged foreign capital, making China the top  haven for international capital investment.    A senior government official said China will remain a major  magnet for international investment due to its high-powered  technical and industrial bases.    In addition, he said, China's vast territory, natural  resources and cheap labour force are also attractive.</p>

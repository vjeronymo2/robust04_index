			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Northern Ireland - Disturbing the peace of Ulster's 'Gold Coast': A four-way battle with crucial implications amid the golf courses of the North Down seat THE NORTH DOWN con-stituency in Northern Ireland is like no other in the province. Here is the 'Gold Coast' commuter belt of Northern Ireland, where a dozen golf courses and the ubiquitous two-car garages, horse-boxes and boat-trailers define the lifestyle of the business executives and senior civil servants who run the province. The buzz of lawnmowers and chatter of birdsong are all that are likely to intrude upon the silence, not the blast of Semtex or bursts of gunfire - even though the Falls and Shankill roads of Belfast are just 15 minutes' drive away. But North Down is about to become the most hotly contested seat in the Northern Ireland general election campaign. Mr Jim Kilfedder, an independent Unionist and MP for 22 years, is defending a 3,900 majority against a three-pronged assault - from another Unionist, the Conservative party and the non-sectarian Alliance Party. The nationalist SDLP does not normally stand in North Down, as it has little local support. This is one of only four Ulster seats it is not fighting. The outcome will have little influence on the overall election result, but could have a crucial bearing on the future of Northern Ireland politics. The campaign is not being fought on tax cuts or government spending. All the candidates agree it is being fought over the future form of government for Northern Ireland. The Conservative party is for the first time mounting a concerted challenge to the Unionists, fielding candidates in 11 of the province's 17 constituencies. North Down, which would be a 'natural' Tory seat anywhere in England, is where they stand the most chance of success. Mr Laurence Kennedy, the Conservative candidate and the party's leader in the province, says: 'Unionism and nationalism is responsible for so much that has gone wrong in Northern Ireland.' But all is not well in the Tory camp - the Conservative government, through the Anglo-Irish agreement, is committed to an eventual devolved government in Ulster; the Northern Ireland Conservatives are not. 'Conservative policy on Northern Ireland is very non-specific,' says Mr Kennedy. 'We want the province governed in a similar way to the rest of the UK, with stronger local authorities and more attention paid to Northern Ireland at Westminster.' Local authorities in Ulster 'currently only have powers to supervise rubbish collection, playgrounds and to bury the dead'. Greater powers, he says, will create the opportunity for the minority nationalists to exercise greater influence. Mr Kennedy is disappointed that Mr Peter Brooke, the Northern Ireland secretary, 'has not come out and said that people here should join and support the Conservatives'. It is doubtful that any senior ministers will be showing the flag in North Down during the campaign. This weakness in Mr Kennedy's campaign is being exploited by his opponents. Mr Kilfedder claims that more than 80 prominent Tory figures have written to him declaring their support. In the event of a hung parliament, there is no doubt where his allegiance will lie: 'I will be voting with John Major.' Mr Kilfedder's crypto-conservatism is exploited by traditional Unionists. For the first time since he won his seat in 1970, he is being challenged by a Unionist - Mr Denny Vitty of the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist Party. Mr Vitty describes both Mr Kennedy and Mr Kilfedder as 'wolves in sheep's clothing'. He says: 'They cannot stand on both sides of the fence. They cannot be true Unionists as well as Conservatives.' His campaign will focus on the Unionist goal of ending the Anglo-Irish agreement. 'We will use the opportunity of a hung parliament to negotiate from a position of strength,' he says.' He believes that the maverick Mr Kilfedder, who split from the Ulster Unionist Party in the mid 1970s over his refusal to take the whip on a range of policy issues, will not win hard-core Unionist support. He is confident that the 5,000 new voters in the Protestant middle-class and working-class housing estates that have sprung up in North Down in the past five years will vote for back him. Mr Addie Morrow, the Alliance candidate, hopes the divisions in the Conservative and Unionist ranks and the failure of either tradition to resolve Ulster's problems will create space for his party with its liberal, non-sectarian profile, to win its first Westminster seat. 'If we can achieve a breakthrough it will change the whole face of Northern Ireland,' he says. His party stands for a devolved administration in Ulster and power-sharing between the two communities. Whether an independent such as Mr Kilfedder can rely on his personal popularity to survive remains to be seen. At his seaside home in Bangor a portrait of Queen Victoria hangs on one wall. Framed pictures of the British and Irish parliaments hang on opposing walls in another room. Contemplating the multiple challenge to his seat, Mr Kilfedder looks out at the small harbour in front of his house and laments he does not have time to go boating. 'I don't even play golf,' he confesses.</p>

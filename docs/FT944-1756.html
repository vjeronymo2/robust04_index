			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Adams firm on weapons: Sinn Fein leader urges all-party talks on demilitarisation Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, appeared last night to harden his stance on the issue of decommissioning IRA weapons. He said the issue would not be resolved in bilateral meetings between the government and his party. On the eve of a second session of exploratory talks in Belfast between the two sides, at which the issue of guns and explosives is likely to be raised again, he said the process of demilitarisation could be addressed once the talks moved to all-inclusive dialogue involving all the parties. Mr Major has insisted that the IRA must give up its weapons before Sinn Fein can enter full negotiations on the future of Ulster. The Irish Republic's government is anxious not to let the issue delay the peace process. Mr John Bruton, the new prime minister, said yesterday: 'It is important to resolve this, not to get into a stand-off about it.' Mr Adams said the existence of all armed groups, including the army and loyalists, needed to be resolved by an effective demilitarisation process as part of the overall settlement. Meanwhile, the republic's new coalition government was yesterday embroiled in an immediate controversy after Mr Albert Reynolds, the outgoing prime minister, revealed details of confidential negotiations between London and Dublin on the Northern Ireland peace process. His comments drew criticism from the UK government, unionist MPs and politicians in the republic. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, expressed surprise that Mr Reynolds should breach the confidentiality of the negotiations and said it would 'make things difficult for both sides'. Mr Reynolds, interviewed on BBC Radio at the weekend, said London had agreed that Dublin should have a role in future all-Ireland institutions covering areas such as tourism and transport - a move northern unionists believe is a step towards a united Ireland. The former Irish prime minister, forced to resign over a judicial appointment scandal last month, said an all-Ireland body would have executive powers and be drawn from representatives in Dublin and a future parliament in Northern Ireland. Mr Reynolds said substantive talks involving British ministers and Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, should begin now and troops should be taken off the streets. He said Downing Street's precondition that weapons be handed in or destroyed could seriously threaten the ceasefire. Mr Reynolds said the all-Ireland body was among proposals in a new framework document which London and Dublin hoped would form the basis for all-party talks on the province's future. The document is due to be published early next year and is expected to be discussed when Mr Major meets Mr Bruton next week.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c)(5) proposes to require the establishment of records of employee complaints of building-related illnesses as part of the written program. These records are believed to be necessary to expedite review and evaluation of the system and to support implementation and operation of an adequate IAQ program [Exs. 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;444b, 3&hyph;502].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency believes that effective system operation and maintenance will necessarily rely upon written information and records such as those relating to design expectations, system capacities, code requirements, maintenance activities and system evaluations. As with other OSHA rulemakings, the written compliance plan is to be accessible to employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Compliance Program Implementation: Paragraph (d)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph proposes to require that the employer take certain actions to maintain acceptable indoor air quality. These actions primarily address means that OSHA believes necessary to achieve continued adequate and proper functioning of building systems [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;17, 3&hyph;26, 3&hyph;38, 3&hyph;41, 3&hyph;55, 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;85, 3&hyph;329, 3&hyph;364, 3&hyph;412, 3&hyph;415, 3&hyph;434, 3&hyph;436, 3&hyph;444A, 3&hyph;479, 3&hyph;496, 3&hyph;500, 3&hyph;501, 3&hyph;502, 3&hyph;505, 3&hyph;507, 3&hyph;529, 3&hyph;531].  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(1) proposes to require that employers maintain and operate the HVAC system to provide at least the minimum outdoor air ventilation rate, based on actual occupancy, required by the applicable building code, mechanical code, or ventilation code in effect at the time the facility was constructed, renovated, or remodelled, whichever was most recent [Ex. 3&hyph;18]. Paragraph (d)(2) proposes to require employers to conduct building system inspection and necessary maintenance activities as often as necessary to reduce the likelihood of indoor air quality problems related to the building systems [Ex. 3&hyph;26]. Further requirements under paragraph (d) are: Assure that the HVAC system is operable during all work shifts, (d)(3) [Exs. 3&hyph;56, 3&hyph;226, 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;436]; implement the use of general or local ventilation where maintenance activities may result in hazardous chemical or particulate exposures in other areas of the building, (d)(4) [Exs. 3&hyph;347, 3&hyph;502]; maintain relative humidity below 60% in buildings with mechanical cooling systems, (d)(5) [Exs. 3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;61, 3&hyph;505B]; during regular maintenance, as described in subparagraph (d)(1), measure carbon dioxide levels. When they exceed 800 ppm, check to make sure the HVAC system is operating as it should and correct deficiencies if necessary, (d)(6) [Exs. 3&hyph;10, 3&hyph;34, 3&hyph;214]; assure that buildings without mechanical ventilation are maintained so that windows, doors, vents, etc., designed or used for natural ventilation are in operable condition, (d)(7); assure that mechanical equipment rooms and any non-ducted air plenums or chases are maintained in a clean condition, free of hazardous substances, and asbestos, if friable, is encapsulated or removed so that it does not enter the air distribution system, (d)(8) [Exs. 3&hyph;29, 3&hyph;500]; assure that inspections and maintenance of the HVAC system are performed by or under the direction of the designated person, (d)(9) [Ex. 3&hyph;29]; establish a record of HVAC system inspections and maintenance, (d)(10) [Ex. 3&hyph;26]; assure that employees performing work on HVAC systems are provided with and use appropriate personal protective equipment, (d)(11) [Ex. 3&hyph;56]; evaluate the need to perform alterations of the HVAC system in response to employee reports of building-related illness, (d)(12); and take such remedial measures as the evaluation shows to be necessary, (d)(13).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA believes that implementation of each of the actions prescribed in this proposed paragraph are integral elements in the indoor air quality program. Provisions which address inspection, maintenance, alteration, and operation of building systems are believed to be essential to ensure successful functioning of system functioning.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(1) proposes to require that employers operate and maintain the HVAC system to provide at least the minimum outside air ventilation rate. Available evidence in the literature supports this requirement. The literature which supports the case for ventilation with outside air falls into two categories. One category includes case studies which are generated when IAQ complaints require on-site responses and the investigators report their findings through IAQ forums sponsored by professional organizations like the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. and the American Industrial Hygiene Association. These studies report that the lack of outside ventilation air resulting from operational or maintenance deficiencies as one of the causes of IAQ complaints. Many of the studies include abatement recommendations to ventilate with outside air as feasible per the original design intent. The second category includes research projects which also support the case for ventilating buildings with at least the recommended minimum of outside air. Research in the areas of ventilation efficiency, tracer gas analysis, dilution/removal of internally generated contaminants, and environmental perceptions mostly support this contention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All three major building codes in the United States which are used in the design of new and retrofitted facilities mandate minimum outside air ventilation rates in mechanically-ventilated buildings. These three code bodies include the Building Officials and Code Administrators International, Inc. (BOCA), the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO), and the Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI). Per Section 102 of the 1991 Uniform Building Code as promulgated by the ICBO, the purpose of the building code is ``to offer minimum standards to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the design, construction, quality of materials, use and occupancy *&blank;*&blank;*''. Clearly, there is a significant commitment of resources by these code bodies to offer design guidance through the building codes to designers to insure that a facility is capable of delivering a minimum amount of outside air to its' occupants. This concept is supported by the efforts of plan reviewers and building inspectors in local governmental jurisdictions throughout the United States who ensure that facilities are constructed per the building codes. Considering the up-front efforts of these code officials, designers, and construction teams, it is reasonable from a standpoint of continuity, to require that buildings be operated and maintained to the same design intent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This provision is not meant to require rebuilding or retrofitting HVAC systems in response to minor work. For example, such steps would not be required for any renovation work that does not modify the building's configuration or the conditions that would be affected by the building code applicable at the time the system was installed or last modified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

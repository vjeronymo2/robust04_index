DPA learned this today on the sidelines of Defense  Minister Volker Ruehe's visit to the Slovak Army in Bratislava.  He stressed that, because of the bad financial situation, the  strength of the German armed forces can "by no means" be kept at  the level of 370,000 men, as agreed between Chancellor Helmut  Kohl and the former Soviet State President Mikhail Gorbachev at  their meeting in the Caucasus.    In the future, the Bundeswehr's personnel might consist of  about 200,000 in the army, approximately 80,000 in the air  force, and 20,000 in the navy. At the "Munich Conference for  Security Policy" last weekend [5-6 February], clear differences  of opinion emerged between Kohl and Ruehe over the future  strength of the German armed forces. Contrary to his former  attitude, Kohl insisted on 370,000 soldiers. This was  interpreted as efforts "designed not to lose any votes" in  election year, despite the tight financial situation.    Ruehe demonstratively refrained from mentioning figures, and  he smiled meaningfully at the chancellor's statements. Recently  the minister has stressed that he does not think much of the  "ongoing speculations about figures." However, when he  presented his ideas last week as to how he wants to handle  further cuts in the defense budget involving 1.25 billion German  marks, he made it clear that the Bundeswehr will not have  370,000 men by the end of this year, as originally planned, but  at most about 345,000.    Rudolf Scharping, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD], explained in Munich that there are "not really  any serious differences" between his party and the government on  foreign and security issues. At the SPD congress last autumn,  the SPD spoke in favor of a Bundeswehr of 300,000 men.</p>

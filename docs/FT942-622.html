			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: BellSouth may not take up option on QVC stake BellSouth, the Baby Bell telephone company, is unlikely to exercise an option to buy a stake in QVC Network, the television home shopping channel, a BellSouth executive confirmed yesterday. Ms Nancey Humphries, director of investor relations, made the remark at a technology conference organised by Bear Stearns, the New York investment bank. Separately, Mr Barry Diller, who heads QVC, said after the company's annual meeting that 'one would assume' BellSouth would not exercise its option to buy Dollars 500m of QVC shares at Dollars 60 a share. The deal was part of QVC's financing of its unsuccessful Dollars 10bn bid for Paramount Communications, the film and publishing group, and was seen as a way for BellSouth to get a toehold in the entertainment business. At the time of the agreement, QVC's stock was trading at over Dollars 50 but it has been below Dollars 40 since April. Mr Diller said QVC could be expected to seek expansion opportunities beyond electronic retailing, including possibly into production of fiction and non-fiction programming. Speaking later, he said the company's basic television shopping service had restored double-digit sales growth after a five-month slowdown.</p>

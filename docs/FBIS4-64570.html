			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has  expressed pleasure at the "overwhelming approval" by the  European Parliament of the entry of Austria, Sweden, Finland,  and Norway into the European Union [EU]. A further great and  important step toward the enlargement of the EU has been taken,  Kinkel said in Bonn on Wednesday [3 May]. Kinkel said he is  confident that the last hurdles will also now be overcome and  that the referenda and ratification processes in the individual  states will be brought to a brisk and positive conclusion.  Kinkel stressed that the Federal Government will do everything  to ensure the treaties of accession were ratified in good time  in Germany, so that the four European Free Trade Association  states will become equal members of the EU on 1 January next  year.</p>

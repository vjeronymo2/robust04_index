			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REAGAN  </P> <P> As the current occupant of the White House scours the country for qualified  Republicans who can stand FBI checks, his predecessor continues to make  headlines. Ronald Reagan, never one to lie awake worrying about ethics, will  receive $2 million for a speaking tour in Japan. We have become accustomed to  seeing Japan Inc. buying up our stocks and real estate, so why not  ex-Presidents? Japan became the world's leading lender during Reagan's term,  while the U.S. became the leading debtor. Talk about a golden parachute!  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a movement is afoot to place the Gipper's likeness on Mount  Rushmore. Never mind that this national monument might have been sold if Reagan  and (former Interior Secretary James) Watt had their way; let's be big about  this. Let them put up a cardboard cutout of the Great Communicator. A  two-dimensional representation would be most fitting -- and it would be easy to  remove once the voters realize how easily they were conned for eight years.  </P> <P> W.

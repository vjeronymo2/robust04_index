Ero Pavilainen, a resident of the northern Russian city of  Petrozavodsk, served in early 60's in a military unit near the  town of Pechenga, close to the Norwegian border. He told the  Petrozavodsk-based newspaper ``NORTHERN COURIER'' on Friday that  he and other soldiers had unloaded numerous railway cars with  bombs with mustard gas.    ``These were the Soviet chemical weapons accumulated since  the (World) War (Two). They were delivered by trains from  various military units of the Soviet Union and dumped in the  Arctic Ocean,'' Pavilainen was quoted as saying.    The newspaper added that measurements taken by experts in  certain parts of the White Sea showed that the water and soil  there are contaminated and unsuitable for living organisms.    It added that the secret burial places of chemical weapons  may be the reason for a high mortality rate, especially among  newborns, registered in several settlement along the coast.</p>

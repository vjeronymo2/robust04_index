			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Azlan shares fall sharply to 128p Shares in Azlan Group, a distributor of advanced computer networking products which came to the market in November at 230p, fell sharply again yesterday. The shares, which have fallen from a peak of 281p in June, shed a further 32p yesterday in thin trading to close at 128p. The company did not issue a statement, but there were market rumours that a large institutional investor had become disenchanted with high technology new issues in general and had decided to sell. The collapse in the group's share price began in June after the company issued a warning that profits in the first half of the current year would not match those of last year.</p>

			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Arts: String quartet with a French connection - Chamber music In addition to being this country's most intensely communicative and impassioned string quartet, the Lindsay Quartet have proved themselves capital festival-creators. This gift was first revealed in Sheffield, where for 10 years they have been holding a spring chamber-music festival; more recently it has been further developed at the London Wigmore Hall, where their week-long series-packages have provided the annual autumnal season-launching.  (The Lindsay's 1987 Haydn festival still shines particularly bright in the memory of all who took their share of it.) The theme of this year's programme (September 25 - October 2, with lunch hour as well as evening events) is one of their most ambitious yet. It weaves a web of Anglo-French connections and contrasts, placing side by side chamber-music masterpieces from both sides of the Channel and new works similarly commissioned, and sharing performance duties with a roster of French and English chamber-musician 'friends'. This celebration of the entente cordiale was intended to coincide with the opening of the Channel Tunnel - but as the Lindsay first violin, Peter Cropper, rather plaintively remarks in a programme-book introduction, 'We cannot help it if we are on time]' Saturday's opening concert outlined the festival's basic programme pattern. Franck's mighty Piano Quintet (with Jean-Francois as imaginative, invigorating pianist) supplied the second-half masterwork. Britten's Third Quartet and Dutilleux's Ainsi la nuit, both written in the same year (1976), provided first-half experiences full in themselves and perhaps just a little fuller for being closely juxtaposed. Britten's great tribute to his admired compositional confrere Shostakovich - a farewell to life and to composition which is at the same time a gloriously unfettered glance into the future - seemed newly enlarged in stature when placed alongside Dutilleux's exquisite but eventually rather enervated re-discovery of Bartokian and Webernian nerve ends. To all these works the Lindsay brought the musicianly energy and ebullience, the passion for facing challenges and surmounting hurdles, that is theirs alone. Though Mr Cropper's intonation showed itself more regularly reliable than is sometimes the case, the quality of the ensemble-playing was never exactly fine-grained - but it was unfailingly exhilarating. The concert began with two brand-new musical squibs, both short and rather damp: a 'God Save the Queen' meditation by a Frenchman (Jean-Francois Zygel) and a Marseillaise one by an Englishman (Christopher Brown). Since the festival promises substantial amounts of much more enticing-looking new music, I shall return to it later this week. Wigmore Hall, London W1. Festival sponsored by Studio B in co-production with CREA-Nantes</p>

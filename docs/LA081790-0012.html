			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY URGED TO CONSIDER 2 ALTERNATE COURTHOUSE SITES;  </P> <P> DEVELOPMENT: COUNCILMAN ERNANI BERNARDI SAYS TWO VACANT BUILDINGS IN HIS  DISTRICT MIGHT BE BETTER OPTIONS THAN THE PROPOSED CHATSWORTH LOCATION.  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi proposed Thursday that instead of  moving ahead with plans to build a municipal courthouse in Chatsworth, the  Board of Supervisors should consider using an abandoned hospital in Lake View  Terrace or a former department store in Panorama City.  </P> <P> Bernardi's suggestions came two days after county supervisors voted 3 to 1 to  move ahead with plans for the courthouse in Chatsworth, despite intense  opposition from local residents who say the plan will bring traffic and noise  to the residential community.  </P> <P> In a letter to Supervisor Mike Antonovich, Bernardi said either of the two  sites in his district should be considered as an alternative to the Chatsworth  site or as supplemental court facilities.  </P> <P> Neither site is in the West Valley area, however, which is where officials have  said the new courthouse space is needed.  </P> <P> "It may be a long shot, but they're having a lot of problems in Chatsworth and  maybe we can offer them a site," Bernardi said.  </P> <P> He added that the Lake View Terrace site has good freeway access and bus  service, making it a convenient alternative to a West Valley site.  </P> <P> One of the proposed sites is the former Lake View Medical Center in Lake View  Terrace, which includes 14 acres of land and three buildings.  </P> <P> The property was seriously considered at one time as a home for a Phoenix House  drug rehabilitation center for which former First Lady Nancy Reagan has raised  millions of dollars.  </P> <P> The second site is a former Robinson's Department Store, a three-story building  at the corner of Chase Street and Van Nuys Boulevard in Panorama City.  </P></p>

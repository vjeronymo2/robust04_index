Will a deficit of nearly seven billion francs in 1993 be the  figure which will balance the financial statement of the Groupe  Air France on the next 31 December? It is still too early to say  so with certainty but this is the figure which kept circulating  at the outcome of the meeting held in Paris on 17 November 1993  by the company's Board of Directors. This new figure is due  partly to a complete stoppage at Air France last October (to the  tune of about one billion francs, not counting the strike's  impact on customer loyalty), and partly to the traditional drop  in air travel at this time of year: Traffic for the first ten  months of 1993 only grew by 0.3 percent compared to the same  period in 1992.    To recover some dynamism for inadequate business, the  company  launched an extraordinary series of promotional "incentive"  rates to some 25 destinations, which interested parties can take  advantage of, under certain conditions of course. For his part,  the new CEO was determined to create a new post of deputy  director general for business, which went to Jean-Claude  Baumgarten, a longtime company man.    The second general meeting for negotiations between  management and the company's 14 unions was held on 22 November  1993. In terms of social measures, next year should see 900  "natural" retirements and 1100 departures due to negotiated  early retirements. The Management Committee is scheduled to meet  on 7 December, one week before the third general meeting which  is expected to address the (delicate) question of overstaffing,  which according to our colleague at L'HUMANITE represents at  least 2000 jobs.</p>

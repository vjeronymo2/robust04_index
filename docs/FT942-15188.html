			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / UK Company News: The lure of a blank sheet - The introduction of a new accounting guideline A growing number of British companies are starting to take advantage of a rather unusual new accounting guideline: one that leaves them with a blank sheet in their annual report to fill as they see fit. It is called the Operating and Financial Review, and it represents a radical departure for the UK Accounting Standards Board from the normally prescriptive standards it has produced in the last three years. The idea is to give the accounts back to the management, allowing companies to describe and explain their financial position in a balanced way rarely seen in the generally bland and upbeat statements currently provided by chairmen and senior executives in annual reports. 'They should put the flesh on the bones of the accounts,' says the board's Mr Simon Peerless. 'Accounts are a complex technical statement for the specialist. The OFR should be what makes them mean something to a wider audience.' There is undoubtedly a need to help the less sophisticated reader. Mr Stuart Valentine, director of research for ProShare, the wider share ownership promotion body, says: 'The annual report is such a forbidding document. It is not easy to understand. Most people don't do more than glance at it.' Since 1980, the US Securities and Exchange Commission has required public companies to produce a management discussion and analysis (MD&amp;A) with its annual filings. But the statements are highly prescriptive, and often produce little more than a restatement of figures and ratios readily available from the accounts. By contrast, the ASB, which first issued draft guidelines on the OFR in April 1992, has tried to avoid a legalistic framework. It allows companies to be as free as they choose in their descriptions. 'It's interpretation, not the blindingly obvious, that we're after,' says Mr David Tweedie, the ASB's chairman. According to an analysis earlier this year by Company Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of company accounts, 62 of the FT-SE 100 companies already have some form of financial review. Among the better examples are British Airways, Tomkins and Thorn EMI. However, in the majority of cases, reviews tend to be short, rarely discuss the difficulties with the business, and neglect important issues. For example, only 40 per cent mentioned cash flow, a vital topic and one now served with a new accounting standard. One of the better examples of companies adopting the OFR so far is Bass, the brewing, hotels and leisure group. In the 1993 accounts it covers 8 pages, illustrated with graphs, describing each of the divisions, pensions, interest, tax, foreign currencies and exchange rates, treasury policy and capital structure, cash and assets. Mr John Booth, financial controller, says the OFR was modelled on the company's MD&amp;A, but with a freer format. 'There has never been anything to stop companies publishing this kind of information, but in the past financial reviews have largely been PR statements. One of the benefits of the OFR is that it almost forces you to bring out some of the negatives.' One institutional investor says of the Bass report: 'It has a crispness and clarity and it is financially focused. It shares management's intentions with shareholders and shows where investment is focused.' He says it fulfils his aims in an OFR, which are to gain an understanding of the company and its position in its markets, and future development and investment plans. The statement can prove the basis for better discussions at meetings with the company. Investors point more sadly to the latest accounts of Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate. There are glossy colour pictures in abundance, but the text is rather more sparse and uninformative. Mr Martin Taylor, a vice chairman of the company, says: 'The OFR is a suggestion, it is not mandatory. We are very happy with what we disclose. Our filings with the SEC are 60 to 70 pages long. Those who are interested can get copies.' One problem with the OFR is what to do if companies refuse to comply. In the US, the SEC takes a tough line, often sending back accounts to be rewritten and threatening penalties. In April 1992, it reached a legal settlement with Caterpillar for failing to disclose in its management discussion that one-quarter of 1989 profits were non-recurring. The UK shows no signs of attempting any similar enforcement. Although the ASB produced the guidelines, it believes the OFR is not part of the statutory accounts over which it has jurisdiction. There is little sign that the Stock Exchange or the Department of Trade and Industry would intervene. The hope is that companies will act responsibly, although for every good example of an OFR, judging by the US experience, there are other instances of businesses which have clearly manipulated the intention. An academic survey published last year suggested that while US companies were good at describing historical events, few provided forecasts and projections that were useful and accurate. When the directors made projections, they tended to ignore or incompletely report those that were negative. There is one remaining difficulty: the audience for the OFR. Mr Booth at Bass admits that he is not sure to whom the text should be addressed. A survey last year of readers of its annual report found few private shareholders got beyond the chairman's statement. Despite the emphasis on the less well trained investor, it seems that analysts and institutional investors - who are supposedly better equipped to read the accounts - may be the most likely beneficiaries.</p>

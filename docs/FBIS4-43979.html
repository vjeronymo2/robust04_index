			<p>BFN     [Text] The TRNC [Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]  Council of Ministers has expressed concern that any move by  Greece during the EU [European Union] summit in Corfu to push  the issue of the Greek Cypriot side becoming a European Union  member may have adverse effects on the negotiation process in  Cyprus. The Council of Ministers met today under Prime Minister  Hakki Atun and discussed various issues, including the latest  developments in the Cyprus problem. Foreign and Defense  Minister Atay Ahmet Rasit informed the correspondents while the  meeting was still in progress that the Council of Ministers had  assessed the developments that may take place on the Cyprus  problem during the EU summit in Corfu. He said the following:    [Begin Rasit recording] The TRNC Council of Ministers feels  there is a need to issue a statement on the 24 June EU summit on  Corfu. The statement is as follows:    We are worried that the furthering of the issue of the Greek  Cypriot side becoming a full EU member during the EU summit may  have adverse effects on the negotiations process in Cyprus. The  Greek Cypriot side does not represent the legitimate government  of the whole of Cyprus, nor can it act on behalf of the Turkish  Cypriot people. The treaty oaf 1960 clearly stipulates that  Cyprus cannot be a part of international organizations in which  Turkey and Greece, which are the guarantor powers of Cyprus, are  not members. The Turkish Cypriot people's separate consent is  required for Cyprus to become an EU member. That fact is  outlined in UN documents. The Turkish Cypriot people are  opposed to Cyprus becoming a member of the EU, in which Greece  is a member and Turkey is not. Such a development, which can be  interpreted as enosis [union with Greece], will have negative  effects on the negotiation process.    Considering the continuing talks on the confidence-building  measures in Cyprus, the intensive effort that has been made to  further the Greek Cypriot side's application to become a full EU  member conflicts with the initiatives that have been made to  establish mutual confidence on the island. The Turkish Cypriot  side has done its utmost with regard to the confidence-building  measures. It is prepared to sign the agreement on the  confidence-building measures if the points that were agreed upon  in Vienna some time ago are included in it. It has the  political will for that purpose.

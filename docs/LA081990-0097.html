			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PRICE DROP DRIVES AWAY RECYCLERS OF NEWSPAPERS;  </P> <P> GLUT: THE SUPPLY OF NEWSPRINT MUSHROOMED AS CURBSIDE RECYCLING BECAME POPULAR.  BUT INDUSTRY DEMAND FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN VERY HIGH.  </P> <P> The price paid for recycled newspapers has plunged in recent years and may drop  further before rebounding, according to the author of a state report on  newspaper recycling due out Thursday.  </P> <P> As a result, many community groups that recycled newspapers as fund raisers  have quit. Even the Boy Scouts have dropped out. The last of the troops in the  Western Los Angeles County Council of the Boy Scouts, which includes the San  Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, quit recycling papers earlier this year.  </P> <P> "The newspapers are paying $5 a ton," said Karen Judisch, who works with the  council. "To try and get that amount and be scoutmaster or cubmaster using all  that gas, it just isn't worth it. It's really a shame."  </P> <P> A telephone survey of recycling centers in the San Fernando Valley found that  those still accepting papers paid about $10 a ton, or a half-cent per pound.  Three years ago, centers were paying between $20 and $40 per ton.  </P> <P> The price of recycled newsprint dropped during the second quarter of 1990,  after remaining stable through the previous three quarters, according to the  recycling report prepared by the California Integrated Waste Management Board,  the agency recently created to bring about a statewide reduction in the amount  of waste going to landfills.  </P> <P> The supply of used newsprint has mushroomed as curbside recycling programs have  proliferated, industry officials note. At the same time, publishers have failed  to switch to using recycled newsprint, and demand from other industrial  consumers has dropped.  </P> <P> The soft market is old news to area recyclers and paper companies. Bob Fagan,  president of Sun Valley Paper Stock, a Sunland firm that buys old newspapers  from recycling centers and sells it to paper mills in Asia, said the price of  "super-clean" recycled newsprint has dropped from $127 a ton a year ago to $30  a ton today.  </P> <P> The result locally is that some recyclers have stopped accepting newspaper.  Marv Saidner of San Fernando Recycling in Pacoima said his firm stopped taking  newspapers four years ago. Now, he said, he concentrates on recycling aluminum  cans and California redemption containers.  </P> <P> Other area recycling companies still accept papers, but no longer pay for them.  "We essentially lose money on it," said Dave Sanders, branch accountant for  Burbank Recycling, which stopped paying for newsprint over a year ago. The cost  of transporting the paper to processing factories is greater than the amount  his company receives for the product, Sanders said.  </P> <P> Those companies that absorb the cost of accepting old newsprint said they do so  primarily to keep their customers bringing in other recyclable goods that  remain profitable. "We do it more for customer service," said Ron Schweitzer,  president of Mobile Recycling, a regional firm that accepts a variety of  recyclable products. "Our whole business philosophy is to be a one-stop  recycling center. It's sort of a form of advertising."  </P> <P> A major factor that may cause the excess supply of recycled newspaper to grow  even more is a new state law requiring cities to reduce significantly the  amount of trash they dump in landfills over the next decade, said Brian Foran,  associate waste management specialist for the waste board and the author of the  state report.  </P> <P> But another new statute designed to strengthen demand for used newsprint may  cause prices to eventually rebound. That law requires commercial printers to  use at least 25% recycled newsprint as of Jan. 1, 1991, and at least 50% by  Jan. 1, 2000. Increased demand for recycled paper may also come from mills  planned for construction that process used newsprint.  </P> <P> "Within three years, I'm sure the markets are going to be real healthy," Foran  said.  </P></p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia halts joint venturers' exports THE RUSSIAN authorities have effectively suspended all exports of oil by foreign joint ventures in a fresh blow to the credibility of the country's efforts to attract foreign investment to its ailing energy sector. A western executive who declined to be identified said that Transneft, the state-owned organisation that manages Russia's oil pipeline network, had excluded all joint ventures from its monthly schedule for pipeline access since the beginning of June. Mr Lev Vainberg, head of the Association of Joint Ventures, told a news conference that he had written to Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, asking him to reverse what he described as an illegal decision. An official at the Fuel and Energy Ministry said that the decision had been taken by the first deputy minister but that he did not know the reasons for it. Other officials at both the ministry and Transneft were yesterday said to be unavailable to take telephone calls. The move deprives joint ventures, companies jointly owned by Russian and foreign partners, of their ability to generate hard currency to recoup their investment and their share of profits. 'Cutting out revenues creates a lot of instability in the business environment,' said the western executive. 'The Russians are shooting themselves in the foot.' Mr Vainberg said a number of foreign companies were considering legal action against Transneft and the Fuel and Energy Ministry and that some had already appealed to their governments to intervene in their support. Earlier in the day Mr Yuri Petrov, head of a vaguely defined state conglomerate set up to attract investment, chided foreign companies for not rushing to help Russia rebuild priority industries including its energy sector. What he failed to mention was the need to avoid arbitrary and discouraging treatment of foreign companies already trying to invest in Russia. This latest unexplained move follows another decision earlier this year, subsequently reversed, to deny export licences to some of the joint ventures entitled to export oil. Other western companies are upset about the government's failure to implement an exemption from an export tax granted almost a year ago.</p>

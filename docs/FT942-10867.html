			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / No welcome for observers in Hebron After little more than an hour into their peace mission to the West Bank town of Hebron, 117 international observers, dressed in bright white uniforms, floppy caps and pinafores, got an immediate taste of the problems that lie ahead in this flashpoint of Arab-Jewish violence. The observers, from Italy, Denmark and Norway, sheltered from Palestinian stone - throwers and Israeli soldiers firing teargas. They are on a three-month mission in an effort to reduce tensions between the Palestinians and armed Jewish settlers in the wake of the mosque massacre on February 25 of 29 Palestinian worshippers by a Jewish fanatic. The observers were caught in the middle of an explosion of violence as angry Palestinian youths shouting 'settlers out' stoned Israeli buses and soldiers responded firing tear-gas in the main street. The observers looked on helplessly, wiping their eyes from the stinging gas. All the observers are unarmed and under the protection of the Israeli forces. Palestinians laughed and jeered as the observers scuttled for shelter and turned their cars around from trouble spots. Some shopkeepers offered them broken onions to ease the effects of the teargas which wafted through the air. 'This is an unexpected welcome but we are prepared for our mission,' said one Italian observer. Unwelcome by Israel, which reluctantly agreed to the deployment, the observers also seem to have little goodwill from Palestinians. Many Arab residents in Hebron, which has been in a state of tension and under curfew since the massacre, said they did not expect the observers to bring much of a change in their lives. 'This is not a solution to our problems,' said Mr Abdel Kareem Yaghour. 'We don't want international people to interfere with our lives. Thousands of Moslems are being killed in Bosnia, Somalia and the rest of the world and international people do nothing. Look, these men don't even have guns. What will they do against the settlers and the army?' Calming hatred between the 110,000 Arabs who live in Hebron and the 5,000 Jewish settlers will not be easy. Most settlers live in nearby Kiryat Arba but 450 live in the heart of the biblical town which is sacred to both Moslem and Jew.</p>

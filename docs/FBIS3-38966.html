It is important in that connection that the United States  and  Russia become more involved in the peace negotiations.  Washington seems ready to play a more prominent role in this  connection, said Claes. He did not wish to make any statement  about Moscow's attitude.    Claes said he was aware of the risk posed by military  action,  also with respect to the UN troops on the ground. We need  military advice to keep the risk to a minimum. However, there  comes a point in time when one can no longer remain an onlooker,  but must take action, said Claes. Supposedly, even Butrus-Ghali  considers that the situation has now gone "too far," otherwise  he would not have requested NATO to send in the air force.    According to Claes, it is virtually definite that the  murderous attack on Saturday [5 February] was the work of the  Serbs. There is little doubt about that, but we are not  absolutely certain, said the minister. However, this lack of  absolute certainty does nothing to alter the attitude of the EU.  It must be clear to everyone that this kind of atrocity is  inadmissible.    From the statements made by Claes it was clear that European  negotiator Lord David Owen was not in favor of imposing an  ultimatum on the Serbs.    At a separate press conference, Lord Owen said that the  Serbs  would never agree to withdraw from Sarajevo if there was a  chance that the Muslims would seize the opportunity to reconquer  the liberated territory. Consequently, the Muslims of Sarajevo  would also have to hand in their weapons, said Lord Owen.    Lord Owen also tabled the idea that the EU should pay the  Serbs for withdrawing their troops, for example by easing the  economic sanctions against Serbia. I was certainly not the only  person to reject that idea categorically, said Minister Claes.    The fact that some member states of the EU stil have doubts  about imposing an ultimatum on Serbia is not doing the image of  the EU any good, said Minister Claes. It is now up to NATO to  show its teeth. A harder attitude would not have done the EU any  harm at all, said Minister Claes.</p>

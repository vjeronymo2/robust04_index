			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICE FOR NORIEGA ISN'T IN THE CARDS;  </P> <P> LAW: OLLIE NORTH'S CLOAK OF DISPENSATIONS WOULD FIT THE GENERAL JUST AS WELL.  THE GOVERNMENT CAN'T AFFORD TO TRY HIM -- OR TO LET HIM FREE.  </P> <P> The one country we can be certain Manuel Noriega will not ask to be sent to is  Romania. The new revolutionary government's concept of justice -- secret  "trial," no appeal, quick execution -- is unlikely to appeal to Noriega's sense  of survival.  </P> <P> Like many tyrants of the past, Noriega will be seeking a peaceful and luxurious  retirement. And if history is a guide to the future, he will find some fellow  dictator willing to extend him a professional courtesy. Among the modern  precedents is the hospitality extended to mass murderer Idi Amin by Saudi  Arabia, and the welcome mat rolled out for Nazi war criminals by Paraguay and  Syria. Even civilized countries like the United States and France have given  sanctuary to despots -- like the Shah of Iran, Ferdinand Marcos and Jean-Claude  "Baby Doc" Duvalier, wanted for trial in their own countries.  </P> <P> Administration sources, pointing to Noriega's indictment on drug charges, have  tried to distinguish the case by arguing that he is "a common criminal." But  the Shah, Marcos and Duvalier were also regarded as criminals by their own  people.  </P> <P> The fact that we sent in the U.S. Army to capture Noriega weakens our claim  that he is a "common criminal" as distinguished from a political opponent. He  may well be both. The U.S. government certainly did not regard him as a common  criminal when our CIA worked hand-in-hand with him over a considerable number  of years. We treated him as the powerful political figure he was. He may have  been an s.o.b., but as Franklin Roosevelt once said of another U.S.-supported  Central American dictator: "At least he's our s.o.b."  </P> <P> Manuel Noriega is no longer our s.o.b., but he apparently knows a lot about  other s.o.b.'s with whom we are, and have been, dealing. He also knows about  our CIA operations throughout Central and South America. It is for this reason  that knowledgeable sources are doubting that President Bush really wants him to  be tried in an American court. Under the rules of evidence, Noriega's lawyers  could demand disclosure of highly embarrassing government files. If our  intelligence services refuse to produce those files, the charges against  Noriega might have to be dropped, as several charges were dropped against  Oliver North, John Poindexter and others.  </P> <P> The difference is that the Bush Administration and the Central Intelligence  Agency wanted the charges dropped against North and Poindexter. They used the  cloak of national security as an excuse for helping their friends. Noriega is  nobody's friend. The last thing the Administration wants now is a trial in an  American court that results in a dismissal of charges against him. Our legal  system is based on precedents. The crowning irony would be for the precedent  established in the case of hero Ollie North to be used to free villain Manuel  Noriega.  </P> <P> There were many officials in Washington who were hoping that Noriega would  suffer the fate of Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian dictator executed by his own  army, or of Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the Medellin drug boss killed in a  shootout.  </P> <P> Short of Noriega being killed, the next best outcome for the Administration may  well be the one that is currently playing itself out. The problem is now  squarely in the hands of the Vatican. No one expects us to use gunboat  diplomacy on the nunciature. Our hands are tied. We did the best we could. Or  did we? Is it possible that Noriega's all-too-obvious Vatican option did not  occur to a single Washington official? Could we not have surrounded the  nunciature to prevent Noriega from sneaking in? Or did we really close our eyes  to this possibility?  </P> <P> It's not too late to get our hands on the fugitive who has continued to make a  fool of us. We can simply wait him out. Although international law may forbid  us from physically entering the nunciature and grabbing Noriega, he remains  subject to capture as soon as he tries to leave. Cars, helicopters and  airplanes -- even those bearing the seal of the Vatican -- are not the  "territory" of the Vatican as the nunciature is. If the Vatican were to decide  to allow Noriega to seek asylum in Cuba or some other country, we need not  allow him safe passage.  </P> <P> Remember that not so long ago, we forcibly stopped an Egyptian aircraft  carrying terrorists and made it land in Italy, where the terrorists were  apprehended. We could do the same with Noriega. But there are many who believe  that we will not do everything in our legal, diplomatic and military power to  see to it that Noriega is brought to trial in a America. courtroom.  </P> <P> As a Noriega lawyer put it to me: "They know that the case of the United States  vs. Manuel Noriega would really turn out to be the case of Manuel Noriega vs.  the CIA, Ronald Reagan and George Bush."  </P></p>

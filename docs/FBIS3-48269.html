			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Majuro, Jan 25 (AFP) -- Top Marshall Islands  government officials have criticised what they say is the  failure of the United States to release information about the  effects of its nuclear test program here. Officials said they  believed the lack of data had led to inadequate compensation  being paid to Marshall Islanders.    In the wake of US Department of Energy (DOE) admissions that  US citizens were used as unwitting guinea pigs for nuclear  experiments, Foreign Minister Tom Kijiner said Monday that the  United States had failed to release full information about its  nuclear test program in the Marshalls. His comments followed a  recent medical study confirming that the Marshalls had a rate of  thyroid tumours dramatically higher than in other parts of the  world.    The study indicated health problems were not confined to the  atolls of Rongelap, Utirik, Bikini and Enewetak, which the  United States said were the only radiation-exposed areas in the  Marshalls.    During the early 1980s, Marshall Islands negotiators sought  detailed information about the 66 announced nuclear tests,  Kijiner said in an interview.    "But US officials told us there was no further information  to  provide to us," he said, adding that the US statements had  proved to be false. "The United States wasn't fair to the  Marshall Islands during the negotiations (of a treaty known as  the Compact of Free Association between the two nations)."    Last month, the DOE released previously classified  information about the size of a majority of its nuclear tests in  the Marshalls, information Kijiner said the Marshalls first  requested more than a year ago.    The foreign minister said the United States released only  selected information during the negotiations on the Compact of  Free Association so that nuclear compensation would be minimised.    Marshall Islanders had brought lawsuits in US courts seeking  about five billion US dollars in compensation for damages from  the nuclear tests.    The United States provided a 150 million dollar trust fund  to  yield about 270 million dollars over 15 years in the compact  that was negotiated in the late 1970s and early 1980s.    Marshalls Washington ambassador, Wilfred Kendall, said here  that the matter of US compensation "needs to be revisited."    He concurred with Kijiner, saying that "all the details  (about the nuclear tests) were not on the table during the  negotiations."    Their contention is supported by a leading US congressman,  California Democrat George Miller who is chairman of the House  Committee on Natural Resources.    In a letter to US President Bill Clinton earlier this month,  Miller wrote: "This committee has long been concerned that the  entire story of the testing done in the Marshalls Islands has  not yet been told and that the health and well-being of a  significant number of Marshallese may depend on a look at all  the facts."    Miller said some Rongelap islanders, who were engulfed in a  cloud of radiation from a 1954 hydrogen bomb test at Bikini,  have charged that they were used as guinea pigs to further US  understanding of the effects of radiation.    "In the light of the recent disclosures regarding actual  radiation experimentation in the United States during this  period, that possibility cannot be ignored," he wrote.    He called on the Clinton administration to declassify  information on the nuclear test program in the Marshalls.</p>

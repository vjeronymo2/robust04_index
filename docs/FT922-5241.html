			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Arts: Glittering history in Portman Square - Architecture Patronage is a thing to celebrate and the flags are up in London's Portman Square to mark 20 years of remarkable achievement of London's Heinz Gallery. It was in May 1972 that the Queen opened the Heinz Gallery of the Royal Institute of British Architects. This generous gift to England from Mr and Mrs Henry J. Heinz II has been responsible for the rejuvenation of interest in architectural history, drawings and models in a way that has been quite extraordinary. Brilliant curatorship and the encouragement of young architectural historians have kept the Heinz at the forefront of both knowledge and exhibitions. It is only the visible tip of the iceberg of one of the world's richest collections of architectural drawings. To celebrate its twentieth birthday the Heinz gallery is showing a miscellany of recent acquisitions in a lively and enthralling display. It is a pleasure to enter the darkened room that Alan Irvine designed for the Heinz Gallery - there are two reasons. First it is like going into a richly stocked and glittering shop of architectural drawings and models - sadly none of them is for sale. Second, the gallery itself, which normally plays a subservient role to the collection, can now be seen to have been a very successful, elegant and calm setting for a diversity of exhibition displays. When Alan Irvine, of the architects Buzas and Irvine, designed it he was much influenced by the work of the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. I think it is that sense of Italian style that has given the Heinz a lasting elegance - something that is quite rare in London galleries. The current exhibition is an enjoyable miscellany that reveals the discernment which has always marked the acquisition policy of the RIBA Drawings Collection. It is a catholic policy that wisely takes an inclusive historian's view and tries, perhaps not entirely consciously, to avoid the divisive polemics which have polarised the recent architectural debate. Modern architects will have their place in history and it is right that stylistic considerations should sometimes take a back seat. The quality of the recent acquisitions remains remarkably high despite the virtual non-existence of any RIBA purchasing budget. The collection has always been fortunate in its donors and the long tenure of the first curator, Mr John Harris, certainly brought about a complete change in the value of architectural drawings, both aesthetically and financially. Rich gifts continue to enhance the collection and the donation of some 150 drawings by Joseph Bonomi (1739-1808), who was invited to England by the Adam brothers, is one of the most generous recent examples. It is possible to see in the exhibition his drawings for Roseneath, the great house outside Glasgow, now demolished. Another eighteenth century practitioner who has been added to the collection is Giacomo Leoni (c1686-1746) in the form of an album of drawings for a London house in Arlington Street. His importance as the publisher of the first edition of Palladio's 'Works' cannot be underestimated. I enjoyed seeing the lovely drawings for the grotto at Oatlands by Stephen Wright and the drawing by Isaac Ware (who died in 1766) of an unexecuted design for Westminster Bridge. The design model by CR Cockerell (1788-1863) of Langton House in Dorset is a poignant reminder of another great house that has been demolished. George Gilbert Scott is well represented in the collection and the addition of the drawings for Kelham Hall are both important and interesting examples of his domestic work. The nineteenth century was a rich period for presentation drawings and a dense output of material from the leading architects has posed major cataloguing problems for the collection. Models too can impose storage problems but they are important and much enjoyed by the public. How sad, for example, that all that remains of the City of London's glorious cast-iron Coal Exchange is the architect's model. The twentieth century is almost over and the collection and this exhibition shows both the strengths and weaknesses of the period. Lutyens's sketchbook for Munstead Wood, on long-term loan from the Lutyens family, is an enticing hint of the development that was to come of his early twentieth century country houses. Sketches so often reveal more than the finished drawings and this particular sketch book has a freshness and humour and cosiness that is enchanting. Cosy is not a word to be applied to the work of Erno Goldfinger - the refugee who brought some of the Bauhaus tradition to England and left behind in London the Trellick Tower in North Kensington (where the architect lived for two weeks to show how wonderful life was in a tower block as long as you could retreat to Hampstead) and London's Elephant and Castle development for the London County Council. The work of Tecton is shown in the exhibition by their drawings that showed how prefabricated houses could be treated with a variety of facades - an exercise carried out for Peterlee New Town in 1949. Patrick Gwynne shines out as an interesting and neglected modern architect with his Blackheath houses that stand as modest beacons of successful new house design of the 1960s. It is time to cheer for the Heinz Gallery and all its works and to hope that its original and stimulating approach to architecture and architectural history will long continue in Portman Square. The current celebratory exhibition continues until June 13 at the Heinz Gallery, 21 Portman Square, London W1.</p>

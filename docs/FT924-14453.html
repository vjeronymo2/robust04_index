			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Three-dimensional photos snapped up Artists through the ages have experimented with various ways of representing depth in space. At the recent Photokina exhibition in Cologne Kodak unveiled its own attempt to tackle three-dimensional representation, writes Michiyo Nakamoto. Kodak's depth-imaging technology uses track-mounted 35mm cameras with electronic shutters to capture images from several perspectives. Up to 24 exposures on conventional film can be used to fashion one three-dimensional image. The film is processed normally and then scanned digitally. The information is rearranged pixel by pixel into a single image, and then transferred to a Kodak light valve technology film recorder. A transparent optical material called a lenticular screen is placed over the picture to 'focus' the image. The result is a three-dimensional picture that gives the illusion of depth without needing special glasses. Kodak believes there are potential applications in professional and commercial photography such as for point-of-sale and cinema displays. Kodak: UK, 0442 61122.</p>

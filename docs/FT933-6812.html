			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Overseas selling may signal end of bull run in gilts THERE were signs yesterday that the bull run in the UK government bond market might be losing momentum. It may have been straws in the wind, but dealers reported overseas selling, particularly from Europe and eastern Asia. They also mentioned switching into German and French government paper. The main slide occurred in maturities longer than 10 years, the area which recently experienced the biggest gains once the market had latched on to the belief that the UK promised economic growth with low inflation. The 8.75 per cent bonds expiring in 2017 fell  5/8 to 114 3/4. Mr John Shepperd, gilts specialist with Yamaichi, the Japanese securities house, said: 'It seems like there has been a bit of a mood change. People had been buying into the dips and now they have started selling into them. There is a feeling that gilts have hit fair value.' Short-dated maturities, which respond to interest rate changes rather than inflation perceptions, held steady ahead of a hoped-for rate cut in Germany tomorrow. Debate over a German rate cut continued to transfix the German debt market while switching and position-taking ahead of an auction today unsettled prices. Investors were selling the most recent 10-year issue to buy bonds issued by the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the sale of former East German companies, because the spread between the two presented an arbitrage opportunity. Also, considerable interest from domestic and international investors ahead of an auction of between DM4bn to DM6bn of four-year Schatz bonds diverted attention. September bund futures traded on Liffe closed at 97.14, marginally lower on the day, even though cost of living figures from Baden-Wurttemberg were in line with forecasts and gave encouragement to economists who have predicted a quarter point cut in the German discount rate to 6.5 per cent. FRENCH 10-year bonds were stronger as investors concerned over the short-term prospects for interest rates switched out of shorter-dated paper. The September Notionnel French government bond future on the Matif was a quarter point firmer at best and ended a net 12 basis points higher. AMONG the high yielders, Spanish bonds shrugged off disappointment that the repo rate was left unchanged at 10.5 per cent as investors, particularly US hedge funds, bought 10-year maturities up to near-record levels. The rise in prices pushed the yield on 10-year paper down to around 9.27 per cent. Mr Jouni Kokko of SG Warburg said 10-year yields had fallen from above 14 per cent since last October and his forecast of 8.8 per cent by the end of the year was already looking conservative. AUSTRALIAN bonds plunged as the currency fell sharply and dealers said uncertainty over the future of the budget, which opposition parties have threatened to block in the Senate, undermined market confidence. The 9.5 per cent Commonwealth bond maturing in August 2003 fell 1 1/2 points and the yield rose 21 basis points to 7.03 per cent. Dealers said investors were principally nervous about the budget's path through parliament, with the opposition parties calling for changes but the currency's slide by one US cent overnight also dampened sentiment. AFTER posting early declines, US Treasury prices rebounded sharply yesterday following a strong afternoon auction of two-year notes. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  3/8 at 100 3/4 , yielding 6.192 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was up  5/32 at 100 23/32 , to yield 3.842 per cent. The market opened in listless fashion for the second consecutive day. Dealers blamed the absence of fresh economic news, and a busy holiday week, for the lack of interest in the market and the low levels of trading activity. The only feature of the morning was some manoeuvring by dealers and investors ahead of the afternoon auction by the Treasury of Dollars 16bn in two-year notes. Analysts said they expected the auction to go reasonably well. In the event, the sale proved even better than expected, and demand for the new issue was especially strong from retail accounts. The success of the sale lifted the market's mood, and sent prices sharply higher across the maturity range.</p>

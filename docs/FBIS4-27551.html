			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Japan and Russia will soon  announce plans to build a disposal plant for liquid nuclear  waste near Vladivostok in the Russian Far East, Foreign Ministry  sources said Thursday [2 June].    The plant, to be funded from a Japanese 70 million dollar  grant for denuclearization, is expected to be completed within  this year, the sources said.    The Japanese Government has agreed in principle to construct  the facility, which would filter radioactive substances from the  liquid waste, on an offshore dock as requested by Moscow.    For lack of storage and treatment facilities the former  Soviet Union and Russia have been dumping hundreds of tons of  nuclear waste in the Sea of Japan and other waters off its  coasts.    The disclosure of the decades-long nuclear dumping has  sparked international protests and strained relations between  Tokyo and Moscow.    Japan last autumn offered to lend Russia a tanker to provide  urgently needed storage capacity, but Moscow later retreated  from the plan and proposed to build the waste disposal plant  instead.    Moscow repeatedly told Japan it would have to resume nuclear  dumping at sea if the plant was not built quickly.    The sources said final approval for the project might still  be held up by apparent differences between Moscow and  Vladivostok authorities about the nature of the plant.</p>

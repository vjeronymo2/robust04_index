I had come to their  home--the former residence of the Chechen-Ingush Obkom [oblast  party committee], where General Dudayev's portrait is now  displayed prominently--twice, but she was unable to talk,  although she did try... The third time, apparently moved by the  feeling that we have to talk somehow--after all, a person has  traveled all the way from Moscow--she rose from a sofa where she  lay lying covered with a plaid blanket and moved to a nearby  chair.    I expected the conversation to go one of two ways: once  engaged in conversation about her husband she may again feel  unwell and I would have to leave again, perhaps for good; or, on  the contrary, reminiscences would perk her up somewhat, distract  her from the continuous self-immolation that had been going on  for many days now. Fortunately, it was the latter--as we talked,  her face regained some color; being a direct and emotional  person, she immersed herself entirely in the world she was  talking about.    [Moroz] Manana, when was the last time you saw Zviad  Konstantinovich?    [Gamsakhurdia] On 24 September. That was the day he left  here. That was our last meeting.    [Moroz] Did you talk on the phone?    [Gamsakhurdia] We talked on the phone every day.    [Moroz] When was your last conversation?    [Gamsakhurdia] When they entered Zugdidi. After that all  communications between us were cut.    [Moroz] Who are "they"?    [Gamsakhurdia] The Tbilisi junta and the Russian paratroops.    [Moroz] What did you talk about? The events in Western  Georgia?    [Gamsakhurdia] No, we did not talk about the events because  the conversations were listened to. He was simply reassuring me:  "Do not worry, Manana, everything will be fine." He still had  hopes that the Russian troops would be withdrawn from Western  Georgia. I kept telling him: "Zviad, you are probably lying to  me. You say everything is going well, but the television says  entirely different things."--"No, Manana, this is not so. I am  right in the thick of events. The people have rebelled. Everyone  is for the president. So do not worry. These Russians will not  be able to hold on here for long." It turned out differently,  though. The Russians together with Mkhedrioni cleared out the  whole of Mingrelia.[end Gamsakhurdia]    I had heard this contention--that the Russian troops,  "Baltin's landing," had been instrumental in the defeat of  Gamsakhurdia's supporters--before I met with Manana Gamsakhurdia  for this interview, from her household. I tried to say something  timidly: The Russian soldiers only provided protection of  railroads and communications, I said--but was mercilessly  ridiculed as a victim of Moscow's propaganda. For this reason,  this time I chose not to argue with Manana.    [Moroz] When did you learn of your husband's death? From  whom?    [Gamsakhurdia] On 4 January. From a person close to us...    [Moroz] How true is this information? Rumors are still  circulating that Gamsakhurdia is alive...    [Gamsakhurdia] You see, I would love to believe this more  than anybody else. I am the closest person to him, and I am  taking it hard... I do not even know how I will survive this  all. But I had to believe it because my acquaintance told me  everything, beginning to end.    [Moroz] You have not seen, of course, the last note your  husband left behind?    [Gamsakhurdia] What note? There was no note. This is all  conjecture.    [Moroz] How did the children take the news of their father's  death?    [Gamsakhurdia] Oh, do not remind me of this! This is the  second tragedy in my family. The younger one tells me: "Mama,  when I get up in the morning I feel as if this is all a  dream..." And the older one... I do not know how he will get  through all this. He stays up all night and cries endlessly. And  talks to him as if he were alive.[end Gamsakhurdia]    Gamsakhurdia's sons--17-year-old and very tall Tsotne, and  15-year-old Georgiy, who looks very much like his father--of  course do not approve of their mother's revelations in a  conversation with a journalist. Their pain and suffering is  their own personal business, something they do not display to  outsiders. But, of course, it would not occur to them to say  even one word of reproach to their mother.    [Moroz] Does the younger one take it easier?    [Gamsakhurdia] The younger one does not let me see his  tears.  So that I will not get upset and start crying, too. I found out  that he goes out into the yard, sits behind the house, and cries  there. The older one cannot help it. He is crying right now. And  will keep crying all night--until 0800, 0900. He is crying and  talking to him: "Zviad, I cannot accept it! Why are you lying  there? Why do I still live?"[end Gamsakhurdia]    Yes, this is inconsolable human grief, an inconsolable human  tragedy. And the devil has prompted me once again, how many  times is it now, to barge in on human grief, human tragedy, with  idle journalistic curiosity. But such are the rules of the game,  such are the rules of the profession. There are moments when the  journalistic profession prompts one to immoral acts. It is a  vicious circle: being a professional, one does immoral things. I  should have thought about this earlier, when I decided to choose  a journalistic career.    "He says such words," Manana continues, referring to the  older son. "He prays endlessly, from morning to night. They took  the Bible and read it together. They beg our Lord to return  their father to them alive--for our father to rise from ashes,  they say, like Lazarus. This is a great tragedy."    [Moroz] Zviad Konstantinovich was a busy man. Did he still  find time to spend with his sons?    [Gamsakhurdia] Time is not important in communication. He  was  like a friend, an older comrade to them. He found time for  them... Sometimes he would come and kiss them late at night,  when they were already asleep. And when he was leaving--oh, my,  how they parted! How they hugged and kissed each other!    [Moroz] Did they not want to go with him?    [Gamsakhurdia] Oh, yes, of course... This is precisely the  point. The older one cries all night: "Why did Zviad not take me  there? I would die next to him! What do I need this life for  without a father, without such a man! Zviad was a holy man for  me."[end Gamsakhurdia]    I talked to both boys. In conversation with a stranger,  Tsotne did not display even a hint of any weakness. He answered  the questions in a measured, somewhat dry manner. Among other  things he said that at this point he does not plan to engage in  political activities. On the other hand, again, this does not  tell of his true intentions--only that he does not intend to  reveal them to every stranger. He is a first-year student at the  University of Chechnya. The Department of Philology, Roman and  German languages--his father's specialty. It was his father who  helped him prepare for the entrance exams last summer. The  younger one, Georgiy, on the contrary, does not hide his career  plans: "They are wrong to think that my father's death brought  everything to an end!"--"Do you understand," I tell him, "what a  dangerous road you want to take?"--"Yes, I do. I am not afraid  to die."--"Do you not have any pity for your mother? Did she not  have enough when your father died?" He is silent, staring in the  air. On the outside, a regular teenager in a denim jacket and  sports woolen cap pulled down over his forehead, edges rolled up  like a loop. It is always shocking when a child, prematurely  grown up, says words that few adults would utter.    [Moroz] Manana, are you not concerned that the boys will  also  get involved in the political struggle now and will be in danger?    [Gamsakhurdia] They already are in danger now. Shevardnadze  is a kind of a man who will stop at nothing.[end Gamsakhurdia]    Still, let us hope for the best. There are still several  years to go. Lately, the world around us has been undergoing a  complete makeover, beyond recognition, in a matter of two to  three years. Who would think that one of the most famous Soviet  dissidents, many times arrested, persecuted, and later elected  president of Georgia by an absolute majority of the vote (87  percent), would end his life by putting a gun to his head in a  God-forsaken mountain village, hounded and surrounded from all  sides, and his family, alone and disconsolate, would be mourning  the irretrievable loss of a loved one in a strange land? Perhaps  in a few years everything will turn around in just as unexpected  and strange way and the sons will not have to repeat the  crusades of their fathers?    [Moroz] Manana, how did you meet? To the best of my  knowledge, you are 10 years younger than your husband.    [Gamsakhurdia] Yes. What brought us together was the  illnesses of our mothers. My mother developed cancer, and I was  looking for a Swiss medication that at the time was not sold in  the Soviet Union. It so happened that Zviad's mother, Miranda  Gamsakhurdia, also had cancer at the time, and I learned  accidentally that they had this medication. I asked whether they  would share it with me. So one day Zviad comes and drops off a  pile like this of packets of the medication. And a whole folder  of materials on how to use it. This is how we met.    [Moroz] Did you have a traditional Georgian family or was it  different from other families?    [Gamsakhurdia] It was a traditional Georgian family. It was  also traditional in the sense that it had long traditions.  Because his mother was a princess, and his father was a prince  as well. As you know, he was a Georgian national writer.    [Moroz] Which period of life was the happiest for you?    [Gamsakhurdia] Which?.. Upon the passage of these 20  years--in October of this year we were to celebrate our 20-year  wedding anniversary--it turns out that all periods were happy  for me. Despite the fact that we were constantly persecuted and  arrested twice. I mean, he was arrested twice. During our life  together. Altogether he had been arrested four times. We went to  internal exile together--Kizlyar Rayon in Dagestan...    [Moroz] Was this a happy period, too?    [Gamsakhurdia] Let me tell you this. It was very difficult  there. Very. We spent 18 months there. Cold and hungry, the KGB  constantly over our heads. He was not permitted to travel more  than 10 kilometers from the designated point of exile. Every  Saturday or Sunday we were visited by people from Neftekumsk who  came to ascertain that he was still there. The conditions were  terrible. In the winter, minus 40 degrees. Monsoon winds. And  intolerable heat in the summer. All sort of insects,  tarantulas... We were very poor. Despite all of this, however, I  was the happiest woman in the world. Because we were together.  Prior to that we had not seen each other for such a long time,  and now we were there. This was 2 August 1979.    [Moroz] That you had a lot of hardship in exile is to be  expected. What about other times--you probably lived quite well?  I mean, in a material sense.    [Gamsakhurdia] I have never been interested in the things  many women are interested in these days--dressing well, shining  at receptions, travelling abroad... I did not travel abroad; I  dressed as our budget permitted. I did not consider this a  misfortune. Or fortune, for that matter. I repeat, I was the  happiest woman in the world because I was next to such a man...    [Moroz] Why did you not take the name of Gamsakhurdia?    [Gamsakhurdia] My surname is Archvadze-Gamsakhurdia. You  see,  in our family there were three sisters--my parents did not have  any sons. When I was still in 10th grade I promised my father I  would keep his name as long as I lived.    [Moroz] Did you discuss political issues with your husband?    [Gamsakhurdia] No, we did not, but our life was such that  whether we wanted it or not, everything revolved around  politics. When a man is persecuted, when they show up at your  house with a search warrant, when you are arrested, exiled, sent  to Lefortovo prison, to a psychiatric ward--what else can you  talk about?    [Moroz] Did your parents try to talk you out of marrying  Gamsakhurdia?    [Gamsakhurdia] My parents had passed away by then. But my  mother knew Zviad before we got married--they became acquainted  after the incident with the medication. She loved Zviad very  much, so naturally she would not have tried to talk me out of  it. As for myself, I knew very well what I was doing. Even  before we got married, whenever he visited me he brought various  anti-Soviet literature published in Moscow. Such as the  CHRONICLES OF CURRENT EVENTS. We reprinted and distributed it. I  think that Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn and Alik Ginzburg  will never forget that Gamsakhurdia was the first person to  distribute the "GULAG Archipelago" in the Soviet Union. When he  was arrested in 1977, the first charge against him was  distributing the "Archipelago." Then later there was publication  of the GOLDEN FLEECE and VESTNIK GRUZII [GEORGIAN HERALD]. I,  too, participated in their distribution.[end Gamsakhurdia]    A year and a half ago in this house, in an adjacent room, in  the office of the head of the house, I spent two hours talking  to Zviad Gamsakhurdia himself. Both then and now I kept, and  keep, thinking that perhaps it would have been better if that  difficult but romantic period of dissident life had lasted as  long as possible? Actually, better for whom? After all, the  world surrounding us has indeed changed for the better. Or at  least it is on the way to such a change. Thanks to dissidents  among others. But dissidents themselves suddenly started feeling  uncomfortable in it. The simplicity of existence is gone: Here  is an anti-people's, inhuman authority we have to fight against  with all we have got. Should it be surprising that few of the  former rebels have been able to adapt to these changes?    [Moroz] You said that all the periods of your life with  Zviad  Gamsakhurdia were happy. Does the period when he became first  Supreme Soviet chairman and then president not stand apart in  some way?    [Gamsakhurdia] It does, and probably for the worse. I was  very upset when I learned that he had become chairman of the  Georgian Supreme Soviet. At the time of his election I was in  the audience. Maybe I had a premonition of what tragedy was in  store for us in the future--I began crying. A journalist came  over to me and asked why I was crying when everyone around me  was jubilant. I said that beginning that day our family was  ruined. Because Zviad took upon himself such a heavy cross to  bear. Had we lived in a normal state, had Georgia not been  occupied by a foreign army, had Georgia been a democratic  independent country, it would have been different. True, when he  became president I was happy because Zviad himself was happy.  Because the absolute majority of the Georgian population  supported him. I believed that now nobody could treat him like  they treated, for instance, the disobedients in Vilnius. It  turned out, though, that they had completely different  intentions. What was in store for us was worse. This is what I  could not anticipate.    [Moroz] Still, you had bad premonitions... Did you not try  to  talk him out of this fight? I mean this time--this last period  of his life.    [Gamsakhurdia] In no way. Never. Because he had chosen this  road since childhood, since he was 15. He was first arrested  when he was 16. I had no moral right to be talking him out of  it. How could I face him with an ultimatum: "You must stop  fighting!"? This means he would have to leave Georgia. I was not  capable of saying such a thing to him because I also love my  motherland. I also wanted Georgia to be free, to separate from  the other republics. And in the end Zviad's dream did come true.  Why should I stand in his way? He took the road of Christ and  the road of freedom. The road of purity and the road of love.    [Moroz] How was your life in Groznyy?    [Gamsakhurdia] Very difficult. Despite all the attention we  were given here. The people came to love Zviad very much.    [Moroz] Did you meet with President Dudayev often?    [Gamsakhurdia] Very often. They were like brothers with  Gamsakhurdia despite different faiths. He is also so upset now!  And his wife visits us almost every day. They do everything  possible to prevent us feeling alone here.    [Moroz] Did you try to talk your husband out of going to  Georgia last September?    [Gamsakhurdia] No. This was the only time he ever deceived  me. Although I would rather not see this word in a newspaper. He  wanted to shield us somehow from this situation, not wanting to  jeopardize the life of his sons. He told me: "Manana, I will go  alone for now, and after some time--very soon--you will come  with the children." I was waiting for that day. Can you imagine?  I was waiting: Maybe he will send someone today, tomorrow... We  talked on the phone, and I kept reminding him: "Zviad, what  about it? Will you keep your word or not?"--"I will, Manana. It  will be very soon." This is how he stalled for time. He knew  everything beforehand and did not want to jeopardize his family.    [Moroz] Do you have any property left in Georgia?    [Gamsakhurdia] We had a house there. It was the house of  Gamsakhurdia's father; we lived there. On 6 January 1992  Ioseliani, Kitovani, and their confederates plundered it, and  then two months later burned it down. So there are only charred  walls left now... And in the summer they even defiled the grave  of Zviad's mother and father.    [Moroz] How are you going to live from now on? Or do you not  think about it right now?    [Gamsakhurdia] I keep thinking about it. How am I to live  now? I have no money. Absolutely. I have no home. My children  are deprived of their motherland. They have nothing. All the  clothes we have on, the Chechens bought for us. We came here  with nothing. I was wearing a housecoat...[end Gamsakhurdia]    When I was preparing for my trip to Groznyy, I was asked to  take with me some money collected by Georgian businessmen living  in Moscow for the Gamsakhurdia family. Many people made pledges.  When I left, however, all I had in my pocket was my per diem  allowance. Businessmen's love is as short-lived as popular love  (this again refers to the 87 percent of vote cast for  Gamsakhurdia at the presidential elections).    [Moroz] Are you planning to return to Georgia?    [Gamsakhurdia] As long as the junta is there--no. As long as  Shevardnadze is there, I will not return.[end Gamsakhurdia]    Fifteen-year-old Georgiy mentioned in his conversation with  me: "Father is buried in a village... I cannot tell you which  village it is."--"Is it not the village reported in the press?"  I inquired, puzzled. "No, a different one."    For several weeks now a tug of war has been going on between  Zviad Gamsakhurdia's family and the authorities. The authorities  insist on conducting a full-scale formal investigation of the  circumstances of the former president's death, with the forensic  expert evaluation required in such cases, autopsy, etc.  Gamsakhurdia's widow is categorically against it. She consents  only to visual identification of the body, after which it is to  be sent to Groznyy. The authorities' logic: A man died under  mysterious circumstances; the law requires that the cause of his  death be ascertained. But there is also another logic: Zviad  Gamsakhurdia died on territory where military operations were in  progress; in essence he died like a soldier, and is there such a  law that requires surrendering the body of a slain soldier to  his enemies? There is no such law. There is, however, a rule  dictated by the norms of humanism--to hand over to relatives the  body of a dead person so that they may dispose of it at their  discretion. This humanistic norm is what Manana Gamsakhurdia is  appealing to. So far, in vain. The Georgia authorities for some  reason staunchly refuse to meet the request of a woman  devastated by grief; the report that official delegations  shuttle from Tbilisi to Groznyy for negotiations while she is  being difficult turn out upon closer look to be ordinary  disinformation (I was a witness to this myself: On Friday  "Ostankino" reported that a delegation from Tbilisi, consisting  of representatives of the authorities and the procuracy, was on  its way to Groznyy; what arrived, however, was a group of  Tbilisi intellectuals, to express condolences to Gamsakhurdia's  widow--that is all, I myself was present at that meeting).    On 16 January, Manana Gamsakhurdia sent a telegram to  Russian  president Boris Yeltsin, to both chambers of the Russian  parliament, the heads of other CIS states, as well as to the  United Nations and the CSCE. She asks them to interfere, to  influence the Tbilisi authorities, to help her to finally get  the body of her husband so she can say a last "goodbye" to him  and bury him in a Christian manner. Can it happen that this  plea, too, will have no effect?</p>

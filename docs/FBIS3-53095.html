The plan includes the right to self-determination for  southern Sudan and a referendum in this connection after the  announcement of a cease-fire among the Sudanese parties to the  conflict. An official Sudanese source told AL-HAYAH in Nairobi  yesterday that the Sudanese Government delegation to the  negotiations is authorized to discuss any issue the SPLM may  raise, except the self-determination issue -- which means that  no progress is likely to occur in the negotiations if they  actually take place between the two sides. [passage omitted]    AL-HAYAH yesterday obtained a copy of the Garang-Mashar plan  for the negotiations, which is entitled "Agenda for the Peace  Talks in Sudan."    The plan says: "We met on 5 and 6 January in separate  meetings in Nairobi with the ministerial committee regarding the  peace talks in Sudan. And we agreed on a joint agenda" for  negotiation with the Sudanese Government.    The plan includes three points:    1. To negotiate a cease-fire among all parties to the  conflict in order to halt all military actions under the  supervision of a neutral team of international observers and to  secure favorable conditions to facilitate humanitarian relief  operations in southern Sudan.    2. The right to self-determination for the people of  southern Sudan, the al-Nubah mountains, and other marginalized  areas. This can be done through a referendum in these areas to  enable the people there to determine their political future by  themselves.    3. To make a temporary arrangement to implement these  measures during the transitional phase that follows the halt to  military actions, until a permanent arrangement is made.    The plan was signed by John Garang and Riak Mashar. It is  the first joint plan between the two men to be presented in the  peace negotiations with the government since the split inside  the movement in 1991. [passage omitted]</p>

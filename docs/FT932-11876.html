			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / International Company News: Lyonnaise in Westburne pledge LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez is in no hurry to sell its 68 per cent voting interest in United Westburne, now that the North American plumbing, heating and electrical goods wholesaler is benefiting from a strengthening US economy, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. 'We have stated our intention to divest, but there is no particular haste,' said Mr Guy de Panafieu, a senior Lyonnaise vice-president, after the United Westburne annual meeting. The Montreal-based wholesaler hopes to become profitable again over the next 18 months. The group operates 21 divisions and 390 branches with 6,000 employees after being restructured to deal with the recession and construction slump. About 25 per cent of annual sales of more than CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.57bn) are made in the US, mainly in California. Mr de Panafieu said it would be logical for the control block in Westburne to be sold to a single shareholder rather than through a wide public distribution. But Lyonnaise would not object to a management buy-out.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Survey of Nigeria (9): True picture distorted / Assessing business profits ALTHOUGH REAL gross domestic product has increased by a third in the past four years, Lagos businessmen say that trading volumes have fallen in many activities, especially consumer goods. It has become progressively harder to make profits in the domestic market, other than by efficiency gains, cost-cutting and poaching market share. In the consumer-goods sector, large companies report a fall in volumes at the top end of the market, but a compensating increase for lower-priced items. Consumers are 'downtrading', switching from detergents to laundry soaps, and from larger to smaller (and cheaper) packages. There is evidence, too, of slackening demand from the packaging industry. Official statistics suggest that, since 1988, private consumer spending has barely kept pace with inflation. Many shoppers have moved downmarket, too, to lower-priced items or into the informal sector. Nevertheless, the pre-tax earnings of publicly-quoted companies have powered ahead, rising 27 per cent last year, after a 29 per cent rise in 1990 and more than 60 per cent in 1989. When deflated by the composite consumer price index, real turnovers have risen 37 per cent over the past seven years, while pre-tax earnings have increased by almost 65 per cent. In fact, a retail price index - especially one heavily weighted with downmarket basic necessities - is no way to measure real business performance. A better yardstick is failure of naira earnings to keep pace with currency depreciation. In 1984, N1m of profits translated into Dollars 1.3m; but, by the end of 1991, the same naira earnings were worth little more than Dollars 100,000. In other words, while the pre-tax profit index rose almost fivefold to 494 by 1991, when converted into US dollars, the index actually halved over the period. Both turnover expansion and profit growth slowed during 1991, reflecting the fall in inflation in 1990-91 and tougher business conditions. Turnover was up 32 per cent last year, down from 37 per cent in 1990 but still well ahead of the trend rate for the past seven years of 22 per cent. Profit growth slowed slightly, from 28.7 to 26.7 per cent, but this, too, stayed just ahead of the trend growth rate of 25.6 per cent. Margins (pre-tax earnings as a percentage of turnover) narrowed to 11.9 per cent during 1991, dipping below the eight-year average of 12.5 per cent. For most large businesses, access to foreign currency remains the key to profitability. Over the past year, profits have been squeezed by the combination of consumer resistance on the one hand and rising costs of imported inputs on the other. Although, the official rate for the naira depreciated only modestly during 1991 - from 12.4 US cents to 10.6, a fall of about 15 per cent - the real cost of foreign exchange rose sharply. This was because companies were unable to get much more than 10 to 20 per cent of their foreign currency requirements from the official (first tier) market. Instead, they had to buy their foreign exchange at various different premia from literally dozens of banks. The naira float will change that but only at the expense of higher inflation. One of Nigeria's largest companies says it maintains accounts at more than half the country's 120 banks. Until devaluation early this month, the true cost of funds was somewhere between the previous official rate of N10.5 to the dollar and the competitive rate, quoted by the banks for earnings from non-oil exports and other inflows, of N18 to N20. Assuming an 80-20 split between free market and official markets, companies were paying in the region of N16 to the dollar. The widening gap between the two markets in the first ten weeks of 1992 and subsequent devaluation will mean sharply higher inflation in this heavily import-dependent economy. Between them, last year's rapid monetary growth and devaluation spell rapid inflation in a market where import cost-plus pricing is the norm. Business economists believe inflation is already running at 30 per cent  - double last year's officially-estimated 15 per cent - and predict gloomily that it will reach 50 per cent this year, unless the authorities tighten credit and rein in the free-market exchange rate soon. But when - rather than if - that happens, the official rate will have to be allowed to find a more 'competitive' level, perhaps around N14 to the dollar. All this is playing havoc with business costs. One big importer says it takes six to eight months to convert foreign exchange into delivered imports. He estimates his working capital requirement at 30 per cent of turnover, compared with 12 per cent in European markets. This is going to mean tighter margins and slower profit growth during 1992, though inflation will continue to make corporate results look better than they really are.  ------------------------------------------------------------                 CORPORATE PERFORMANCE INDEX  ------------------------------------------------------------ Reporting       Turnover     Pretax     Price     Margins   year                       profits    index       (%)  ------------------------------------------------------------ 1984              100         100        100       12.7 1985              102         130        104       16.2 1986              109         133        111       12.3 1987              128         156        121       12.3 1988              166         187        170       11.0 1989              227         303        253       11.2 1990              311         390        275       12.4 1991              410         494        300       11.9  ------------------------------------------------------------ Trend 1984/91    22.3        25.6       17.0       12.5 (% pa)  ------------------------------------------------------------ Source: FT statistics  ------------------------------------------------------------</p>

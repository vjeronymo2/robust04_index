			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Bloody nose for Rasmussen's SDP - Denmark Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's Social Democratic party was dealt a bloody nose, winning only 15.8 per cent of the vote compared with 23.3 per cent in 1989 and losing one of its four seats in Strasbourg. The SDP, whose supporters are not as pro-European as its leaders, lost heavily to the alliance of two anti-European movements, the People's Movement Against the EU and the June Movement. The two groups scored a total of 25.5 per cent compared with 18.9 per cent won by the People's Movement in 1989 (the June Movement is a newcomer), but the two failed to win an extra seat and retain a total of four. The election was not a clean sweep for the anti-European cause, however. The two pro-European opposition parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, each picked up an extra seat, 'an excellent result,' commented Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Liberal leader and former foreign minister. The Liberals went ahead to 18.9 from 16.6 per cent to win four seats. The Conservatives, whose lead candidate was the popular former prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, won 17.7 per cent, against 13.3 per cent last time, and picked up three seats. But the strongly pro-Union Centre Democratic party, a member of the present four-party centre-left coalition government, lost both its seats and saw its share of the vote sink to 0.9 per cent from 7.9 per cent in 1989. The Radical Liberals (also a member of the coalition) gained a seat for the first time by fielding a popular woman candidate, former environment minister Ms Lone Dybkjaer, who is the present live-in companion of the prime minister. The Euro-sceptical Social People's party held on to its single seat although dropping to 8.6 from 9.1 per cent.  -------------------------------------------- Population: 5.2m Seats: 16  -------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 52.5%; 1989, 46.2%)  -------------------------------------------- Party*    Parliament    % vote      Seats              group    '94   '89  '94   '89  -------------------------------------------- Venstre       LDR    18.9  16.6    4     3 CPP           EPP    17.7  13.3    3     2 SDP           PES    15.8  23.3    3     4 JB            RBW    15.2     -    2     3 FB            RBW    10.3     -    2     1 SPP        Greens     8.6   9.1    1     1 RV            LDR     8.5     -    1     - CD            EPP     0.9   7.9    0     2  -------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Interior  -------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations:  -------------------------------------------- CD = Centre Democrats; CPP = Conservative People's party; FB = People's Movement Against the EU; JB = Junibevaegelsen; RV = Radikale Venstre; SDP = Social Democrats; SPP = Socialist People's party  -------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  -------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  -------------------------------------------- Proportional from national lists Compulsory voting: No  -------------------------------------------- MEPs  -------------------------------------------- SDP Kirsten Jensen, Freddy Blak, Niels Sindal, Ove Madsen  -------------------------------------------- CPP Poul Schluter, Marie Jepsen, Christian Rovsing Venstre (Liberals) Eva Kjer Hansen, Bertel Haarder, Niels Anker Kofoed, Karin Riis Jorgensen  -------------------------------------------- Radical Liberals Lone Dybkjaer  -------------------------------------------- Socialist People's Party Lily Gyldenkilde  -------------------------------------------- June Movement Jens-Peter Bonde, Ulla Sandbaek  -------------------------------------------- People's Movement Against the EU Ole Krarup  -------------------------------------------- Based on preliminary results issued by the European Parliament.

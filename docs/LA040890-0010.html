			<p><P> April 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 THE RAVE-UPS "CHANCE" EPIC. ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF  ONE STAR (POOR) TO FIVE STARS (A CLASSIC).  </P> <P> Another fairly fine effort, this "Chance" is, from L.A.'s last remaining  ex-cowpuncher-poet rock 'n' roll band.  </P> <P> But as far as truth in advertising goes, it's a bit of a tease, with not enough  rave-ups delivered, not quite enough chances taken. The sound this time is less  rootsy and more pop, less Dylanesque and more Zombiesque -- though not so much  so that frontman Jimmer Podrasky doesn't still write rambling songs about what  "the queen said to the dealer" and that sort of thing. The Rave-Ups seem to be  groping for growth yet tentative in striking out too far, making for an  enjoyable, reiterative follow-up that doesn't leave much to the title concept.

			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIAL BOTHERED BY PRIVATE PLANNER'S PRESENCE ON BOARD  </P> <P> The selection of a development firm planner to help interview finalists for the  job of Costa Mesa's public services director gives the appearance of a conflict  of interest, a City Council member charged Thursday.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Sandra L. Genis said that choosing Malcolm Ross, an executive with  C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, a major development firm in Costa Mesa, to be a  member of the interview board raises the potential for conflict because the  firm will need to deal with the new public services director in the course of  its business.  </P> <P> Ross joined three public employees on the interview board for the position,  which has not yet been filled.  </P> <P> Genis said she will bring up the conflict issue at the council's Aug. 7 meeting  in hopes of changing the city's policy to preclude similar situations in the  future.  </P> <P> "I'm really concerned about the kind of message this sends out to the job  applicants for this position and other positions in terms of who really  controls this town and (who) they have to keep satisfied," said Genis, who was  elected last year on a slow-growth platform.  </P> <P> "In this case, the message is you have to keep the developer pleased."  </P> <P> Ross could not be reached for comment, but City Manager Allan L. Roeder denied  that there was any conflict of interest in the selection of Ross to help  interview finalists for the public services position, a job paying up to  $75,000 a year.  </P> <P> "We have had varying individuals sit on different oral boards depending on  qualifications," Roeder said. "I believe it's healthy for us to have people  from the private sector involved in the interview process because we do  interact frequently with the private sector."  </P> <P> And including a member from private business along with three public employees  on the interview board was important to give diversity of experience and  expertise, he said.  </P> <P> Although he works for the development firm, Ross is a specialist in  transportation issues with the city's Chamber of Commerce, Roeder said. Also,  he said Ross was chosen as one of the panelists because the new public services  director is expected to work extensively on improving transportation in the  city.  </P> <P> Roeder said the panel interviewed seven job hopefuls, which were then pared to  three. He said the group made no decisions, only recommendations for him to  consider in making the final selection in the next few days.  </P> <P> While the development firm and its executives and subsidiaries have given  campaign contributions to council members, Roeder said, council members have  "absolutely no involvement in who is on that panel."  </P> <P> Roeder said he does not object to Genis' suggestion that the city change its  policy regarding who is appointed to selection boards.  </P> <P> "I understand her concern. Even if there is no actual conflict, I think she is  concerned about the perceived conflict." If the rest of the council feels  similarly, he said, "let's adopt a policy . . . and live by it."  </P> <P> Councilwoman Mary Hornbuckle said she does not see how the naming of Ross to  the panel could present a conflict of interest. The council, she said, makes  development decisions regardless of whether the Segerstrom firm deals with the  new public services director.  </P> <P> "Neither Mr. Ross nor the public service director have final authority on what  happens in the city," she said.  </P></p>

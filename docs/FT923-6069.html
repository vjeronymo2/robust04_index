			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Volatile times ahead for EC's equity markets: The French vote on Maastricht treaty is making brokers jumpy EUROPEAN equity markets have fallen heavily from their May peaks, and there could still be some nerve-wracking weeks ahead. German shares, as measured by the DAX index, are 18.7 per cent per cent below the level reached in May. France's CAC-40 has dropped 19.7 per cent and Italy's BCI index, burdened by additional problems such as a long wait for a new government after the April election, has fallen by 28.6 per cent. Volumes have been low across the continent during August, but much of the decline happened before the holidays. The consensus of European equity market-watchers is that any further drop is likely to be limited to around 4-5 per cent in the run-up to the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on September 20. But severe volatility cannot be ruled out. Since the start of the summer, the markets have adjusted to several disappointments: the rejection of the Maastricht Treaty by Danish voters; the increasing weakness in the dollar; diminishing hopes for a recovery in the US and UK economies; a poor corporate reporting season in Europe and economic uncertainty in Japan. Analysts have cut earnings forecasts and the markets have tended to ignore any pleasant surprises among companies' interim results. In the first quarter of 1992, shares in cyclical industries sped ahead on hopes of an upturn. According to the FT-A World Indices, by the end of the first quarter, the European chemical sector rose 9.1 per cent in local currency terms, while cars rose by 8.5 per cent and car components by 20 per cent. But recovery expectations dimmed and by the end of the second quarter chemicals had fallen back by 1.6 per cent, the gain in car shares had been reduced to 1.6 per cent and in the component sector to 9.8 per cent. Since then, poor interims and downgradings in earnings forecasts have taken 9.5 per cent off chemicals, 21.9 per cent off cars and 11.7 per cent off components. The outlook is dominated by the French referendum on Maastricht. A 'no' vote may have been largely built into French equity values, but other continental markets have not discounted the possible consequences of a 'no' vote, such as a radical realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), or rising interest rates in Italy, Spain and the UK. Morgan Stanley's strategist, Mr Richard Davidson does not rule out a devaluation against the D-Mark of the lira, the peseta, and the pound sterling, but he believes the benefits would be fleeting. Nobody would applaud a 'no' vote more than Ms Lisa Hosking, strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston. She says it would break the untenable situation in which many EC members find themselves. 'Economies which need low interest rates have high interest rates and their governments cannot act freely.' However, Mr Davidson argues that a French 'yes' vote, followed by ratification of the Maastricht Treaty by the British and German parliaments would create a bullish scenario for European bourses: German interest rates would come down, stimulating economic growth in Europe. European equity investors also have to consider the effects on European earnings of the dollar's decline and of the economic slowdown in Germany. Analysts generally agree that the bottom for the dollar may not be far off at around DM1.30-DM1.35, and that although the currency will remain volatile until the US presidential elections in November, it could rebound to DM1.65 next year. Some analysts say the European markets have over-reacted to the dollar's weakness, since dollar earnings only make up between 2-4 per cent of European earnings growth. The likelihood of a narrowing of interest rate differentials between Germany and the US by the middle of next year as well as a move by institutions to increase their underweight position in dollar-denominated assets should lend support to the US currency. Germany is more of a problem. Its economy is slowing and there are no signs of interest rates coming down quickly enough to provide the necessary stimulus. Some analysts warn that the Bundesbank is trying to get the economy back to the way it was in the late 1980s, an impossible task following reunification. Another drag on the German stock market is its heavy concentration of cyclical and export-dependent industries whose earnings downturn has not yet been factored into equity values. Analysts believe German companies face a greater problem regarding their profit margins than other north European economies, which makes their earnings outlook more vulnerable. The current environment does not lend itself to the outperformance of one sector against the other, analysts say. By contrast, individual stocks are being singled out by increasingly selective investors in the light of each company's interim earnings. Any signs of lower interest rates would get the financial sectors moving ahead, with the quality stocks rising fastest. It could also herald a switch back from defensive sectors, such as utilities and food, into the cyclical industries. Low volume and uncertainty work both ways, however. If next week, European fund managers return, refreshed and invigorated from their holidays, any sudden decision to buy at current, depressed levels could send prices sharply higher, at least for the short term.</p>

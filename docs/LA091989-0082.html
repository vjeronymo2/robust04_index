			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NEW CHIEF OF PACIFIC SOUTHWEST HOPES TO FIND STRENGTH IN DIVERSITY  </P> <P> Pacific Southwest Corp. is a quirky little concern with an eclectic variety of  businesses.  </P> <P> It owns 384 acres of largely undeveloped land in northern San Diego County; it  counts kiwi farms, beehives and industrial sewing machines among its assets; it  services commercial and residential mortgage loans and leases cars and  computers, and it picks, packs and stores crops from farms owned by others.  </P> <P> The Northridge-based company, founded in 1980 by President Jerry Fraschilla,  has always been a bit short on a long-term game plan, which helps explain its  detours into unusual businesses. "When I originally started, it was not with a  preconceived idea," Fraschilla said. "It just sort of evolved."  </P> <P> And the company just sort of drifted into obscurity. Although Pacific Southwest  has been consistently profitable -- it earned $123,402 on $1.9 million in sales  for the nine months that ended April 30 -- its stock has all but been ignored  by institutional investors. The stock trades on the so-called "pink sheets"  over-the-counter market, which lists small, thinly traded stocks that don't  attract much attention.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Work Same Magic  </P> <P> But William Hutchinson, president of Hutchinson Securities, a San Francisco  investment banking firm, recently bought a 1% stake in Pacific Southwest and  was elected to the firm's board of directors. Hutchinson is betting that  Pacific Southwest's newest asset -- its chairman, Ronald Langley, 45 -- will be  able to work the same kind of magic for the tiny company that he did while  working for New Zealand's second-largest company, Brierley Investments.  </P> <P> "With Ron Langley there, we'll have no difficulty in attracting additional  capital for further expansion," Hutchinson said. By using Langley's contacts,  Fraschilla said he is hoping to turn Pacific Southwest into a national  financial services company.  </P> <P> Langley is also wagering on his ability to turn Pacific Southwest into a  success story. One of his first steps was investing $1 million to buy 333,333  shares, or about 17% of Pacific Southwest's stock, and he received options to  buy another 333,333 shares at $5 each. (Fraschilla and his family own about 24%  of the company.)  </P> <P> But building another success figures to be a lot tougher this time around for  Langley. Brierley is a huge international concern with $7 billion in assets and  access to virtually unlimited sources of capital, while Pacific Southwest's net  worth, based on the difference between its assets and debt, is a mere $4  million, with little extra cash for investments.  </P> <P> Langley says the company could easily raise $2 million for investments or  acquisitions with its existing cash and assets. But if Pacific Southwest's  plans are big, that won't go too far. And raising money by selling more stock  doesn't seem like an option given the company's meager appeal among large  investors.  </P> <P> What it all comes down to is that the pressure is on Langley to not only find  crackerjack investments, but to also lure enough big partners to help share the  risk of those investments.  </P> <P> Despite these obstacles, Langley is bold enough to say that his plan is to  attract a larger company that will buy into Pacific Southwest with a  $10-million to $20-million investment and provide the resources necessary for a  more significant expansion. The lure for such an investor will be his history  of spotting profitable investments, he said.  </P> <P> "We're starting with a smaller size," Langley said. "But if we come up with an  attractive enough investment, we can always get financing. Our equity portion  might be smaller, but if it's good enough, there's always a way of making the  investment work."  </P> <P> Langley is already checking out investment opportunities to exploit in  financial services, particularly since the savings and loan crisis has left  many insolvent thrifts ready to dump assets such as mortgage operations and  real estate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move Fast  </P> <P> Peter Brook, an analyst at the New Zealand brokerage Hendry Hay McIntosh Ltd.,  said he expects Langley to move fast.  </P> <P> "The only difference is he won't have the capital base to work with initially  and the deals will be smaller," Brook said. "You'll see him buy perhaps some  unusual companies that might not look like much, but he'll be able to do  something with them."  </P> <P> This faith in Langley stems from his track record when he worked for Sir Ronald  Brierley, who was chairman of Brierley Investments until a recent change of  control. Brierley isn't a big name to most Americans, but he's a big-time  investor who became an international figure by investing in companies in  Australia, Europe and the United States.  </P> <P> Since moving here from his native Australia in 1984, Langley served as  executive director of Industrial Equity Pacific Ltd., Brierley's North American  investment group. And Langley followed Brierley's investment style, which  involves looking for undervalued businesses, no matter how offbeat or eclectic  they might be.  </P> <P> "Langley was very much a Brierley's man," said Michael Willis, an analyst at  James Capel &amp; Co., a London brokerage firm.  </P> <P> </P> <P> $1-Billion Portfolio  </P> <P> In those five years, Langley built Industrial Equity's portfolio of U.S.  investments from $2 million to about $1 billion. Langley bought Everest &amp;  Jennings, the Los Angeles wheelchair manufacturer; bought and sold Higbee Co.,  a Cleveland department store chain, and at one time owned a stake in Calmat  Co., a Los Angeles cement maker, and Resorts International, the Atlantic City  gambling and hotel chain.  </P> <P> Langley claims Higbee as his biggest coup. Higbee was foundering through a  depressed local economy in 1984 when Langley started buying stock. "The broker  I first gave the order to thought that I was a bit of a madman" because the  firm was in such bad shape, he said.  </P> <P> But Langley saw a talented retail team and valuable underlying assets at  Higbee, such as real estate that would eventually bounce back from the slump.  Brierley acquired the company for $72 million and sold it three years later for  $165 million.  </P> <P> After spending 14 years amassing investments for someone else, Langley wanted  to do it for himself. "I was looking to have more equity in what I did next,"  he said.  </P> <P> That next step became Pacific Southwest. Actually, Fraschilla initially  approached Langley and tried to get Industrial Equity to make a $10-million  investment in Pacific Southwest. The deal never materialized, but Fraschilla  and Langley hit it off.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Boost in Net Worth  </P> <P> A few months later, Langley quit his post with Brierley to become chairman at  Pacific Southwest. Langley's $1-million investment helped boost the firm's net  worth to at least $4 million, the minimum required for the company's stock to  be listed on the higher profile National Assn. of Securities Dealers National  Market list. Having its stock traded on NASDAQ might eventually help Pacific  Southwest sell more stock to raise money for its expansion.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Langley and Fraschilla hope that the encroaching development  from San Diego and Orange counties will soon catch up to the firm's land  holdings near Escondido and Ramona, giving them the opportunity to profit from  land sales or to take part in developments. That might not happen soon, though,  since zoning changes in northern San Diego County are often tough to come by.  </P> <P> "Just having the land alone won't guarantee the next step," said Hugh Sinnock,  head of the San Diego office of W. Ross Campbell, a mortgage banking company.  "But if it's in the direction of growth, it's just a matter of time."  </P> <P> The company's other operations remain small and exist largely to generate  income so Pacific Southwest can afford to hang onto the land.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Retired in 1973  </P> <P> Fraschilla, 52, retired as Technicolor's vice president of corporate  development in 1973 and got into the real estate business. He opened Pacific  Southwest in 1980 and two years later started a mortgage brokerage business to  avoid paying fees on land he bought and sold.  </P> <P> This year, the mortgage business, which collects fees on loans originated by  lending institutions, expects to handle about $180 million in residential  mortgages and up to $60 million in commercial loans, including those processed  through mortgage businesses in the Bay Area and Santa Ana that Pacific  Southwest recently agreed to acquire. Those loans would produce between $1.5  million and $3 million in pretax income, Fraschilla said.  </P> <P> The company also leases such equipment as cars, computers, sewing machines and  medical equipment, and it remains in various agricultural businesses.  </P> <P> Langley said he plans to stay in all those businesses and expand them as  quickly as possible while searching out opportunities such as Higbee that would  interest other investors and give Pacific Southwest the chance to buy assets on  the cheap.  </P> <P> All of his grand plans, of course, turn on whether he can come up with the  money to pay for these ventures. "But I've always found in the past that if an  idea is good enough, you'll always find someone with the money," Langley said.  </P> <P> Stockholders in Pacific Southwest can only wish him good hunting.  </P></p>

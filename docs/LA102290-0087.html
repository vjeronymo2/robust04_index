			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> FAREWELL SALUTE PLANNED FOR PIER  </P> <P> The city will hold a nostalgic "farewell salute to the old pier" Thursday. City  officials said the razing of the pier will be in full swing by Thursday, and  the ceremonies on that date will mark the death of the old structure.  </P> <P> The pier has been closed since July, 1988 because of age and storm damage.  </P> <P> The farewell ceremonies will feature live music, small pieces of the pier given  away as souvenirs and an update on fund raising for the replacement pier.  </P> <P> The end of the new pier will be 12 feet higher than that of the old pier,  enabling it to better withstand winter storms.  </P> <P> Mayor Thomas J. Mays said everybody is invited to the farewell salute. He noted  that the pier attracted about 1 million visitors a year from all over the  world.  </P> <P> "I grew up in this city, and I've surfed around that pier many, many times, and  it has many memories for me," Mays said. "I think everyone who lives in this  city is going to have some emotional moments about seeing the old pier come  down."  </P> <P> The new pier, which is estimated to cost $11.7 million, is scheduled to be  completed by spring, 1992. The city still lacks about $2.8 million, and a  private fund-raising drive is under way.  </P> <P> The farewell will begin at 11:30 a.m. Thursday at the entrance of the pier,  Main Street at Pacific Coast Highway.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species to the Federal ``List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Plants.'' A species may be determined to be an endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Panthera onca <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Curtailment of Its Habitat or Range  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within the United States, jaguars have been recorded most commonly from Arizona, but there are also records from California, New Mexico, and Texas, and reports from Louisiana. Currently there is no known resident population of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguars in the United States, though they still occur in northern Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Arizona  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Goldman (1932) believed that the jaguar was a regular, but not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> abundant, resident in southeastern Arizona. Hoffmeister (1986)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered the jaguar an uncommon resident species in Arizona. He  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concluded that the reports of jaguars between 1885 and 1965 indicated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a small but resident population once occurred in southeastern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Arizona. Brown (1983) suggested that the jaguar in Arizona ranged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widely throughout a variety of habitats from Sonoran desertscrub  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> upward through subalpine conifer forest. Most of the records were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Madrean evergreen-woodland, shrub-invaded semidesert grassland,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and along rivers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The most recent records of jaguars in the United States are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from Arizona. In 1971, a jaguar was taken east of Nogales and, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986, one was taken from the Dos Cabezas Mountains. The latter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual reportedly had been in the area for about a year before it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was killed (Ronald M. Nowak, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, pers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Arizona Game and Fish Department (AGFD) (1988) cited two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recent reports of jaguars in Arizona. The individuals were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered to be transients from Mexico. One of the reports was from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1987 from an undisclosed location. The other report was from 1988,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when tracks were observed for several days prior to the treeing of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar by hounds in the Altar Valley, Pima County. An unconfirmed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report of a jaguar at the Coronado National Monument was made in 1991  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Ed Lopez, Coronado National Monument, pers. comm., 1992).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, there is a report of a jaguar sighted in December,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, on the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge in the Baboquivari  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountains of southern Arizona. Refuge personnel believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chances are ``very good'' that this was a reliable sighting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Merriam (1919) summarized several accounts of jaguars, from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> various locations in California, which were obtained from documents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published between 1814 and 1860. Strong (1926) provided evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Cahuilla Indians of the Coachella Valley and San Jacinto and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Santa Rosa Mountains of southern California were familiar with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar. Nowak (1975) mentioned reports of jaguars in the Tehachapi  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mountains from 1855, and the last known individual from California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was killed near Palm Springs in 1860 (Strong 1926). Nowak speculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the animal may have been a breeding individual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Louisiana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nowak (1973) speculated on the occurrence of jaguars east of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Texas. Several early accounts mentioned jaguars and tigers. He  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cited Baird (1859) who believed that specimens had been taken from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana. Nowak also discussed the killing of what was probably a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jaguar near New River, Ascension Parish, Louisiana in 1886. Lowery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1974) mentioned this killing and included the jaguar in the fauna of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana on a provisional basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> New Mexico  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Barber (1902) speculated that jaguars made their way into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mogollon Mountains of New Mexico by ascending the Gila River. Bailey  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1931) suggested that jaguars seemed to be native in southern New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mexico, but were regarded as wanderers from across the United States-Mexico border. He listed nine reports of jaguars in New Mexico from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1855 to 1905. Brown (1983) stated that the last record from New  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Mexico was from 1905. Nowak (1975) mentioned reports of jaguars  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> along the Rio Grande from as late as 1922. Halloran (1946) reported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that dogs ``jumped'' a jaguar in the San Andres Mountains in 1937.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Findley  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (1975) stated that jaguars once occurred as far north  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as northern New Mexico.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Texas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

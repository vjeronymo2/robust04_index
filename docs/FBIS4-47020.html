			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by the Republic of Tatarstan Center for Social </F> Problems: "What Wages Do We Receive?"]    [Text] The Center for Social Problems would like to offer  for the attention of readers a graphic depiction of how, to  whom, and in what proportion the monies of the labor  remuneration fund are distributed.    Thus, if we take the average wage in April, R142,750, in  keeping with the rules in effect as of today the following  withholdings will be made from this amount: trade union dues--1  percent, or R1,428, the pension fund--1 percent (R1,428), and  income tax--12 percent (R17,130). Total withholdings come to  R19,986, and R122,768 will be issued to the individual. However,  it should be taken into account in this instance that, as an  average statistical citizen, every one of us is a consumer of  goods and services which are part of the subsistence minimum.    This means that, when buying these goods and services,  everyone who draws a salary (1.52 million) pays out of his  earnings value-added tax (VAT) in the amount of R5,995, or 4.2  percent of our average wage. Besides this, we should not forget  about yet another indirect tax which we, once again as the  average statistical citizen, pay out of our salaries--the excise  tax on wine and vodka products. These payments come to R8,870  per month, or 6 percent of our average wage. Summing up the  total, we see that only R109,703 remains of the wage issued to  us (R122,768).    Now let us move on to the indicator of the standard of  living. The average per capita income in our republic comes to  approximately 0.6 average wages. Therefore it is possible to  consider that, after all withholdings, the average per capita  income comes to R64,700 (107,903 times 0.6), whereas the  standard of living will be equal to 1.43 (64.7 over 45.38).    Additional outlays are incurred by the labor compensation  fund in order to pay employees who are on forced administrative  furloughs or working short work weeks. There are almost 200,000  such people in the republic, of whom, according to data from the  Republic of Tatarstan State Committee for Labor, no fewer than  60 percent receive wages at the level of the minimum labor  compensation on a monthly basis out of the labor compensation  funds of enterprises. Therefore, no less than 2 percent, or  R2,855 per one employed person per month, are withdrawn from the  labor compensation fund to pay for incomplete employment.    If we take into account this additional burden on each  employed person, too, the remainder of the wage will come to  R105,048, and the real value of the standard of living--1.38.    Taking into account everything stated above, this low  indicator of the standard of living confirms yet again the  crisis condition of the socioeconomic situation in the republic  which was stated at the 20th session of the Republic of  Tatarstan Supreme Soviet.</p>

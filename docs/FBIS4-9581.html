			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" from speech delivered by Jozef Moravcik at the </F> Constituent Assembly of the Democratic Union of Slovakia (DEUS)  in Bratislava on 23 April, "shortly after his election as DEUS  chairman": "Political Culture Influences Stability"]    [Text] This period is also important from the viewpoint of  what style of politics and government will be established in  Slovakia. The standard of political culture also has an impact  on stability. We have had negative experience in this respect.  We know that a confrontational style and the search for an enemy  at any price do not suit us because they lead to political  crises. We should, by our own conduct, create a positive image  of the style of exercising political power.    Among the problems that upset our citizens and make their  lives unpleasant are growing crime, vandalism, corruption, and a  general deterioration of interpersonal relations. I realize that  our situation in this field is not too critical when we compare  it with countries we tend to consider stable and prosperous. In  spite of this, I am convinced that we must take steps to stave  off such negative phenomena. We must now allow what I recently  heard from one foreign visitor to become a permanent truth:  "You have an interesting country, we feel good here, but what  puzzles us are the grim and sad faces of your people." In  short, we must see to it that contentment and smiles return to  the faces of our citizens.    A special problem is the impartiality and nonpartisanship of  state administration staff. To secure the stability of state  administration staff, this staff must inevitably be above party  affairs. We must not hesitate any longer in this regard. It is  necessary to prepare and introduce within a short period of time  a law on civil servants that would bring about the needed  stability in this sensitive sphere of state administration.    It is difficult to speak about the stability of the state  administration, however, when we are not even clear about its  structural changes. These, too, are unavoidable. We realize that  the present structure of state administration bodies leads to  the persecution of citizens by the bureaucracy.    The large degree of redistribution of resources through the  state budget, particularly in the sphere of health care and  education, creates tension on the revenue side. This tension can  be eliminated by increasing either revenue or the deficit. A  higher deficit means living at the expense of the future,  however. Dilemmas of this kind are characteristic of the  present. We cannot waste time pondering them. It is necessary to  take vigorous action also in this regard. This means more  private initiative in education and health care. Savings in  these areas will allow us to reduce the tax burden of, in  particular, entrepreneurs, allowing them to devote more  resources to the development of business.    It seems that the entrepreneurs' present tax burden exceeds  the critical mass of tolerability. It is evident that this  excessively heavy burden erodes the psychological barrier  against tax evasion and other forms of tax fraud. When we deduct  from taxes tax evasions of this kind, the actual tax burden is  lower. It would be far more effective if the formal tax burden  matched the actual burden, leaving aside the fact that such  criminal elements in the economy corrupt the social atmosphere.    A sore point of Slovak economic policy is support for small  and medium-sized businesses. There exists a mass of documents  approved by various governments reflecting the endeavor to find  a way of giving support to this form of enterprise. In spite of  this, we still owe much to small and medium-sized businessmen.  We must start eliminating this debt as soon as possible.    Our integration into European and transatlantic structures  is  not free of problems. It is taking place at a time when a new  model of European cooperation and a new architecture of European  security are being sought. In the same way that we are  interested in the borders of the zone of stability and  prosperity not ending at our western border, we must be  interested in having democratic and stable partners to the east  of our republic. We set particularly great store in good  relations with Ukraine and the Russian Federation.    Our immediate task is to contribute to the stability of  Central Europe. I think Slovak-Hungarian relations represent the  greatest liability in this respect. It needs to be stressed that  this liability rests on both sides. This liability, which is a  liability of the two countries' governments not only toward  their citizens but also toward the expectations of the entire  democratic Europe, must be settled as soon as possible. A  condition for this is the establishment of an atmosphere of  mutual trust. In other words, we must get rid of mutual  distrust. This requires, among other things, the resumption of  dialogue at various levels of state representation, including  the highest level.</p>

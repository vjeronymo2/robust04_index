Provincial party Secretary Wang Maolin  and Governor Chen Bangzhu attended and addressed the meeting.    Comrade Wang Maolin said: The year 1994 is an important and  crucial one for deepening reform, and it is very important to do  a good job in this year's judicial work. Departments at all  levels should fully understand the importance of maintaining  social stability in the new situation and should strengthen  party leadership over judicial work so as to ensure political  stability and social tranquility. In resolving social order  problems, there is a need to look into their root cause and  phenomena; to strengthen the formation of the judicial  contingent; and to fully display judicial departments' functions  in safeguarding party and state power, in preserving the  people's interests, and in protecting reform, opening up, and  economic development.    In his speech, Governor Chen Bangzhu pointed out: Following  the deepening of reform and opening up, some new problems and  situations will emerge which will add to the difficulties in  maintaining social stability. Principal party and government  leaders at all levels should pay full attention to this and do  their best to help maintain social stability.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["C.G."-signed report: "Kinkel: CSCE Not To Be Put Above </F> NATO"]    [Excerpt] Bonn, 27 May -- Following Russian Defense  Minister Grachev's statements in Brussels, the Federal  Government has pointed out the limits of the West's concessions  to Moscow. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Friday [27  May]: "Russia's wish to put the CSCE above other European  security institutions is not shared by us." He said that  although the CSCE is of great importance, "there cannot be" a  ranking, with the CSCE coming first, the North Atlantic  Cooperation Council second, followed by NATO in third place.  Moscow cannot be granted a right of veto either. Kinkel said:  "Security in Europe cannot dispense with NATO as a defense  alliance in the foreseeable future." This is also in the  interest of the Central and East Europe states, Kinkel said.    However, Kinkel welcomed Russia's willingness to accept  NATO's offer to join the Partnership for Peace program. It is  important that Russia wants to join the program as an equal  partner. The partnership opens up the opportunity for  comprehensive military cooperation to secure peace and stability  in Europe. Like the other partners, Russia can itself decide on  the extent and quality of its contributions. Kinkel said: "I  expect Russia to sign the Partnership for Peace framework  document as soon as possible." In addition, talks and  cooperation between NATO and Russia are desirable: "NATO and  nuclear power Russia have to enter into a strategic dialogue,  such as the one that the United States and Russia have had for  years." Mutual consultations, although excluding a Russian  right of veto, are in the interest of all parties concerned,  Kinkel said. [passage omitted]</p>

The intended effect of proposing approval of these rules is to regulate emissions of VOCs in accordance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990 (CAA or the Act). EPA's final action on this notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) will incorporate these rules into the federally approved SIP. EPA has evaluated each of these rules and is proposing to approve them under provisions of the CAA regarding EPA action on SIP submittals, SIPs for national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards and plan requirements for nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments must be received on or before November 21, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments may be mailed to: Daniel A.

These rules were submitted by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to EPA on May 30, 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 3, 1978, EPA promulgated a list of ozone nonattainment areas under the provisions of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1977 (1977 CAA or pre-amended act), that included the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin and the Southeast Desert Air Basin. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  43 FR 8964, 40 CFR 81.305. Because some portions of these areas were unable to meet the statutory attainment date of December 31, 1982, California requested under section 172(a)(2), and EPA approved, an extension of the attainment date to December 31, 1987. However, this extension was not requested for Kern County, and therefore, Kern County's attainment date remained December 31, 1982. On May 26, 1988, EPA notified the Governor of California, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H) of the pre-amended Act, that KCAPCD's portion of the California SIP was inadequate to attain and maintain the ozone standard and requested that deficiencies in the existing SIP be corrected (EPA's SIP-Call). On November 15, 1990, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. In amended section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAA, Congress statutorily adopted the requirement that nonattainment areas fix their deficient reasonably available control technology (RACT) rules for ozone and established a deadline of May 15, 1991 for states to submit corrections of those deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> At that time, Kern County included portions of two air basins: the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin and the Southeast Desert Air Basin. The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin portion of Kern County was designated as nonattainment, and the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County was designated as unclassified. See 40 CFR 81.305 (1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 20, 1991, the San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District (SJVUAPCD) was formed. The SJVUAPCD has authority over the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin portion of Kern County. Thus, the KCAPCD still exists, but only has authority over the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 182(a)(2)(A) applies to areas designated as nonattainment prior to enactment of the amendments and classified as marginal or above as of the date of enactment. It requires such areas to adopt and correct RACT rules pursuant to pre-amended section 172(b) as interpreted in pre-amendment guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  EPA's SIP-Call used that guidance to indicate the necessary corrections for specific nonattainment areas. All of Kern County is classified as serious. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  However, the Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County was not a pre-enactment nonattainment area and, therefore, was not designated and classified upon enactment of the amended Act. For this reason, KCAPCD was not subject to the RACT fixup requirement and the May 15, 1991 deadline. However, KCAPCD is still subject to the requirements of EPA's SIP-Call because the SIP-Call included all of Kern County. The substantive requirements of the SIP-Call are the same as those of the statutory RACT fixup requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the proposed post&hyph;1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice'' (Blue Book) (notice of availability was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 25, 1988); and the existing control technique guidelines (CTGs). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The San Joaquin Valley Air Basin portion of Kern County retained its nonattainment designation and was classified by operation of law pursuant to section 107(d) and section 181(a) upon the date of enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Southeast Desert Air Basin portion of Kern County was designated nonattainment on November 6, 1991. See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The State of California submitted many revised RACT rules for incorporation into its SIP on May 30, 1991, including the rules being acted on in this document. This document addresses EPA's proposed action for Rule 410.3, Organic Solvent Degreasing Operations, and Rule 412, Gasoline Transfer into Stationary Storage Containers, Delivery Vessels, and Bulk Plants. These submitted rules were adopted by the KCAPCD on May 6, 1991 and found to be complete on July 10, 1991 pursuant to EPA's completeness criteria that are set forth in 40 CFR part 51, appendix V <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and are being proposed for approval into the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA adopted completeness criteria on February 16, 1990 (55 FR 5830) and, pursuant to section 110(k)(1)(A) of the CAA, revised the criteria on August 26, 1991 (See 56 FR 42216).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 410.3 controls emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from solvent metal cleaning operations, and Rule 412 controls VOCs emitted during the transfer of gasoline into storage tanks and delivery vessels. VOCs contribute to the production of ground level ozone and smog. The rules were adopted as part of each district's efforts to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone and in response to EPA's SIP-Call and the section 182(a)(2)(A) CAA requirement. The following is EPA's evaluation and proposed action for these rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> EPA Evaluation and Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In determining the approvability of a VOC rule, EPA must evaluate the rule for consistency with the requirements of the CAA and EPA regulations, as found in section 110 and part D of the CAA and 40 CFR part 51 (Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans). The EPA interpretation of these requirements, which forms the basis for today's action, appears in the various EPA policy guidance documents listed in footnote 2. Among those provisions is the requirement that a VOC rule must, at a minimum, provide for the implementation of RACT for stationary sources of VOC emissions. This requirement was carried forth from the pre-amended Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the purpose of assisting state and local agencies in developing RACT rules, EPA prepared a series of Control Technique Guideline (CTG) documents. The CTGs are based on the underlying requirements of the Act and specify the presumptive norms for what is RACT for specific source categories. Under the CAA, Congress ratified EPA's use of these documents, as well as other Agency policy, for requiring States to ``fix-up'' their RACT rules. See section 182(a)(2)(A). The CTG applicable to Rule 410.3 is entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Solvent Metal Cleaning,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;022. The CTG documents applicable to Rule 412 are entitled, ``Control of Volatile Organic Compound Leaks from Gasoline Tank Trucks and Vapor Collection Systems,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;78&hyph;051, and ``Control of Volatile Organic Emissions from Bulk Gasoline Plants,'' EPA&hyph;450/2&hyph;77&hyph;035. Further interpretations of EPA policy are found in the Blue Book, referred to in footnote 2. In general, these guidance documents have been set forth to ensure that VOC rules are fully enforceable and strengthen or maintain the SIP. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> KCAPCD Rule 410.3 includes the following significant changes from the current SIP rule:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Adds an applicability statement, definitions, recordkeeping requirements and test methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Adds certain operating requirements and equipment requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Deletes Executive Officer discretion in determining equivalent control systems.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> KCAPCD Rule 412 contains the following changes from the current SIP rule: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Adds definitions, certain operating provisions, recordkeeping and test methods. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Deletes certain exemptions and Executive Officer discretion in determining equivalency of storage tank emission controls. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has evaluated these submitted rules and has determined that they are consistent with the CAA, EPA regulations, and EPA policy. Therefore, KCAPCD Rule 410.3 and Rule 412 are being proposed for approval under section 110(k)(3) of the CAA as meeting the requirements of section 110(a) and part D.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Process <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301 and part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted this action from review under Executive Order 12866.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations, Ozone, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Authority: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: October 11, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John Wise, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNER> <SIGNJOB> <!-- PJG ITAG l=04 g=1 f=1 --> Acting Regional Administrator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SIGNJOB> <FRFILING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=40 g=1 f=1 --> [FR Doc. 94&hyph;26020 Filed 10&hyph;19&hyph;94; 8:45 am] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FRFILING> <BILLING> <!-- PJG ITAG l=68 g=1 f=1 --> BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </BILLING>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

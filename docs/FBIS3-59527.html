			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "Cisi and Soleri-Cigel Form a </F> GIE"]    [Text] In response to the facilities management promise of  the AS/400, Cisi and Soleri-Cigel have decided to form an equal  share association within a GIE (Economic Interest Group). The  French market, currently worth 260 MFF, is expected to double in  the next three years. The distinguishing characteristic of FM  AS/400 is the global nature of the demand (operation,  maintenance and development, integration of software programs);  hence the need for pooling know-how. Cisi will contribute its  operational skills to the GIE. Boasting a turnover of 260 MFF in  Facilities Management (out of a total of 1.52 billion FF), the  SSII, which is also working with Bull on large systems  facilities management, had decided to tackle the opportunities  of the FM AS/400 market two years ago. It already has a few  contracts to its credit (Bayard Presse, Cholet...).  Soleri-Cigel, one of the foremost French AS/400 agents, can for  its part claim expertise in development and integration of  software programs specific to IBM minicomputers. Its sales from  these products go as high as 120 MFF, out of a total turnover  figure of 355 MFF.</p>

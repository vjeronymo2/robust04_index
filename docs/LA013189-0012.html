			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HOPE PREVAILS DESPITE PLAN TO CLOSE EMERGENCY ROOM  </P> <P> Spirits in the emergency room at San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital  were high Monday as doctors hoped for a solution to the hospital's financial  problems and the recent announcement that its emergency room will close March  28, authorities said.  </P> <P> "There's hope up until the day it closes," said Tom Hennessy, chief executive  officer for the hospital, which serves Southeast San Diego. "If some solution  to the funding problem can be found, there's a chance that the department can  remain open."  </P> <P> But a specific solution is nowhere in sight. National Medical Enterprises,  which operates the hospital, announced Friday that it will close the emergency  room because of "serious financial losses." Don Griffin, vice president of  business development for NME, said the company had lost more than $20 million  since 1982, primarily because of inadequate reimbursement from the federal  government.  </P> <P> "San Diego Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital finds itself in a situation like  so many other hospitals in the state of California, and it is faced with no  alternative other than to close its emergency room or continue to face  disastrous financial implications," Michael H. Focht Sr., president of NME,  said in a statement about the closure.  </P> <P> The hospital's contracts with the County Medical Services and the County Jail  will also be terminated.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Have to Find Other Hospital  </P> <P> Asked where people in the area would go for walk-in care, Griffin said: "The  reason we issued notice on Friday was to inform patients in the area that we'd  no longer be providing emergency service, and by the time March 28 comes, they  should have identified other places to go."  </P> <P> Griffin said that, according to the American Medical Assn., one out of seven  hospitals in the country will close in the next two years.  </P> <P> The closest hospital is Paradise Valley in National City, which also has  announced plans to close its emergency room in May. UC San Diego Medical Center  in Hillcrest and Mercy Hospital will probably receive more patients when the  emergency room at Physicians &amp; Surgeons closes, authorities said.  </P> <P> In May, NME announced plans to sell the hospital to Nationwide Medical Systems  of Perris, Calif. The sale was finally rejected, Griffin said Monday, because  the city of San Diego refused to grant clear title to the property.  </P> <P> But City Councilman Wes Pratt said NME and Nationwide had failed to convince  the city that they planned to continue to operate the facility as a hospital.  "There was no reasonable assurance that what they were proposing was going to  work . . . and there was no assurance that they were going to operate as a  hospital," he said.  </P> <P> An aide for County Supervisor Leon Williams, who represents the central-region  residents who use the emergency room at Physicians &amp; Surgeons, said the  supervisor was extremely disappointed and his staff is working to keep the  department open.  </P> <P> "We are not prepared to allow those people in Southeast San Diego who were  serviced by Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital to go wanting for medical  services," said aide Neal Arthur.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Hennessy said, the emergency room was packed with "a tremendous  volume of patients."  </P></p>

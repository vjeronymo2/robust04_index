			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Welsh Water joins race to build private roads Welsh Water has joined UK and Continental construction companies which have formed rival joint ventures and consortia to bid for Pounds 380m of privately financed road schemes announced last week by Mr John Watts, roads minister. At least eight potential groupings have emerged which expect to bid for one or more of the four design, build, finance and operate contracts. Contractors will be paid by shadow tolls from the Exchequer, based on the number of vehicles using the road. In return they will design, finance, construct and maintain the roads for 15 to 25 years. Five of the the eight groupings are understood to include: Tarmac and John Laing, the UK contractors, with Welsh Water and Transroute, the largest French toll road operator. BZW are merchant bank advisers. Amec and Alfred McAlpine, the UK construction companies, and Spanish contractor Dragados. Taylor Woodrow, Sir Robert McAlpine and Amey, all from the UK. Mowlem of the UK and Dumez GTM of France, advised by Schroders merchant bank. Wimpey, the UK contractor, and Babtie Group, the UK highways design and transport consultants. Merchant bank advisers are Morgan Grenfell. Three other UK contractors - Costain, advised by NatWest Markets, Balfour Beatty advised by Bank of America, and Trafalgar House - are separately talking to potential partners and plan to bid. It will be the first time that shadow tolls have been used since the government removed its opposition to the concept in last year's Budget. The schemes have attracted strong interest from Continental toll road and construction companies anxious to break into what they believe will be a growing market for privately financed infrastructure projects in the UK. Welsh Water, which recently acquired Acer engineering consultants, also wants to expand its UK and international business in large-scale infrastructure schemes. The four road projects are: A Pounds 190m scheme to build a 19-mile link joining the M1 and M62 south of Leeds with the A1. All three existing roads will be widened to dual four-lane capacity on approaches to the new link road. A Pounds 145m scheme to widen 13 miles of the A1 to motorway standard between Alconbury, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. A Pounds 35m scheme to widen a 34-mile stretch of the A419 and A417 between Swindon and Gloucester, including two bypasses. A Pounds 10m project to bypass Haltwhistle, Northumberland, on the A69 plus management of the entire 53-mile length of the A69 between Newcastle upon Tyne and Carlisle.</p>

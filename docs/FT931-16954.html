			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / Arts: RSC looks for corporate friends - Sponsorship In an ominous start to what could be a difficult year for arts sponsorship, Royal Insurance has announced that it will not be renewing its support for the Royal Shakespeare Company worth Pounds 2.1m over three years when the contract expires at the end of 1993. The decision surprises nobody. Royal Insurance has been with the RSC for six years, investing Pounds 3.5m in the Company. It renewed the connection once, increasing its annual aid from Pounds 465,000 to Pounds 700,000 a year. This length of support is quite impressive in arts sponsorship: if there is such a thing as an average relationship, it would be for three years with a year's grace to enable the arts organisation to find a replacement. The RSC has this 12 months' leeway. Heralded at the time as the biggest arts sponsorship ever, the link has undoubtedly helped both parties, but especially RI, which has raised its profile and had marvellous entertainment opportunities. It promoted Ian Rushton, group chief executive of RI when the deal was sealed and its main internal supporter, to the role of spokesman for all UK corporate sponsors. He warned the government that business would not pick up the cheque if arts subsidy was cut. The RSC benefited from an assured extra income during some seasons when box office revenue failed to meet its target. The recession, and its impact on profits, is the main factor behind RI's decision to withdraw, but the difficulty in injecting new excitement into a sponsorship after six years is as important. The RSC is well aware of the difficulties in making good the Pounds 700,000 in the current climate. It may well settle for a number of smaller sponsorships. It has been successful in recent months in finding companies willing to pay up to Pounds 10,000 to be associated with certain performances. It has also forged an imaginative link with Unilever which, through its brands Persil, Comfort and Flora, is backing the current productions at the Barbican to the tune of Pounds 50,000. Fortunately for the RSC its new Hamlet at the Barbican is a box office winner, with advance bookings of Pounds 1.2m. Box office takings in London and Stratford in November and December were above target. A good critical reputation will be the RSC's best advertisement in its search for new corporate friends.                            *      *      * It is a sad irony for the RSC that the UK's biggest arts sponsor, British Telecom, with a Pounds 1.6m budget, has been looking for an important theatre company to back, to add a third prong to its substantial sponsorships of dance, through Northern Ballet Theatre, and art, through the National Touring Exhibition. Its choice has fallen on the English Shakespeare Company and a deal will be announced this week. The RSC was never in the frame. BT had supported its annual tour to small venues but the relationship ended, with some acrimony, a year ago.                            *      *      * RI's six years with the RSC is as nothing compared with Texaco's support for the Metropolitan Opera in New York. This is now starting its 53rd year and in that time Texaco has contributed Dollars 100m to the Met. The oil company has concentrated its help on underwriting the Met's Saturday afternoon matinee performances which are transmitted to over 300 radio stations throughout North America. It is generally agreed that the sponsorship has done more to popularise opera in North America than any other project. Since 1990 the UK has been covered by the broadcasts and every Saturday until April the Met opera can be heard live on Radio 3, with a complete Ring cycle scheduled for March.                            *      *      * Fashion houses are not famous for their sponsorship of the arts but on January 24 an exhibition of structures by the American minimalist artist Sol Lewitt opens at the Museum of Modern Art in Oxford, thanks to Nina Ricci. As is so often the case the impetus behind the link comes from the fact that the president of Nina Ricci, Gilles Fuchs, is an important collector of modern art, including the work of Lewitt. He recently commissioned the artist to design the packaging for its new fragrance for men, Ricci-Club.                            *      *      * It seems extraordinary that, given the recession and the announced cuts in sponsorship by leading banks, oil firms, and insurance companies, Colin Tweedy, director general of the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, can still forecast a rise in arts sponsorship, albeit a small one, in 1993. His optimism is based on the potential expenditure of new sponsors, especially small- and medium-sized companies. As administrator of the Business Sponsorship Incentive Scheme, ABSA is well placed to monitor the emergence of such sponsors. The Government funds the BSIS with Pounds 4.5m (the sum remains unchanged for 1993-94), which is geared to draw in new arts sponsors with matching grants. There has been no falling away in demand for this top-up money in recent months, suggesting that the sponsorship bandwagon is still rolling. The BSIS also throws light on changes in sponsorship fashions. A feature of the past year has been the growth of interest in supporting film - there has been a threefold increase in BSIS grants in this field, from six to 19. Film received Pounds 444,600 in sponsorship and top-up grants, as against Pounds 121,000 in the previous year. Sponsors have at last woken up to the fact that film is enjoying a revival of interest, with cinema admissions booming. Film is flexible, international, and appeals to young audiences. Perhaps not surprisingly Piper Heidseick's sponsorship of the British Film Institute's Classic Film Collection won it the best first-time sponsor award at last month's ABSA prize giving. Other successful film sponsorships in recent months have included the IRN-BRU backing for the pop video exhibition at the Museum of the Moving Image; MacPherson Paints support for the Film Foundation's educational pack of the film Macbeth; and Panavision's sponsorship of the First Film Foundation New European Filmmaker's Short Film Festival. The attraction of film is that helping it can be very cheap, which appeals to small businesses. A local restaurant, The Ubiquitous Chip, sponsors the Glasgow Film Theatre.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Interior Minister Antoni Asuncion by Jose </F> Maria Brunet; place and date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brunet] Did you wish to  begin a new stage at the Interior Ministry?    [Asuncion] No. It is a matter of continuing the same plan  with my own methodology, but the plan's essence is the same. My  conduct is based on continuity. There is no break in the  ministry's policy. There are people who believed that they had  served their term at the ministry and asked to be replaced, and  we opted for complying with this request, taking into account  the years that they have spent here.    [Brunet] What circumstances define the antiterrorist  struggle at the beginning of 1994?    [Asuncion] We are undoubtedly faring better. A great deal  of progress has been made in the public response to violence in  the Basque Country. It is noteworthy progress for society to  reject this, and for the parties, despite the wrenches that may  be thrown in the works, to maintain their consensus on  terrorism. The purely policing aspect must be adjusted to the  responses that have to be made at each moment. In the political  sphere, we must continue as until now. The fact that platforms  for peace are proliferating and organizations whose origin lies  in the Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party] political area are  softening their message and daring to say that violence leads  nowhere, seems to me important. There is a substantial change.  This is undoubtedly drawing Herri Batasuna toward a new  strategy; hence the dialogue-oriented face that those who have  been protecting the crime syndicate now wish to present. So it  is a good thing that they wish to present that image, but I have  the impression that it is purely electoral strategy; that they  are going to see whom they deceive.    [Brunet] That is happening while attacks are taking place in  Madrid and Barcelona.    [Asuncion] Yes, but that is the inconsistency of what is a  purely electoral strategy on the part of Herri Batasuna, with  that image that they wish to present, that concerns them. But  they have not stopped. We have had attempts and one casualty in  Barcelona since I arrived at this ministry. There have been  attempts in Huesca, at a Civil Guard barracks, bombs attached to  vehicles in Bilbao, 60 kg of amonal [explosive] in Madrid, and  the attack on a colonel in Barcelona. Hence, the activity is  continuing, and we must be alert.    [Brunet] You have a certain reputation as a hard-liner.  Does it weary you or are you now accustomed to the idea?    [Asuncion] It seems to me that it is completely  inappropriate that a democratically elected government, where  citizens are free to express themselves, to carry out their  political plans, and to conduct politically the representation  of the people, should have to sit down with a gang of criminals.  So it is not feasible for a democratically elected government  to negotiate with a gang of killers who represent only  themselves. I believe that it is not feasible, has no chance.    [Brunet] Against the raising of principles, it can be said  that this was attempted in Algiers.    [Asuncion] Nobody can be accused of a lack of will to try  everything, but it was found that that did not work out, and  from that point there has been nothing, not that there can be  anything. Algiers is unrepeatable.    [Brunet] Does the reputation of being a hard-liner bother  you or not?    [Asuncion] Few things bother me, but I believe that it does  not reflect reality. I am a completely normal individual. I do  not know the reason for that hard-liner label. The fact is that  it seems to me that there are stances on which you cannot  compromise. I do not believe that you can compromise with these  men of violence, and that you must make appropriate responses.  If that is being hard-line, I will be, but I believe that that  is a normal reaction.    [Brunet] The impression has been formed that there were  other people at the Interior Ministry, such as Vera, who were  considering the possibility of dialogue.    [Asuncion] Dialogue is impossible as long as they continue  to kill. There can be no dialogue with somebody who does not  wish to have it. I do not know exactly what Vera's personal  opinion was, but I wish to make it clear that the government  does not establish channels of dialogue with terrorists, and so  I believe that Rafael Vera complied in these matters, which are  government orders that are accepted. Vera left because he was  tired -- he said so on the first day -- and I understand that  fact.    [Brunet] In the event of ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty]  relinquishing its weapons, how far could the state go in order  to promote rehabilitation?    [Asuncion] It is laid down in the legal procedures. The  framework created by parliament is the scope that we have.  Those who break the code are punished. The grounds on which  you justify your crime are the least of it. Every criminal  justifies his crime, but he commits it; breaks a rule of conduct.    [Brunet] There are people in the prisons who would perhaps  like to see new prospects....    [Asuncion] The people who are in the prisons are well  acquainted with the prison law and the regulations. They know  very well to whom they must turn to that effect. The oversight  judges are the ones who oversee the carrying out of sentences,  and so that is not unknown. But if you are referring to  pardons, that is not feasible. The only thing that is possible  as a reference point is the political parties' agreements, and  the framework in which that takes place is the Ajuria Enea  pacts, which were later reproduced in Madrid. The frame of  reference is what is now accepted a priori by the political  parties.    [Brunet] How is the dialogue with the People's Party viewed  at the Interior Ministry?    [Asuncion] Whenever there is a preelection atmosphere, the  People's Party uses these issues. I would ask that we keep cool  heads and that the elections do not entail a deterioration in  the political consensus on terrorism. That is undoubtedly what  would would delight Herri Batasuna; for there to be discord in  the area of the Ajuria Enea agreements. Our duty is to prevent  that from happening, with cool heads and setting aside matters  that could disturb that consensus. After June, everything will  return to normal, but we must prevent this from breaking down  now. My opinion is that the Herri Batasuna area will attempt  this. The steps that they are taking are to try to deceive the  first person to approach them.    [Brunet] Were splits nearly created by the Basque  Socialists' initiative in favor of dialogue with Herri Batasuna?    [Asuncion] No, no, no. There is a great deal of common  sense in the parties about this matter. So it affects nothing.  The parties' response has been very favorable. I hope to have  a meeting with them soon. That was a proposal that the Basque  Socialist Party should discuss within itself and consider  whether to bring it before the Ajuria Enea committee, and in any  event to discuss it there. The fact is that this initiative's  being leaked without people having knowledge of these matters  represents an omission, a shadow that had to be explained  personally to the parties.    [Brunet] You say that there is nothing to discuss with ETA.  What about Herri Batasuna?    [Asuncion] Herri Batasuna is now bringing a bill before  parliament. Let them speak. Let us see what they say. This is  a bill out of context, publicity seeking, because what they want  is to change the general organic prison law and the penal code.  It is a very strange bill, aimed at justifying the lack of  attention that these people in the Herri Batasuna area have for  the ETA prisoners.    [Brunet] So there is nothing to be said in the interparty  dialogue....    [Asuncion] It seems to me absurd for those who do not  frequent the forums for discussion and who renounce the  political participation that they have had endorsed by elections  to try to seek other things. At least, it is my impression that  their inbreeding is such that anything other than ego,  self-advertisement, and complacency -- specifically political  confrontation in the institutions -- frightens them.    [Brunet] That is, you would advise the Basque Socialists not  to sit down with Herri Batasuna....    [Asuncion] I will confine myself to making the observations  that I have just set out. They will know very well what they  wish to do. Right now, Herri Batasuna would sit down with  anybody, as long as they present an image different from what  they really are, but as a mere electioneering strategy. That  does seem dangerous to me; that any party should give Herri  Batasuna credibility. That is a matter that should be closely  watched. It seems to me that this area is very concerned about  what is happening around it, which is why they have such strong  reservations with respect to organizations such as Elkarri.    [Brunet] Recently, three Herri Batasuna members who were  going to see Antxon in Santo Domingo were not allowed in. Does  that have anything to do with these opinions that you are  expressing?    [Asuncion] It seems to me stupid that those who are killing,  as in the case of Barcelona, should go the next day to see the  sanhedrin in exile in order to explain. It seems to me totally  inconsistent. They have no reason now to play any more charades  of that kind.    [Brunet] Was there an explicit request to the Dominican  Republic?    [Asuncion] We would say that the meeting was not authorized.    [Brunet] Through diplomatic channels....    [Asuncion] Of course.    [Brunet] When the People's Party says that there can never  be rehabilitation for crimes of bloodshed, is it adopting a  correct approach?    [Asuncion] If the People's Party wishes to carry that out as  it says, there must be a change in the law. Under the current  prison law -- which was unanimously approved in parliament,  including the Popular Alliance -- those distinctions do not  exist. This does not mean that it will not be changed. Serving  sentences in full is a proposal advocated by the PSOE [Spanish  Socialist Workers Party], which proposes changes in the law for  this, through the penal code.    [Brunet] The Basque Nationalist Party seems not to share  that view.    [Asuncion] The matter was resolved within the framework of  the Ajuria Enea pacts, also signed by the People's Party. The  fact is that what the People's Party signs is one thing, and  what it says is another, but the real issue will be seen in  March. The penal code will be approved in that month, and I  have already said what the PSOE's election pledge was. Insofar  as agreement can be reached on the proposal, that will be the  legal framework that will define a new dynamic.    [Brunet] That is, you are clearly in favor of serving  sentences in full.    [Asuncion] Of course. [passage omitted]</p>

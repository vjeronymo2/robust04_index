			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Price fixed for Japanese rail offering THE PRICE at which shares in East Japan Railway, one of seven regional railway companies created in 1987 by the break-up of the national system, are to be offered for sale was yesterday fixed at Y380,000 (Dollars 3,656) a share. JR East, which will be listed on the Tokyo stock exchange in October, will be the first state flotation since Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the 65.7 per cent government-owned telecommunications giant, went public in 1987. The flotation, initially scheduled for last year, was postponed as a result of stock market weakness. Half of JR East's 4m shares, with a face value of Y50,000, will be sold in the first tranche. The success of JR East's listing is seen in Tokyo as crucial for other semi-privatised companies, such as Japan Tobacco, and the remaining six railway groups. The price was based on the auction of 600,000 shares last week, where the weighted average of successful bids came to Y379,806. The accepted bids ranged from Y352,000 to Y623,000. Over 17,000 bids were placed for the auction, with 3,993 successful bids, including 52 from foreign investors. The 10 largest buyers were all major financial institutions led by Fuji Bank with 30,000 shares and Long Term Credit Bank with 21,500 shares.</p>

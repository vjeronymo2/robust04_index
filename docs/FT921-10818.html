			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Catching the radio tails Since BT's privatisation in 1984, the government has been searching for ways to crack the telecommunication group's local monopoly. Providing telephone lines to people's homes has been the part of the market most resistant to competition and also the biggest cause of irritation to customers, since they have no alternative if their lines are faulty or there is a dispute over bills. Mercury Communications has concentrated on servicing business customers and providing a long-distance service to residential customers over BT's lines. Ministers now think they may have found the answer to BT's local stranglehold in a new technology, known as radio tails, which makes the final link to a customer's home by radio rather than the traditional cable. Ionica, a start-up venture based in Cambridge, was licensed to provide such a service last week. Ionica plans to put aerials on people's roofs and transmit telephone conversations to and from the exchange using radio spectrum at around the 3.5 GHz frequency. Inside people's homes, there will be a wire and a socket, just like BT's service. Nigel Playford, Ionica's managing director, who previously founded Cognito, the two-way paging company, argues that his service will be a low-cost alternative to BT's because there will be no need to dig up the roads and put in cables. This will also benefit the environment - the aerials will not be an eyesore as they will only stand six inches high, while traffic will not be held up by roadworks. If these claims are borne out - and Ionica's coyness about how precisely its technology works makes this difficult to judge - there will be applications elsewhere, particularly in developing countries which are having to put in networks from scratch. The technology could also have an impact on the balance of prices in the UK as Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of telecommunications, has been quick to grasp. As part of BT's latest price review, which began last week, the company wishes to increase standing charges and make compensating cuts in call charges. Assuming current technology, Sir Bryan accepts that there is a case for such 're-balancing' of prices because BT is losing money on providing telephone lines. But if Ionica's technology is successful, the value of BT's fixed network will have to be written down or even written off. Haven't we been here before? Isn't this what personal communications networks (PCN) and telepoint are supposed to achieve? The difference between radio tails and PCN is twofold. PCN is essentially a cellular service, designed for people on the move, and therefore has the high costs associated with such a sophisticated technology. Radio tails are specifically designed for fixed locations. Second, Playford argues that the quality of sound will be superior both because the phone will not be moving around and because putting aerials on people's roofs will give a better radio reception than with cellular equipment. As for telepoint, which has had a bad name since it flopped in the UK, the difference is that radio tails are specifically focused on the home environment. Telepoint was positioned as an alternative to a public call box. Lastly, should there be one radio tail operator or competing ones? There is much to be said for competition but the problem will be to find the necessary radio spectrum. The only sensible way of allocating the spectrum - which is a scarce national resource - is to auction it off to the highest bidders. It is about time that ministers dusted down their dossiers on the subject.</p>

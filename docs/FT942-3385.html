			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / 'We find these surveys a pain in the neck': Gillian Tett reports mixed views on the value of responding to questionnaires The Confederation of British Industry's latest business survey was greeted by a City fan club yesterday. After 30 years of polling British businesses, the surveys have won a reputation among City economists as being among the better barometers of the economy. The CBI's problem, however, is that the reviews from executives are more mixed. The manager of one northern furniture factory said: 'Quite frankly, we find these surveys a pain in the neck. We get inundated with so many that answering them could be a full-time job. And some of that information we don't want to give out anyway.' Although many large companies share the City's enthusiasm for the survey, faithfully filling it in every month, many smaller businesses are less sure. And while these companies are probably a minority, this patchy support may be creating variations in the way that companies complete the results. The CBI insists that this mixed level of support is normal, and says its surveys are weighted to account for it. In an effort to persuade companies to participate the CBI promises anonymity and sends respondents free survey results. Of the 3,000 manufacturers polled each month, about 1,400 normally respond. The distributive trade survey, published yesterday, usually gets about 500 responses from a mailing list of 15,000. Mr Sudhir Junankar, head of economic trends at the CBI, said: 'The surveys are voluntary. We can't force them on anyone so we try to make it as easy as possible.' He said that the surveys were kept simple to avoid burdening companies. The monthly industrial survey, for example, includes only five subjective questions. Although the quarterly surveys are more detailed, including evaluations of expectations over the next four months, the answers are kept to the 'better' or 'worse' criterion, and do not demand precise estimates. For some companies, at least, the tactic has worked. Mr Philip Aiken, managing director of Gas Europe in BOC, said: 'The forms they send you are very user-friendly. My 11-year-old daughter could fill them in.' He said he completed the survey because he found the results valuable. But as Mr Aiken pointed out, the flip side of this approach was that the vagueness of the questions meant companies could answer them in varying ways. 'I do sometimes wonder about the quality of the data. I suspect some people might answer depending on how they feel that day,' he said. Most companies insist that their response is more scientific - the CBI says senior management answer the survey in more than 80 per cent of cases. But Mr Junankar admitted that companies could vary in the way they interpreted issues such as 'business constraints' - and, more crucially, their concepts of 'normal' business activity. Mr Aiken, for example, judges whether business has improved by looking for changes of 2 per cent or more, usually based on a year-on-year plan, and does not include labour availability in his assessment of business constraints. Mr Richard Sutton, company secretary of Loake Brothers, a Northamptonshire shoemaker, defines what is 'normal' by 'running my eye over the last couple of years'. Changes of 10 per cent in either direction are considered to be 'better' or 'worse'. He considers that labour contraints, such as the availability of workers, are central to any definition of business constraints.</p>

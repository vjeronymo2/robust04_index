			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Survey of Hertfordshire (1): Well placed for recovery - Late last year, the county had the fastest-rising unemployment rate in the UK. Its response, has been swift and well co-ordinated / A new body dedicated to promoting inward investment. Already there are signs of renewed economic activity WHEN BRITAIN held the presidency of the European Community during the second half of last year, three of the key ministerial meetings were held not in London but 25 miles north in the unfamiliar surroundings of Brocket Hall, near Welwyn. The choice of Hertfordshire, and of this historic house, where two Victorian prime ministers, Lords Melbourne and Palmerston, lived and died, was appropriate for more than just the splendour of its conference facilities and parklands, and its high security. Hertfordshire, with its quaint villages favoured by film-makers, its relatively small-scale and successful urban centres, none in excess of 100,000 population, its high-technology employers, and its position close to three of London's four main airports, and astride the motorway network, is a part of Britain which can stand comparison with the more prosperous parts of Europe. Its inhabitants enjoy the second highest per capita income in the UK, and its better-off residents have the opportunity to live in the most expensive property outside London. Those living there include not just City types, such as the current Lord Mayor of London, Sir Francis McWilliams, able to take advantage of good rail links which whisk them into London in 20-30 minutes, but arts and media personalities, including the now reclusive Clockwork Orange director, Stanley Kubrick, who lives in a heavily guarded mansion near Harpenden. Yet, for all its apparent prosperity, not long before Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had begun their talks in the county with their fellow EC ministers, local leaders had themselves been visiting Brussels to ask the industry commissioner, Mr Martin Bangemann, and other officials for aid. Hertfordshire has had to follow the route taken by other councils from more economically depressed regions of Britain, because of the impact on several of its key towns of the decision by British Aerospace to close down its Hatfield site, home in the past to aircraft as famous as: the Mosquito, the World War II fighter-bomber; the Comet, the first commercial jetliner; Trident; the BAe125; and, in more recent years, the BAe146 regional jetliner. A total of 2,300 employees will lose their jobs by the end of this year, following others who have been made redundant in earlier cutbacks at the plant, which, during the mid-1980s, employed 7,500. British Aerospace has also been scaling down other operations within the county in its missile and satellite plants, mainly in Stevenage. The same pressure within the aviation market has forced Rolls-Royce to close its helicopter engine plant at Leavesden, near Watford, in June this year, again with the loss of 2,000 jobs. Even before these job losses were announced, unemployment in Hertfordshire, which had been as low as 2.1 per cent in November 1989, had risen by late last year to near the national average of more than 10 per cent, giving the county the dubious distinction of the fastest-rising unemployment rate in the UK. For a county which has always weathered UK downturns, it represents, in the words of Professor Neil Buxton, Vice Chancellor of the University of Hertfordshire (formerly Hatfield Polytechnic) quite a somersault. Nor has it just been the skilled and unskilled engineering workers who have borne the brunt of these job losses, taking the county unemployment total well above 40,000. The shake-out in the City of London, where banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions have shed thousands of jobs, has hit the county badly. In St. Albans, one in four of the unemployed is from a professional job. The response, however, to the county's problems has been swift and well co-ordinated. With British Aerospace's difficulties already clear some time ago, the county council and the local Training and Enterprise council (Tec) commissioned a study, from accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, of the economy's strengths and weaknesses. From this has emerged a new strategy and a body dedicated to promoting inward investment: the Hertfordshire Development Organisation (HDO). The county's trip to Brussels brought in funds worth Pounds 0.7m from the EC's Perifra programme for helping regions destabilised by large-scale closures - money which will be supplemented by equal funding from the local authorities and the Government-funded Tec. Where previously it had been difficult for developers to get the go-ahead for schemes, because of fears of over-heating the economy, key sites are now being brought forward and marketed. These include some very large parcels of land released from aerospace use. As part of another initiative, a range of organisations, including the chamber of commerce, the county, the university and the Tec, is behind plans for a One Stop Shop, operating from one central and a number of ancillary sites, which will offer support to new and existing businesses. This has now won funding from the Department of Trade and Industry, and is expected to begin operation before the end of the year. The impact these efforts can make is, inevitably, a matter of some debate. Dr Al Rainnie, co-director of the local economic research unit at the university, points to the county's history of relatively slow jobs growth in the 1980s, when it lagged behind other south-east counties - the result, he believes, not just of restrictive planning policies, but of a culture of over-dependence on the then dominant aerospace and defence sectors. He fears that individuals emerging from those industries will not have the entrepreneurial skills that the growing companies of the future will require, and that many of the new jobs that do come into Hertfordshire may pay less well than those being lost, with some erosion of pay levels also resulting from increased contracting out of operations previously handled in-house by big employers. He is also sceptical about whether the county can hope to be more than moderately successful in attracting inward investment, in competition not just with other regions of the UK, able to offer grants and other inducements, but with the low-wage economies of eastern Europe. 'Our expectation is that job growth will be disappointing and that many of the new jobs will not be as good in quality as those they replace,' he argues. The gloom of this view is challenged, however, by both the county and the HDO, which see plentiful signs of the county's continuing attractiveness, as well as some evidence that economic activity has already picked up and the rate of job loss announcements slowed down. Many companies, according to Brian Briscoe, chief executive of the county council, want to be near London but not necessarily within it, and will continue to be attracted to Hertfordshire for its environment, its proximity to airports, its road and rail communications, and the wide range of information technology, engineering, managerial and professional skills it can offer. Mitsubishi Electric is one example quoted of the sort of company which has successfully established itself in the county. Its UK sales, service and warehousing are all located in Hatfield, where it will now be the largest industrial employer following the closure of British Aerospace. Nearby, in Welwyn Garden City, Rank Xerox is establishing its European headquarters. Another recent arrival, Nissan, last year chose Watford for its UK distribution headquarters. Back-office operations continue to be attracted, too, with the latest, Provident Mutual, shortly to open a Pounds 40m new head office in Stevenage, where it will employ 900 people. The prospects for attracting large-scale manufacturing investment are less strong, but, according to Hugh West, chief executive of the HDO, there will be niche products for which Hertfordshire will be the most suitable location, because of skills developed by existing industries - for example, in new materials. Great hopes are being placed, too, on the pharmaceutical industry and related healthcare field, already one of the county's biggest industries, and a sector set to grow even faster in the next century as medical advances accelerate and the population ages. At Stevenage, the biggest building project in the UK, apart from the Channel Tunnel, is under way for Glaxo. This will house an important research and development facility employing up to 1,500 people, including 900 scientists. Even without this, Hertfordshire is one of the main centres for pharmaceutical research in Europe, with SmithKline Beecham, Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme, Roussel-Uclaf, Roche and Astra Laboratories among the leading names drawn, along with Glaxo, to operate in the county because of its proximity to medical research in universities in Oxford, Cambridge and London and to the London teaching hospitals. As part of the same development, the University of Hertfordshire has built up substantial expertise in medical areas. As well as attracting Pounds 1m of industry funding for a medical professorship, it has won contracts to carry out paramedical training and nursing training. It hopes these can be the stepping-stones to a post-graduate medical school, which could link in with other supporting disciplines in medical electronics and bio-sciences, and with the important medico-legal work carried out by its law department. The impact of these developments lies some way in the future, and the rest of the 1990s look like continuing to be much more difficult for prosperous Hertfordshire than the gilded decade before. With its many advantages, compared with more distant locations, it is hard, however, to see Hertfordshire failing to adapt to changing economic circumstances, despite the shocks it has suffered. Hugh West, at the HDO, points to the site in Stevenage which Provident Mutual has occupied as an example of what has happened in the past and will happen again. Less than 50 years ago, it housed heavy engineering, then switched to sophisticated defence activities which have in turn now made way for financial services. Whatever its current problems, it is Hertfordshire's good fortune to be in a part of the country where such changes can take place.</p>

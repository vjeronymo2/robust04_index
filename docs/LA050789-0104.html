			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MIZE SHOOTS A 63 TO TIE WITH LEVI  </P> <P> Perhaps Wayne Levi should have looked at his television schedule.  </P> <P> An unexpected and unusually early starting time threw Levi off his rhythm and  opened the gates to a host of challengers Saturday in the third round of the  $1-million Byron Nelson golf tournament at Dallas.  </P> <P> Levi, who did not have a bogey in the first two rounds, had three in a round of  68 and dropped into a tie for the lead with Larry Mize, who made a 25-foot  birdie putt on the final hole for a 63.  </P> <P> "I didn't check the starting time," Levi said. "I figured noon at the earliest.  Who ever heard of a last starting time of 10:50?"  </P> <P> The unusually early weekend times were scheduled to enable television coverage  to be completed before the start of the Kentucky Derby.  </P> <P> "I don't follow horses," Levi said. "When I found out, I had to rush. I didn't  hit as many balls as I wanted to. I didn't putt as much as I wanted to."  </P> <P> The co-leaders were at 13-under-par 197.  </P> <P> Larry Nelson birdied two of his last three holes and shot a 67 that left him at  198.  </P> <P> Loren Roberts and Dave Rummells were next at 199. Roberts shot a 66 and  Rummells a 67.  </P> <P> Jody Rosenthal made six consecutive birdies to charge into the lead before bad  weather halted play in the second round of the LPGA's Crestar tournament at  Chesapeake, Va., for the second straight day.  </P> <P> Half of the 136-player field was still on the Greenbrier Country Club course  when lightning, rain and an approaching hailstorm forced play suspended with  Rosenthal five under par with seven holes to play.  </P> <P> The non-finishers will complete second-round play this morning, with the final  18 holes to follow.  </P> <P> Saturday's round began with Betsy King and Juli Inkster tied for the lead after  three-under-par 69s Friday.  </P> <P> Inkster, the defending champion, had two birdies and a bogey, leaving her four  under par through seven holes, but King dropped three strokes with a  double-bogey and a bogey on the fifth and sixth holes, and was one under par.  </P> <P> Larry Mowry shot a five-under-par 67 to take a one-stroke lead over Gay Brewer  in a Senior PGA Tour tournament at San Antonio.  </P> <P> Mowry was at 11-under-par 133 after two trips around the Dominion Country Club  course. Brewer, the first-round leader, shot a 69.  </P> <P> Harold Henning, with a 65, and Miller Barber, who shot a 70, were next at 136.  </P></p>

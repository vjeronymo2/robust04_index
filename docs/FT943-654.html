			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fortune Oil back in black Fortune Oil, the oil and gas exploration and production company, could pay its first dividend soon, after reporting interim results showing a return to profit. The group said the recent capital reconstruction had opened the way for 'dividends from future profits' and the board was considering an appropriate dividend policy. However, a decision on a final pay-out had not been taken. Fortune announced after-tax profits of Pounds 578,000 for the six months to June 30 against losses of Pounds 163,000. Turnover jumped from Pounds 226,000 to Pounds 34.1m. Earnings per share were 0.05p (1.63p losses). Mr Daniel Chiu, chief executive, said he was confident the group would show a significant improvement this year. Fortune also said the mooring terminal in Maoming, south China, in which it had a majority stake, would begin operating some time after November. Fortune is more than 47 per cent held by Chinese investors.</p>

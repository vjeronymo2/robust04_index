			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / British Gas offers connection discount to power stations BRITISH GAS has been offering huge discounts on the cost of connecting gas-fired power stations to its pipeline network while claiming publicly that it is discouraging power station business because of a lack of gas. The discounts have angered independent gas suppliers, which accuse the company of making it almost impossible for competing pipelines to be built. Independent power generators say that in negotiations British Gas will often agree to offset half or more of the cost of connecting a new power station to its nation-al gas supply grid - a saving for the generator of Pounds 10m or more which British Gas would expect to recoup in future gas sales. British Gas, however, says it has tried to restrict gas sales to the power generation market by putting up the price of gas. The controversy over pipeline charges is one of the reasons that Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, the industry regulator, has called for British Gas's pipelines operation to be sold. Sir James said recently that effective competition would not be introduced into the UK gas market until British Gas's transportation and storage operation was in separate hands. Ofgas says British Gas's practice of offering allowances towards the cost of generators' pipeline connections defies market logic. 'This is a very murky area at the moment, and it is not clear to us that these marketing allowances offered by British Gas are properly costed,' said Mr Greg McGregor, of Ofgas. There seems to be some confusion at British Gas over the incentives. Mr Philip Rogerson, the company's managing director of finance, was not aware of the offer. 'I would find it astonishing if we did that,' he said. Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica, an independent supply company which has built the only rival pipeline, said: 'How can we expect to compete when they are offering such huge discounts?' He accused British Gas of predatory pricing. The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is reviewing British Gas after a row between the company and its regulator over an appropriate rate of return for its pipeline business. British Gas has insisted that it needs a rate of return of at least 6.8 per cent while Sir James believes it should be between 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent.</p>

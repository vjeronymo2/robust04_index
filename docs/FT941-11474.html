			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Business snubs Clinton health bill The first week of the Clinton administration's renewed drive for healthcare reform has brought a mixture of tactical defeats, victories and draws in its battle for universal coverage. The most significant setback was the decision on Wednesday by the Business Roundtable, an association of 200 prominent corporate heads, to endorse the more modest reform bill sponsored by Congressman Jim Cooper, the Democrat from Tennessee. The White House conceded it was 'disappointed but not surprised' that it had failed in its strenuous efforts to get the association to preserve its previous neutrality. It suggested the Roundtable had been unduly influenced by the arguments of the insurance industry against universal coverage. The Cooper plan is the only alternative which has attracted measurable bipartisan backing in Congress. It does not require universal coverage, though the congressman argues that his blueprint creating insurance purchasing alliances for small businesses, many of whom now provide no coverage, would have virtually the same effect. He also sees many other similarities with the administration approach, including reliance on what is known as 'managed competition.' Its attraction to big business is that it would not force companies to purchase insurance for their employees, nor would it allow the government to put ceilings on insurance premiums, both features of the administration plan. While sticking to his threat to veto any legislation that does not provide universal coverage and while working to prevent a rush of support for the Cooper bill, President Bill Clinton this week has indicated willingness to compromise on other parts of his plan, including employer mandates. This gesture was influential in persuading the nation's governors, meeting in Washington this week, to issue a strong call for passage of healthcare reform this year. But they endorsed none of the plans currently on the table and admitted they were hopelessly divided on whether employers should be required by law to provide insurance. Nevertheless the mood of the governors, plus the evidence of public opinion polls, has already induced a large tactical shift in the Republican position. Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, this week significantly modified his assertion of seven days ago that there was no healthcare crisis in the US and promised to work for reform, even though he predicted 'it won't look like any bill out there now.' Polls taken since the president's State of the Union message last week all indicate majority backing for Mr Clinton's broad goal, but they also reveal much incomprehension. Mr Dole's volte face demonstrates Republican awareness of the problems the party could face if it is perceived to be obstructing the popular will.</p>

He was presenting the ANC's three-pillar  election manifesto at Nasrec, south-west of Johannesburg, which  promises good form of government, a better quality of life for  South Africans and end to crime and violence.    The document is moderate in tone and bases the promises it  makes on a growing economy. Mr Mandela conceded that  implementation and financing of the programme would not be easy.    "Our objective is to use resources more efficiently and not  to increase the tax burden. Large sums of money already go to  education, health and other areas. But the results are poor," Mr  Mandela said.    The ANC would encourage an open and democratic society and  would respect a bill of rights. Government corruption and  dishonesty would not be tolerated.    Turning to the second pillar of the manifesto, Mr Mandela  warned that South Africa's economy would no longer be run for  the benefit of the white minority. The manifesto prioritises job  creation and better incomes in a growing economy, marked by  increased foreign investment, a public works programmes  providing 2.5-million jobs over the next 10 years and more  roads, schools, clininc and houses. Small business would be  encouraged and rural poverty eliminated through development  programmes.    Woman and those earning under R[Rand]4,000 a month are  promised a better tax deal.    The manifesto says the security forces will be refomed to  reflect the national gender and character of South Africa.  "Criminal behaviour in these forces will not be tolerated. Those  serving today will be encouraged to continue in line with the  new culture," the manifesto said.    It promises that with the cooperation of commmunities, an  ANC-government will ensure criminals are dealt with to the full  extent of the law. "The ANC recognises the depth of our  country's crisis. We are convinced that political will, an  environment of peace and stability and a technically sound  programme are a sure foundation for reconstruction and  development.    "The ANC pledges to spare no effort to reach these ideals.  We  are ready to tackle the problems."</p>

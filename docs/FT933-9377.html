			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Observer: Trading down When you have been managing director of Coutts &amp; Co, private bankers to the royal family, what do you do for an encore? Julian Robarts, who spent 34 years in a Coutts' frock coat, has found another family to serve, albeit one with rather less money. He has recently taken over as chief executive of The Iveagh Trustees, which manages what's left of the fortune of the brewing side of the far flung Guinness family. The family stake in Guinness is now down to around 2 per cent. But this is still worth close to Pounds 200m. Robarts, whose family bank had been taken over by Coutts in 1914, parted company with Coutts after its parent National Westminster Bank decided to put one of its own men in charge at the end of 1991. Having had a year off enjoying himself, Robarts decided that 56 was too young to retire from City life. Discreet as ever, Robarts refuses to say much about his new post, save to admit that it is a full-time job. Indeed, the appointment would probably have gone unpublicised had it not been for the fact that Robarts has also taken on the chairmanship of Hill Martin, a small Bristol firm which looks after the finances of wealthy clients.</p>

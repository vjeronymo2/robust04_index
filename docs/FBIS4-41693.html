			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov and </F> Andrey Shitov]    [Text] Moscow, 27 Jun -- "Russia should carry on arms trade  on the same principles on which states in the West engage in  this trade," ITAR-TASS reported today, quoting Sergey Yushenkov,  chairman of the State Duma's defense committee.    Yushenkov described various laws currently in the pipeline  and said that as a result of Western competition, the United  States' share of some 30 percent of world arms trade market in  1987 had now climbed up to almost 60 percent in 1993, as against  Russia's five percent.    Yushenkov also said that Russia had already concluded  contracts to deliver planes to Malaysia worth approximately 600  million dollars this year and that Thailand was interested in  Russian arms and the Russia's Scud system in particular, said to  be much more effective that the Patriot system. Russia was also  trying to enter the Latin American markets, ITAR-TASS said.    Yushenkov praised the Partnership for Peace deal signed by  Russia recently and recalled that "Western Europe has still not  extended the most favored nation status to Russia in full. The  bans, especially those affecting quantity, affected the output  of military industrial enterprises."    Sergey Yushenkov hoped that having now joined the  Partnership  for Peace program Russia would now regain, if only partially,  its previous stature on its traditional Polish, Czech, and  Slovak markets, where there was a need for spare parts for  Russian arms purchased at an earlier stage, ITAR-TASS concluded.</p>

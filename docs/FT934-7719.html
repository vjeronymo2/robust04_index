			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke hit Further downgrades in Ladbroke, including one from joint broker SG Warburg, continued the downward revision begun by Smith New Court, the other house broker, on Tuesday. Although most leisure analysts were hinting at problems at the group's DIY business, Texas Home Care, there was consternation over the continuing downward pressure on the shares. This was underlined by another good performance from Forte, the hotel group's shares opening up their largest ever gap over Ladbroke, the two normally running fairly in parallel. In a strong sector, Ladbroke shed a penny to 156p, the lowest level for more than a year, in big turnover of 12m. Forte climbed 5 to 239p in volume approaching 6m. The stock has been advancing in recent sessions as talk of stronger London bookings have given hopes of improvements in room rates - news that would normally impact favourably on Ladbroke. Analysts are expecting further details on Forte trading on a visit to France today to inspect the group's motorway service station business. A health scare in the Netherlands sent Unigate shares down 12 to 355p. Dutch food group Verenigde Bedrivjen Nutricia, in which Unigate holds a 32.6 per cent stake, announced that it was recalling a consignment of baby food that may possibly be contaminated. As Unigate shares began to fall, hectic trading in Amsterdam led to Nutricia being temporarily suspended. One UK food analyst said the recall could cost Unigate more than Pounds 1m. Last year, Nutricia contributed 15 per cent of Unigate's Pounds 108m profits. United Biscuits gained 8 at 337p, with Smith New Court rumoured to be a buyer. Dalgety added 9 at 448p on news that it is in discussions to buy BP's pet food business. Food retailers were the best performing sector, rallying from their recent bout of weakness. J. Sainsbury jumped 14 to 379p and Tesco 8 1/2 to 195 1/2 p. Property shares were again strong, lifted by results and a positive statement from Land Securities, the UK's biggest property group. Its shares, strong following a James Capel buy note earlier in the week, added 6 at 734p. MEPC advanced 12 to 510p, British Land 8 to 418p and Brixton Estates 5 to 229p. A reversal of recent switching out of National Westminster and into Barclays saw the former race up 12 to 562p on 4.4m traded. Barclays edged up a penny to 585p on 3.1m. A single deal in TSB, where one UK house bought and sold a block of just over 2m shares, left the stock 4 higher at 224p with overall turnover reaching a hefty 9.1m. Pharmaceutical issues benefited in early trade from a strong performance by the sector in New York on Tuesday night. Some gains were trimmed in the afternoon as Wall Street opened easier, but Zeneca gained 10 at 787p and Glaxo 9 at 658p. SmithKline Beecham rose 7 1/2 to 412p as concern over a possible difference of opinion between Mr Bob Bauman, the chief executive, and Mr Jan Leschly, the chief executive designate and current head of the pharmaceuticals division, faded away. Commercial Union added 10 at 606p following the well received third-quarter figures, while General Accident, badly affected by below par results on Tuesday, rallied 13 to 671p. Increased prospects for a cut in UK interest rates after the latest economic data on inflation and retail sales led to a strong burst of buying in high yielding utilities stocks. In the regional electricity issues, South Wales jumped 17 to 657p while Yorkshire rose 10 to 622p. Northern Ireland Electricity climbed 6 1/2 to 199 1/2 p. The FT-SE 100's four water stocks made excellent progress. Anglian rose 9 to 515p and Severn Trent 8 to 525p. The oil and gas sector's two cold weather stocks, British Gas and Calor Group, were the brightest performers in a generally strong sector. Gas moved up 7 to 328 1/2 p following a buy recommendation from Kleinwort Benson, who said the recent fall in the shares was overdone. The broker added that Gas now yields more than three-month money and that given Kleinwort's expectation of rising production profits and further cost cutting the stock is attractive. Gas reports third-quarter results today. Kleinwort, along with most leading brokers, forecasts a loss of Pounds 200m on a historic cost basis. Calor Group, always boosted by cold snaps in UK weather, advanced 11 to 293p. PowerGen's purchase of a 3.9 per cent stake in the Liverpool Bay oil and gas development from Monument Oil &amp; Gas continued to drive Monument shares, a shade higher at 56p, but also produced another firm showing by Lasmo - also heavily involved in Liverpool Bay - which hardened to 134p. Enterprise made good progress, closing 9 ahead at 462p. Recent encouraging drilling news helped Pict Petroleum add a further 4 at 158p.</p>

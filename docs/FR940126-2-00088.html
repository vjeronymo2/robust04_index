			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Agreement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order to achieve satisfactory cleanup of the HMC site, NRC and EPA agree to do the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in the oversight of reclamation and remedial activity at the HMC site. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. EPA will review the amendments to the site reclamation plan (``the plan'') and will provide comments to NRC. NRC will review and, if necessary, require revisions to the plan to assure conformance to 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, as amended, prior to approving the plan via license amendments. NRC will provide EPA with copies of all license amendments which affect the site closure plan prior to issuance for comment. If no comments are received within 30 calendar days, NRC will issue the amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. If EPA determines that remedial actions are deficient or unsatisfactory, then EPA shall provide notice to NRC of the deficiency. NRC shall assume the lead role for notification to HMC, except for such notification as EPA might statutorily be required to provide in certain events. The notification shall specify a time period within which regulatory compliance is expected to be achieved. Should compliance not be achieved in this time period, EPA will assume the lead for taking or seeking any enforcement action within its area of regulatory responsibility and NRC will assume the lead for any enforcement actions necessary within its area of regulatory responsibility. Both Parties reserve all rights under this MOU to take whatever actions are determined to be necessary, including the conduct of remedial actions within and outside the disposal area, in order to fulfill their regulatory requirements. In any event, no actions affecting site remediation will be taken by either Party without prior consultation with the other Party. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Both Parties shall appoint a facility coordinator who shall be responsible for oversight of the implementation of this MOU and the activities required herein. The facility coordinators shall be appointed by each Party within seven (7) days of the effective date of this MOU. Each Party has the right to appoint a new facility coordinator at any time. Such a change shall be accomplished by notifying the other Party, in writing, at least five (5) days prior to the appointment, of the name, telephone number, and mailing address of said facility coordinator. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Parties will meet periodically at the request of either Party and at least semiannually insofar as it is necessary to accomplish the objectives of this MOU. The facility coordinators should communicate with each other on a routine basis by telephone. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The Parties will provide technical advice and any necessary regulatory consultation to one another upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The Parties will generally provide each other with copies of all official correspondence and documents related to remedial actions at the site. The Parties will also normally provide copies of other information upon request. In the event that one of the Parties does not wish to furnish certain specific information, documents, or correspondence to the other, then said material shall be identified to the other Party along with the reasons for withholding it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Whenever notice or information is required to be forwarded by one party to another under the terms of this MOU, it shall be given by and directed to the individuals at the addresses specified as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> EPA: Director, Hazardous Waste Management Division (6H), U.S. EPA, Region 6, 1445 Ross Avenue, suite 1200, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NRC: Director, Uranium Recovery Field Office, Region IV, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, P.O. Box 25325, Denver, Colorado 80225. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 9. Routine communications may be exchanged verbally, in person, or by telephone between the Parties to facilitate the orderly conduct of work contemplated by this MOU.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. EPA enforcement documentation provided under this MOU will be kept as exempt material by EPA and NRC, to the extent legally possible, according to the policies and procedures under 40 CFR part 2 and 10 CFR part 2.790, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The Parties shall notify each other of any pending visits to the HMC property which relate to the site closure plan. To the extent that they are otherwise authorized to do so, either Party and their consultants may, at their option, accompany the other Party on such visits. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> V. Agency Responsibilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. NRC Responsibilities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. NRC will ensure that the owners/operators of the HMC uranium mill implement an approved reclamation plan that meets all relevant NRC requirements, including 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, as amended. The reclamation plan will require HMC to assure long-term stability of the tailings, reduce gamma radiation to background levels, and diminish radon exhalation to appropriate regulatory standards. If any part of such plan is not complied with by HMC, NRC will take whatever actions it deems appropriate to ensure compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. NRC will ensure that the owners/operators of the HMC uranium mill implement a compliance monitoring program for hazardous constituents that meets all relevant NRC requirements, including 10 CFR part 40, Appendix A, for the establishment of ground water protection standards and points of compliance. NRC will verify implementation by HMC of any required compliance monitoring and/or ground water corrective action at the HMC uranium mill site resulting from the establishment of ground water protection standards as soon as such is reviewed and accepted by NRC. If any ground water requirements are not complied with by HMC, NRC will take appropriate action to ensure compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. NRC will direct HMC to provide both Parties with copies of major work product submittals as they become available. Such work products will include a reclamation plan and any other plans and specifications for assessment, remediation, and monitoring, including all analytical data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. NRC agrees to provide EPA with progress reports on HMC's remediation, semiannually. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. NRC will assist in the development of information to support EPA's deletion of the site from the NPL upon completion of the remedial action, if appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

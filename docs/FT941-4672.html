			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Technology: New tools, old-style newspaper The convergence of the computer, broadcasting and publishing industries into the multimedia sector has led many pundits to predict the demise of traditional newspapers and magazines. While this may be premature, a number of companies are already exploring alternatives to existing news and magazine formats. Newsweek has launched a quarterly interactive CD-Rom video magazine. Hearst plans to launch on-line computer services tied to magazines like Popular Mechanics, House Beautiful and Good Housekeeping. On-line electronic news services are sprouting up everywhere. One of the most ambitious projects is a computerised newspaper being put together by Knight-Ridder, the US-based wire service and newspaper group. Knight-Ridder's approach is unusual in that it attempts to incorporate new technology into today's newspaper format, rather than vice versa. The company's Info Design Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado has novel views on what readers' preferences will be in the next century. While others are rapidly discarding today's formats in the race towards the future, Knight-Ridder's maxim is that its new electronic newspaper should resemble an old-fashioned newspaper as much as possible. Much of today's research into electronic newspapers, such as that of the Media Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, concentrates on filtering information. For instance, an avid sports reader might elect to receive news electronically on that subject alone. Knight-Ridder, however, thinks it is essential to maintain a human editor who packages a set of articles. Roger Fidler, who is in charge of the project, says the information age is in danger of over-filtering information. 'We want to maintain the reader's ability to browse, and we want to build the branded identity of the 'Daily Us'.' The Info Design Lab plans to begin tests of its product on personal computers by the end of the year. However, the company is counting on a new generation of hand-held, keyboard-free computers to make its product available to the mass market. These would be light and easily portable. 'I don't think the formula of having people read their news on the television or a back-lit computer screen has worked,' says Fidler. 'We are looking to use computer tablets, the size of a magazine. New resolution and new types of liquid crystal make them easier to read. Really, they resemble a magazine to the reader.' In the vision of Knight-Ridder, consumers could subscribe to this newspaper or buy it at a newsstand, as they would today. The difference is that they would receive the newspaper electronically over the wire at night or in the morning purchase a memory card, about the size of a credit card, which could be inserted into the hand-held device. This formula prevents constant news updates, a service many see as essential to compete in the new multimedia age. Fidler, however, believes that consumers are uncomfortable with updates throughout the day. 'It would make people feel they're always missing something.' The Knight-Ridder electronic newspaper will make in-depth information available. By touching the screen, consumers will be able to reveal story stacks, and additional information such as charts, tables and videos. Even advertisements will be stacked in layers to entice the consumer. Readers will be able to obtain additional information about a product, activate video commercials and order products with a built-in device.</p>

			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Slough Estates drops to Pounds 29m SLOUGH ESTATES, the UK's largest industrial property company, yesterday announced a 14.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Pounds 28.8m for the six months ended June 30. Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman, was cautiously optimistic about the group's prospects, saying that there had been a 'significant' increase in inquiries for space. 'As economic recovery becomes more evident and business confidence returns, so I become more optimistic of the medium-term prospects of the group for both improved property occupancy and values,' he said. The profit decline mainly reflected a reduction in the amount of interest capitalised. Profit before interest and tax rose 18 per cent to Pounds 57.2m. FRS 3, the new accounting standard on reporting financial performance, required Slough to recognise Pounds 2m of profit from investment property sales. The standard defines profits on disposal of investment properties in the profit and loss account as the difference between the net proceeds of the sale and the prior year-end book value. At June 30, the group had net borrowings of Pounds 663m and shareholders' equity, based on December 1992 valuations, of about Pounds 1.07bn. Net gearing was 62 per cent, compared with 83 per cent at end-1992. The Pounds 147m rights issue in March was 87 per cent taken up. Earnings per share fell from 6.5p to 4.4p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 3.1p. COMMENT Slough Estate's share price, which closed 1p down at 241p, has nearly tripled in value over the past year, reflecting a sea change in sentiment towards the sector. A year ago, Slough was cutting its dividend and worrying about the dim prospects for any short-term improvement in the property market. Yesterday, it was pointing to a sustained improvement in business confidence and a significant increase in inquiries for space, making it sufficiently optimistic to plan a new speculative development on its Slough trading estate. Nonetheless, anyone looking for hard evidence of an improvement in the underlying property market in yesterday's results would be disappointed. In the UK, occupancy rates actually fell as success in letting new buildings was offset by tenant failures and lease expiries. The likelihood of slow, if steady, progress on the letting front will restrict Slough's scope to increase its dividend for several years. That leaves potential investors with a solid, but unexciting, prospect of a near-average yield for the sector and a share price that is at a slight discount to the company's likely year-end net asset value.</p>

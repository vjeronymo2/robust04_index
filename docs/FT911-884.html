			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Morris appeal on inter-union disputes MR Bill Morris, deputy general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, yesterday called for changes in the TUC's Bridlington rules governing inter-union disputes as union leaders met to discuss the future of the TUC. Mr Morris said events in the past few years had shown that the Bridlington rules were 'ripe for review'. He said they should be examined independently by an impartial expert who could suggest changes to bring them up to date. The call indicates growing pressure on the Bridlington rules, which have been at the centre of controversy in a number of disputes involving the TGWU. They include the dispute over Ford's proposed components plant at Dundee. Mr Morris made his remarks in London at a conference called to discuss how the TUC should operate. Changes in the way it and its member unions operate will be considered at the Trades Union Congress in Glasgow in September. The rules, which set out how unions may compete for membership within companies, have been criticised by a number of rightwing unions and led to the expulsion from the TUC of the EETPU electricians' union in 1988. Mr Morris's call indicates that there is now some leftwing disquiet about the rules, which have also been criticised by Mr George Wright, the other main contender to become the next general secretary of the TGWU. The rules were defended by Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the RMT transport union. Mr Knapp said there had to be a 'discipline of approach' and the TUC should 'not be in the business of free market unionism'. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said unions had achieved a lot, but the pressures from competition and from some employers 'increasingly put individuals in exposed position, and we find it difficult to protect them'.</p>

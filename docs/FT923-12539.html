			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / International Company News: Hewlett chief retires after 14 years MR JOHN YOUNG, president and chief executive of Hewlett- Packard, is to retire after 14 years at the helm of the US computer and electronics company. He will be replaced by Mr Lewis Platt, currently HP's executive vice-president and head of the computer systems division. Mr Young is leaving HP on a high note. His departure comes as the company is enjoying an earnings surge that has defied the computer industry slowdown. For the first half of its fiscal year, HP reported a 44 per cent increase in earnings on revenues of Dollars 8bn. Although sooner than expected, Mr Young's retirement had been planned; a succession committee was formed two years ago to choose the company's third chief executive. Mr Young succeeded co-founder, Mr David Packard, as president in 1977 and chief executive in 1978. 'Fifteen years as a chief executive at a Fortune 50 company is a long time. I believe that organisations can benefit from fresh leadership,' Mr Young said yesterday. 'It is time to move on. During my tenure, HP has gone from a Dollars 1.3bn company that was mostly in measurement and test instruments and hand held calculators, to become what will this year probably be more than Dollars 16bn in revenues, with 70 per cent in computers and almost 60 per cent outside the United States.' Mr Young's successor, Mr Lewis Platt, had been seen as one of two favourites for the position. The other, Mr Richard Hackborn, remains executive vice-president in charge of HP's computer products organisation. Mr Platt, 51, has been at HP for 26 years in a variety of positions. Most recently, he headed HP's computer systems group. In recent years he has played a key role in HP's growth in the workstation and multi-user computer markets. Also announcing his retirement plans yesterday was Mr Dean Morton, HP chief operating officer. No successor was named to this position. Mr Young and Mr Morton are retiring under the company's officer early retirement policy.</p>

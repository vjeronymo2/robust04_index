			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Measurement an irony of fund management IT HAS been an irony of index fund management that the total returns of fund managers depended to a certain extent on just who was measuring. Thus, the daily publication starting today of the FT-SE and FT-Actuaries indices showing total returns represents an effort by the two main performance measurement services to agree on the best way to measure it. For the 1992 calendar year, for instance, Combined Actuarial Performance Services calculated the total return of the FT-A All-Share Index at 20.6 while WM Company, its leading competitor, calculated it at 20.4 per cent. In previous years, the divergence has been as wide as 0.4 per cent - a significant divergence for fund managers who promise to track the index within 0.1 per cent of its total return. 'It is all about accountability,' said Mr James Woodlock, managing director of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, the UK's largest index-tracking fund manager. 'I have frequently been asked at trustee meetings to explain the divergence between our own performance and that of the index,' he said. The most significant factor has been the assumptions made about reinvestment. 'If I know how the index is calculated, I can run my reinvestment on that same basis.' Thus, publication of clearly defined and uniform criteria may cause some shifts in the way passive index-tracking fund managers handle assets under their control. Mr John Clamp, chief executive of CAPS, said that the chief distortion in calculations of total returns may have come during periods when dividends were rising sharply. 'The use of gross dividend yield in a period when dividends are rising sharply will underestimate the total return.' CAPS intends to retroactively calculate its indices back to 1987 so that pension fund trustees may form a different view of performance, he said.</p>

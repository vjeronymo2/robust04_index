			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Pit strike threat to Yeltsin's poll hopes A strike which spread yesterday across three regions in Russia's coal industry could undermine President Boris Yeltsin's election campaign in the last days before the poll. More than 30,000 miners in the Arctic coal basin of Vorkuta were joined yesterday by thousands of workers in the Urals and in northern Siberia All but one of Vorkuta's 13 mines were closed yesterday, along with four mines in northern Siberia, as the Independent Miners' Union called out its members to protest against non-payment of wages and a range of other complaints. Only a small proportion of the workers in the industry have joined the strike but Mr Yeltsin, facing parliamentary elections on December 12, has traditionally enjoyed strong support among miners. Strikers are also demanding a government reshuffle. Miners in the main Russian coalfield of the Kuzbass were considering joining the strike today, according to Mr Sultan Mamedov, deputy president of the IMU. The news agency Interfax reported last night that pit leaders would decide today. Mr Yuri Shatyrenko, deputy labour minister, said last night the government working group which is dealing with the miners' demands had settled most of them. He said: 'In my view, these strikes are illegal - they were called while negotiations were still being held.' The strike could bring power cuts later in the year because the early onset of a severe winter has greatly raised energy demand. The strikers, who had produced a list of 25 demands, are most aggrieved over long delays in wages payments and in the rapidly worsening situation in the coalfields - as rail tariffs for coal carriage soar, increasing the indebtedness of the pits and the insecurity of the miners. The government has recently proposed a programme of closures of more than 40 pits nationwide, including four of the 13 in Vorkuta, an area almost wholly dependent on the mines. A new Finance and Industry Group has been established and charged by Mr Yeltsin with the task of 'furthering the reconstruction of the Russian economy, accelerating scientific and technical progress and raising the export and competitive potential of Russian enterprises'. Mr Yeltsin's decree establishing the group also orders the state committees for industrial policy and for property to set up two 'experimental' financial-industrial groups - an apparent attempt to create large industrial holdings with their own banks and investment houses along Japanese lines, a route favoured by many industrialists. Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, has been admitted to hospital for treatment for a kidney ailment. His press spokesman said his condition was not serious and he would be back at work soon.</p>

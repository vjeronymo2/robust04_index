			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: France The Paris bourse is being torn between fear and greed. It is uncertain which emotion will prevail. The recent whiff of corruption in the business world, which is rapidly developing into a stench, has been offending international investors. Companies accounting for some 16 per cent of the CAC 40's capitalisation have been tainted by one form of scandal or another. Many of the allegations may prove unfounded but the damage to sentiment will persist. The CAC 40 has already fallen 18 per cent this year, substantially underperforming the German and UK markets. It is not easy to see that trend quickly reversing itself as political uncertainties mount ahead of next May's presidential elections. Nevertheless, investors with steely nerves and long time horizons may sniff a chance to buy shares on the cheap. Political rows and corruption scandals are unlikely to knock corporate earnings. Significantly, perhaps, the savaging of Alcatel's shares on Monday was followed by a sharp rebound the following day. The French economy also appears to be coming good. The statistics office yesterday confirmed industrial production had risen 2.1 per cent in April. That may have owed much to a fiscal stimulation package revving up the car market in particular. But many other industrial groups, which have squirrelled away provisions during recession, could well produce some surprisingly good earnings gains.</p>

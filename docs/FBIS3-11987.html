The decision was made by the Ministries of Finance,  Planning, and Mines and Energy, which approved the Furnas  Electric Power Plants, Inc. report on the need to finish the  construction work. Furnas President Marcelo Siqueira on 24 March  confirmed the news to this newspaper.    The construction cost is calculated at $1.5 billion. The  Brazilian Electric Power Company, Inc. and Furnas will have to  contribute the rest of the money. "This resumption is not  inflationary; we will not receive any money from the Treasury,"  Siqueira said.    According to him, Furnas will begin to publish the public  bid  documents for completion of Angra-2's construction in the next  15 days. He said the plant's civil work is practically finished  and only the equipment still has to be assembled. This equipment  -- most of it purchased from Germany and some of it manufactured  in Brazil -- has been stored in warehouses at the Angra nuclear  complex.    Ayrton Caiuby, director of the CNEN [National Nuclear Energy  Commission], said that in the next few days, CNEN members will  meet to decide the date when Angra-1 will be put into operation.</p>

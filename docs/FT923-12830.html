			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / International Company News: AMR Dollars 166m loss an 'enormous disappointment' AMR, parent company of American Airlines and one of the 'big three' carriers in the US, yesterday led what is likely to be a dismal quarterly reporting season for the nation's airline industry with a Dollars 166m loss after tax in the three months to end-June. Mr Robert Crandall, American's chairman, described the figures as 'an enormous disappointment' - and pinned the blame on domestic fare wars, plus rising fuel costs. 'Operating results were very adversely affected by the need to match discounted fares of our competition,' he said, 'and secondly, by continuing increases in fuel prices.' Part of the deficit came from one-off items - a Dollars 109m provision on a now-suspended hotel and car reservation system project, and Dollars 9m to cover American's share of a recent class action settlement, centring on price-fixing allegations. But even without these items, AMR would have posted an after-tax loss of Dollars 48m, or 64 cents a share, compared with a Dollars 10m profit in the same three months a year earlier. At the operating level, there was a small profit, but a 14.1 per cent rise in operating expenses year-on-year, to Dollars 3.53bn, easily outweighed the 12.3 per increase in revenues at Dollars 3.59bn. In April, American tried to overhaul domestic ticket pricing by eliminating its numerous discount offers in favour of a four-tier fare system. Yesterday, Mr Crandall admitted the initiative had been undermined: 'Our competitors have chosen to continue filing many different fares, thus proliferating complexity and preventing 'value pricing' from working as it should. Thus, despite strong traffic growth in the second quarter, yield declined by 3.6 per cent - a very unfortunate result,' he said. The Dallas-based company was one of only two US carriers to make a profit in the first three months of 1992. However, the second-quarter deficit means AMR is now posting a net loss of Dollars 146m for the first half, on revenues of Dollars 7.09bn. In the first six months of 1991, there was a Dollars 185m deficit, on revenues of Dollars 5.96bn. AMR had already warned of a second-quarter loss and, in the event, the airline's operating results were better than some pundits had feared. Shares in AMR itself rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 65 1/2 yesterday, and other carriers' stocks also enjoyed a modest rally. Delta was up Dollars 1 1/2 at Dollars 56 7/8 and UAL gained Dollars 2 at Dollars 116 1/4.</p>

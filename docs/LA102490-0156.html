			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TROOPS SEAL OFF ISRAELI BORDERS TO PALESTINIANS  </P> <P> Israeli troops sealed the borders of the occupied territories today in an  effort to curb a wave of bloody revenge attacks by Arabs and Jews.  </P> <P> An order from Defense Minister Moshe Arens banned the nearly 1.7 million  Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from entering Israel after attacks  on Tuesday left two Arabs dead and seven people wounded.  </P> <P> In Jerusalem, tensions over the killings of Palestinians on the Temple Mount on  Oct. 8 increased with the death today of a 20th Arab victim.  </P> <P> Police sources and family members said Salim Ahmad Khaldi, 18, was apparently  shot by an Israeli civilian on a street near the holy site during the melee.  </P> <P> Hospital officials said another Arab also died today of beating wounds suffered  at the hands of Israelis after he stabbed two women soldiers Tuesday.  </P> <P> A general strike was called in Arab East Jerusalem, and activists ordered  merchants in the main Arab shopping streets and the narrow alleys of the Old  City to close.  </P> <P> In an interview on army radio, Arens denied that confining Palestinians to the  territories amounted to returning to the 1967 border before Israel captured the  land.  </P> <P> He said he hoped Palestinians would realize "that persisting in these violent  attacks will only increase the tragedy of the Palestinian people."  </P> <P> Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh said the order would "last for several  days" and should not seriously affect the troubled Israeli economy.  </P> <P> At the Erez crossing into the Gaza Strip, thousands of Palestinians arrived  today in private cars, taxis and buses. Many carried suitcases or makeshift  bundles as they were loaded into buses and trucks to go home.  </P></p>

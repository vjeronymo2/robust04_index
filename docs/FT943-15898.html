			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Joint authority for Ulster ruled out The Republic of Ireland is seeking 'the closest possible links between a Northern Ireland administration and the Irish government', but this would not amount to joint administration with London, Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, said yesterday. Speaking in Dublin to businessmen from both sides of the border, his comments were made in response to recent criticisms from Unionists in Northern Ireland that the current bilateral talks between the two governments are aimed at establishing a joint authority. Mr Spring said that a joint authority 'is not on the Irish government's agenda'. Deeper economic co-operation, however, would be encouraged. It would be 'realistic' to double current cross-border trade of IPounds 1.3bn (Pounds 1.28bn) a year to IPounds 3bn. In spite of deep political divisions 'there are very few who will contest the view that Ireland makes sense as a single economic area,' said Mr Spring. The Irish government wanted 'strong, meaningful and dynamic' cross-border structures to promote this goal and the two governments were looking at the prospects for co-operation in transport, health, energy, trade and tourism 'and other areas'. He said the continuing violence imposed a 'huge burden' on both the UK and Irish economies and impeded progress in economic co-operation. It was imperative 'that those who engage in violence on both sides should cease to inflict this intolerable burden on their fellow citizens'. Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, has meanwhile been pouring cold water on growing expectations of an extended IRA ceasefire in the summer or autumn. Mr Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein president, said: 'The present intense speculation . . . is unhelpful and misinformed'. He added: 'Peace is not simply an IRA ceasefire. The peace process must address all of the issues which lie at the heart of the conflict.' These included a lifting of the broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein, an end to 'economic inequalities' for Roman Catholics and 'the speedy release' of all long-term IRA prisoners. Sinn Fein is due to give its definitive response to the Downing Street declaration within the next two to three weeks.</p>

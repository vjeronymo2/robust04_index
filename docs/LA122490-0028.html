			<p><P> December 24, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ON CAMPUS : VALLEY COLLEGE;  </P> <P> CLASS TAKES 'DONAHUE APPROACH'  </P> <P> Instructors of a speech class at Valley College that satisfies a state  requirement for analytical-thinking credit follow what they call the "Phil  Donahue approach to teaching."  </P> <P> The course, taught by a method similar to that of a television talk show,  generates student participation through discussions of current events no matter  how controversial.  </P> <P> Subjects range from the Middle East crisis to the Milli Vanilli lip-sync  scandal.  </P> <P> Professors Jack Sterk and Jim Marteney developed the idea for the course --  called Speech 104 -- about 10 years ago when the state added a  critical-thinking class to college graduation requirements.  </P> <P> Both teach the course with the hopes of triggering responses from their  students and using that feedback to illustrate the techniques of argumentation  and persuasion.  </P> <P> "Our goal is to engage information and make students respond and react. We want  them to critically examine the situation," Marteney said.  </P> <P> "We aggravate students in class because of the issues we talk about, but what  we really look for is for the students to challenge themselves and defend  themselves," he said.  </P> <P> Marteney said the idea is to encourage student participation.  </P> <P> "No one class is going to radically change a person, but we generally want the  student to change and examine critically the methods of argumentation," he  said.  </P> <P> Although the course is popular with students, it is not easy, its teachers  said.  </P> <P> "Speech 104 is a hard class because it makes students think," Sterk said.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F> Information Department, by Salah Salamah in the studio on 24  February--recorded]    [Text] [Salamah] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron has  shocked the occupied territory and alerted all Palestinian  forces in and outside the occupied territory. What is the  latest information about the number of casualties?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] So far, more than 60 Palestinian martyrs have  fallen in Hebron and more than 270 Palestinians have been  injured. The Israeli Army is participating with the settlers in  the killing operations and in collective terrorism against the  Palestinian people in steadfast Hebron. Clearly, this crime was  well-planned.    [Salamah] In fact, some say the massacre is the work of one  man, but other reports say it was an organized massacre. What  information do you have about this?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Such a great number of martyrs and wounded  cannot have fallen as a result of one man's work. A great  number of settlers entered the Ibrahimi Mosque. They were armed  and they entered under the eyes of the Israeli Army which, has  strict security measures in place at all entrances to the  Ibrahimi Mosque. These settlers opened fire on the worshipers  while they were prostrated during dawn prayers. Therefore, all  indications are that the operation was a large-scale one aimed  at creating large-scale terror and fear. Palestinians in all  areas are now confronting this crime and its perpetrators with  all their resources. These murderers and criminals must be  confronted with all our resources.    [Salamah] Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, in your opinion, will this  pogrom affect the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the  PLO?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] It is clear now that the presence of the  settlers and settlements in the heart of Palestinian territory  is a time bomb that explodes every now and then to kill more  people. Therefore, it is clear that no actual peace, either in  a provisional or in a final form, will be achieved while the  settlements are in existence.    [Salamah] Does this mean that during its current  negotiations  with Israel, the PLO will present the problem of the settlements  that will remain in the Gaza Strip after the Israeli withdrawal?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Not just the issue of the settlements in the  Gaza Strip.    [Salamah] I mean at this particular stage, Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Yes, I am talking about this stage. All the  Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories are  an obstacles on the path of any arrangements to make peace.  Therefore, the existence of the settlements is the point at  issue now. No actual peace will be accepted with the presence  of the settlers and these murderous gangs, who will destroy not  only the peace process but the way of life of the Palestinian  people. These have always been their aims. It has proven to be  the same today.    [Salamah] Mr. 'Abd-Rabbuh, what possible measures might the  PLO take to face the possibility of similar massacres in the  occupied territories?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] As I have said, there is the issue of the  existence of settlers. We must confront this existence by all  means and resources. The issue of ending the existence of the  settlements must be at the forefront of the issues that will be  considered with the aim of realizing steps toward a just and  real peace. Moreover, we have presented this urgent issue to  the UN Security Council to take urgent measures so the UN  Security Council will reiterate that the existence of the  settlements is illegitimate and that they must be removed from  occupied Palestinian territory, and also to provide  international protection for the Palestinian people. Within  this framework, we appeal to all the forces that wish to see  peace, and to the Arab and Islamic worlds, to shoulder real  responsibility along side of the Palestinian people in these  difficult circumstances.    I repeat here that the Palestinian people will know how to  confront this massacre. Those who committed it will pay a real  price in exchange for every drop of Palestinian blood.    [Salamah] Thank, You, 'Abd-Rabbuh.    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Thank You.</p>

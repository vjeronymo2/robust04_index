			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 667.21(b) is revised to require that if a referred institution was not otherwise required to keep records relating to its compliance with State standards, and it did not keep those records, the SPRE allow the institution a reasonable period of time to obtain those records to enable it to demonstrate its compliance with the State's standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Relationship Between Tuition-and-Fee Charges and Remuneration <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters objected to the proposal that a State establish an acceptable percentage for the relationship between the tuition and fees charged by an institution for an educational program and the amount of money that a student who successfully completes that program actually earns. A number of commenters believed strongly that this approach would be administratively unmanageable for comprehensive institutions that offer a broad spectrum of programs, including programs in liberal arts, sciences, teacher education, engineering, and nursing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters believed that the Secretary does not have the authority under the statute to require a SPRE to make a judgment regarding the reasonableness of the tuition and fees charged by an institution. Many of these commenters contended that the standard, as proposed in the NPRM, was tantamount to price-fixing. The commenters argued that this standard, as articulated in the statute, simply requires an institution to disclose to students and prospective students information on program costs and on earnings that a graduate of that program could reasonably be expected to make in an occupation related to that program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other commenters asserted that relating the amount of tuition and fees to the amount of money a graduate of an educational program earns assumes incorrectly that (1) the institution alone is responsible for a student's education and employment, and (2) salary is the only reason for education. The commenters pointed out that a student is also responsible for his or her education and that the student may choose a job that is rewarding in ways other than money. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A few commenters pointed out that States sometimes establish the tuition and fees for certain programs at public institutions. The commenters urged the Secretary to exempt these programs from this standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters contended that States do not have adequate data on wages and salaries either to establish an acceptable percentage or determine that an institution met that percentage. These commenters were concerned that the results of surveys conducted by an institution of its graduates' earnings would not be reliable. Finally, many commenters argued that any formula governing the relationship between tuition and remuneration consider State subsidies provided to public institutions to ensure a fair comparison of tuition and fees between like programs offered by all types of institutions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters agreed with the proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary notes that this requirement only applies to vocational programs and therefore does not apply to programs such as liberal arts programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary acknowledges that commenters are correct when they note that many variables influence whether a person obtains a particular job. However, the Secretary believes that one of the most important factors is the job training of that individual. Further, institutions that purport to offer education to prepare students for occupations ought to be able to substantiate that the education they provide does just that. In addition, for students who receive loans for their education, it is reasonable to expect that they will qualify for positions that will enable them to repay those loans. For these reasons, the Secretary disagrees with the commenters who categorized this standard merely as a student consumer information disclosure requirement or that it is tantamount to price fixing. More appropriately, under this standard, a SPRE must determine whether an institution's tuition and fees are too high, given the remuneration that its graduates can reasonably expect to receive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, based on public comment and further review, the Secretary has decided that an institution should not be required to survey its graduates to obtain employment and wage data; rather, a SPRE may rely on local, State, or Federal employment and wage data to determine the institution's compliance with this standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

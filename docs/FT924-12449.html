			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Wagon raises Pounds 31m for European acquisition WAGON Industrial Holdings, the Telford-based engineering group, is to buy Polypal, a Belgian manufacturer of storage equipment, for Pounds 32.3m and finance the acquisition with a fully underwritten 1-for-4 rights issue at 335p, raising a net Pounds 30.8m, writes Paul Cheeseright, Midlands Correspondent. The rights price is 25p below the lowest level at which the shares have traded this year. Yesterday they fell 12p to 396p. The rights is also available to convertible holders on a 1-for-14 basis. Wagon, which specialises in materials handling, precision engineering and automotive components, also announced a rise in pre-tax profits for the six months to September 30 to Pounds 8.52m, against Pounds 6.02m which was struck after Pounds 2m exceptional costs for factory rationalisation. The interim dividend is maintained at 6.325p and an unchanged final of 10.675p is forecast on the capital enlarged by the rights issue of 9.89m shares. Earnings per share came out at 15.08p (9.71p) basic or 14.56p (10.12p) fully diluted. Polypal is the largest of the series of acquisitions Wagon has made since the beginning of the recession. It comes with Pounds 6m of net cash, but has been bought as a means of expanding Wagon's presence in the European materials handling sector. It gives a complementary line of products, manufactured in Liege, and a distribution network in France, Germany and the Netherlands to supplement the existing Wagon presence in Spain and the UK. In the half year to last June, Polypal's pre-tax profits were static at BFr92m (Pounds 1.8m) on turnover little changed at BFr881m. Wagon expects it to contribute Pounds 1m to its 1992-93 pre-tax profits. In the first half Wagon drew the benefit both of the cost cutting exercises for which it paid in 1991-92 and of the small acquisitions it has been making to bolster its existing lines of business. Turnover improved to Pounds 114.4m (Pounds 114m). The company said that immediate market prospects were not encouraging. After a demand spurt in the spring, UK orders had reverted to 1991 levels, while in continental Europe uncertainty remained after the effective revaluation of the D-Mark. COMMENT Wagon has ridden the recession with more aplomb than most. The record of quick adaptation and the quiet expansion of an ungeared business promise a lift in this year's pre-tax profits to about Pounds 19m against Pounds 14.1m in 1992. This makes the rights issue, supported by a forecast maintained dividend look fairly priced. Earnings per share on the enlarged capital should come out at about 25.5p, compared with 23.79p, putting the shares on a prospective p/e of 15.5. This may look slightly high for the sector, but then Wagon is faring better than most of its peers.</p>

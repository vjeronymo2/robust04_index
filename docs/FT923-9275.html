			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Highveld down 34% due to poor markets THE RECESSION in South Africa and weak international markets caused Highveld Steel and Vanadium's attributable profits to drop by 34 per cent to R31m (Dollars 11m) in the six months to the end of June. The metals manufacturer, which is an associate of the Anglo American group, is cutting its interim dividend to 20 cents a share from 30 cents a year earlier, following a 46 per cent drop in earnings per share to 35.1 cents from 65.3 cents. Earnings were diluted by the issue of new shares to fund Highveld's 50 per cent stake in the Columbus stainless steel project. Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, said poor market conditions and the uncertain socio-political climate meant that second-half earnings would 'at best' equal those of the first. Turnover rose by 7.4 per cent to R696.2m from R648.2m, but weaker margins saw pre-tax profits fall by 28.5 per cent to R35.9m from R50.2m. Attributable profits fell to R31m from R47.2m. Mr Boyd said the prolonged South African economic downturn had had a serious impact on the construction industry and capital investment in general. These factors, and high merchant inventories, caused a 'substantial decline' in Highveld's domestic steel sales. The absence of large industrial projects and a weak order book suggested this position was likely to continue in the second half. International steel markets remained weak with consumption and prices predicted to fall. Consumption and prices of vanadium - Highveld is the world's largest producer - have also fallen. Mr Boyd said the board had approved the R2.5bn Columbus project, a joint venture with Samancor, the South African ferrochrome producer. Talks with the authorities about incentives and funding must still be finalised.</p>

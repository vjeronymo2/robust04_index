			<p><P> March 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ARTS PANEL VOTES TO RESTORE $19,000 OPERA PACIFIC CUT  </P> <P> Opera Pacific stands to be $19,000 better off after the California Arts Council  approved a new procedure Friday that would give back grant money it previously  withheld.  </P> <P> The Costa Mesa-based group won't get the money immediately because "there are  absolutely no funds left in this year's budget," council director Robert Reid  said Friday. But he added: "They will definitely get their grant money next  year."  </P> <P> Opera Pacific briefly had its Arts Council rating and accompanying grant amount  reduced from $51,000 to $32,000 last year but won a reinstatement of the rating  on appeal. It was the first time that a large-budget arts group had  successfully appealed a council grant action.  </P> <P> Although the Arts Council restored the company's rating, there was no mechanism  for reinstating the portion of the grant that was withheld.  </P> <P> On Friday, at a regular meeting in Los Angeles, the council unanimously voted  to adopt a measure that will, retroactively, allocate money to large-budget  arts groups that successfully appeal Arts Council grant decisions. The money  would come from any funds left in the budget at the end of the fiscal year,  "which almost never happens," a staff member said.  </P> <P> If there were no leftover funds, successful appeals would be placed in a  priority position to have additional or reinstated monies awarded the following  year -- contingent on the governor's approval of the council's budget.  </P> <P> This would be in addition to whatever funds a group may be awarded in the  regular course of that year through the CAC grant process.  </P> <P> The only thing now standing between Opera Pacific and its $19,000 is the  unlikely prospect that the governor would ax the Arts Council's budget  entirely, or the entire allocation for large-budget ($1 million and over)  organizations.  </P> <P> When the council took its vote, Opera Pacific managing director Martin Weil  sighed and said, "Thank you," adding, "Hopefully, this will make it easier for  other people in the same situation" to get grant money restored.  </P> <P> "Until today, I wasn't counting on this money," said Weil, one of only about  half a dozen members of the public who attended the meeting. "Now I'm counting  on the money."  </P> <P> The original rating and grant reduction centered on charges that the company  used electronic amplification during opera productions. Upon appeal, Arts  Council members decided that the charges were unfounded.  </P> <P> Weil also took the opportunity to make a plea to the governor to change his  mind about a proposed cut in the council's budget for next year.  </P> <P> Speaking on behalf of the California Confederation of the Arts, of which he is  a board member, Weil asked Gov. George Deukmejian to reconsider his proposed  $3-million cut to the Arts Council's 1989-90 budget and approve, instead, an  increase from the current $15.5 million to $17.8 million for the next budget  year, which begins July 1.  </P></p>

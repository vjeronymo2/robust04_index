			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (A) A guaranty agency shall notify the Secretary immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whenever it becomes aware of reliable information indicating a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating school may have closed. The designated agency in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the state in which the school is located shall promptly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigate whether the school has closed, and whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> teach-out of the closed school's program was made available to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students, and report the results of its investigation to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary no later than 30 days after receiving the information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) If a guaranty agency determines (or is informed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary) that a participating school has closed, it shall,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 30 days of making that determination or being informed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Secretary, notify all lenders participating in its program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspend collection efforts against individuals with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans made for attendance at the closed school, if the student to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whom (or on whose behalf) a loan was made was enrolled at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school on the closing date or withdrew not more than 90 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prior to the date the school closed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) Within 30 days after receiving notice from the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that a school has closed, a guaranty agency shall review its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records of loans that it holds and identify all borrowers (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students) who appear to have been enrolled at the closed school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the closing date or who withdrew not more than 90 days prior  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the date the school closed. If the guaranty agency knows the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower's address, it shall, within 30 days after identifying a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower under paragraph (d) of this section, mail a discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application and an explanation of the information that must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included in the sworn statement (which may be combined) to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower. The application shall inform the borrower of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures and eligibility criteria for obtaining a discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (D) If the guaranty agency determines that a borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified in paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(C) of this section does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for a discharge, the agency shall notify the borrower in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> writing of that determination and the reasons for it within 30  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after receiving the borrower's completed application and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sworn statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (E) A borrower's request for discharge may not be denied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solely on the basis of failing to meet any time limits set by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lender, guaranty agency, or the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Lender responsibilities.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) If the lender is notified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by a guaranty agency or the Secretary, or receives information it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes to be reliable from another source indicating that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower may be eligible for a loan cancellation under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) of this section, the lender shall immediately suspend any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efforts to collect from the borrower on any loan received for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program of study for which the loan was made (but may continue to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive borrower payments), and, within 30 days of receiving the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information or notification, inform the borrower of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures for requesting a discharge.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the borrower fails to submit the written request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sworn statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within 60 days of being notified of that option, the lender shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resume collection and shall be deemed to have exercised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forbearance of payment of principal and interest from the date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the lender suspended collection activity. The lender may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capitalize, in accordance with 682.202(b), any interest accrued  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and not paid during that period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The lender shall file a closed school claim with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency in accordance with &sect;682.402(g) no later than 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days after the lender receives the borrower's written request and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sworn statement described in paragraph (d)(3) of this section.

The lender shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assist the guaranty agency and the borrower in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether the borrower is eligible for discharge of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Within 30 days after receiving reimbursement from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guaranty agency for a closed school claim, the lender shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notify the borrower that the loan obligation has been discharged,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and request that all credit bureaus to which it previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reported the status of the loan delete all adverse credit history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> False certification by a school of a student's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility to borrow.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> General.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary reimburses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holder of a loan received by a borrower on or after January 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1986, and discharges the borrower's obligation with respect to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section, if the borrower's (or the student for whom a parent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received a PLUS loan) eligibility to receive the loan was falsely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified by an eligible school. For purposes of a false  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification discharge, the term ``borrower'' includes all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endorsers on a loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relief available pursuant to discharge.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i) Discharge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (e) of this section relieves the borrower of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing obligation to repay the loan and any charges imposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs incurred by the holder with respect to the loan that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrower is otherwise obligated to pay.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section qualifies the borrower for reimbursement of amounts paid  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> voluntarily or through enforced collection on a loan obligation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharged under paragraph (e) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) A borrower who has defaulted on a loan discharged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under paragraph (e) of this section is not regarded as in default  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the loan after discharge, and is eligible to receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assistance under the Title IV, HEA programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) A discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section is reported by the loan holder to all credit reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies to which the holder previously reported the status of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan, so as to delete all adverse credit history assigned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Borrower eligibility for discharge.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A borrower  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifies for discharge of a loan under paragraph (e) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section if the borrower submits to the holder of the loan a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written request and a sworn statement.

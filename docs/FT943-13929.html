			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Arts: Surprising last refuge for the avant-garde - Off the Wall The new Glyndebourne has only been open seven weeks but it is proving a much more exciting place than its sedate predecessor. The booing that greeted Deborah Warner's abstract version of Don Giovanni on Sunday was not unprecedented - Peter Sellar's equally revisionist Magic Flute was heartily disliked by traditionalists (most of the Glyndebourne audience) a few years back - but this time the barracking was more confident and showed a welcome tendency to start fresh traditions in the new auditorium. More startling still have been the advertisements alerting the public to unsold tickets this season. It has always been true that a ticket to Glyndebourne was almost impossible to come by, even from touts. There are over 6,000 opera lovers waiting (at a signing on fee of Pounds 50) many years for the membership which guarantees tickets: most regard a trip to Glyndebourne with as much longing as the three sisters dreamed of Moscow. Now the Sussex Downs are suddenly much closer. The enlarged auditorium means that there are around 400 extra tickets to sell each evening and for the August performances of Peter Grimes and The Rake's Progress (20th century opera is blatantly less popular with the social element in the Glyndebourne audience) there is still availability. Hence the ads. There has also been confusion about the 42 standing places priced at Pounds 10 and Pounds 15 for each performance. They can be booked in advance. So if you are quick you can go to Glyndebourne this summer for a tenner. Next summer it should be open house for everyone. The programme consists of new productions of a rare Handel oratorio and Berg's Lulu, not obvious box office hits, plus revivals of Britten's A Midsummer Night's Dream, which failed to sell out completely last time - and Don Giovanni. As the ENO rejects experimentalism for popular operatic favourites Glyndebourne seems to be the surprising last refuge of the avant-garde. Sponsors love a credit, a little plug in the press for the opera, concert, art show, they have supported. This is mainly because only a minority of company directors appreciate the arts, and media coverage is the obvious way that they can prove to their more hard-headed colleagues that there is a tangible return from the corporate investment. In the past such credits were hit and miss affairs, with the BBC and some national newspapers refusing to acknowledge the sponsors' contribution. As a result, the arts lost patrons. In recent months the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, and arts organisations like the National Theatre and the Tate, have launched a strenuous campaign to persuade the media to include the sponsor in coverage of arts events. It seems to be paying off. In a survey conducted in May, 74 per cent of sponsors were credited, compared with only 49 per cent in February. Six newspapers had a 100 per cent success rate, including the FT (of course), but also such traditional sceptics as the Guardian (now an ABSA member) and the Evening Standard. The research also indicated that sponsorship is still comparatively rare. Only 39, or 22 per cent, of the 180 reviews were of events that had been sponsored. There is only one topic of conversation in the arts and heritage world at the moment - the National Lottery. It would be a dozy arts administrator, or museum director, who did not want to jump on this particular gravy train. The problem is which compartment to make for - the Millennium Fund, the arts treasure chest, or the heritage pay outs. The Millennium Fund is channelling half its anticipated revenue, or roughly Pounds 800m by the year 2000, into large prestigious new building projects of national significance, which puts it off-limits to art galleries and theatres that only need refurbishment. The arts money is likely to be competed for by every arts institution in the country, from the National Theatre to a local video workshop. This leaves the National Heritage Fund's largesse as the centre of most speculation. One gallery that has moved swiftly is Dulwich Picture Gallery in south London. This week the chairman of its trustees, Lord Sainsbury, launched an endowment appeal which aims to provide Pounds 400,000 a year to improve both the display of the collection and the out-reach programme of this, the oldest public art gallery in the UK. To ensure such extra income suggests an endowment fund approaching Pounds 8m. Dulwich has pulled off a coup by receiving a promise of help from the National Heritage Fund, although, surprisingly, not from its lottery resources but from its annual grant, which is to be reduced next year to Pounds 8.8m. This is because the Heritage Lottery Fund can only give endowment support to projects to which it has also given capital funding, a strange quirk of the legislation. Of course help for Dulwich depends on the Trustees raising a substantial sum by their own efforts, but with Lord Sainsbury and Mrs Vivien Duffield on board the omens are good that this little artistic jewel should gleam even more brightly in future. Every now and then you catch sight of the extent of the recession in the art market, or rather in the picture market, where things are toughest. In July 1990 a bidder quickly acquired on the same day at Sotheby's some 18th century ancestors by paying Pounds 820,000 for a family portrait by Zoffany; Pounds 380,000 for one by Joseph Wright of Derby; and Pounds 68,000 for a Gainsborough. Fate forced him to sell them at Christie's this week. The Gainsborough sold - for Pounds 45,500, but even at Pounds 220,000 there was no bidding on the Zoffany and the Wright of Derby was bought in at Pounds 180,000. The market for smart decorators' paintings is still stone-cold dead. By chance this week an aristocrat was actually buying in the saleroom. The Duke of Devonshire, through his Chatsworth Trust, paid Pounds 265,500 at Sotheby's for a Gainsborough portrait of Georgina, an 18th century Devonshire Duchess. In 1876 it sold for 10,000 guineas, at the time the highest sum ever paid in the saleroom. How tastes change.</p>

			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Punjab calls in army to curb killings PUNJAB'S newly elected chief minister yesterday called in the Indian army to help police crush Sikh militants who have shot dead almost 70 people in recent days, Reuter reports. Mr Beant Singh said two army generals and Punjab's police chief would oversee the crackdown in the industrial city of Ludhiana and areas south of it. Soldiers and paramilitaries are backing up police in house-to-house searches. Sikh militants, who are fighting for a separate homeland, have vowed to punish anyone who voted in the February 19 elections or who collaborates with Mr Singh's government.</p>

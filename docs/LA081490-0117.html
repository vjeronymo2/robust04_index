			<p><P> August 14, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BEATING OF COUPLE IN FRONT OF CROWD PROBED  </P> <P> Los Angeles County sheriff's detectives are investigating a weekend melee in  Palmdale in which a group of men beat a man and a woman while a crowd looked on  in a parking lot where teen-agers congregate on weekends, authorities said  Monday.  </P> <P> Joel Houtz, 22, was cut and bruised when he was beaten and kicked by about  eight men during the attack at 12:30 a.m. Saturday, deputies said.  </P> <P> His girlfriend, Rebecca Campbell, 21, suffered cuts, bruises and a broken  ankle.  </P> <P> The altercation began when several men harassed and pinched her as she and  Houtz were leaving a bar, Campbell said. Words and then blows were exchanged,  she said.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials discounted reports that some in the crowd of about 100  cheered during the attack, though they said no one came to the couple's aid and  some onlookers joined the fray when Campbell's car grazed a teen-age girl as  Campbell tried to get help for Houtz.  </P></p>

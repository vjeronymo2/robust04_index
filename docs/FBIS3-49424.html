R."-signed report: "VOMO Director Andrej Lovsin </F> Resigns"]    [Text] Ljubljana 6 January -- Andrej Lovsin today stopped  working as the director of the Security Organ of the Defense  Ministry [VOMO]. At his own request, the government at today's  session relieved him of his duty as undersecretary in the  Defense Ministry, a statement by the Defense Ministry says.    Lovsin started his military career in the former Yugoslavia  as an officer of the Yugoslav Peoples' Army. Upon his release  from the Yugoslav Peoples' Army in 1985 he took up employment in  the Slovene Secretariat for Internal Affairs, and after  independence in June 1991, took up the post of the chief of the  military intelligence service. Under his leadership the service  rather successfully dodged parliamentary supervision, while  Lovsin himself was involved in the controversial kidnapping of  two Greek arms merchants in Austria.    The failure and disclosure of this action gave rise to hints  about VOMO's encroachment upon the authorities of the civilian  intelligence service and its appetites for control over the  civilian sphere, which led to the affair of VIS  [Security-Information Service] versus VOMO. On that occasion,  Lovsin offered his resignation from the post of the chief of the  military intelligence service for the first time, however,  Defense Minister Janez Jansa did not accept it. Lately,  Lovsin's name again rocked the public in connection with the  B.P. case, that is to say, the affair involving the Adit and  Safti [companies].</p>

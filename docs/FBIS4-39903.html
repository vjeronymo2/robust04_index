			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 10 TASS -- China has staged another  underground nuclear test despite repeated appeals on the part of  several states, including Russia, a representative of the  Russian Foreign Ministry said here today.    "This event provokes deep Russian regret, the more so China  did it at a time of the Geneva multilateral negotiations on  comprehensive ban on nuclear tests, which has been supported by  all nuclear powers," says the statement received by ITAR-TASS.    "We are also alarmed with the fact further Chinese nuclear  tests may endanger the observation of the nuclear tests  moratorium by other nuclear powers.    "We would like to hope that the Chinese side will understand  its genuine national interests, comply with the appeals of the  international community and together with other nations help to  achieve complete termination of underground nuclear tests and  fulfilment of the Chinese-declared intention to conclude a  treaty on comprehensive ban on nuclear tests," says the document.</p>

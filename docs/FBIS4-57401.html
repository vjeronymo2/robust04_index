			<p>BFN     [Text] Between the last half of 1993 and the first quarter  of 1994, Havana has experienced the greatest shortage of  medicines ever remembered by health authorities. This was stated  on 15 May by Public Health Minister Julio Teja in referring to  the need for and advantages of the medicine distribution program:    [Begin Teja recording] We continue hoping to find the ideal,  perfect method where there is an explanation for everything and  everyone understands everything. What are the risks we run? The  products and raw materials are arriving now, following the  efforts made by the government, and we are able to increase the  production of medicines a bit -- not to a level that tomorrow  will provide medicines of every type, but enough to conduct a  recovery process. Thus, the term, even in GRANMA, is recovery.  If we do not implement these measures now, we would have used up  these medicines we are now getting; by mid- year, when we would  have to implement the plan, we would have none because they  would have once more ended in the black market. That is the  reality.    In other words, medicines are ending up in the hands of  three  or four people. We cannot engage in a criminal act and hold back  medicine until we have the perfect program. We have waited  enough. We have worked with Havana hospitals to ensure the  supply of the priority medicines. I say this because I believe  that one of the things we have to do is to make the doctors  understand. That is the truth. The document states that this is  the opinion of the government and party leadership. The struggle  has to be won with the health workers, the doctors, pharmacists,  everyone in that field. We believe that this battle is being won.    I want you to know that it is not only the doctor issuing  unwarranted prescriptions, knowing full well that the medicine  is not available. There was the question put by Comrade [Carlos]  Lage about the doctor who comes -- I was told this by several  professors and doctors -- to the neighborhood and tells everyone  that beginning tomorrow, they can forget asking for  prescriptions because he can only give prescriptions to be  filled in the area where he lives, 42 km away. This is a way of  damaging the Revolution.    We have to work against this. We have asked the help of the  party and the unions. We have visited every hospital. Briefings  have been given to every doctor in the Armed Forces, in every  military unit. The Interior Ministry has hosted meetings with  doctors who work in prisons, jails, etc. We have tried to inform  most. As the banner reads: We will continue to conduct classes  and reevaluation tests. However, this is a battle. This is  combat. We have to gain awareness and support; if we had plenty  of everything, these measures would not be necessary. [end  recording]    Health Minister Julio Teja participated in the meeting of  presidents of the People's Councils of Havana. Politburo members  Carlos Lage and Ricardo Alarcon are also attending the meeting.  Transportation, local industries, and telephone industry issues  are also slated for discussion.</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Survey of India (40): Cricket is no longer enough - Foreign policy is dominated by ties with Pakistan The fighting which broke out at an India-Pakistan charity cricket match in London last month was a public demonstration of the intense bitterness between the two countries. Even a passionate appeal for calm from Imran Khan, the former Pakistan captain and a legendary figure in his own country, was unable to prevent Pakistan supporters from invading the pitch and then burning an Indian flag. India's relations with other countries ebb and flow, but the enmity with Pakistan is deeply embedded in both peoples. Indian foreign ministry officials have other issues on their plates such as improving links with the US and China and nurturing ties with the states of the former Soviet Union; regional co-operation; the United Nations; nuclear weapons; championing Third World causes. All these matters are on Delhi's foreign policy agenda. But hostile relations with Pakistan colour them all. Unfortunately, little has happened in the last year to ease the tension  - and much has happened to make it worse. The outbreak of inter-religious violence which followed the sacking of the Ayodhya mosque in northern India triggered a spate of angry exchanges between Delhi and Islamabad, which culminated in tit-for-tat expulsions of junior-level diplomats. The bomb blasts which shook Bombay in March raised tensions further as India accused Pakistan's security forces of involvement in the outrage. In the meantime, violence worsened in the troubled northern Indian state of Kashmir, where pro-independence insurgents operating with support from Pakistan are fighting the Indian security forces. Indian officials believe that the domestic political upheavals in Pakistan delay the possibility of any meaningful bilateral talks. As Mr Salman Kurshid, the minister of state for external affairs, said in a recent FT interview: 'They have tried to hide behind a break in government and given the impression of being preoccupied internally.' But even if a strong government were to take power in Islamabad tomorrow it is unlikely that the two sides could settle their differences over the crucial issue of Kashmir. India insists Kashmir is an integral part of the country; Pakistan says Kashmir, inhabited mainly by Moslems, should have the right to choose between staying in India and joining the Islamic state of Pakistan. Both governments reject the option favoured by many Kashmiris - independence. The one matter they both agree upon is the bilateral Simla Agreement, signed in a rare lull in tensions in 1972, which says that the issue of Kashmir should be resolved by the two governments. India is ready to try to mollify Kashmiris by offering greater local autonomy, but not independence. However, it insists that the violence must stop and Pakistan must cease supporting the insurgents. The last year has seen a strong upsurge in the insurgents' activities, which has provoked an equally tough response from the Indian security forces. In recent weeks, the tide seems to have turned firmly in favour of the Indian authorities which are claiming some success in suppressing violence. A lull in the fighting may give Delhi an opportunity for a meaningful offer of talks with the insurgents. Mr Kurshid says the government is ready for talks 'any time, anywhere'. In the meantime, the security forces' activities have exposed India to international criticism of its human rights record. Amnesty International and other watchdogs have accused the security forces of acts of brutality against Kashmiris. The government admits to some individual cases of soldiers stepping out of line but says foreigners pay too little attention to brutalities committed by insurgents. Delhi is considering responding to criticism by permitting visits of foreign human rights organisations to Kashmir and publicising the punishments given to soldiers found guilty of murder and other serious human rights abuses. Nevertheless, India can take comfort from the fact that, if its international reputation has suffered on account of Kashmir, Pakistan has recently fared much worse. The US has condemned its alleged support for terrorists, including fighters in Kashmir, its narcotics trade and its purchase of missile technology from China. Islamabad was forced to work very hard to persuade Washington not to put it on the list of terrorist nations earlier this year. It remains under close obser- vation. But when it comes to arms, particularly nuclear weapons, Washington's eye is fixed equally firmly on both India and Pakistan. The US wants both countries to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to inhibit the spread of nuclear weapons. Pakistan says it will sign if India does. India says it will not sign unless countries possessing nuclear weapons also agree to give them up. India firmly believes that developed countries cannot enshrine in law a permanent strategic advantage over less developed states. As Mr Kurshid says: 'You can't divide the world into haves and have nots.' The US has applied sanctions restricting trade in arms with Pakistan and, to a limited extent, with India. Most recently, it put pressure on Russia to cancel the proposed sale of specialised rocket engines to India. India's response is to try to develop the engines indigenously. Even as they talk to American officials, both Delhi and Islamabad continue with nuclear and missile development programmes. Delhi's strategy is to have weapons-making technology ready without necessarily making the weapons themselves. Islamabad has admitted actually making bombs. Fortunately, as poor developing countries, the two states do not have limitless resources to pour into weapons. But for each, especially Pakistan, military spending places a heavy burden on the economy at a time when both are trying to modernise and promote growth. The hostility casts a pall over India's relations with its other neighbours. India would like to promote regional co-operation and trade through the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation. The SAARC would also like to act as a spokesman for the region on global issues and would welcome its neighbours' support in its discreet campaign for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.</p>

			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Chamberlain Phipps rises fourfold in maiden interims Chamberlain Phipps, the shoe components and footwear group, reported maiden interim results showing a fourfold increase in pre-tax profits, and announced its first acquisition since it returned to the market in August. Pre-tax profits for the six months to October 1 jumped from Pounds 1.05m to Pounds 4.5m, on turnover doubled from Pounds 32.2m to Pounds 66.6m. The profits figure included an Pounds 800,000 reorganisation charge and, for the first time, results from Chamberlain's French operations bought just over a year ago. Mr Dan Sullivan, the US-born chairman, said that, on a like-for-like basis, pre-tax profits for the half-year rose by about 21 per cent to just over Pounds 5m. Sales on a like-for-like basis, excluding disposals, had been flat. The materials division, which includes the footwear components business formerly owned by Evode, improved operating profits from Pounds 1.32m to Pounds 1.62m, on sales 23 per cent down at Pounds 19.6m. Mr Sullivan said trading in the UK continued to be difficult, although the division had enjoyed strong export growth of about 15 per cent. The footwear business, including SAC and Thierry which were not consolidated into the group's results at flotation, increased operating profits from Pounds 391,000 to Pounds 4.19m. Sales jumped from Pounds 6.59m to Pounds 47m. Chamberlain also announced a conditional agreement to acquire Ouest Parts, the largest supplier of components to the French shoe industry, for about FFr74m (Pounds 8.79m) in cash. Last year the group returned profits of about Pounds 1.4m and had net assets of about Pounds 2.2m. Mr Sullivan said he expected to expand further in continental Europe, and Chamberlain was currently in discussions about a second purchase. Chamberlain finished the first half with net debt representing almost 90 per cent of shareholders' funds. This was expected to fall to about 60 per cent by the year-end. The group declared a maiden dividend of 2.7p. Earnings rose from 6.7p to 7.9p. On a pro forma basis earnings rose to 7.7p. Chamberlain's shares, floated at 165p in August, closed 3p up at 183p.</p>

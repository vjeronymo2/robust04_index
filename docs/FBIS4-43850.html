			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Interior  Ministry land registry and cartography officials have determined  that 3,136 of the 4,638 donums in the closed Maras [Varosha]  area, which the United Nations in the confidence-building  measures package want the Greek Cypriots to have access to,  belong to the Turkish Cypriot Waqf and that Greek Cypriots and  the British confiscated these properties.    Upon the request of the President's Office, the Interior  Ministry, Magosa [Famagusta] Land Registration Office, and  Lefkosa [Nicosia] Survey Branch uncovered one by one the Turkish  Cypriot Waqf properties by examining old Maras land registration  records.    According to information obtained from Halil Giray, Interior  Ministry Survey Branch director and cartography technical  expert, the Turkish Cypriot properties in Maras were charted on  land registration maps on a scale of 1:1000. In works which  were conducted jointly with the Magosa Land Registry Office and  Lefkosa Survey Branch, old land registration and cadastral  records were used to chart Turkish Cypriot Waqf properties to  land registration maps.    It was determined that 3,024 donums of land belonging to the  Turkish Cypriot Waqf appeared in the land registration records  as Greek Cypriot properties; 88 donums appeared as belonging to  the British Defense Ministry; and 24 donums appropriated by the  Greek Cypriot administration under the name of the Cyprus  Republic.    The Turkish Cypriot experts who examined the land  registration records starting from 1912 one by one, determined  that 3,136 of the 4,638 donums in the closed area of Maras,  belong to Abdullah Pasha Waqf and Lala Mustafa Pasha Waqf. The  remaining 1,493 donums are properties which are not owned by the  Wagfs.    These important works, which shed light on the Turkish  Cypriot property situation in Maras, found out that 88 donums of  land belonging to the Abdullah Pasha Waqf had been registered  under the name of the British Defense Ministry during 29 May  1947 and 9 May 1948, and 24 donums were appropriated by the  Greek Cypriot administration under the name of Cyprus Republic  during 1972-1974.

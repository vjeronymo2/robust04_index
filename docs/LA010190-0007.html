			<p><P> January 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP GOES THE REFUND  </P> <P> Pennies will be closer to nickels today for thrifty consumers who recycle their  empty soda and beer containers. A new state law will boost the ineffective  one-cent refund to a nickel for two small cans or one large bottle.  </P> <P> The higher refunds will make recycling a little more rewarding.  </P> <P> Californians have bothered to return barely half of their empties to recycling  depots at nearby supermarkets or to a state-certified recycling centers since  the bottle law took effect just over two years ago. Even environmentally minded  consumers have argued that a penny back wasn't worth the trouble.  </P> <P> The stronger incentive takes effect today. An empty two-liter bottle, glass or  plastic, is worth five cents. Also, worth a nickel are two cans or bottles that  contain less than 24 ounces. Five cents, the standard reward in states that  have successful bottle laws, ought to prove persuasive.  </P> <P> Californians drink 12 billion bottles and cans of soda or beer in a typical  year. The empties choke landfills -- and that's when the cans and bottles are  properly disposed. Many are just tossed away by litterbugs, blighting beaches,  parks and roads. Maybe a nickel will change their bad habits.  </P> <P> Recycling can take some pressure off the distressed environment. Consumers who  take the time to return their empties deserve their reward.  </P></p>

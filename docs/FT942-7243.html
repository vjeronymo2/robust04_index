			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Carlton It is hard to know whether Carlton's acquisition of Central Television is paying off. Though group interim results included two months of profits from Central, they were not split out. Carlton did say that changes already implemented would save Pounds 10m on an annual basis. The takeover benefits have therefore come through somewhat faster than expected. Still unclear is whether the eventual savings will be greater than the Pounds 10m-Pounds 15m forecast when the deal was agreed last year. In the short run, the recovery in TV advertising and strong growth of video sales will continue to boost Carlton's profitability. Longer term doubts hang over both of the group's major businesses: the expected eclipse of videos by compact disc formats; and increased competition to its ITV franchises from cable and satellite. The government's review of cross-media ownership may throw up opportunities for Carlton in cable and satellite. The chairman, Mr Michael Green, has been vocal in calling for the barriers that keep media groups out of each others' patches to be pulled down. But shareholders will probably want to see Central fully integrated and enhancing earnings per share before Carlton embarks on another big acquisition. Fortunately, that seems to be management's intention.</p>

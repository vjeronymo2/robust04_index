			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A MONET SHOW FOR OUR '90S;  </P> <P> THE QUINTESSENTIAL CREATOR OF DAPPLED MASTERWORKS WAS ALSO A GRUMPY,  SELF-PROMOTING PRO  </P> <P> The century's last decade has just begun. A nation long regarded as a world  superpower seems at the apogee of greatness, flaunting its wealth and prestige  like a bedizened courtesan.  </P> <P> A strata of self-doubt lurks just beneath its rhinestone encrusted surface. A  humiliating defeat in a war with a third-rate power still rankles and  everywhere there are fissures in the frosting -- government is wracked with  scandal, drug and alcohol use escalate alarmingly, conservative forces harden  position while radicals plant bombs or drift into mysticism.  </P> <P> A country proud of its cultural modernity hoists one more glass of bubbly while  glancing covertly at two threatening peoples -- the Germans and the Japanese.  </P> <P> Familiar as it all sounds, the scenario is not about the United States in the  1990s. It is about France in the 1890s -- the Franco-Prussian war, not Vietnam;  the Dreyfus affair, not Iran-contra; La Belle Epoch, not "The Bonfire of the  Vanities." It is particularly about a historic exhibition opening to the public  Wednesday at the Museum of Fine Arts.  </P> <P> "Monet in the '90s" is a singular art event reuniting the largest number of the  artist's renowned "series" paintings to be assembled since they were executed  </P> <P> and dispersed a century ago -- 90 of them, just so we don't lose the theme.  These nuanced variations on such landscape motifs as poplar trees, grain stacks  and the facade of Rouen Cathedral have multiple happy properties.  Postcard-popular with the general public, they are also awesome icons for  cognoscenti who regard them as seedbeds of modern art and the source of  contemporary serial painting, which involved everybody from Andy Warhol to  Frank Stella.  </P> <P> In short, the museum has a blockbuster that even the fussiest connoisseur  cannot disdain. It will surely pull big crowds until it closes here April 29.  It then travels to Chicago's Art Institute and London's Royal Academy, which  co-organized the event. No, it won't go to Los Angeles, and more's the pity.  </P> <P> C'est dommage, because it is not only a superb, revealing show but because the  title is a significant pun. "Monet in the '90s" means what is says but it also  means the way the 1990s look at Monet.  </P> <P> By now, alert readers may be asking themselves about the connection between  Monet -- the quintessential art-for-art's-sake Impressionist -- and social  upheavals in France at the fin de siecle. Didn't the artist known as  just-an-eye-but-what-an-eye simply do his dappled thing while Paris wallowed in  enticing decadence?  </P> <P> Well, not according to the compelling catalogue written by the show's  organizer, Paul Hayes Tucker of the University of Massachusetts, Boston.  </P> <P> Tucker -- a Monet specialist -- thinks in a radical revisionist art historical  manner much abroad in academia. The method goes beyond traditional questions of  style, school and individual artistic psychology to link art and artists to  larger social, political and economic issues. It tends to demythologize  comfortable, romantic notions about the artistic character. Tucker paints a  portrait of Monet as a shrewd, self-promoting entrepreneur with a sharp eye on  the competition, the market and public taste.  </P> <P> The artist was pushing 50 -- and working in an Impressionist manner that even  his contemporary, Pissarro, called "rancid" -- when he did his first series  paintings. According to Tucker, different suites intended to counter the  competition of the radical young Seurat prove the old dog could still absorb  the new tricks of decorative Symbolism, soothe the rattled nationalism of his  audience with reassuring traditional rural themes and -- finally -- express  utter disgust with the rapacious anti-Semitism of the Dreyfus case. After that,  Monet retired to his garden at Giverny. There he painted the "Japanese  Footbridge" series, presumably as an encouragement to emulate Oriental  reverence for nature and private meditation.  </P> <P> Whew! To believe all that is to believe artists are capable of conducting their  careers as a kind of three-dimensional chess game.  </P> <P> But Tucker's text, although often highly circumstantial, frequently rings true.  During this period, Monet made the final transition from scruffy bohemian to an  artist of immense wealth and the stature of a national hero. Critical response  to his exhibitions was so ecstatic that newspapers like Le Gaulois devoted  whole supplements to his art. He must have been doing something right, even if  much of this putative French nationalist art sold to Americans.  </P> <P> Besides, we know artists like this. In California alone, people like Robert  Irwin or Robert Graham are almost as admired for their career tactics as for  their work. With Monet, as with them, it remains an open question whether their  amazing astuteness arises from intuition or calculation. Whichever, Monet is  characterized very much in the mold of the artist going into 1990s -- the canny  pro rather than the visionary seer.  </P> <P> One thing is certain. When we come to actually look at the Monets, tactical and  sociological questions give way to issues that are universal and poetic.  </P> <P> These are still the paintings that make us hear Debussy in the background.  </P> <P> Tucker has simply proven again that you can slice art many ways without  wounding it.  </P> <P> The first suite on view is a group of eight canvases done in the Creuse Valley  in 1889. Each depicts a mounded landscape cradling a section of river under  changing light. "Sunlight Effect" approaches the rugged naturalism of Courbet,  "Evening Effect" muffles tone and shape so closely as to point to abstraction.  </P> <P> Curious. We are so accustomed to associating Monet with the dappled delicacy of  stereotypical Impressionism that it is a surprise to feel this work burly and  somewhat inert under its surface texture.  </P> <P> The effect goes away in half a dozen graceful views of fields at Giverny but  returns in 15 pictures from the famous "Grain Stack" suite, with its humble  conical piles enduring the heat and snow of the seasons.  </P> <P> (The French like to complain, "En ete on crame, et on hiver on caille" -- "In  summer we boil and in winter we freeze.")  </P> <P> If we want to have unaccustomed thoughts about Monet based on the pictures, it  is their revelation of a quality not unlike Expressionist anguish. Fairly  subtle most of the time, it is most obvious in mountain paintings he did on a  visit to Norway. We suddenly find him predicting the neurotic tensions of an  Edvard Munch.  </P> <P> There is something phantasmagoric about the grain stacks -- they look scruffy  and defensive, like dwarf Abominable Snowmen ready to mount a crazy attack on  anybody who disturbs their elemental hibernation.  </P> <P> Monet worried and complained about his art so consistently that his wife once  said that being disgruntled was part of his nature. When he was painting the  now-revered Rouen Cathedral suite, he had nightmares about the building. "It  fell on me," he wrote, "and seemed to be pink or blue or yellow."  </P> <P> So much for the serene patriarch of Giverny. This sounds more like the  visionary disturbance of a Van Gogh.  </P> <P> The "Cathedrals" series -- seen here in 10 versions -- creates an odd, even  upsetting tension between the stout solidity of the building and Monet's  liquefying light. His struggle with them shows. They exist somewhere between  noble failure and narrow triumph.  </P> <P> One is left convinced that Monet made his art in a state of struggle against  depression.  </P> <P> But only half the time.  </P> <P> The artist was grumpy and obsessive. He could turn the latter quality to good  use in the real world, as when he mounted a successful subscription campaign to  have Manet's "Olympia" given to the nation, or fought tenaciously to build his  Giverny water garden or save the poplar trees on his property line. He was  bear-like and formidable.  </P> <P> But his favorite painting was Watteau's exquisite "Embarcation for Cythera."  His favored colors were green and lavender -- said to be the hues of the pure  aesthete.  </P> <P> The suites of series paintings virtually alternate between moody downers like  the grain stacks and lyric celebrations like the "Poplars." The trees stand  like serpentine rows of slender girls in pale green dresses, billowing hair  united by mischievous winds.  </P> <P> If we want to fool around with fashionable theories about what makes artists  tick, we could do worse than to explain Monet as a manic-depressive. Like most  analysis, that's too gross but it sets some useful parameters.  </P> <P> Monet was really a blender and rectifier -- a very French seeker of harmonic  compromise, a very individual pioneer of new frontiers carefully gained.  </P> <P> The most useful metaphor for Monet is the idea of the cinematic lap-dissolve.  His work demands that the viewer make subtle distinctions. We find ourselves  wishing they could all be projected on one spot to more clearly show his  caressing light, lengthening shadows and changing seasons.  </P> <P> With Monet, everything dissolves into everything else. Illumination on a  hillside changes furrowed earth into choppy water. The act of depicting the  land dissolves into pure painting. His melancholy dissolves into his joy to  produce the poignant "Mornings on the Seine." Talk about harmony. No wonder he  liked Whistler.  </P> <P> The final suite on view is the lovely "Japanese Footbridge" set. Poor  installation does not diminish either its sense of fulfillment or its symbolic  message. In most versions, the bridge leads out of the canvas to new  experience.  </P> <P> One wanders backwards through the exhibition to be struck by the overriding  common property of the paintings. Almost without exception, they want to be  bigger. They strain uncomfortably at their frames like Samson in the Temple.  </P> <P> Monet died in 1926 at age 87. He still had more than a quarter-century to paint  in his garden after the footbridge suite. The result was the magnificent, huge,  waterlily paintings that burst his final limitation, size. Of course he grumped  the whole time.  </P> <P> Monet's work does send a message to the 1990s. When the world lets you down,  cultivate the inner garden and let no man trample its fruits.  </P></p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / International Company News: Smith Corona to close its last US typewriter manufacturing plant SMITH Corona, the manufacturer of portable typewriters which has spent years fighting alleged Japanese cut-price 'dumping' of products in the US, announced yesterday it was closing its last US manufacturing plant and relocating production to Mexico to save costs. The news came as Smith Corona, 48 per cent owned by Britain's Hanson, announced a rise in fourth-quarter net income from Dollars 2.3m, or 8 cents a share, to Dollars 6m, or 20 cents a share. Net sales were up from Dollars 77.2m to Dollars 86.2m. Smith Corona said it would phase out manufacturing operations at Cortland, in New York state, over 12 months, with a loss of 775 full-time and 100 part-time jobs. Some 370 engineering, design and administrative workers will remain in Cortland. The move will cost Dollars 15m pre-tax, of which Dollars 9m will be recorded in a special charge in the first quarter. However, the company expects to save Dollars 15m on an annual basis in manufacturing costs. Smith Corona's battle against alleged dumping has brought the company several legal victories, but little practical benefit in the market place. However, the struggle may have encouraged Japanese typewriter and word processor companies to establish assembly operations in the US. Brother Industries, the main target for Smith Corona's action, has even accused the US company of dumping itself, since Smith Corona now has a large manufacturing operation in Singapore. Brother is likely to redouble these accusations over the Mexican move. Mr Lee Thompson, Smith Corona's chairman, said the move was being made very reluctantly but was 'absolutely necessary in view of the predatory pricing by foreign competition in our industry.' 'The last US factory of the last American consumer typewriter company is closing, forced to move as a direct result of these competitors openly thumbing their noses at our trade laws.' Criticising the US Government's 'unwillingness' to enforce the trade laws, he said the company would continue to use its US suppliers, so the US content of its machines would continue to be higher than those of its competitors. Mr Thompson said that in the fourth quarter the company increased unit sales and revenues of both typewriters and personal word processors. International sales benefited from sizeable shipments to a large European distributor. However, there were signs of recovery in the domestic market. For the full year, the company reported net income was Dollars 22.1m, or 73 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 371.7m, against Dollars 19.6m, or 65 cents, on sales of Dollars 383.4m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun (ITAR-TASS) -- The introduction of  any sanctions at all against Pyongyang and the holding of an  international conference on the problem of the Korean  peninsula's nuclear-free status are incompatible. This point of  view was expressed today by DPRK Ambassador to Moscow Son  Song-pil.    Replying to an ITAR-TASS correspondent's question, he said:  "At one time we displayed an interest in the Russian proposal to  hold an international conference. Our side based its position  on the fact that such a forum would promote a solution to the  accumulated problems around the negotiating table on the basis  of equal rights and mutual respect. There was no question of  any sanctions at that time. Now we clearly state: Sanctions and  dialogue are incompatible."    Regarding the DPRK's departure from the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA), the ambassador announced that on 13 June  his government officially informed the U.S. Administration of  this, the latter being the depository state of the IAEA Charter.  He stressed that recently all the cooperation with the IAEA  boiled down to carrying out inspections of North Korean  facilities which were of a "far from objective nature". The  IAEA has practically neither the time nor the inclination for  constructive cooperation in the development of the DPRK's  peaceful nuclear program as envisioned by the charter of that  organization, the diplomat said, .    "The longer we stayed in the IAEA the more vigorously our  peaceful nuclear activity was being restricted," Son Song-pil  stated. He considers that the resolution recently adopted at  the Council of Administrators of the IAEA on the "North Korean  nuclear problem" effectively signifies the introduction of  sanctions. This, in his opinion, is what forced the DPRK  Government to make the decision to leave the international  agency.    As for the Treaty of Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons,  the  ambassador said the DPRK reserved the right to so-called  "special status". This is because his country announced its  departure from the treaty but then declared its "temporary  suspension."</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / BBC threat to suspend strikers: Corporation may use freelance labour to beat disruption The BBC has decided to take disciplinary action against staff if strikes continue next week. The Corporation said it may use freelance labour to overcome future disruption. The decision was taken on Wednesday evening by the full board of management on the eve of yesterday's second 24-hour strike. Coverage of polling in the European elections and in five UK by-elections was disrupted. The dispute is over performance-related pay proposals and an element of decentralised bargaining on conditions at the BBC. The unions will announce today how they plan to affect Sunday's broadcasts - not necessarily by another 24-hour strike. If Sunday's dispute goes ahead, all BBC staff will receive a letter warning them that the management will start suspending staff if further action is taken. Such action is planned for next Tuesday and Friday. An intensification of the dispute would almost certainly be accompanied by hiring freelances. Senior managers will address staff meetings throughout the UK today to promote the improved proposals presented to the unions at the end of last week after four days of talks at Acas, the conciliation service. They will emphasise that the present offer is the final one. Mr Tony Lennon, president of Bectu, the main broadcasting union, said last night: 'The stakes are very high in the dispute. If any staff are threatened with suspension we will have to take serious stock of the situation.' The unions would go only as far as the members wanted and members would be consulted if management began disciplinary action. He said: 'If the BBC tried to impose a deal on the staff, it would destroy the last vestige of trust the staff have in the top brass.' Local managers would also face 'fermenting resentment' and 'outright anarchy' in some areas. The unions would like to return to Acas for further negotiations but the BBC made clear yesterday that it would not return to the conciliation body except for matters of clarification. The One O'Clock News, Six O'Clock News and Nine O'Clock News were broadcast yesterday in spite of the strike. The BBC's By-Election Special Programme was also broadcast as planned, presented by Peter Snow and David Dimbleby. Unions said support for yesterday strike was at the same overall level as the first 24-hour strike in May, when the vast majority of staff did not work. A 3 per cent pay rise is already on offer. The BBC concessions at Acas included strengthing a code of practice on work scheduling and making safeguards for protected days off and 'unpredictability allowances' - part of the core BBC-wide conditions of service. The unions want provision for penalty payments for non-stop work of more than 12 hours and breaks of less than 10 hours and clearer definitions of what constitutes an off-duty day.</p>

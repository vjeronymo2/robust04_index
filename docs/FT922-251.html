			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / IBM forms alliance to develop PC multimedia INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer manufacturer, has formed an alliance with Videologic, a small UK electronics company, to accelerate the growth of one of the most promising new computing technologies. The technology, 'multimedia', combines computer text and graphics with moving video images and stereophonic sound on a personal computer screen. It promises to bring greater verisimilitude and ease of use to computing applications ranging from business analysis to games. Industry experts believe the development of multimedia applications could rejuvenate the personal-computer sector, which is flagging because of market saturation and a decline in product innovation. Multimedia has been slow to take off, chiefly because of the difficulty of developing applications that use its full potential. Creating a multimedia computer program has so far been the province of experts using expensive equipment. The goal of IBM and Videologic, a wholly owned subsidiary of Avesco, a video equipment supplier, is to create products that will make the writing of multimedia programs cheaper and simpler. Videologic is a world leader in interactive video technology. In 1989 it pioneered a way of controlling moving video images on a computer screen which significantly cut the cost of image processing. Avesco made a profit on sales of about Pounds 20m last year. No equity or board-level participation is involved in the joint venture, but there will be close co-ordination between the two companies as they develop semiconductor chips, electronic circuitry and software that can be slotted into personal computers to enable them to be used as workstations for the development of multimedia applications.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Thanks to the correct leadership of the provincial  party committee and government, people in Jilin Province  effected a tremendous change in rural areas, and peasants'  living standard was greatly improved. Peasants' per capita net  income came to 891.61 yuan in 1993, up 390 percent from 1978  when reform just began. When allowing for price rises, the  increase was 236 percent. Peasants had 512.5 yuan in their  hands per capita, up 56.6 times from 1978. Thanks to the  increase in their income, peasants began to become particular  about their food. In 1993, their per capita grain consumption  totaled 324.16 kg, up 24.2 percent from 1978, of which rice and  flour accounted for 51.5 percent. Food on their table became  varied, which included rice, steamed buns, chicken, duck, fish,  and other kinds of meat.    By the end of 1993, there were 68 radios and 85 black and  white television sets in every 100 peasant households. Peasants  spent most of their spare time listening to radio and watching  television. Per 100 peasant households had 70 sewing machines,  235 clocks and watches, and 123 bicycles, up 140, 180, and 280  percent, respectively, from 1978. They also had one camera, 31  washing machines, one refrigerator, two electric fans, two  motorcycles, and 2.7 pieces of large furniture.    In addition to increasing their durable goods, peasants also  notably improved their housing conditions. In 1993, their per  capita housing space increased to 16 square meters, up 84.1  percent from 1978. Under such circumstances, they began to pay  attention to interior decoration. In 1978, most of them lived  in thatched or earth cottages. Now, brick-and-tile houses can  be found everywhere in rural areas, small multi-story houses  have been built, and interior decoration has become more  urbanized, with telephones, carpets, and ceramic-tile floors and  walls entering the peasant family. Some peasants also have  heaters to keep their houses warm all year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Political Pornography, Clown Play </F> Makers"]    [Text] At yesterday's press conference, the Macedonian  [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Interior  Minister [Ljubomir] Frckovski spoke of the activities of the  Interior Ministry in issuing citizenship certificates and  certain parties' attacks on the intelligence agency work.    To the 14th June inclusive, he stated, the citizenship  status  of 1,463,582 Macedonian citizens of age, i.e. of 98 percent of  the population, has been regulated. The figure of 150,000  citizens to be left with unresolved status, which appeared  earlier, was not correct. Only 5,500 applications have been  negatively answered thus far, and about the same number of  applications is being decided on, he explained. (?86,368)  citizens have not yet been delivered their citizenship  notification, but this will also be done in due time before the  census.    As for recent accusations of the State Intelligence Service,  Minister Frckovski said these were plain political games of  certain parties, which attempted to slander and vilify the  Macedonian Interior Ministry in order to justify their own  failures of cover for intentions to glorify certain political  parties. This is only a pre-election warming up, he said, in  which parties are using methods appropriate to their own profile  and internal structures. The minister exposed information  showing the Interior Ministry has evidence on activities of  certain political parties, especially of VMRO-DPMNE [Internal  Macedonian Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for  Macedonian National Unity], during this party members' meetings  with another party from Bulgaria, in and out of Macedonia.  These meetings included plans for the joint appearance in the  coming elections. But, he pointed out, the Interior Ministry  cannot be possibly blamed for these activities. It can notify  part of them and present them to the Macedonian public, but  cannot be blamed for their existence, just as it cannot be  blamed of making them up. If following such a logic one could  end up concluding that entire parties are simply made up, this  goes into the territory of science fictions, Frckovski said.    What really concerns the ministry, Frckovski added, is the  fact that the level of political struggle is being brought down  to a level of political discussions focused on political  pornography. [sentence as received] Parties make up stories of  secret documents and party police squads, avoid checking the  truth of the presented "evidence," attempt to politically  manipulate with the public, and, as a result, the ministry is  disabled to introduce any serious inspection or a serious  democratic procedure to check any accusations.    In regard to rumors of organized crime in the state and  mentioning of two names by the ex-undersecretary in the Interior  Ministry, Frckovski said charges have been brought against the  ex-undersecretary and apologized to the individuals whose names  were mentioned in connection with such alleged crimes.</p>

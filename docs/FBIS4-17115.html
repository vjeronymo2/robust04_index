			<p>BFN     [Text] The unification of monetary systems between Russia  and any other state, apart from Belarus, is not yet on the  agenda. Tajikistan, however, is requesting such a step, Acting  Russian Minister for Cooperation with CIS Countries, Vladimir  Mashits, told a news conference in Moscow Wednesday.    As to the unification of the monetary systems of Russia and  Belarus, it as yet not known when this will take place, said  Mashits. The unification agreement requires amendments to the  Belarusian Constitution and if they are not taken, the question  will be raised again, said the Minister.    He said that now it was difficult to offer forecasts on  whether the monetary union would cause an inflation leap in  Russia, as some Western experts believe. Mashits believes that  wage payment delays affect inflation in Russia even more.    Commenting on the results of the CIS summit in Moscow on  April 14-15, Mashits named among the most important economic  decisions the creation of a commission for the economic union  under the coordinating consultative committee, the agreement on  the creation of a free trade zone, the understanding on  re-export, an agreement on the unification of laws for the  creation of commercial, financial, isurance and other similar  structures.    In Moscow the states had reached an understanding on  cooperation towards labor migration. The CIS leaders recognized  the benefits and guarantees for those who took part in World War  II, and the families of those who died. The benefits and  guarantees will be equal in the CIS countries, said Mashits.    Mashits noted the importance of Ukraine joining the economic  union as an associated member.</p>

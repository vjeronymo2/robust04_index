			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Brown redirects Labour's economic strategy MR GORDON Brown, the shadow chancellor, yesterday started the task of producing a credible opposition economic strategy with the completion of a lengthy policy document underlining Labour's break with public ownership, spending and tax levels. The document, sent to the party's new policy-making forum for discussion before this year's party conference, eschews traditional ideology in favour of improving the economy's productive potential. Its ambition is to present Labour's economic strategy as the ally of the individual by arguing that government-backed investment in training and industry is a prerequisite for individual advancement. Mr Brown, launching the new policies in Corby, Northamptonshire, said the proposals were 'grounded in a philosophy in which a strong and prosperous community advances individual opportunity and ensures investment in our future'. The document adds: 'Instead of the old battle between public and private sectors, it is our objective to mobilise the energies of both.' But the shadow chancellor adheres to the central principle that 'responsible government intervention' is essential to sustained growth and high employment levels. Entitled Labour's New Approach, the document says its starting point is a recognition 'that Britain's problems cannot be solved by the application of crude free-market economics'. It adds that the emphasis of the Conservatives on inflation control as the sole objective of macro-economic policy must be replaced by a strategy embracing sustainable growth, a manageable balance of payments and high employment levels, as well as low inflation. Mr Brown identifies individual skills as the most important ingredient of industrial competitiveness in the 1990s. The government's role is to ensure that individuals receive enough training to reach their potential and to improve the economy's productive capacity. He advocates public/private sector partnerships in rebuilding the nation's infrastructure and in developing regional and industrial strategies. He suggests the establishment of a network of regional development agencies and banks, tax and social security incentives for skills training and penalties for 'entrenched interests' that limit opportunity and choice. This group is said to include banks offering poor service, the 'Tory financial establishment', privatised monopolies which overcharge and irresponsible employers who neglect training. The document carefully omits specific spending pledges but hints how a future Labour government would finance its proposed investment in education and training, infrastructure and industrial investment by suggesting a restructuring of the national accounts. Government investment would be separated in the accounts from spending and borrowing needed to pay for current expenditure and the servicing of past debts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS special correspondents Boris Vlasov and </F> Dmitriy Gorokhov]    [Text] Pskov, 7 Apr -- The so-called "decision" on building  Russian military bases in CIS states and Latvia came as a  complete surprise for the Russian foreign political department,  Andrey Kozyrev, head of Russian diplomacy, said here today.  Nobody had agreed it with the Foreign Ministry. Andrey Kozyrev  arrived in Pskov to meet Swedish Foreign Minister Margaretha af  Ugglas, who is in Russia on a working visit.    According to the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry, the  above document had caused a similar astonishment in the Defense  Ministry, as well. "We do not need any bases in Latvia," he said  quoting Pavel Grachev, defense minister, with whom he had spoken  this morning. "There is an installation in Skrunda but it is not  a military base, but a radio relay station for space monitoring."</p>

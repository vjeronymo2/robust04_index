			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchanges: A watershed in the market THE DOLLAR and European currencies drifted down against the D-Mark yesterday in what appeared to be a delayed reaction to the Bundesbank's decision not to cut interest rates on Thursday, writes James Blitz. The Bundesbank yesterday surprised dealers by announcing a repo rate at 6.90 per cent to next Wednesday, higher than the established repo rate of 6.80 per cent. The move did not imply a tightening of monetary policy, but nevertheless gave a temporary setback to most European currencies. The French franc fell below the FFr3.51 level against the D-Mark but later closed at FFr3.499 from a previous FFr3.502. The Danish krone fell as low as DKr4.1350 at the start of European trading and later closed at DKr4.1225. The Belgian franc came under more intense pressure at one stage, but closed a little stronger on the day at BFr21.30 from its previous BFr21.37. The dollar was also undermined by the German move, closing at DM1.6665 from a previous DM1.6680 on a day which brought no important US data. Sterling closed at DM2.5000, down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day. For the last few weeks, market volumes have been thin. But on Tuesday many dealers return to work after their holidays. It is striking that they do so just as a watershed has appeared in in the three major trading areas in the market: the ERM, the dollar/D-Mark currency pair and the dollar/yen exchange rate. There is little doubt that the Bundesbank's failure to cut rates will put intense pressure on France, Belgium and Denmark to decouple their monetary policies from Germany. Thus far, they have tried to shadow the D-Mark by keeping interest rates high. But their currencies could show a downward trend over the next few weeks, whether they cut rates or not. There will be a new focus on the dollar/D-Mark exchange rate too, especially in the week of the August payroll report. Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS, believes that a high figure for the report could give the dollar a new boost. But the dollar is now trading below DM1.67, a level it tried hard to break on the upside for most of the last year - and it may be difficult to sustain a recovery above this level. On the dollar/yen rate, yesterday's close of Y103.95 from a previous Y104.40 has led some economists to think that the Japanese currency is building substantial new strength. But next month's attempts by the Japanese government to stimulate the economy may strengthen the import side of the country's trade balance. Mr Chertkow thinks we may never see Y100.</p>

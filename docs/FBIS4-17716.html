			<p>BFN     [Text] Talks on conflict settlement among Armenia,  Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh are to resume in the Kyrgyz  capital between 3 and 5 May.    Speaker of the Kyrgyz Supreme Council Medetkan Sherimkulov,  who has already held two rounds of talks with the warring sides,  today received information that the chairmen of the supreme  councils of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh -- Babken  Ararktsyan, Rasul Kuliyev, and Karen Baburiyan, respectively --  will arrive in Bishkek for the talks. Baburiyan will take part  in the talks for the first time.    The chairman of the Federation Council of Russia and head of  the interparliamentary assembly of the CIS member-states,  Vladimir Shumeyko, is also due to visit Kyrgyzstan at the time  of the talks. He is expected not only to participate in the  talks, but also to sign an agreement on interparliamentary  cooperation between the Federation Council and Kyrgyzstan's  Supreme Council. It has been suggested that a joint commission  should be established to coordinate this cooperation.</p>

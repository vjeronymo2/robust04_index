			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Arts: Daylight allowed in on magic Sovereign, the unprecedented exhibition about Queen Elizabeth II that opens at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum today, will be enjoyed by visitors in different ways. For me, one of the most eloquent images is a rather mundane photograph of the European Community summit meeting in London in 1977. There is Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the president of France, standing next to the Queen, looking his imperial best and about seven feet tall. Chancellor Schmidt is almost concealed between some half-forgotten politicians. Giulio Andreotti, then as so often prime minister of Italy, has placed himself well. James Callaghan, the British prime minister, smiles on benignly from the side. Where is Giscard now? The image could be repeated time and again, for the Queen has survived so many comings and goings. She must have known more Commonwealth leaders than anyone else in the world. At home she has watched the departure of eight prime ministers - possibly nine by next week. Her private diaries would be as priceless as some of her jewels. It is the mixture of continuity and change that astounds. The Queen never ceases to adapt. Bagehot wrote of the monarchy in a well-known line: 'We must not let daylight in on magic.' But, in a controlled way, the Queen has been letting in daylight all the time. The Palace may complain that the Royal Family is sometimes maltreated and misrepresented by the press, but the interesting question about the monarchy and the media is who uses whom. You will not find the complete answer in Sovereign, but there is some fascinating evidence. The Queen and British television came of age together. It was the Queen who insisted that her coronation in 1953 should be shown live on the small screen. Sir Norman Brook, the cabinet secretary, wrote a minute saying that this would open the door to the unthinkable: for example, the televising of the House of Commons. Churchill let the Queen have her way, and television took off. So did other families. Listen to the broadcast of the coronation today, as you can in Sovereign, and the voice is unmistakably Dimbleby: it could just as well been David, at times even Jonathan, as Richard. Even the cameraman at the Abbey wore morning dress. The rest of the media were friendly to the point of reverential. When the BBC Home Service carried a bulletin from the Palace, it was spoken in tones that suggested the whole nation must listen, and perhaps it did. Pathe news in the cinema did it with more dash, but with the same belief that everything British must be good, especially when blessed by the Queen. When it showed Her Majesty opening the country's first atomic power station at Calder Hall, the next line was about how the 180 families were to live there. When the Queen went to Germany in 1965, the banner headline in the Daily Sketch was KAMERADSCHAFT, under the strap 'The Queen appeals to West Germany: let's be partners in Europe'. How times have changed. The Sketch has long since disappeared and is remembered, if at all, as the definition of a really frivolous newspaper - even more so than the tabloids that have survived. The Queen preferred broadcasting and continues to do so, possibly because it is so much easier to control, and the press can turn fickle. Sovereign contains lots of old film. It is remarkable to watch how many firsts she has witnessed and sometimes initiated. She saw in not only atomic power, but also Concorde, the decimalisation of the currency, North Sea oil and - the exhibition reminds us - the election of the first black woman MP to Westminster. She was the first monarch to visit the prime minister's country residence at Chequers. The guide to Sovereign suggests that the Queen has the best-known face in the world today. With the stamps, the coins and the banknotes, that may be true. Yet the exhibition understates, I think, her contribution to the Commonwealth and the concern of some other members of the Royal Family about poverty in the third world and dereliction in the inner cities. Of course, there is much more besides, like the display of the Queen's wardrobe over the years, brilliantly treading the narrow line between dullness and ostentation. There are also some of the Queen's paintings, the replica of a state dinner with its gold service, the original Magna Carta, pictures of horses and dogs: the regal along with the homely. See it for what you will. There is nothing about the excesses of the young royals or of the media baying for scandal, which are among the problems of the modern monarchy. Sovereign comes over as a portrait of a responsible woman determined to carry on with her duties. The exhibition is sponsored by Reed International, the Daily Telegraph and Pearson, which owns the Financial Times. Not even the organisers are sure how far it will draw the crowds. Sovereign runs at the V&amp;A until September 13 Hours: 10.00 to 17.30 Mon-Sat 12.00-1730 Sundays Normal admission Pounds 6. Student, OAP and family concessions</p>

			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE VOTES FOR NEW CURBS AGAINST BEIJING;  </P> <P> 81-10 APPROVAL OF TOUGHER ECONOMIC SANCTIONS IGNORES ADMINISTRATION VIEW ON  ISOLATING CHINA  </P> <P> Ignoring the Bush Administration's objections to further isolation of China,  the Senate voted tough new economic sanctions Friday to punish the Beijing  government for last month's bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> The measure, co-sponsored by the Democratic and Republican Senate leadership,  was approved by a vote of 81 to 10 -- far more than the two-thirds majority  needed to override a presidential veto.  </P> <P> Both California senators, Republican Pete Wilson and Democrat Alan Cranston,  voted for it.  </P> <P> The legislation would suspend for six months insurance and financing of  American business in China by the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment  Corp. It would also bar indefinitely the use of foreign aid funds for  China-related activities, block commercial contracts for Chinese space rockets  to launch U.S.-made satellites, suspend licenses for export of crime control or  detection equipment and ban nuclear exports to China.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sensitive Technology  </P> <P> The measure writes into law the ban on export of weapons, including helicopters  and helicopter parts, that President Bush imposed by executive order  immediately after the June 3-4 massacre in Beijing. It also requires the  President to negotiate with other Western nations to prevent export of  sensitive technology to China.  </P> <P> The House passed a similar measure, 418 to 0, last month. The legislation was  sent to a conference committee to reconcile minor differences between the two  versions.  </P> <P> In Paris, where Bush is attending an international economic conference, White  House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Administration's position "is  the same as it was toward the House-passed bill (which Bush opposed)."  </P> <P> "We believe our policy is adequate," Fitzwater said. "We also have to be  mindful of the long-term relationship (with China.)"  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier that the United States and  most of its allies agree it would be a mistake to adopt additional sanctions  that would have the effect of isolating China from the rest of the world. At  the same time, he said, it is too early to talk about lifting existing  sanctions.  </P> <P> But Congress clearly wants to go further than the Administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> People's 'Concern'  </P> <P> Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) said the legislation "is  designed to express to the government of China the concern which the American  people feel about the continuing persecution of Chinese students and workers  who support the pro-democracy movement."  </P> <P> The bill, co-sponsored by Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), was attached as an  amendment to legislation authorizing funds for the State Department. Passed  after only 10 minutes of debate, the measure headed off even tougher sanctions  proposed by Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.)  </P> <P> In addition to the sanctions, the bill urges Bush to reconsider the extension  of most-favored-nation trade status to China. The Administration renewed  China's status in May, shortly before the crackdown on pro-democracy  demonstrators in Tian An Men Square. Under the law, the matter need not be  reopened until next year.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Can Be Lifted  </P> <P> The legislation permits Bush to lift the sanctions if he certifies to Congress  that China has made progress on a program of political reform or that it is in  U.S. interests to end the measures.  </P> <P> To lift the suspension of nuclear transfers, the President would also have to  tell Congress that China has provided unequivocal assurances that it will not  help any nation without nuclear weapons to acquire nuclear explosive devices or  materials.  </P> <P> In a non-binding section, the measure calls for suspension of loans by the U.S.  government's Export-Import Bank to finance U.S. exports to China.  </P></p>

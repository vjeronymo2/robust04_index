			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans seek extra sugar access to expanded EU The European Union's traditional sugar suppliers want to ship 700,000 tonnes a year more to meet the higher demand they expect to result from the expansion of the union. Exporters in the African, Caribbean and Pacific group, who have an overall quota of 1.3m tonnes a year, have told the EU that they can guarantee the additional 700,000 tonnes. 'With the impending expansion of the European Union and changes in the sourcing of sugar for Portugal, the ACP countries have an opportunity to expand their exports,' said Mr Karl James of the Sugar Association of the Caribbean. 'A recent study done on production in the ACP states indicates that they can ship 700,000 tonnes more each year, and in the negotiations with the EU we are asking that this be bought at the preferential price we now enjoy.' The European Union is changing its sugar import regime and will establish a mechanism for the access of additional sugar under an agreement that will become effective in July 1995 and run for six years, according to the Sugar Association of the Caribbean. 'The EU's proposals are an encouraging development and will provide the basis for the ACP group to negotiate with the EU to achieve its objective of additional access at the guaranteed price.' In a move to make more of another preferential market, Caribbean Community (Caricom) sugar exporters have asked the US government for changes in the allocation of their import quotas to allow other producers in the group the first call on meeting shortfalls of any member, said the Sugar Association. 'The United States does not allow any member of the group to supply any or part of a quota belonging to another member,' the association said. The US Department of Agriculture sets annual import quotas for Caribbean and other producers. 'Some countries have frequent difficulty in meeting their US quotas,' said Mr James. 'Barbados, for example, has not shipped any sugar to the US for several years, but none of the association's members benefit from this shortfall. This is what we have asked the US Department of Agriculture to change.'</p>

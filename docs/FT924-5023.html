			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: For those with Pounds 50,000 to spare . . . - Five financial advisers explain to Philip Coggan how they would spread their investment portfolios to maximise capital growth CAPITAL growth, rather than income, is normally the goal for savers who are working. This is especially the case as few people use up their annual capital gains tax (CGT) allowance (Pounds 5,800 in 1992-93) but most income-producing investments incur an immediate income tax liability. So, the Weekend FT asked a group of financial advisers to recommend a portfolio of Pounds 50,000 for an investor seeking capital growth. For simplicity, it was assumed that the investor was a single person paying top rate tax. Investors should remember that, with some of the policies recommended, commissions and other initial charges will take a chunk out of their capital. But four of the five advisers have recommended index-linked National Savings (NS) and tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas), where there are no additional charges, while the costs involved in buying index-linked gilts through the post office are relatively low. Unit trusts and single premium bonds will incur bid-offer spreads of 5-8 per cent, however, and investment trust dealing will also involve stamp duty, brokers' commission (in some cases), and a bid-offer spread (which will vary with the liquidity of the trust). The costs mean these portfolios should be considered only for long term investment. Note also that the advisers recommend a broad spread of investments with exposure to bonds, equities, tax-efficient products and a measure of inflation protection. DAVID HARRIS, of Chantrey Financial Services in London, says: 'I believe that economic uncertainty in the UK, and turmoil in the exchange rate mechanism, makes it paramount for investors seeking capital growth to retain a prudently balanced portfolio, seeking to protect them from fluctuations within equity, cash or fixed interest markets.' He includes both index-linked gilts and NS and stresses: 'Individuals must recognise the threat of inflationary trends, even though predictions are for lower inflation rates in the foreseeable future.' In the equity field, Harris says: 'My selection of Newton for the Pep (personal equity plan) investment is based on the fine historic record of the Newton Income fund. Both the Mercury and Schroder selections reflect broadly based, conservatively managed UK portfolios. The Fidelity Special Situations trust has had a poor record during the recession, but is the type of trust that is ideally placed to benefit from an upturn in the UK economy.' Harris also includes the Fleming Far Eastern investment trust which 'should offer individuals good long term performance prospects from the wide range of economies available in this geographical sector.' He adds: 'The Baring and Kleinwort Benson fixed interest funds provide a sensible balance to this equity exposure.' His recommendations are: 6th issue of index-linked NS certificates. Amount Pounds 5,000. Treasury 2.5 per cent index-linked gilt 2003. Amount Pounds 6,000. Tessa account. Pounds 3,000. Personal equity plan in Newton Income unit trust. Amount Pounds 6,000. Baring's offshore International Bond fund. Amount Pounds 5,000. Kleinwort Benson's offshore gilt fund. Amount Pounds 5,000. Schroder's UK equity unit trust. Amount Pounds 5,000. Mercury's British Blue Chip unit trust. Amount Pounds 5,000. Fleming Far East investment trust. Amount Pounds 5,000. Fidelity Special Situations unit trust. Amount Pounds 5,000. RICHARD ALLEN, of Willis Corroon Financial Planning, says: 'Advantage should be taken of most of the tax-exempt investments appropriate to a higher rate taxpayer, with the final portfolio consisting of approximately 50 per cent in equities and 50 per cent in secure or balanced investments.' He first chooses a Pounds 3,000 Tessa investment with the Leeds Permanent, which pays 7.5 per cent tax-free, and adds the 6th issue of index-linked NS, which will pay 3.25 per cent above inflation tax-free if held for five years. Allen would then split Pounds 16,000 between three single premium investment bonds - a with-profits bond from Prudential Holborn, and unit-linked bonds from Sun Life and Standard Life. He says income could be accumulated but withdrawals could be taken later. He also suggests investing Pounds 6,250 (allowing for charges) in a Pep with TR City of London investment trust, and a similar sum in a Clerical Medical High Income Pep, when the new tax year starts in April. Extra equity exposure would be gained through the Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust and Framlington's Recovery unit trust, re-investing income in all cases. Allen adds a Pounds 5,000 holding in Whittingdale's Short Dated Gilt fund, pointing out: 'Assuming interest rates continue to fall, the value of this fund should increase. But it should be encashed in about two years' time to fund a Newton Income Pep for the 1994-95 tax year. Finally, Allen is left with Pounds 500, which could be invested in premium bonds 'or into a case of Chateau Mouton Rothschild which, if it fails to appreciate, could be appreciated at a retirement party.' His selections: Tessa with the Leeds Permanent. Amount Pounds 3,000. 6th issue of index-linked NS. Amount Pounds 5,000. Whittingdale Short Dated Gilt fund. Amount Pounds 5,000. Prudential Holborn with-profit investment bond. Amount Pounds 6,000. Sun Life Deferred Distribution bond. Amount Pounds 5,000. Standard Life Managed bond. Amount Pounds 5,000. TR City of London investment trust Pep. Amount Pounds 6,250. Clerical Medical's Equity High Income Pep. Amount Pounds 6,250. Foreign &amp; Colonial investment trust. Amount Pounds 4,000. Framlington Recovery unit trust. Amount Pounds 4,000. Premium bonds/Mouton Rothschild. Amount Pounds 500. CLIVE SCOTT-HOPKINS, of the Windsor-based Towry Law, has chosen a portfolio with a strong equity bias. 'With interest rates on the decline world-wide, there are growth opportunities in world equity markets - especially the UK, US and Far East, with Europe and Japan likely to pick up later in 1993 - that we have not seen since the crash of 1987.' Scott-Hopkins chooses Perpetual's Growth &amp; Income unit trust in a Pep. He says the international fund has been 'second in its sector since its launch in 1989. Its assets are 50 per cent in the UK/Europe and 50 per cent in the US/Far East.' He adds a single company Pep run by Kleinwort Benson. For investment and unit trusts, Scott-Hopkins puts half the portfolio in his own company's discretionary service, managed by Mercury Asset Management. He adds a Pounds 6,000 investment in Exeter's zero preference unit trust which, he says, is 'the only authorised unit trust specialising in the management of zeros, with average redemption yields of 9 per cent and greater immediate growth as interest rates fall further.' Finally, Scott-Hopkins recommends putting Pounds 10,000 in a bank-backed business expansion scheme (BES). He says there are a number in the pipeline, with banks providing a contractual exit route in five years and a six month loan-back option. (Note that the latter is not available for basic rate taxpayers). His recommendations are: Personal equity plan. Perpetual's Growth and Income fund. Amount Pounds 6,000. Single company Pep. Kleinwort Benson's managed plan, present choice Cable &amp; Wireless. Amount Pounds 3,000. Towry Law's investment and unit trust discretionary service. Amount Pounds 25,000. Exeter Zero Preference unit trust. Amount Pounds 6,000. A bank-backed BES. Amount Pounds 10,000. JAMES HIGGINS, of London-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe, says it is pointless trying to distinguish over the long-term between pensions and investment. If the individual's pension needs are not met fully, he feels the maximum possible investment should be held in this area. Otherwise, Higgins suggests a portfolio designed for medium term growth and tax efficiency. First, he proposes a single company Pep, with a high yielding utility such as Bristol Water. He then adds a general Pep using the income shares of split capital investment trusts. 'As well as generating a high yield, they can offer the prospect of capital growth,' says Higgins. 'For example, Jove and River Plate both offer yields of over 12 per cent. As interest rates fall, there is some scope for the price of these shares to rise.' Another class of split trust shares favoured by Higgins is the zero preference. 'For reasons of security, we like the fully covered shares which offer a fixed redemption price at a given date,' he says. 'Compared with deposit rates, these returns are very attractive indeed. 'For example, TR Technology offers a gross redemption yield of over 8.5 per cent, a return which will be classed as capital gain for tax purposes.' Higgins puts Pounds 14,200 in zeros and Pounds 1,800 into a Tessa on the ground that many investors will be past their first year of contributions by now. He adds index-linked NS and a 'cash-back' BES, covering a further Pounds 15,000. Finally, he puts a further Pounds 10,000 in a managed currency fund, saying: 'While there is blood being spilled in the currency markets, these funds have the opportunity to make money - much more so than in relatively stable times. We particularly like the Hambros EMMA Managed fund because that covers bonds as well as currencies.' His recommendations are: General Pep in income shares of split level investment trusts, for example Jove and River Plate. Amount Pounds 6,000. Single company Pep in Bristol Water. Amount Pounds 3,000. Zero coupon shares of split level investment trusts - for example, TR Technology. Amount Pounds 14,200. 6th issue of index-linked NS certificates. Amount Pounds 5,000. A cash-back BES. Amount Pounds 10,000. Managed currency fund. Amount Pounds 10,000. Tessa. Second year instalment. Amount Pounds 1,800. JOHN COLE, of London-based adviser Berry, Birch and Noble, says: 'A balance needs to be struck between what we believe are opportunities for above-average returns in equity-related areas and the need to maintain an investment spread which includes more secure areas of growth. There is a danger of inflationary pressures growing in the economy.' Cole chooses the 6th issue of index-linked NS certificates, plus a further Pounds 6,000 in an index-linked gilt, and adds: 'Although relatively small, a Tessa is worth including. We would also like to set aside Pounds 10,000 of capital for investment in a BES - in particular, a scheme with an assured exit route. The tax relief of Pounds 4,000, which would come back next year, would be used to fund part of 1993-94's Pep entitlement.' As a Pep, Cole chooses the Murray Income trust which, he says, has a 'reasonable yield.' Finally: 'We would like to see more geographical spread into international sectors and, in the circumstances, would recommend NM's discretionary Unit Trust Portfolio Management Service. 'Their capital growth portfolio allows unit trust selections to be made from the market place without restriction and, most importantly, is a fee-based service.' His suggestions are: 6th issue index-linked NS certificates. Amount Pounds 5,000. Treasury 2 per cent index-linked 2006. Amount Pounds 6,000. BES. Amount Pounds 10,000. Tessa from Leeds &amp; Holbeck. Amount Pounds 3,000. Murray Income trust Pep. Amount Pounds 6,000. NM Unit Trust Portfolio Management Service. Amount Pounds 20,000.</p>

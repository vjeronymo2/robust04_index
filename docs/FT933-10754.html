			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Crisis continues AFTER last Friday's unprecedented turmoil in the European exchange rate mechanism, dealers were still waiting last night to see whether the Bundesbank and the Bank of France would realign the currency grid or suspend the system, writes James Blitz. At the end of trading on Friday night, three currencies, the French and Belgian francs and the Danish krone were at, or slightly above, their floors against the D-Mark in the ERM. Both the French and German central banks had intervened heavily in support of the French franc, possibly to the tune of DM50bn. Yesterday, dealers in London were wondering how they would respond in the event of various outcomes to the crisis. In the event that the system is suspended, the French franc could come under some more selling pressure. But Mr Paul Chertkow, global currency strategist at UBS, said that the franc could rebound above its notional ERM floor against the D-Mark because France's fundamental economic position is so strong. A strong alternative to suspension was that the bands for the franc and Danish krone could be widened, perhaps to 6 per cent, allowing the franc to drop further while maintaining its central parity. But Mr Ian Harnett, an economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, said this would have to be accompanied by German interest rate cuts which would then allow France to ease monetary policy. If that did not happen, the market could try to test the new floor for the French franc and other currencies in the near future. Dealers will keep a close watch on the dollar/D-Mark level. The threatened disintegration of the ERM may depress the D-Mark because the system has been the cause of so much investment in the German currency.</p>

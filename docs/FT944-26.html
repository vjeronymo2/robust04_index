			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Sport: The Cup that blotted out the fun - War and Peace (Playing fields and battlefields) / It was the year of the World Cup and the Winter Olympics, the bung and the bribe. Peter Berlin reviews the events of 1994 The World Cup has grown so large that it blots out the sun for five weeks and throws into shade other sports events for months before and after. But around the orgy of marketing and broadcasting there was a normal sporting year, with an abnormal number of extreme highs and lows. The Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, in February opened in a blaze of publicity after Nancy Kerrigan, a figure skater, was attacked with a crow bar during the US trials by Jeff Gillooly, the husband of her chief rival Tonya Harding. Kerrigan lost at the Olympics to Oksana Bayul of the Ukraine. In Britain, 24m people tuned in to watch Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean try in vain to regain the Olympic ice dance title. Instead, the hero of the games was the impossibly noble Norwegian Johan Olav Koss, an Easter Island man on blades, who won three golds and set three world records. The unfancied Welsh won the five nations championship in rugby, though nobody could quite work out how they did it. Wigan won the double in rugby league. But the visits of the Australian rugby league team and the South African union side suggested that the centre of gravity in both sports remains firmly in the southern hemisphere. The balance of power in golf is also shifting south of the equator. Nick Price of Zimbabwe won the Open and the US PGA. While Ernie Els of South Africa won five tournaments, including the US Open, and a record Pounds 1.8m. Cricket had its share of heroes and villains. Brian Lara broke Sir Garfield Sobers' test scoring record with 375 against England in Antigua in April, then joined Warwickshire, helping them to win three trophies, and scoring 501 against Durham at Edgbaston. The England Test team continued to reel from crisis to crisis, pausing only to raise their fans' expectations cruelly with competent performances against West Indies in Barbados, where Alec Stewart scored two centuries, and against South Africa at the Oval, where Devon Malcolm took nine wickets for 57 runs to save the series. The nadir among many low spots was the unseemly matter of the dirt in captain Mike Atherton's pocket. The England team finished the year supine at the feet of Shane Warne, the Australian spin bowler. The Formula 1 drivers' championship was decided in the last Grand Prix in Adelaide where Michael Schumacher collided with Damon Hill at speed. Schumacher was widely accused of crashing deliberately to preserve his lead in the championship. Like all the drivers, Schumacher is acutely aware of the dangers of losing control. The whole season was raced under a pall after Ayrton Senna and Roland Ratzenberger died in much-replayed crashes. If Schumacher was so desperate to win that he was prepared to risk being a posthumous champion, then he has crossed the line between bravery and lunacy. Perhaps the anti-blood sports league should found a branch to protect humans. It could demonstrate at grand prix circuits, American football games and boxing matches. Boxing resembles professional wrestling more every year. But wrestling has better costumes, fitter performers and more plausible fights. Twenty years ago in Kinshasa, a superbly fit 25-year-old faced Muhammad Ali, 32 and deemed to be over the hill, for the world heavyweight title. Ali won. George Foreman lost. It is a measure of how far boxing has decayed that in November, Foreman, now an overweight, bald, grandfather, regained the heavyweight crown. It is easy to understand why Frank Bruno was so willing to foresake pantomime in search of yet another last boxing pay-day, since there is less and less difference between the two. Tennis also needs a serious heavyweight champion. Martina Navratilova retired; Monica Seles refused to unretire; Steffi Graf often played as if she was thinking of retiring; and Jennifer Capriati, retired, was arrested in a drugs raid, and then came back. The WTC raised the minimum age for players to protect them from burning out. It then waived the rules to admit two 14-year-olds with star quality: Martina Hingis and Venus Williams. Pete Sampras finished the year as men's number one. He is the leader of an elite of hard-working young men without charisma who hit the ball very hard. The exception is Andre Agassi, who returned after a five-month lay-off and won the US Open unseeded, pleasing those who still believe in genius. The apex of the soccer year was not the World Cup final but the European Cup final in May. Milan swept aside Barcelona 4-0 with a performance that seemed to herald a new era for the club and the sport. Instead, the club's fortunes have mirrored those of its owner, Silvio Berlusconi. In the autumn, Milan lost the World Club final to Velez Sarsfield, a poor and unglamorous club from Buenos Aires. The World Cup in the US opened well. Fifa, world soccer's governing body, had, it seemed, got it right. The stadiums were full; the referees enforced new, harsher laws and, as a result, goals and play flowed. A darker note entered in the second round after Diego Maradona was expelled for drug-taking and Andreas Escobar was shot after scoring an own goal which helped eliminate Colombia, one of the pre-tournament favourites. Matches were staged at midday or in mid-afternoon to accommodate European television viewers, and the soccer began to suffer. Players had to work in conditions that ran from sweat-shop (New York), through steel-foundry (Dallas) to Turkish bath (Orlando). Teams that had spent five weeks playing in steam ran out of it in the end. The final was a weary spectacle. It yielded no goals and was decided by the inability of the cramped legs of Franco Baresi and Roberto Baggio to keep their penalties down. The finals still yielded rich memories: Baggio's last-minute heroics, George Hagi's guile, Hristo Stoichkov's explosiveness, Saeed Owairan's unorthodoxy, Romario's gift for the unexpected, the Nigerian mix of delicacy and power, the attacking teamwork of the Spaniards. The World Cup provided some light in the year of the crash and the crow bar.</p>

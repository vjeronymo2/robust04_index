			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Arts: Canaletto's view of the English landscape - Patricia Morison visits the inaugural exhibition in the converted Gas Hall, Birmingham Birmingham's high profile as a city which has lavished money on the arts is, from some angles, hideous - such as the new Convention Centre and Raymond Mason's pink fibre-glass sculpture outside it, my candidate for the most repellent work of public art. Happily, everyone can unite in welcoming the latest addition to Birmingham's cultural scene, the splendid Gas Hall Exhibition Gallery. The old turn-of-the-century Gas Hall has been turned into a spacious exhibition gallery of 1,000 square metres. Renovated and designed by architects Stanton Williams, the entrance way is dull, but never mind. The Edwardian interior with its triple aisles and pillars, terrific for sculpture, makes an attractive and versatile space for visiting exhibitions. It cost Pounds 4m; Pounds 1.8m from the EC, Pounds 1.15m from the city, the rest from an appeal now close to its Pounds 1m target. State-of-the-art air-conditioning means that Birmingham will be able to bid for the grandest international travelling art shows. There could be no better house-warming than Canaletto and England, an exhibition which is beautiful, full of interest, and has a really good catalogue. Yet the show is not just about Canaletto, even though there are over 30 of his paintings, among them some of the best in the country and some from private collections. It is also about the influence of Canaletto on a host of artists from Samuel Scott and Rowlandson to Girtin, Bonington and Turner. Part of the show's interest comes from deciding how fully you accept its curators' thesis that Canaletto deserves the credit for giving English mid-18th-century topographical painting a much-needed shot in the arm. Was Piranesi not quite as important, you may ask. In the end, are not the echoes of Canaletto less striking than the differences between his view of the English scene and the evolving native tradition? Canaletto came to England in 1746. It was his first and only visit abroad, and the motive was money. George Vertue, a great source of gossip on the London art world, thought that Canaletto was attracted by the English stock market which offered 'better Security or better interest than abroad'. However, the fundamental reason for the trip was that business in Venice was flat. How well Canaletto deserved his fame in the 1720s and 1730s is shown by a small, well-chosen group beginning with the 'Allegorical Tomb of Lord Somers'. This piece of rococo theatre (rather badly lit) is on long loan to Birmingham and belongs to the speculative series of sepulchral tributes to British Worthies commissioned by the Irish impresario, MacSwiney. For sheer magic, nothing in the exhibition can beat a pen-and-ink drawing of San Michele from the Ashmolean, every line wiggling as if the world were merely a watery reflection. Engravings of such scenes allowed the modestly rich man to have a souvenir. But the elite who made the Grand Tour simply had to have their Canaletto oil, like the pair of hot, colourful views of the Grand Canal and the Rialto Bridge bought by the Earl of Leicester. They bought Canalettos very nearly by the yard. By 1746, Canaletto had saturated the market with Venetian views and war had checked the tourist flow. The artist's energetic agent, Consul Joseph Smith, knew that the Whig grandees were modernising London with impressive projects such as the building of Westminster Bridge. They were pouring money into their country seats and landscaping the grounds and surely would jump at having Canaletto on hand to record their triumphs? They did, although perhaps with not quite the eagerness expected. In eight years he sold more than 60 paintings as well as etchings and finished drawings. Yet there were low points when business was thin. Was it cause or effect that, as the exhibition clearly demonstrates, some of Canaletto's English scenes are damned dull? It was not surprising that Canaletto had trouble in adapting to England. His unique talent was for capturing the duet between blue sky and Venice's sparkling water. England's cloudscapes, London's cobbles and mud, were not at all the same thing. Spiteful comment even suggested that he was an impostor. 'The Old Horse Guards from St James's Park', bought by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber for the astounding figure of Pounds 10.12m, is certainly large but it lacks charm. The trouble may have been that Canaletto was not trying to please anyone in particular. He simply painted the canvas and advertised it in The Daily Advertiser. One odd feature of Canaletto's views of England is that he seems almost never to have showed horses. I spotted just one in a Canaletto drawing, although he often included dogs and urinating men. Both men and dogs had often appeared in Venetian vedute where as horses, of course, had not: was this one consequence of changing places to which the Venetian could not adjust? Ladies' crinolines, however, he seized on as a way to enliven foregrounds with bold blobs of pink, white, blue and lemon. The crinoline dodge works well in his paintings of Warwick Castle and still better in the view of the Thames from the Duke of Richmond's riverside palace. When we look at this ravishing pair from Goodwood, it seems mad to think that Canaletto was past his best. But then, Canaletto was new to London and desperate to impress the duke, his best contact. He painted one view from an upstairs window, looking north up Whitehall at the vestiges of Tudor London, soon to be swept away. In the view from the terrace, Canaletto has the Thames as his accomplice. The water is a mesmerically beautiful lilac, with squiggles of grey suggesting the pull of the tide. The sky, of course, is that brilliant blue which tells us that in reality, the duke had bought himself a stretch of Venice-on-Thames. Sponsored by British Gas. Exhibition runs until January 9. Meanwhile in London there are many Canalettos in George III and Consul Smith at the Queen's Gallery, Buckingham Palace, until December 23.</p>

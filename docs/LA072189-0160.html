			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Non-Farm Income Rises: Led by big payroll gains in the West, personal income  for non-farm workers rose by 9.4% in the first quarter of 1989 from a year ago,  the Commerce Department said. In its regional survey, the department said  income jumped a strong 15% in Nevada, followed by 12.1% in Florida and 10.7 in  California -- the three fastest growing states in the nation. For the entire  nation, non-farm personal income stood at an annualized $4.23 trillion in the  first quarter, compared to $3.87 trillion in the first quarter 1988. The  figures are not adjusted for inflation, which is now running at a 5.9% annual  rate at the consumer level.  </P></p>

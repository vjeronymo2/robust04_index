			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial by Themos Kh. Stoforopoulos: "Justified Fears"] </F>   [Text] The Greek prime minister's visit to the United  States causes concern, because it has become obvious that the  U.S. policy in our region not only does not take Greek interests  into account but is opposed to them and is trying to "organize"  the Balkans and the Near East against Hellenism, with Turkey as  its axis. No one can believe that the only superpower cannot  influence Ankara, Tirana, or Skopje [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] to support legality and peace.    With our behavior, which has turned us into a mere object to  be maneuvered by the United States and the other Western powers,  we have contributed to the formulation of the U.S. policy. We  have not really utilized any of our advantages and have let our  defense and economy reach a state where our dependency has  become complete.    Our fears are being reinforced, because in all of the years  that he has been responsible for our foreign policy, Prime  Minister Andreas Papandreou has yielded to U.S. suggestions on  substantive issues and tried to hide this behind a rhetorical  screen.    Before it assumed the leadership, we remember that PASOK  [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] was opposed to the  intercommunal talks in Cyprus but afterward willingly conveying  to Nicosia the transatlantic requests for the intercommunal  talks to continue and the pro-Turkish "solution" to be accepted.  We remember how we stayed in the NATO consortium, the bases  that were supposed to leave but remained, the exploit of the  courageous Greek Armed Forces during the 1987 crisis in order to  "put over" the postponing (at NATO inspiration) of our exerting  our sovereign rights in the Aegean. We have not forgotten the  first Davos conference (Papandreou-Papoulias) with the Americans  behind the scenes (as they of course were during the second  Davos conference of Mitsotakis-Samaras).    What stance will the prime minister take in Washington? Will  he stress the Turkish regime's natural fascist, expansionist  character, which is being supported by the United States and  presented as a model? Will he remind them of the Armenian and  Pontian genocides, the September Revolution, the deportations,  and other measures against Greeks and the Ecumenical  Patriarchate? Measures that are still in effect. Will he  condemn Ankara's behavior in Cyprus and northern Kurdistan, the  Aegean, and Thrace? Will he refer to the murder of Theofilos  Yeoryiadhis [in Cyprus]? Will he say that due to its nature,  the Turkish regime is violating human rights each day? That it  is continuously widening economic inequalities that arouse the  public's discontent (as also expressed at the expansion of  Islamism)? Will he underline the dangers of encouraging the  Albanian authorities' antiminority policy and the Skopjean  ideology?    Will the prime minister tell the U.S. President that after  20  years of fruitless negotiations on Cyprus--during which the  Turkish side has gradually hardened its demands while at the  same time carrying out more illegal actions--Greece believes  that no more talks should be held until all the Turkish troops  and settlers withdraw from the island unconditionally, until the  pseudostate renounces its claimed status, and until the basic  freedoms of all Cypriots are restored? Will Greece stress that  it will not give up any of its sovereign rights in the Aegean  and that it will guard its sovereignty in Thrace? Will the  prime minister strongly defend the just Greek positions in  Macedonia and North Ipiros?    This stance, which is the only beneficial one for the  nation,  would bring Greeks everywhere closer. It would make the  activity of Greek-Americans particularly effective.    Let us hope that the prime minister will not give in to  pressure from Washington to make concessions on our national  issues. For example, that it will not agree to support further  discussion on the confidence-building measures on Cyprus because  they favor the Turkish schemes. That it will not legalize  Turkey's expansion and its machinations against Greece by  accepting a third Davos conference. That it will not agree to  "freeze Greek-Turkish disputes," even with NATO "guarantees,"  because its political vision is well known.    If we followed such recommendations, the repercussions would  be very negative and the "trade" for Greek-American business  access to the Balkans unacceptable (even financially  unprofitable).</p>

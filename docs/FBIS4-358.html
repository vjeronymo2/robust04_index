			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the armed wing of the RPF on 7 April; </F> place not given; read by (Emmanuel Muzinga)]    [Text] [Words indistinct] (?increasing) deterioration of  the situation, the RPF [Rwandan Patriotic Front] made public a  communique [words indistinct] (Emmanuel Muzinga):    [(Muzinga)] Here is a communique from the Rwandan Patriotic  Army [RPA] military high command:    While regretting the tragic events that caused the death of  the Rwandan and Burundian presidents, Juvenal Habyarimana and  Cyprien Ntaryamira, we call on the Rwandan people, and on  friends of the RPF in particular, to remain calm and allow our  country to pass through the current difficult period without  mishap.    We also wish to warn certain elements, which are  exacerbating  this situation by attacking members of opposition parties or  Tutsis. By this we mean that at this moment, Rwandans are being  persecuted, or perhaps even killed, because of their political  or ethnic affiliations. These acts of violence are mainly  attributed to sections of the Presidential Guard, who are backed  by government soldiers.    To safeguard the peace process initiated in our country, all  these acts of violence must cease immediately. This is the only  effective means of resolving Rwanda's problems. Every kidnapped  individual and his family must be released immediately.    If these demands are not met, or if the relevant authorities  fail to get the situation under control, the RPF and its army  will be compelled to take all necessary steps to carry out a  sacred duty -- that of protecting the country's innocent  citizens. We hope that reason will prevail over passion and  that everyone will realize that neither violence nor war can  help us solve Rwanda's problems.</p>

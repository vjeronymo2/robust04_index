			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 2 Jan (NA) -- Economy Minister Domingo  Cavallo has said that in 1994 the economy will grow by 6 or 7  percent, investments will increase by 15 percent, and exports  will increase by 10 percent.    The minister said that 1994 will be "a very good year" in  macroeconomic terms, and that inflation will be "below 5  percent."    Cavallo said that next year's great challenge will be the  construction of new factories "to expand productive activities  in the interior of the country, permit investments, and allow  the creation of job opportunities and goods and services  demanded by the people."    Cavallo reiterated that in order to achieve these objectives  it is necessary to reach an agreement with the provinces --  through the fiscal pact -- in order to reduce taxes on  productive activities and so reduce costs.    The minister said that the program will be complemented by  "strong investments by the private sector and the provinces in  roads, telecommunications, energy, railroads, and ports."    Cavallo said that increases in exports should be derived not  from the fluctuations in international prices, but from the  "increase in exportable volume." The minister forecast "an  important increase in the export of hydrocarbons -- oil and gas  -- as well as in agricultural products." Cavallo said that in  1993 the export of industrial manufactured products increased by  22 percent with respect to 1992.    The minister said that of the $1 billion 1993 increase in  imports over 1992, "$900 million were the result of importation  of capital goods."    Cavallo made these statements in an interview published by  the magazine NOTICIAS. The minister said that in 1993  "consumption increased by 4 percent while the gross domestic  product increased by 6 percent, which means that national  savings have also increased."    The minister said that "all investments will be financed by  our internal savings" by the year 2000. "This does not mean we  will reject foreign capital, but I hope by then local companies  will be investing outside of the country."    Regarding the 1994 fiscal account, Cavallo said: "It has  been demonstrated to the IMF, and to all those who had doubts  about the current Argentine Government economic policies, that  we can lower tax rates, or eliminate them, and still increase  our tax collections through the legalization of the country's  economy."    Cavallo stressed that economists who predicted that the  government would not be able to fulfill the year's fiscal goals  were wrong, and will this year be wrong again. The minister  added that the government will continue to improve on the tax  administration system, will increase its austerity in the area  of spending, and will intensify the fight on corruption using  the criteria of equality and efficiency in the use of resources.    Cavallo pointed out that Santiago del Estero proved that  "those who wanted to get votes with demagoguery and by  squandering local resources will think twice before doing it  again." "You can also win elections with austerity," Cavallo  said, adding that "we must terminate the payment of exorbitant  salaries and state purchases from contractors."</p>

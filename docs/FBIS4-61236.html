			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by N. Borovskaya: "Speaker Was Elected on the First </F> Day"]    [Text] The Kaliningrad Oblast Duma began its work on 26  April. The agenda prepared by the organizing committee included  16 issues. Naturally, deputies were unable to cope with such a  number of topics in just one day, all the more so since a  portion of the first session was devoted to representative  issues. Members of political parties and civil movements  welcomed the representative body and expressed their  expectations toward it.    Later, deputies arrived in the suite on 17 Kirov Street --  which had been previously allotted to them -- to begin their  work. Gennadiy Batutin, the oldest deputy of the Duma, was  elected the chairman of the first session. Deputy Danuta  Smirnova was elected his deputy. Yuriy Matochkin, head of the  Kaliningrad Oblast Administration, addressed the Oblast Duma.    During the first day, deputies managed to form working  bodies  and approve the statute of the first session. The most urgent  question -- who would become the Duma speaker and deputy speaker  -- was resolved within five hours. In the course of several  rounds of voting and numerous consultations, Valeriy  Nikolayevich Ustyugov, head of the Baltiysk Rayon  Administration, was elected Duma speaker by a margin of 17  votes. Yuriy Nikolayevich Semenov was elected deputy speaker  (13 votes cast in favor, 6 against, and one invalid).    We will provide more details on this fascinating story, as  well as on the entire session that lasted two days, in the  following issues of our newspaper.</p>

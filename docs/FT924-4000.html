			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Technology: Playing it again - Films on CD may soon replace traditional videos, but far more is in store for viewers Humphrey Bogart died 35 years ago, but he could soon return to the entertainment world as the star of a new film on compact disc. New developments in digital technology promise to make it possible to revive past Hollywood stars such as Bogart from old films and put them in new ones. At this stage, Hollywood studios are cagey about their plans for this rapidly advancing technology. But by turning Bogart's image from the films in which he starred into digital signals, which can then be manipulated, they could make the star of Casablanca do things on CD that he never did on celluloid. That, however, is only one of the creative possibilities offered by digital video. It has the potential to do for images what digital sound on CDs has done for music - provide random access and the ability to make near-perfect copies. There will be no need for rewinding to get to a particular sequence. Nor will repeated viewing mar the image. Intriguingly, films on digital video could have alternative story-lines, to be selected according to the viewer's taste, or different characters could be worked into the story. Imagine your favourite James Bond film with a new ending. Whatever surprises emerge, video seems set to move into a new generation. For most consumers, video means products in analogue form such as cassette tapes and laser discs. While digital audio has been available to consumers in CDs for more than 10 years, it is only recently that work to digitise picture information has approached the commercial stage. That is because there is so much more information in a visual image than in a sound recording. After conversion to digital signals, the image must be squeezed sufficiently for storage on a CD. 'The picture is compressed and blown up again, and the trick is to do this without people noticing,' explains Simon Turner, head of the interactive systems group at the Philips Research Laboratories in Redhill in the UK. Images have a compression factor of 133 compared with one of about four for sound; so video compression requires far more processing power than sound compression. At Redhill, where work to convert visual information into digital signals and compress it (known as encoding) has gone on since 1989, 10 minutes of full-screen video used to take three weeks of continuous processing with a mainframe computer. But rapid advances in digital technology are bringing digital video closer to the desktop and into the living room. Philips, the inventor of the CD, has been working on the digitisation of video for the consumer market. Next year, the Dutch group will bring out a device called a full-motion video decoder to be slotted into its Compact Disc-Interactive machine, a new type of home entertainment system the group launched last year at about Pounds 500. It enables users to play with audio, graphics, data, animation and photographs stored on CDs and viewed on their television TV screen. When fitted into a CD-I machine, the FMV decoder - which will sell for about Pounds 125 - will enable digital videos to be viewed on TV, but not to manipulate them. CD-I sets incorporating FMV will also be launched in the near future. The challenge Philips faced in developing full motion video for consumer use was to provide high-quality digital video at prices acceptable to the consumer market. That meant putting the decoding function - the conversion of the digital signals into full motion video images that can be shown on the TV screen - on a single chip and reducing the cost of the decoder. That work has been carried out in close collaboration with Motorola, the US semiconductor and communications group. Meanwhile, the encoding time has been substantially reduced and Philips expects to have a real-time encoding machine next year, which could encode 10 minutes of film in 10 minutes. Once the encoding and decoding hurdles have been overcome, the manufacturing of digital videos on CD will cost no more than audio CDs - about 50 pence. But digital video is only one step towards the digitisation of visual images. Expectations that moving images will increasingly be digital have led companies in industries from telecommunications to computers and semiconductors to join forces in the Moving Picture Experts Group and agree an international standard for digital video encoding, known as MPEG-1. This will be followed by MPEG-2 for products with a higher data rate such as digital TV. The quality of digital video based on MPEG-1 will depend to a large extent on the quality of the original source but should be at least as good as ordinary video tapes. Philips' demonstration videos using high-quality original source material look considerably better. But Philips is nonetheless dependent on the studios to come up with software which does the quality justice and attracts consumer interest. Fortunately for Philips, Hollywood studios and TV broadcasters are keen to develop creative applications of digital video as another way to exploit the visual material they own. George Lucas, of Star Wars fame, is one of the many producers looking at the creative possibilities of CD-I and full motion video. Interest is also strong in the UK, where more than 20 studios are developing applications. Wildvision, part of BBC Enterprises, is working on a game in which a particular ecosystem is used as a backdrop to follow the adventures of animals living there. 'We were immediately taken by the idea of interactive video,' says Michael Bright, managing editor of Wildvision. Philips expects to have 15 titles available in the spring with the launch of full motion video and many more to follow as work at various studios produces results. While there are undoubtedly interesting ideas for interactive video, the big question is whether any will be good enough to spark enough interest in the new technology. Without a few hot-selling applications, digital video could prove to be ahead of its time and the market too slow to produce the dividends Philips needs.</p>

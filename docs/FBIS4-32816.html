			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Our America" commentary by Manolo Ortega] </F>   [Text] The meeting between the six Central American  presidents and U.S. Vice President Albert Gore has resulted in  nothing more than disillusion. The Central American presidents  were disappointed with the so-called Tegucigalpa minisummit  because Gore rejected any links between their countries and  NAFTA in the short-, mid-, or long-term. It is true that the  presidents had extremely high expectations for this meeting, and  with good reason. To join in an agreement of this nature has  enormous significance for a region still suffering the effects  of a 10-year war and ever-increasing poverty levels.    Although the United States promised to open its markets to  textile imports from Central America, this will only happen  after each Central American country complies with a number of  requirements and conditions imposed by the United States. These  conditions include approving a series of labor laws, creating  laws to protect intellectual property rights and copyrights,  establishing regulations to protect the environment, and  complying with NAFTA's rules of origin governing the textile  sector.    The foreign debt, a paramount issue that determines whether  Central American countries are able to advance economically and  which precludes the region from undertaking sustainable  development because of all of the resources it consumes, was not  discussed at the Tegucigalpa minisummit. We must recall that  Central America and the Caribbean had accumulated a $37-billion  foreign debt by the end of 1993. For countries like Nicaragua  and El Salvador, the foreign debt is an extremely onerous burden  because these nations have so many economic, political, and  social problems resulting from their prolonged wars.    Leading Central American newspapers have criticized the  presidential meeting and stress that Vice President Gore did not  make any clear references to topics of enormous regional  interest, such as the fight against poverty and the  often-mentioned regional incorporation into NAFTA. Although  Hondurans did take advantage of Vice President Gore's visit to  display posters across the conference hall eloquently asking for  the withdrawal of U.S. soldiers from their territory, Gore did  not seem to care at all. Many analysts have agreed that this  meeting tried to exalt the virtues of the so- called hemispheric  summit that will be hosted by President Clinton and which seeks  to become a panacea for this part of the world. The  presidential summit that will be held in Miami in December has  been revived by President Clinton precisely at a time when the  defense and recovery strategies proposed at the various  Ibero-American summits are now in the process of being  consolidated.    It appears that the Miami meeting is aimed at chastising  countries looking for a social model different from that of the  United States, and it seems the session is also designed to  remind the region that the only country that can convene  meetings of this nature is the powerful North American nation.  The hemispheric summit may end up being as disappointing as the  Tegucigalpa minisummit, where the U.S. Vice President simply  voiced some promises, all of which were tied to demands that are  nearly impossible to meet.    Central America, a region with a population of 30 million  and  still burdened by social injustice and military predominance,  urgently needs specific development projects, rather than  promises. In this sense, the visit by the U.S. Vice President  was fruitless.</p>

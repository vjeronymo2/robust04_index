By now multi-level property-right exchange markets of  different sizes have been established in over 20 Chinese cities  of 14 provinces and more are in preparation.    Central China's Henan Province has set up more than 20  property-rights exchange markets and disposition markets for  properties lying idle.    Northeast China's Jilin Province had auctioned 436 local  state-owned enterprises through property-rights markets by the  end of last year.    Mudanjiang City in northeast China's Heilongjian Province  has  got funds of about 57 million yuan by auctioning 10 enterprises  to buyers from the Republic of Korea and Hong Kong.    Sixteen enterprises were sold out to and five were leased by  domestic individual businessmen or those from Hong Kong and  Taiwan on a property-rights exchange fair held last September in  central China's Hunan Province.    Reform measures have also been taken to shift state-owned  enterprises into collective enterprises through annexing or  other ways, according to the survey.    Utilization of foreign capital has seen a new boom. Quanzhou  City in east China's Fujian Province introduced foreign  investment to all of its 41 state-owned enterprises in the first  three months last year.</p>

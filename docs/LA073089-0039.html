			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING;  </P> <P> GRAPEFRUIT: HOW SWEET THEY CAN BE;  </P> <P> TWO FAIRLY NEW VARIETIES LACK THE BITTERNESS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH FRUIT.  </P> <P> According to John Pehrson, a citrus specialist at the University of  California's Lindcove Field Station, once people sample Melogold or Oroblanco  grapefruit, they will probably never again be satisfied with ordinary  grapefruits.  </P> <P> The grapefruit Pehrson was referring to are two fairly new grapefruit varieties  that lack the bitterness associated with ordinary grapefruit.  </P> <P> Both the Melogold and Oroblanco varieties are almost as sweet as a navel  orange, although they have the characteristic flavor of the grapefruit, and  both varieties are seedless. Even people who are not fond of grapefruit will  probably appreciate these varieties -- grapefruit fanciers will be ecstatic  over them.  </P> <P> Both were developed by crossing a grapefruit with a pummelo. Both Melogold and  Oroblanco were developed at UC Riverside, by geneticists Robert K. Soost and  James C. Cammeron.  </P> <P> Both grapefruit will grow and produce in home orchards in much of the  Southland. Generally the production will probably be better and the fruit of  better quality in warmer areas. However, I live in a mild area of Orange County  and I have an Oroblanco tree in my yard that produces marvelous, sweet fruit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Scarce in Nurseries  </P> <P> Oroblanco trees have been available in local nurseries for about six years, but  budwood for Melogold was just released two years ago by the university to  wholesale growers for propagation. The trees are scarce in retail nurseries.  </P> <P> I asked John Pehrson which one of these two super-grapefruit actually had the  best flavor. He said it all depended on who was doing the testing. For  instance, Pherson prefers the Melogold, while his wife favors the Oroblanco.  </P> <P> Pherson suggested I do a taste test and I took him up on it. With the help of  five friends, we sampled and compared Oroblanco and Melogold with a standard  grapefruit variety (Marsh) and then compared them with each other. In  comparison with the standard grapefruit, it was no contest. Both Oroblanco and  Melogold won hands down, and one of the tasters remarked that she wondered how  she could go back to eating ordinary grapefruit again.  </P> <P> In the contest between Oroblanco and Melogold, five of us preferred Melogold  and one favored Oroblanco. The one who opted for Oroblanco thought that there  was a slight aftertaste with Melogold. Pehrson acknowledged that a few others  had noted the same thing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Judged Absolutely Superb  </P> <P> The tasters all felt that Melogold was a little juicier, although two tasters  felt Oroblanco was sweeter.  </P> <P> Both varieties were judged absolutely superb. In physical appearance, both  Oroblanco and Melogold are colored like the typical yellow grapefruit.  Melogold, however, has larger fruit than a standard grapefruit.  </P> <P> If you like grapefruit and have room in our yard (there areno dwarf trees yet),  I highly recommend either Melogold or Oroblanco. I feel that these are truly  the grapefruit of the future. Oroblanco trees are usually easy to locate in  nurseries, while Melogold trees are difficult to find at present.  </P> <P> Purchase only healthy, vigorous looking transplants. Avoid trees with long  trunks and branches concentrated at the top; the tree should have good skirt  branches. If the transplant has any fruit on it, pick it off so the tree's  energies will be devoted to foliage production.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Plant in Sunny Area  </P> <P> Plant your tree in a sunny area and make certain that the grafting union is at  least 3 inches above the soil line. Dig a hole twice as wide as the root ball,  but only as deep as the tree was originally grown. Plant the tree and refill  the hole with the soil you originally removed.  </P> <P> Fertilizer tablets, such as Osmocote Planting Tablets or Jobe's Tree Spikes,  added to the soil at planting time will feed the young tree without burning it.  Water thoroughly after transplanting. Wrap the trunk of the new tree with a  tree wrap material available at nurseries or paint it with a white latex paint  to prevent sunburn.  </P> <P> Irrigate the new tree twice a week, or more frequently during hot weather, then  water it on a weekly basis but not as often during late fall and winter.  Fertilize in February or March and again in July or August with a  general-purpose citrus food. Do not fertilize in late fall. This promotes new  tender foliage growth that would be subject to frost damage during the winter.  </P> <P> Depending on your location, Melogold and Oroblanco will be ready for harvest  between December and February.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Ciampi, Delors on European Growth </F> Strategy"]    [Text] Rome, 18 Feb (ANSA) -- Italian Premier Carlo Azgelio  Ciampi and European Commission President Jacques Delors today  pushed the latter's White Paper on Growth and Employment as a  way of addressing Europe's longer-term problems rather than  relying on short-term monetary management, while stressing the  need for extending European construction to include the  countries of the former Eastern bloc.    Speaking at an international employment forum organised here  by the European Social Studies Institute, both men pointed to  Italy's summer cost-of-labour accord as an example of a more  flexible and responsible approach to economic policy, while  Delors highlighted the Volkswagen hour and pay-cutting deal as  an instance of how employers could pursue socially responsible  solutions to industrial crisis.    Ciampi stressed how national and European problems -- with  spiralling unemployment to the fore -- were "interpenetrating"  and how the European Union remained an "indispensable" forum for  seeking solutions to the recession.    He reiterated the importance of monetary and political  integration within the Twelve, and expansion to include other  European countries, while Delors called on the Union to "bridge  the gap" with East Europe -- for which "we are also responsible"  -- and look at institutional changes with a view to creating a  future 35-nation Europe.    The European Commission President also revealed that he will  probably attend the March Group of Seven Detroit summit on  growth and employment, saying that U.S. President Bill Clinton  was one of the G-7 leaders who was most concerned with  coordinated strategies to pull the world economy further out of  recession.    Ciampi again hailed the July cost-of-labour accord as an  achievement that had allowed Italy to peg inflation (making  "realistic this year's goal of 2.5 percent" and bringing a big  pay-off in debt servicing costs), cut interest rates, boost  exports and regain international confidence. He pointed to the  government's recent employment booster as a way of raising the  efficiency of social buffers and free up the labour market so as  to create jobs for young people.    Delors also praised the labour accord as an atypical example  of cooperation "at a time when social dialogue in Europe seems  to be between deaf persons," while pointing to the Volkswagen  deal as an important example of "flexibility inside firms."    Indicating his White Paper on pan-European communications  projects, funded by possible European Union bonds, as a way of  "opening the windows onto the mid term and getting away from a  day-to-day approach to economic policy," Delors said that  "budget and monetary policies are not the only elements needed  to reach full employment."    In reference to high unemployment benefit costs -- 80  percent  of European spending in job-protection policy -- Delors stressed  that "we must stop funding idleness and make it an obsession to  create new work."    At the same forum, the vice president of the Italian  employers' association, Carlo Callieri, pointed to "an  assessment of instruments of social coordination to allow  monetary authorities to loosen the noose of interest rates" as  one of the ways in which competition and employment might be  reconciled. Callieri called on the present and future  government to meet pledges on cutting the weight of the public  sector and reducing the cost of labour, if employment is to be  boosted.    The leaders of Italy's big three trade unions, CGIL [Italian  General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of  Trade Unions] and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions], also  had their say.    CGIL leader Bruno Trentin called for talks between the  government, employers and unions to look at ways in which the  White Paper could be implemented in Italy.    CISL leader Sergio D'Antoni censured the Ciampi government  for a perceived lack of industrial policy, and called for  Europe-wide fiscal policies.    UIL leader Pietro Larizza said it was "not possible to think  of a politically and economically united Europe and leave each  country with separate union policies," and criticised the  government for alleged lack of action in public works, for which  "not one lire will be spent this year, even though the projects  are on the agenda."</p>

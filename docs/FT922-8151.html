			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Indian state institutions snap up shares INDIA'S state-owned financial institutions took part in large-scale share purchases yesterday to reverse a price collapse on India's stock markets. The Bombay Stock Exchange 30-share index rose 11 per cent, adding 344.76 to 3,431.13, wiping out Tuesday's sharp decline. The two-week tumble in share prices had been triggered by revelations of a financial scandal that resulted in the syphoning of funds from the government securities market into equity purchases. The massive intervention by the financial institutions came after the stock exchange authorities overnight banned forward selling in 85 shares. In an effort to curb abuses in the interbank securities market the Reserve Bank, the country's central bank, yesterday issued fresh guidelines to commercial banks operating in the market. The central bank said banks should not hold an oversold position in a security - meaning that a bank should not sell a security which it did not actually hold. Finance Ministry officials say that some of the abuses in the securities market involve 'fraud and potential criminality.' The Reserve Bank is also probing securities dealing by ANZ Grindlays, Standard Chartered, Bank of America and Citibank, as well as 15 Indian state-owned banks. ANZ Grindlays, India's largest foreign bank and the one believed to be most exposed to losses from abuses in the securities market, last night declined to comment further on its involvement. It issued a press release which said that the bank sees 'no useful purpose in adding to speculation in the market'. According to widespread market reports, National Housing Bank issued a cheque to Grindlays for a large sum which was then credited to the account of Mr Harshad Mehta. Mr Mehta is the Bombay broker who was forced to repay Rs6.2bn (Pounds 122m) to State Bank of India to settle outstanding accounts in the interbank market in government securities. In its new guidelines the Reserve Bank also banned the use of brokers' accounts in interbank dealings. In the present financial scandal the worst abuses occurred as a result of connivance between brokers and bankers in what are normally direct transactions between banks.</p>

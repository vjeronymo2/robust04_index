This is a new victory which the Iraqis have  achieved for their nation and for Iraq, and also a retreat and  defeat for the enemies of both the Iraqis and the nation.    Receiving Iraqi Transport and Communications Minister Ahmad  Murtada in Khartoum today, the Sudanese president added that the  countries which launched the treacherous 30-state aggression on  Iraq are today suffering from disturbances, internal crises, and  an unstable situation when Iraq is continuously proceeding  forward and restoring all that was destroyed in the aggression  to a better condition with a new militant spirit in all walks of  life despite the unfair blockade.    Lt. Gen. al-Bashir asked the Iraqi transport and  communications minister to convey his greetings to President  leader Saddam Husayn and the proud Iraqi people. He expressed  his high appreciation of Iraq's support for Sudan in the  technical, consultative, and engineering fields. Sudanese  Transport and Communications Minister 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Qadir and  the Iraqi ambassador in Khartoum attended the meeting.</p>

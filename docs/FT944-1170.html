			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Mars to rethink advertising role of Saatchi Mars, the privately owned US confectionery and pet foods group, has launched a review of the bulk of its Dollars 1bn (Pounds 640m) worldwide advertising, in response to Mr Maurice Saatchi's removal from the board of advertising group Saatchi &amp; Saatchi last Friday. Saatchi's Bates Worldwide Advertising network is one of Mars' two leading agencies. The company's decision to invite other agencies to pitch for the business placed with Bates - and other Mars business - makes good a threat by the Mars brothers, John and Forrest, to consider severing ties with Saatchi if Mr Saatchi was ousted. Mr John Murray, responsible for worldwide marketing at Mars, said: 'In view of the management changes at Saatchi, we have decided to examine our options. It is a good opportunity to review the performance of our agencies.' Saatchi is responsible for about Dollars 400m of Mars' worldwide advertising, worth some Pounds 30m in annual revenue to the advertising group. Bates subsidiary is Mars' lead agency for three of its most successful brands, each with annual sales of more than Dollars 1bn: M&amp;Ms and Snickers, the chocolate products, and Pedigree, the dog food. Mars was one of the first three accounts acquired by Bates after it was set up in 1940. At the moment, Saatchi shares Mars' business with DMB&amp;B, which also handles about Dollars 400m of business from the confectionery group, and Grey Advertising. Grey's Mars business is also understood to be at risk, though the private confectionery group's relationship with DMB&amp;B is thought to be secure. Mr Murray said several other advertising agencies would be invited to make pitches and that the selection process was likely to take several months. The Mars brothers wrote to Mr Saatchi earlier this year, stressing the importance of their relationship with him. The letter says: 'It seems appropriate to remind you, and the management of Bates/Saatchi, that we insist that our agencies have their top people involved in our business. This has taken several years to get correct and the present relationship with you specifically has become significant.' Mr Saatchi is credited within the advertising group he founded for recently persuading Mars to give Bates the European account for Maltesers. However, he infuriated many colleagues during last week's tumultuous boardroom events by asking the Mars brothers to reiterate their threat to move their account, in an attempt to persuade the Saatchi board of the possible commercial damage to the group were he to be ousted. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi has recently helped Mars create its first interactive computer game advertising campaign. Early next year, computer games publisher Konami will launch 'Biker Mice from Mars', a game which involves characters eating Snickers bars for the power to defeat the evil Dr Limburger.</p>

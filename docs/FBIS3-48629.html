The three-year loan program is to be implemented from fiscal  1996 starting in April 1996.    Under a Chinese plan, a Japanese Shinkansen-type high-speed  railway will be built by the year 2000 between Beijing and  Shanghai at a cost of 1 trillion yen, the sources said.    Trains running at maximum speed of 250 kilometers per hour  on  the 1,200-kilometer railway are expected to cut traveling time  between the two cities to six hours, one-third the present time.    The Japanese Government is expected to select Chinese  projects for application of the loans before Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa visits China, probably in mid-March, the  sources said.    Under its third package of yen loans to China between fiscal  1990 and 1995, Japan is providing 810 billion yen to finance 42  projects.</p>

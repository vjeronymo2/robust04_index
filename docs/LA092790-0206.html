			<p><P> September 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OIL PRICES ROCKET BUT BUSH'S MOVE MAY HELP CALM THEM  </P> <P> In trading that saw rumors of war overwhelm reason, oil prices topped $39 a  barrel and closed up sharply Wednesday. But prices are expected to fall now  that President Bush has said he will tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an  attempt to calm frenzied oil markets.  </P> <P> Crude oil for November delivery surged $1.14 to finish at $38.67 a barrel, the  latest in a string of record closing prices in the last week and the highest  close since crude futures began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in  1983.  </P> <P> The high during the trading day was $39.05, just short of the previous high of  $39.20 reached on Monday.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a new survey showed that the average retail price of regular  unleaded gasoline in California rose 6 cents in the last month to $1.372 a  gallon, defying normal seasonal trends. The survey of 600 California stations  by the California State Automobile Assn. also found price variations of as much  as 45 cents a gallon between different stations for the most popular grade of  motor fuel.  </P> <P> On the New York Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday, crude oil prices opened lower  and traded as low as $36.48 in reaction to American Petroleum Institute  statistics released the day before showing ample supplies of crude, gasoline  and heating oil.  </P> <P> The API, the oil industry's main trade group, reported Tuesday that U.S. crude  stocks of 364 million barrels in the week ending Sept. 21 were down slightly  from the week before but remained 33 million barrels above the level of a year  ago. Stocks of both gasoline and distillates, which include home heating oil,  were above week-ago and year-ago levels.  </P> <P> But fear soon overcame economic fundamentals Wednesday, and prices quickly  rallied as Persian Gulf-related rumors drifted across the trading floor. The  first was that an Iraqi jet had been shot down over the Persian Gulf; the next,  that the United States had given an ultimatum to Iraq to get out of Kuwait  within 48 hours, and the last, that Iraqi troops had stormed the U.S. Embassy  in Kuwait City.  </P> <P> All of the rumors turned out to be unfounded, though Secretary of State James  A. Baker III did confirm later that Iraq had demanded a list of non-diplomats  who have taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy and threatened to hang some of them.  </P> <P> "We come back to the problem: Which is more important? The fundamentals of  supply and demand, or rumors and psychology?" asked Peter Beutel, an oil  analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc. in Hoboken, N.J. "This morning, it  was the fundamentals. This afternoon, it was psychology."  </P> <P> Crude oil for delivery in months after November also closed up, and traders and  analysts again saw oil markets, which had appeared to peak Tuesday, testing the  $40-per-barrel limit and remaining nervous in the absence of a material change  in the Middle East crisis.  </P> <P> But prices could fall sharply today. After markets closed Wednesday, Bush said  he would tap 5 million barrels of the 590-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum  Reserve.  </P> <P> Refined products closed mixed Wednesday. Unleaded gasoline for October delivery  initially fell sharply in reaction to the API figures. They showed national  gasoline inventories at 222.3 million barrels, 5.3 million barrels above the  level of a week ago and 3 million barrels ahead of last year as the summer  driving season comes to an end.  </P> <P> But October gasoline gained back some of its losses and closed down 1.95 cents  at $1.001 per gallon. Gasoline for later delivery closed up.  </P> <P> Heating oil for October delivery closed up 1.37 cents at $1.0257. Heating oil  in later months closed up much higher in anticipation of winter demand:  December heating oil was up 2.48 cents at $1.0477 a gallon.  </P></p>

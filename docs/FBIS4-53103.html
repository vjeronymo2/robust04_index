			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Political commentary: "A Stand Worthy of Welcome and </F> Support"]    [Text] AFP on 13 May cited the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry  spokesman saying that the Vietnamese Government was ready for  peaceful negotiations on border problems between the two  neighboring countries on the basis of mutual respect for  independence and territorial integrity.    This statement from Vietnam came after King Norodom Sihanouk  was quoted by the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW from an interview  he gave to the magazine on 11 May as accusing Vietnam of moving  the border postings deep inside Cambodia and digging canals  inside the country.    Cambodia and Vietnam share a common terrestrial border of  1,130 kilometers and the border problem has been a bone of  contention between the two countries since the French  colonialists left Indochina in the 1950's.    The border disputes between the two countries have remained  outstanding. Moreover, there have been rumors that Vietnam has  moved border markers into Cambodian territory in the Cambodian  provinces bordering Vietnam on the west.    It should be recalled that during Vietnamese Prime Minister  Vo Van Kiet's official visit to Cambodia last April, the two  countries agreed to create an expert team to discuss and solve  their land border conflict.    Vietnam, like Thailand, is a signatory to the Paris 23  October 1991 accord. According to the accord's provisions, the  two countries should respect Cambodia's territorial integrity  and national unity and restrain themselves from interfering in  the country's internal affairs. Following the establishment of  the National Assembly and the formation of the Royal Government  of Cambodia through the elections organized by the United  Nations in May 1993, the Cambodian Constitution defined  Cambodia's border in accordance with the 1/100,000 map of the  1960's. Nevertheless, border issues in the eastern and western  parts of Cambodia remain unsettled, resulting in endless  conflicts and accusations.    With goodwill to achieve peace, security, and have good  neighborliness, which contributes to restoring peace and  security and promoting cooperation in the region as well as  reinforcing world peace, the Cambodian people wish to  enthusiastically welcome the aforementioned stance of the SRV  Government and call on other neighbors of Cambodia to follow the  fine example. Moreover, words and actions should move  concurrently.</p>

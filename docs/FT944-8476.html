			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy The odds of another rise in UK interest rates before year-end to prevent the economy overheating shortened yesterday. The government revised upwards GDP growth for the second quarter to 1.3 per cent and reported growth in the third quarter of 1.1 per cent. That indicates the economy has been expanding at an annual rate of more than 4 per cent, compared with Treasury forecasts at the beginning of the year of 2.5 per cent. The last time the economy expanded that fast was in 1988. Those arguing against an imminent interest rate rise point out that the UK economy is presently only 3.2 per cent bigger than at its peak in 1990, so there should still be plenty of capacity left. Besides, inflation remains subdued. On Wednesday, the government reported underlying inflation for the year to October at a 27-year low of 2 per cent. Although unemployment fell sharply, underlying earnings growth remained unchanged at 3.75 per cent. Nevertheless, the gap between actual and potential output is closing. One worrying feature of the GDP figures was that investment fell slightly, meaning new capacity is not being created at the rate it should be at this stage in the economic cycle. The markets yesterday took the GDP figures in their stride, suggesting they are reconciled to an interest rate increase sooner or later. The exact timing will depend on whether the Chancellor is willing to risk the ire of retailers by putting rates up before Christmas.</p>

			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Japanese rice lobby applauds Gatt veto PROVINCIAL politicians in Japan yesterday applauded the government's decision to exclude rice from a list of food trade items to be liberalised, and agriculture officials added barley, wheat and dairy products to the list of exclusion. Japan has decided not to propose a tariff schedule to replace its present ban on rice imports in an agriculture trade package due to be presented under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). The exclusion of rice followed pressure from members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) who were concerned that a concession on the issue would further undermine the party's already shaky popularity. Mr Koichi Kato, the chief cabinet secretary, said the decision to withhold a tariff for rice reflected the continuing uncertainty over the course of farm trade talks in the Uruguay Round. Japan is planning to offer tariff cuts of between 15 and 30 per cent for a range of other agricultural products, and will reduce its internal supports for some grains and dairy products by 20 per cent.</p>

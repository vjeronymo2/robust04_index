			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / US industrial output makes weak rebound US INDUSTRIAL production edged up last month after a pause in March, indicating the economy is moving ahead slowly, the Federal Reserve said yesterday. Output rose 0.1 per cent, a weaker than expected rebound from March, when production was hit by severe winter storms on the east coast. The annual increase was a more robust 3.4 per cent. Many forecasters expect a stronger rebound later this quarter following signs that consumer spending is recovering after a weak first quarter. Reports this week showed a 1.2 per cent rise in retail sales between March and April; vehicles sales in early May remained well above first quarter levels. Consumer confidence, however, remains fragile: the University of Michigan's index was yesterday reported at 81.9 in early May against 85.6 per cent last month, reflecting growing public doubts about the efficacy of the Clinton economic plan. Separate figures yesterday confirmed a big increase in corporate inventories in March, which could depress growth in the second quarter. The modest overall rise in industrial output last month masked significant differences in sectoral performance. Manufacturing production was up 0.4 per cent and by 4.2 per cent in the past year. However, output of utilities fell. Production is biased toward business equipment, which rose 0.8 per cent in April for the second month running. Led by a surge in computer production, business equipment output has risen more than 11 per cent in the past year. Production of consumer goods, however, fell 0.2 per cent last month and was up only 2.4 per cent relative to April last year. Revisions to data since 1987 led to an increase in the Fed's estimate of the rate of industrial capacity utilisation - to 81.4 per cent last month, which could help explain why inflationary pressures have been stronger than expected.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Fahd al-'Arrak] </F>   [Text] Informed sources of the Chamber of Commerce and  Industry have denied that any of its members recently paid a  working visit to Israel along with a delegation of Gulf  businessmen.    These sources told AL-RA'Y AL-'AMM that what has been  published recently about a visit by businessmen from the Gulf  Cooperation Council to Tel Aviv last week may be correct, but  not a single Kuwaiti businessman participated in this visit.    It is noteworthy that the board chairman of the Egyptian  Airlines Company, ZAS [name as published], has recently stated  that his company had carried businessmen from the Gulf states to  Tel Aviv to discuss spheres of cooperation and joint  opportunities in light of peace prospects in the region.</p>

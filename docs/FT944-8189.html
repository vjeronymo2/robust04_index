			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Survey of Germany (6): Pessimists question euphoria - The economic recovery may mask structural faults Although some of the bounce has gone out of Germany's economic recovery, the debate over its speed and direction is as lively as ever. There are two clear schools of thought over the outlook. The most popular - promulgated vigorously by government and the business establishment during the latest federal election campaign - is that the recovery will continue uninterrupted, taking the country into an extended period of stable growth. Less popular, but equally persistent, are the views of the dissidents who warn that the recession and its aftermath have distorted the real situation. They say that despite the apparent rapid recovery, a combination of current weaknesses and the underlying structural faults in economic, fiscal and monetary policy indicate a rougher ride than that seen by the optimists. There is no disputing that the sequence of events so far this decade, starting with unification in 1990, has been extraordinary. The uniting of the two Germanies created a unique economic 'micro-cycle' as a result of which the international recession very nearly passed Germany by. In the event, pent-up demand for western goods and services in the former GDR effectively kept the slump at bay until mid-1992. Then, as partner-economies were starting to show real recovery, Germany slipped into its steepest cyclical decline since the war. Executives and economists who at the time admitted to being surprised by the downturn are now confessing to being equally surprised by the speed, breadth and momentum of the upswing. The recovery has been driven from the start by powerful export demand which has raised pan-German manufacturing industry's output by an estimated 3.5 per cent this year, following the 7 per cent nosedive recorded in 1993. Although differing over the finer details, most forecasters reckon on a further 4 per cent increase in industrial production in 1995 which should feed through into 3 per cent growth in gross domestic product following 2.5 per cent this year. The main assumptions are that: private and public demand will remain muted as a consequence of falling real incomes and political commitments to budgetary restraint; exports will continue to grow, although less dramatically than this year, and, crucially, increasing corporate confidence will lead to a rise in capital spending to the benefit of the domestic plant and investment goods industries and their myriad suppliers. A key factor behind Dresdner Bank's estimate of 3.1 per cent GDP expansion in 1995, for example, is an expected 8.3 per cent rise in expenditure on plant and equipment after a cut of 13.8 per cent in 1993 and an increase of a mere 1.6 per cent this year. Dresdner is also counting on an upturn in commercial construction to counteract the slowing pace in house-building. Which is where the pessimists join the argument. They claim that the housing boom, which led to an increase of almost 30 per cent in new mortgages in the first eight months of this year has been choked off by a 2 per cent increase in long-term interest rates. These rates, they argue, will act increasingly as a brake on capital investment within industry. Last month's traditional autumn assessment of the outlook from Germany's six leading economic institutes (see page 7 table) dwelt at length on the issue. A majority opinion (excluding Berlin's Keynesian DIW institute) noted that the international recovery and increasing demand for investment capital had pushed up long rates sharply and quickly. As a result, German business found itself faced with high borrowing costs at an unusually early stage in the recovery process. However, the institutes said, industry was undeterred. Investment had increased clearly from the middle of the current year as profit expectations improved. Restructuring and rationalisation undertaken during the recession had lowered break-even thresholds. Low pay deals and greater labour-force flexibility had reduced unit labour costs to rates prevailing at the start of 1991, and capacity utilisation was once again back at long-term average levels. All these indicators pointed to investment in new capacity. The DIW, on the other hand, believes that high long rates - a result of the anti-inflation activities of the US Federal Reserve which are unrelated to European conditions and market needs - will constrain investment plans. The nub of the conflict lies between the DIW's demands that the Bundesbank should cut short-term rates and the majority view that far from leading to lower capital market rates, such a move would raise both inflationary expectations - and, consequently, long rates. There is also strife, although less polarised, over the dampening effects of the D-Mark's relative strength on export opportunities, and the impact on domestic demand of continuing pressure on disposable incomes. A recent survey by Munich's Ifo economics institute found around half German companies were already counting on negative effects from the dollar's fall in mid-October to its lowest rate against the D-Mark in two years. On balance, however, the national currency's strength is in present circumstances seen as a positive factor since it acts as a buffer against imported inflation. Falling personal incomes are also playing a role in curbing inflation, reducing manufacturers' and retailers' room for manoeuvre on prices. But there is growing evidence that it may soon be time to reassess the broader effects of shrunken pay cheques. On recent experience, many economists predict the German public will continue to draw on their substantial savings to prevent any real erosion of their living standards. A study from the BVB banking industry association noted that: 'the stability of private demand is remarkable in the light of the fact that real incomes have been falling since the middle of 1993.' Consumer demand was still at the level it reached in the preceding phase of economic growth, the association said, adding that savings had acted as an economic stabiliser during the recession, and implying they would continue to function in similar fashion during the recovery phase. Latest estimates suggest real private consumption has grown around 0.5 per cent this year - confounding general forecasts of contraction - with a similar rise forecast for 1995. However, the introduction in January of an income tax surcharge to fund unification transfers, higher insurance taxes and the launch of a contributions scheme for care for the elderly are expected to slice another DM40bn a year off disposable incomes. If consumers respond by digging deeper into their reserves or reducing the amount of cash they salt away each month, it will not be long before the Bundesbank pays attention and will not hesitate to raise interest rates, regardless of the effect on growth.</p>

Accompanied by his Russian counterpart Pavel Grachev,  Delcroix toured the base, once off-limits for foreigners, to see  the most advanced Russian strategic missiles and other military  hardware.    The trip was part of Delcroix's two-day visit to Russia,  following the signing of a cooperation agreement by president  Boris Yeltsin and Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene in  Brussels in December 1993 to boost military contacts between the  two countries.    Delcroix's talks with Grachev centered around international  security in the wake of the adoption of the Partnership for  Peace programme proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the  historic U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian nuclear deal signed in Moscow  earlier this month.    Special attention was paid to European security, nuclear  non-  proliferation and the participation of both countries in U.N.  peace-keeping operations in Yugoslavia.</p>

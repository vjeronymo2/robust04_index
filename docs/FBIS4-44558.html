Plan Arrangements for 1994 </H5>   In 1994, State plans arrange for expected raw coal output of  1.16 billion tons, an increase of 20 million tons over 1993.  This includes 480 million tons at State-owned key coal mines, a  reduction of 27 million tons; 195 million tons at State-owned  local coal mines, basically the same as in 1993; and 485 million  tons at township and town coal mines, an increase of 13 million  tons. The total output plan for 1994 is a projected plan and  does not check the total output execution situation.    In 1994, the total amount commodity coal resources turned  over to the State for allocation was still 552.24 million tons.  This includes 479.98 million tons in State orders and 72.26  million tons in resources that were changed from State orders to  regional orders, concentrated in northwest China, southwest  China, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, and other regions, with the  remaining resources going through provincial orders and  enterprises doing their own selling on the market. The problem  reflected in coal orders in 1994 was once again that supplies of  coal exceeded demand, and in particular there were surpluses of  anthracite mixed pulverized coal and some varieties of dressed  coal for smelting.    During the process of executing production plans in 1994, we  must be concerned about the following problems: 1) The State  only implements macro regulation and control and an overall  balance. Many rights have been transferred down to  province-level administrative departments and enterprises, and  we must certainly do our jobs and assume our responsibilities.  We cannot let things slide because of the emphasis on macro  management and create a situation in which things have no one  managing them and nothing is being managed; 2) We must certainly  establish the concept of the market economy, solidly grasp the  focus on economic results, arrange plans on the basis of market  demand conditions and selling and transportation conditions, and  organize production and administrative activities; 3) Production  plan management arrangements and management measures have  changed, but mining bureaus and province-level administrative  departments must have an idea of what their mine production  situations are, how their economic results are, and which mines  should increase their output and which should restrict their  output or cease production, and they should adopt active  measures for additional guidance. Although production plans have  not been checked, enterprise production plans and province  (autonomous region) production plans should all be reported to  higher authorities on schedule and according to stipulations to  enable us to gain information and carry out industry management  and macro regulation and control. I ask that comprehensive  planning departments at all levels focus well on this item of  work in accordance with this requirement.    In the area of technical upgrading, plan arrangements are  for  883 million yuan to be invested in technical upgrading in the  coal industry during 1994, which will include 200 million yuan  in central government financial allocations, 513 million yuan in  bank loans, and 170 million yuan in self-raised capital for  projects receiving bank loans. The implementation of our  technical upgrading plans for 1994 requires that we  conscientiously focus on work in the following items: 1) Focus  on providing the capital. Investments in technical upgrading  during 1994 overall involve two forms. One is composed of State  allocations and self-raised capital. The other is composed of  bank loans and self-raised capital. To provide these funds, we  must do a great deal of coordination and linking work  everywhere. Planning departments at all levels must  conscientiously do this work well and report the situation in  funding implementation and plan execution to the Ministry of  Coal Industry; 2) We must focus on work to implement technical  upgrading projects, ensure project quality and progress, and  make technical upgrading projects produce investment benefits as  quickly as possible.    In the area of capital construction, the scale of  investments  arranged for coal in 1994 by the central government is 15.29  billion yuan, an increase of 20 million yuan over plans at the  beginning of 1993. This includes 4,247,300,000 yuan in domestic  budget investments, 8,654,700,000 yuan in construction bank  loans, 400 million yuan in special funds, 1.381 billion yuan in  foreign investments, 237 million yuan in investments to shift  from oil to coal, 270 million yuan in self-raising indicators,  and 100 million yuan in small-scale capital construction  investments in local coal mines. The main problems in  arrangements for investments in capital construction in the coal  industry are: 1) Limited investments, an increase of just 20  million yuan compared to 1993; 2) The 15.29 billion yuan in  investments still arranges for a 400 million yuan development  fund, but after coal prices are deregulated there will be no way  that this money can be obtained by users outside the calculated  prices. We have proposed to the State that it be changed into  other categories of investments; 3) There is 3.16 billion yuan  in capital construction bonds that will reach maturity and  should be repaid in 1994. We have arranged to repay 210 million  yuan in capital construction investments during the year, but  the remaining 2.95 billion yuan (bonds and construction loan  interest and principal) has not been dealt with. Preliminary  arrangements have been made for a scale of capital construction  of mines in the coal industry at 89 locations with 137.14  million tons, including 18 mines that will be placed into  production with 31.99 million tons, 64 mines where construction  will continue with 93.6 million tons, seven mines where  construction will start with 11.55 million tons, and 18 mines  where preparations for construction will be made with 68 million  tons. There are five mines with poor results that will cease  construction, with 3.09 million tons.    After consultations with the State Council and investment  companies, the principles for arranging for investments in the  coal industry in 1994 are: make key arrangements for those  projects that will have good administrative results after going  into production, can repay loans, and have good external  transportation conditions; make normal arrangements for those  projects which will have relatively good results after going  into production but which will be unable to repay the loans and  which have external transportation conditions; straighten out  those projects which would have poor administrative results  after going into production, experience losses, be unable to  repay loans, and have poor external transportation conditions,  and cease building those where construction should be stopped.  In addition, readjust the investment structure, increase  investments as appropriate in railroads, power plants, cement  plants, and other projects with benefits. In 1994, a total  investment of 1.996 billion yuan has been arranged for cement  plants, power plants, and railroads, an increase of 555 million  yuan over 1993. The ratio between mines and matching facilities  in yearly capital construction investments in the past was  consistently 67:33, but it will reach 58:42 in 1994. There is a  significant increase in investments in benefits projects.    Rather substantial changes will occur in coal investment  channels in 1994. In particular, construction bank loans will  account for more than half the total investments, which is an  increase of 1.9 billion yuan over 1993. All units should, in  accordance with previously arranged construction projects, focus  closely on linking together with management of construction  banks and conduct evaluation work for new construction loan  projects as quickly as possible to ensure that the loans are  used according to schedule.    1994 is the year of the State's greatest reform efforts and  a  key year for completing the Eighth 5-Year Plan. The coal capital  construction tasks are extremely heavy. The scale of mines (and  strip mines) which we plan to place into production in 1994 is  the greatest in one year during the past several years, and we  should start focusing on this item of work from the beginning of  the year and provide preferential guarantees for provision of  the construction capital, the supplies of equipment and  materials, and the construction staff arrangements required for  these projects. All areas must work together to cooperate and  ensure that tasks to place projects into operation during 1994  are completed. For those key mines where construction will  continue, coal washing plants, and other matching productive  projects, we must focus on those key projects which concern  construction schedules and provide overall benefits and make  preferential arrangements. For regular projects where  construction will be continuing, we must follow the previously  arranged investment indices and take into consideration price  increase factors, arrange for unit projects according to how  much we have to invest, and not leave investment shortages.</p>

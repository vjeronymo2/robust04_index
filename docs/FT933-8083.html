Worldspan, owned by TWA, Delta and Northwest Airlines of the US, and Abacus, a Singapore-based computer reservations company, is a leading provider of automated airline ticket reservation systems. Under the deal, a new network will interconnect Worldspan's European locations, and will be managed by AT&amp;T Istel, AT&amp;T's European-based network and information services provider. The contract is one of the largest in Europe for managing a single company's data network services.

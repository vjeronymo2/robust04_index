			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Alco Standard bids Pounds 67m for Erskine ALCO STANDARD, the acquis-itive US paper and office products distribution group, yesterday made a Pounds 67.4m recommended cash offer for Erskine House, the Kent-based office equipment service company. Under the terms of the proposed deal Alco will pay 90p a share for each Erskine ordinary share and 100p a share for the preference stock. In addition, provided the deal goes ahead, Erskine will pay shareholders a second interim dividend of 2.5p. Erskine, with operations in the US, UK and Germany, has been hard hit by the decline in machine sales in the UK which fell 24 per cent in the six months to September 30. First half pre-tax profits fell 29 per cent to Pounds 4.7m and the company warned in March that it would not be paying a full year dividend. The shares, which had been trading just above a 10 year low of 30p in recent weeks, jumped 54p to 89p yesterday after Alco bought 10m shares in the market, equivalent to a 21.7 per cent stake, at the 92 1/2 p offer price - including the second interim dividend. Mr Ray Mundt, chairman and chief executive of Alco, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and reported operating income of Dollars 225.7m (Pounds 146.5m) on turnover of Dollars 4.93bn last year, said the proposed acquisition represented 'the next logical step' in the group's global strategy. Mr Brian McGillivray, Erskine's chairman and chief executive, said the offer was 'good deal' for shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, although he acknowleded that he would have prefered to keep the company independent. If the deal goes ahead he is not expected to stay with the group although any parting would be amicable. Alco's office products division already operates the largest independent copier dealer network in North America with annual revenues of Dollars 1.5bn and has targeted Europe for further expansion. Mr Mundt said Alco identified Erskine as a possible acquisition target 'some time ago,' but only began negotiations on Friday night. The negotiations were completed over the weekend. Erskine House is the leading office equipment distributor in the UK with a 6-7 per cent market share although more than half its 1992 turnover and pre-tax profits came from its US operations. Erskine's US operations are strongest in New York, Houston and Los Angeles and will strengthen Alco's existing US business, according to Mr John Stuart who runs Alco's office products operations. Both companies supply and service the same office equipment from Canon, Ricoh, Sharp and Minolta.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / A hard slog ahead: Britain's stuttering economic performance presents a puzzling picture - The faltering recovery Rarely has the state of the UK economy been so difficult to assess. Official statistics over the past fortnight have provided some hope that manufacturing activity is gathering strength and that the rise in unemployment may be over the worst. But it is too soon to declare that the UK's longest post-war recession has ended. Where once Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might have spied the 'green shoots' of recovery, he now warns that years of hard graft will be required to bring the economy up to the standards of France, which he sees as a yardstick for UK economic achievement. A cynic might say that the change in rhetoric reflects no more than the transformation on April 9 of the government from one seeking election to one with a secure majority for parliament's full five-year life. But there is a genuine puzzle surrounding Britain's economic performance. Consumer demand - the one essential ingredient for a self-sustaining recovery - is notable by its absence. Yet it is difficult to see what the government can do about this without radically changing policy. There has been some good news in recent weeks. Manufacturing output rose 1 per cent in the three months to the end of April compared with the previous three months. The 21,300 increase in seasonally adjusted unemployment in May was only two-thirds the average monthly rise during the past six months. Similarly, last month's growth in bank and building society lending - at a seasonally adjusted Pounds 3bn - was above the Pounds 2.4bn monthly average of the previous half year. Looking ahead to the medium term, the government can draw comfort from the trend in prices. Although May's annual rate of retail price inflation was unchanged at 4.3 per cent, the latest indices for industrial producer prices, average earnings, unit labour cost growth and retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments all point downwards. Average weekly earnings rose by an underlying 7 per cent in April, the lowest annual rate for 25 years. With pay settlements hovering around the inflation rate, annual earnings growth seems certain to fall further. But such news, while encouraging for Britain's future competitiveness, points to a squeeze on consumers' disposable incomes and has added to uncertainty about consumer demand. The latest retail sales figures, showing no revival of trading volumes in April and May compared with the first three months of the year, have severely dented hopes that the Tory election victory might presage a consumer spending surge. Instead they raise questions about the durability of the past three months' recovery in manufacturing output. Professor Douglas McWilliams, the Confederation of British Industry's economic adviser, warns that the increase in manufacturing production may simply reflect an end to heavy destocking. 'We will only get a sustainable recovery when spending comes back into fashion and we are not there yet,' he says. Debt is a main cause of this uncertainty. The economic upsurge in the late 1980s was fuelled by an unprecedented increase in consumer indebtedness as borrowing rose from about 6 per cent of personal disposable income at the beginning of the decade to 17 per cent by the peak of the boom in 1988. Financial sector deregulation combined with economic growth to set in train a sharp increase in mortgage lending, rising house prices and the withdrawal of equity from the housing market by homeowners who traded up. In the process, the ratio of personal debt to personal disposable income doubled to 114 per cent in 1990 from 57 per cent 10 years earlier. In spite of a fall in bank base rates from 15 per cent to 10 per cent over the past 20 months, the debt burden still weighs heavily on Britain's households. As the chart shows, there has been little decline in the personal sector's gross income gearing ratio, which measures the gross interest payments of households as a percentage of disposable income. At 13 per cent at the end of last year, the ratio was close to its 1990 high of nearly 14 per cent, three times the level of the late 1970s, and 50 per cent higher than between 1984 and 1988 when the borrowing binge was at its height. Some senior policymakers believe Mr John Major, when chancellor, may have made a mistake by keeping bank base rates at 15 per cent for a full year to October 1990. That year of extreme rigour pushed inflation down rapidly from its 10.9 per cent peak in October 1990. But it may also have sharply reduced the inclination of the middle classes to borrow. Falling house prices and rising unemployment have added to the scars inflicted by the credit squeeze of the late 1980s, particularly in the south. House repossessions, nearly 75,000 throughout the UK last year, are the most emotionally charged element of the misery afflicting Britain's biggest economic region. But rising unemployment is also curbing demand. The Unemployment Unit, an independent research body, reported this week that unemployment in the south-east reached a post-second world war record last month. The government's options for tackling these problems are limited indeed. While the US has cut short term interest rates to the lowest levels for a generation and seems now to be recovering from recession, the UK is tied by the rules of the European Monetary System. The strength of the D-Mark against sterling since the Danish referendum vote earlier this month against the Maastricht Treaty has underscored Britain's limited capacity for bringing interest rates below German levels. German rates - exemplified by the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate - will stay high so long as Germany is wrestling with the inflationary consequences of unification. Mr Lamont is making a virtue out of necessity and using Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism to squeeze inflation further with the aim of matching or bettering Japan's 2 per cent. Once this is achieved, the way may be open for stronger growth. But achieving such low inflation takes time and sacrifice. In the 1970s West Germany went through a bout of inflation, recession and disinflation similar to the UK's recent experience. The economy afterwards lapsed into sub-standard growth, known then as the 'corrugated iron business cycle'. The chancellor admires France's record. But while the tight monetary and fiscal policies initiated in 1983 have produced inflation below German levels, France's unemployment rate is still close to 10 per cent. All the signs are that Britain faces a similar hard slog.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Liu Weiling: "State Acts To Protect Its </F> Shares"]    [Text] China is tightening the management of State-owned  shares of stock in an effort to stop the drain of State assets.    Closer scrutiny will be given to those State enterprises  that  are transformed into shareholding companies according to an  official with the National Administrative Bureau of State-owned  Property.    Early this month the bureau issued an opinion specifying  that  the administrative departments managing State property at all  levels are in charge of State shares.    According to the bureau's formal opinion, the country's  first  document in this field, these departments will be involved in  all the important steps in converting a State enterprise into a  shareholding company. This includes evaluating assets,  specifying property rights, setting the prices of newly issued  shares, and appointing the institutions to act as  representatives of State-owned shares.    The bureau also said that the State property administration  departments, along with other government departments and  institutions, can also act as representatives of State-owned  shares if authorized by local governments.    Zheng Li, division chief of the bureau's Enterprise  Department said the State will incur big losses if State shares  are not protected as the wave of shareholding conversions builds  up. She noted that most of the transformed enterprises are  mainstays of an industry, a region, or even the entire country.    "The biggest headache in the shareholding companies is that  many companies' State-owned shares do not have responsible  representatives," Zheng said.    Generally, if a State enterprise is converting to  shareholding, the local State property administration department  will appoint the enterprise's president as the representative of  State shares in the new company.    But, Zheng said, most such representatives are not very  responsible, resulting in unfair treatment of State-owned shares.    Since the representatives have no direct stake in the State  property, Zheng said, State-owned shares are not allocated the  bonus shares and dividends they are due.    Meanwhile, Zheng said, many representatives who are  conscious  of the need to protect State property, don't know how to  exercise their duties.    Others, though, simply infringe on the rights of individual  shareholders. For example, they personally appoint members of  the board without proper election by shareholders.    Now, Zheng said, institutions will replace individuals as  representatives of State shares. Zheng said that since  institutions will be responsible to the State, she hopes they  will ensure better treatment of State shares.    Zheng said the bureau's formal opinion is also intended to  standardize the procedures for establishing shareholding  companies, since many businesses converting to shareholding do  not know how to deal with State assets.    Zheng said the bureau's opinion can guide State property  administrative departments in managing this area and enterprises  in switching to shareholding.</p>

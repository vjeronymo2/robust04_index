			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Barratt Results from Barratt Developments would seem incomplete these days without a confident assertion from Sir Lawrie that the UK housing market is on the turn. Figures of the kind which so impressed the market yesterday, though, have recently been anything but routine. Barratt's apparently gravity-defying performance - the Pounds 117m turnaround at the pre-tax level includes an astonishing 50-70 per cent jump in UK operating profits, according to outside estimates - owes much to last year's thumping write-off in the value of its land bank. The achievement is a good deal more than cosmetic, though. Everything points to a classic tightening up of financial controls and a substantial squeeze in working capital. The number of unsold houses has fallen from 900 to 500, those held in part exchange now total 800 against 1100 at the start of the year. While not belittling Sir Lawrie's determination - or indeed challenging his strategy - the most difficult bit may be yet to come. It does not require much of an act of faith to see margins of 10 per cent by 1993-94, but without an unduly bullish view of the housing market it is hard to see where the growth comes thereafter. That said, even after yesterday's jump in the price the market is a bit uncharitable in valuing the shares on a forward multiple less than half that of some of the sector's quality players.</p>

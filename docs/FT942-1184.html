			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Break with Thatcherite past: Moves towards statutory regulation The creation of a statutory regulatory system for the pensions industry, promised in Thursday's white paper, marks a turning point after more than a decade in which laissez-faire principles guided government relations with the City. It is ironic that the job of announcing this departure from orthodoxy fell to Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary. He is seen by the Tory right as one of the few standard-bearers of the Thatcherite inheritance left in the cabinet. Yet Mr Lilley had little choice in the aftermath of the Maxwell scandal but to seek a comprehensive and statutory framework. The disappearance of Pounds 450m of pension funds from Mr Robert Maxwell's business empire - and the plight of the thousands of pensioners left high and dry - required a convincing policy response. Tory backbenchers, no less than the opposition, were unlikely to accept remedies that relied on a further dose of self-regulation. 'I don't think there would be any support for the view that no action is needed in the pensions industry,' says Mr John Watts, Conservative chairman of the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee. As for the pensions industry, a statutory framework complete with regulator was seen as the quid pro quo for a compensation fund financed by a levy. A strong regulator is seen by the industry as essential to minimise the calls likely to be made on the fund. The move to statutory regulation of the pensions industry is likely to rekindle demands for a similar approach to financial services regulation as a whole. Influential bankers and insurance executives have become increasingly concerned about the self-regulatory edifice that has been constructed on the back of the 1986 Financial Services Act (FSA). Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive of Prudential, the UK's largest life insurer, has led calls for a shift towards a simpler statutory system. 'Such is the wholly unsatisfactory state of retail financial services regulation that the experiment of self-regulation within a statutory framework must be seen as a failure,' he says. Other top City figures are reluctant to express such views in public. But there is widespread support for the view that change is needed, says Mr Andrew Hilton, director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a City think-tank. Last May, the centre published a paper arguing for far-reaching changes that drew heavily on the thinking of Sir Brian Pearse, then chief executive of Midland Bank. There has been 'an astonishingly positive response', says Mr Hilton, to the proposals. Despite differences over what should replace self-regulation, there is a growing view in the City that statutory regulation would be better than the framework created by the FSA, according to Mr Graham Mather, the newly-elected MEP who is president of the European Policy Forum. 'People say that we have ended up with the worst of both worlds,' he says. 'The FSA is supposed to be self-regulatory, but it is heavily overlaid by statutory requirements. The attraction of a statutory system is that it would get rid of the present mess.' Such advocates of change are unlikely to have their wish fulfilled, however, says Mr John Maples, a former Treasury minister who is now chairman of Saatchi Government Communications, a lobbyist. 'I cannot believe there is any stomach for amending the FSA this century,' he says. 'The faults are not big enough for the government to go through the grief that would be involved.' Mr Mather agrees. 'There is still time to sort out the FSA,' he says. Those hoping that the pensions white paper opens a new door for similar moves for financial services regulation as a whole are likely to be disappointed, therefore. It will take a scandal of the magnitude of the Maxwell case before the politicians see any need to extend statutory regulation to the financial services industry as a whole.</p>

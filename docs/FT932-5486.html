			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Homecare operation lifts Kleeneze A significant contribution from its homecare operations helped Kleeneze increase overall pre-tax profits by 80 per cent in the first half. In an active period, characterised by disposals and acquisitions, this distributor of consumer products achieved turnover of Pounds 29.2m (Pounds 25.3m) which worked through into pre-tax profits of Pounds 606,000 (Pounds 336,000). However, the share price yesterday fell by 16p to 164p. In November 1992, the company acquired 50 per cent of Hawkshead Countrywear. A Pounds 107,000 loss was carried from that business since its acquisition. The comparative figures for 1992 have been restated to reflect the new accounting treatment under FRS 3. Earnings per share came through at 3.17p against 2.12p.</p>

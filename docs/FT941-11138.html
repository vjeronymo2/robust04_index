			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance and the Family: More help for taxpayers - A new form-filling service Rumblings over the Inland Revenue's shift towards a self-assessed tax system are growing, and accountancy firms are beginning to respond with new services. BDO Binder Hamlyn, the UK's eighth-largest, has made the latest move by starting a fixed-fee tax return service aimed at personal taxpayers. This follows the launch in November of a telephone-based tax return service run by Fryer &amp; Co., a small accountancy firm based in Luton. Binder also is thinking of opening tax shops similar to the H &amp; R Block chain in the US and an equivalent in Australia. Several other accountancy firms and tax advisers are considering similar moves. The fuss has been generated by one of the most radical reforms of the British system ever proposed, although it mirrors systems already in place in countries such as Ireland and the US. Known as 'self-assessment,' it is scheduled to begin in the 1996-97 tax year. In essence, the onus is on taxpayers to complete their own returns, calculate their own liability and pay the amount straight to the Revenue rather than waiting for assessments by officials, as now. The government's commitment to the system has been stressed in the past two Budget statements, and consultation papers have long been circulating within the tax profession. But some are not happy with what they see. Frank Akers-Douglas, head of private client work for Binder, says the draft versions of the new tax return run to about 19 pages, with some 26 pages of accompanying notes. 'Our view is that more and more people will need help in preparing their returns but are frightened to use accountants at present because of the costs.' Binder's service - which has been tested on existing clients - offers a fixed fee for processing the return. This is based on a sliding scale between Pounds 200 and Pounds 1,200, depending on how many entries need to be filled on the return. In addition, the firm will charge for professional advice. Privately, some Revenue officials dismiss what they see as scare-mongering by accountants seeking to generate new business in the confusion caused by the change. There is no doubt that there will be more complications for taxpayers. On the other hand, only about 9m will be involved. Those whose returns are dealt with entirely through the pay-as-you-earn system should be unaffected. Equally, the Revenue stresses that, under the new system, taxpayers can still opt, as now, to file their tax returns without calculating their final liability and get an assessment from the tax office.</p>

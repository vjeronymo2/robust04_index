			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Concession on sale of power NATIONAL POWER, the largest independent electricity generator, has agreed to be more open about its arrangements for selling power direct to consumers rather than through regional distributors. The agreement, made with Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, follows complaints that National Power was allegedly offering preferential terms, in breach of its licence condition. London Electricity alleged that National Power used such terms when bidding to supply power to London Underground. National Power rejected the accusation. Prof Littlechild said he had found no breach. Under the agreement, National Power will operate its supply business as if it were separately financed.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Delors is victor in Socialist defeat MR Jacques Delors has always claimed that his main advantage over his rivals in French politics is that, as president of the European Commission in Brussels, he has the bonus of distance from the domestic fray. This theory was certainly borne out by the results of the French parliamentary elections in which the Socialist party suffered devastating defeat and Mr Delors benefited from a sudden surge in the opinion polls as the favourite Socialist candidate for the 1995 presidential poll. The Socialist party, dogged by a barrage of gloomy economic news and string of scandals, had long been resigned to losing the election. However, the result was not only worse than they had expected, but dealt serious damage to their hopes of relaunching the French left in a 'big bang' alliance of the Socialist party and ecologists mooted by Mr Michel Rocard, former prime minister and one of Mr Delors' chief competitors for the presidential ticket. When Mr Rocard floated his 'big bang' proposals in February, the Socialist party and ecologists commanded enough support to stand a reasonable chance of ousting the right. The ecologists have since lost ground and did not win a single seat in Sunday's vote. The Socialists emerged with just 54 seats, against 252 in the last parliament. This means that, if it was not for the support of the motley assortment of allies who won 16 seats, the Socialist camp would not even have the minimum 58 seats needed to table motions of censure against the conservative government. Moreover, Mr Rocard lost his seat at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine outside Paris, thereby imperilling his hopes, not only of implementing the 'big bang' but also of running for president. Mr Laurent Fabius, the other presidential hopeful, is handicapped by his role as first secretary of the Socialist party and by his closeness to the increasingly isolated President Francois Mitterrand. This leaves Mr Delors to watch from the sidelines in Brussels, more appreciative than ever of his 'bonus'.</p>

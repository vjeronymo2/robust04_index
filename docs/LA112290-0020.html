			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BOLDT HOLDS EL CAMINO REAL TOGETHER IN 22-16 WIN  </P> <P> Mike Maio rolled his eyes as he searched for the right words. The El Camino  Real High co-coach has been through things like this before in the spring, when  he coaches the baseball team.  </P> <P> Hmmm. How to describe the play of Sean Boldt, one of Maio's football and  baseball players.  </P> <P> "Let's see if I can say this the right way," Maio said. "When you're always  around the action, something is bound to happen. Sean is always around the  action."  </P> <P> The nuts and you-know-whats of you-know-who's night: Boldt, making his second  start of the season at quarterback, threw a pair of interceptions. Boldt,  starting as usual at safety, intercepted two passes. Boldt, the big-play man on  defense, returned a fumble for a touchdown.  </P> <P> Toss in a couple of blown coverages on defense that led to a pair of Reseda  touchdowns, as well as a fumble, and you start to get the idea.  </P> <P> Behind Boldt and a stingy defense, El Camino Real defeated Reseda, 22-16, in a  first-round game of the City Section 4-A Division playoffs Wednesday night at  Canoga Park High.  </P> <P> El Camino Real (7-3) will face top-seeded Carson (9-1) in the quarterfinals  Nov. 30 at Veteran's Stadium in Long Beach. The Conquistadores limited Reseda  (5-5) to eight rushing yards and forced seven turnovers.  </P> <P> Boldt gave generously, to both sides.  </P> <P> With El Camino Real leading, 22-6, in the fourth quarter, Boldt tossed a bad  pitch that was recovered by Reseda's Ricky Ray and returned to the  Conquistadore 13. Reseda's Gerald Cohl booted a 33-yard field goal to cut the  deficit to 22-9 with 8 minutes 18 seconds to play.  </P> <P> Boldt then fumbled on El Camino Real's next possession. To make amends, he  intercepted a pass by Jeff Kent three plays later. He then tossed an  interception to Reseda linebacker Edgar Fernandez at the El Camino Real 43 with  4:56 left. Whew.  </P> <P> Kent completed a 35-yard pass to receiver Henry McAlpine -- Boldt tipped the  ball as it arrived -- to set up a Reseda touchdown.  </P> <P> But the Conquistadores made Reseda work for it. The Regents took four plays to  score from the three-yard line, with Maurice Stepter hammering in on fourth  down from one yard. Only 1:22 remained, however, and the onside kick by Reseda  was recovered by El Camino Real, which ran out the clock.  </P> <P> Ray's fingerprints were all over the scoring in the first half. Unfortunately  for the Regents, they were not on the football.  </P> <P> On Reseda's second play from scrimmage, Ray fumbled a handoff near the left  sideline and Boldt scooped up the loose ball and raced 27 yards for a 6-0 lead  with 5:19 left in the first quarter.  </P> <P> Ray then fumbled the ensuing kickoff and El Camino Real recovered at the Reseda  37. Joe LaFirenza kicked a 22-yard field goal to give El Camino Real a 9-0  lead.  </P> <P> In the second quarter, Jim Robertson hammered Reseda quarterback Deon Edwards,  causing a fumble that was recovered at the Regent 18 by Adam Guzzo. Three plays  later, Andy Hasson bulled in from 12 yards on an inside handoff to give El  Camino Real a 16-0 lead with 7:54 left in the half.  </P></p>

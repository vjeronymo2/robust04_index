			<p>BFN     [Text] A meeting between Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak and  the U.S. deputy secretary of state, which lasted almost an hour  and a half, concentrated on Polish-U.S. cooperation. Prime  Minister Waldemar Pawlak said after the talks:    [Begin Pawlak recording] We talked with Secretary Talbott  about the internal situation in Poland. I presented a report  about our economic indicators for the first quarter. Inflation,  which is at its lowest for the past seven years, and a  considerable increase in industrial output are worth noting here.    We also talked about cooperation within various  international  organizations, starting with financial institutions like the  World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and also those  that speed up various ways of development, among them GATT and  the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development].    Discussion of the Partnership for Peace program played a  very  important part in our talks. Further talks on this matter will  take place between experts so that practical, concrete, and  joint projects can be initiated this year. I think that the  development of our region, Central Europe, is also very  important. We discussed how the development of Europe can be  supported in an efficient and effective way. [end recording]    It has transpired from brief statements made by Deputy  Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and Polish Foreign Minister  Andrzej Olechowski that their talks focused on the philosophy of  the Partnership for Peace program. Partnership for Peace,  Minister Olechowski said, is an instrument that could result in  a Europe without divisions, or in a new division of Europe. He  added that this opinion was shared by his U.S. guest. Our  efforts in implementing the idea of the Partnership of Peace  program, Minister Olechowski said, go in the direction of  possibilities for cooperation between Poland's and NATO's  defense systems. The objective is that, if need be, these  systems should be able to cooperate with each other at any time.    Minister Olechowski added that there would be visible  evidence of this partnership and that there would be more joint  exercises and joint actions. Journalists asked Minister  Olechowski whether this visit would change anything in our  mutual relations.    [Begin recording] [Olechowski] No, I do not think so. I  think that the nature of this visit.... [pauses] Mr. Talbott is  a man with vivid interests, he is intellectually alert, and he  promised to come to Poland on his first visit. I think that he  wanted to show that he is interested not only in Russia. That  is why he came to Poland to listen to what we have to say. We  have heard the most recent opinions. I do not see any great  differences here with what I heard three months ago.    [Unidentified correspondent] Specifically, can you name any  undertakings with regard to the Partnership for Peace?    [Olechowski] There is our program, the presentation  document,  that we shall submit to Brussels very soon. We can see that  this document, which has been written according to the  philosophy I have described, is being favorably received.    We also talked about President Clinton's visit. He is to  visit us in July. We talked about our region, and we shall  continue this conversation this evening.</p>

			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Wm Morrison forecasts upgraded after 17% rise William Morrison's shares rose 3p to 120p in a falling market yesterday as the market moved to upgrade forecasts for the Northern supermarket chain, on the back of stronger than expected results. The group announced a 17 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 97.8m, against a market consensus of about Pounds 90m. Sales also rose by 17 per cent to Pounds 1.54bn for the year to January 30. The City revised 1995 forecasts from about Pounds 100m to between Pounds 105m and Pounds 110m. The better than expected performance was based on a strong margin recovery in the second half and contributions from new stores. Excluding new stores, like for like sales were 3.5 per cent higher. Mr Martin Ackroyd, finance director, said sales had increased above expectations partly due to the decision to abandon opposition to Sunday trading. 'If there are five major groups opening on a Sunday and one doesn't, he will suffer,' Mr Ackroyd said. He had not changed his mind about the essential lack of benefits in Sunday opening, however. 'I do not think we have earned anything. We have just recovered the losses.' Margins benefited from passing on price pressures to suppliers. The decline experienced in the 12 months between July 1992 and July 1993 - when Morrison sought to woo back customers tempted by discounters - had more than been recovered by the second half, he said. Mr Ackroyd warned, however, that there was cause for caution. 'The current year will no doubt continue to be extremely tough,' he said. 'If it becomes an all-out price war, then we will join the skirmishes with everyone else.' Morrison racked up capital expenditure of Pounds 120m in 1993-94, including the costs of opening eight stores. The group was currently trading from 67 stores and planned to have 72 by the end of the year. Capital expenditure of about Pounds 170m was budgeted in 1994-95. Gearing is expected to increase to about 25 per cent this year, against 13 per cent previously. The dividend was increased from 0.64p to 0.8p, for a total 25 per cent higher at 1p (0.8p). Fully diluted earnings were ahead 11 per cent at 8.05p (7.23p). COMMENT William Morrison has recaptured its shine with these results after the interim disappointment. It has managed to get its payroll costs under control in the second half and begun to squeeze suppliers. However, this does not go all the way towards explaining the dramatic improvement in gross margins of 1 per cent, with promises of more to come. This is a well managed and traditionally conservative company, so such questions may be dismissed by some as nit-picking. The shares, on a prospective p/e of 12.7 times, are trading at a 15 per cent discount to the market and look cheap for the moment.</p>

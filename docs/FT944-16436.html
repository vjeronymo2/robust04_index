			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Ex-Disney head joins Spielberg in new entertainment group Three of the most powerful figures in Hollywood - Mr David Geffen, the billionaire music mogul, Mr Steven Spielberg, the Oscar-winning film director, and Mr Jeffrey Katzenberg, who recently resigned as head of Walt Disney's movie studio - are joining forces in a new entertainment company. The company, which will open early next year, aims to compete directly with the leading studios - including Disney - by producing movies, animated films, television programmes, music and interactive entertainment. The three founders will own equal shares of the venture and will provide the initial funding. However, there was speculation among industry observers that they might soon seek external finance. Mr Tim Wallace, entertainment industry analyst at SG Warburg Securities in New York, said: 'What will be really interesting is whether they team up with any of the telecommunications and computer companies that now want to buy into Hollywood.' The news ends weeks of speculation about Mr Katzenberg's future since he left Disney in August. Mr Katzenberg, 43, played a pivotal part in Disney's success since the late 1980s, culminating in the release of The Lion King, its latest animated hit which has already grossed Dollars 270m in the US alone. Mr Katzenberg, once dubbed the 'golden retriever' for his flair for flushing out talent, quit after being passed over for the presidency. His new partners are two of his closest, and wealthiest, friends. Mr Geffen, 51, made his first million by the age of 25 and has since become a billionaire by investing the Dollars 710m he made in 1990 from selling his record company's share of the MCA entertainment group to Japan's Matsushita. His Geffen Films subsidiary will become part of the new venture, as will Amblin Entertainment, Mr Spielberg's production company. Mr Spielberg, 47, will continue to direct for other companies but is expected to use the group as an outlet for his fascination with technology.</p>

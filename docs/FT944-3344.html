			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Breakthrough in US for Dornier - Ventures and contracts Dornier, the subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), will supply 20 Dornier 328 turbo-prop aircraft to a regional US airline, the second biggest delivery since the aircraft was launched last year. The order is a significant coup for Dornier as major orders on the international aviation market are relatively scarce. Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chief executive, said: 'With the second big client we have finally managed the breakthrough on the hotly contested US market.' Jetstream International Airlines, the Ohio-based operator which has placed the order, has an option for a further 20 aircraft. Dornier's biggest order to date came from Horizon Air, a Seattle-based operator which placed 20 firm orders and 40 options. Dasa did not disclose the value of the order. The Dornier 328 has a list price of Dollars 9m, can seat 33 passengers and is, with a top speed of 620kmh, the fastest aircraft in its class, Dasa said. Saab, Bombardier, British Aerospace and Embraer, the Brazilian group, are the 328's main competitors. Air Engiadina, a Swiss operator, placed the first order for the 328 in October last year. Since then Dornier has sold the aircraft to clients in the US, Taiwan, Nigeria and India. Dornier now has 72 firm orders and a further 71 options from 16 clients.</p>

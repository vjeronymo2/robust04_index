			<p>920905 FT  05 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Ewart board changes blocked by institutions INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Ewart, the Belfast-based property company, at an extraordinary meeting yesterday defeated a move led by a dissident shareholder, Mr Philip Monahan, to gain control of the company. Ewart said institutional shareholders, which own 52.8 per cent of its shares, unanimously opposed proposals to replace four of its directors with nominees of the dissident shareholder group. The dissidents include Mr Monahan, chairman of Republic of Ireland-based Monarch Properties, which holds a 29.2 per cent stake in Ewart. He has been a non-executive director of Ewart since 1990 and is backed by several Ireland-based businessmen who have business interests with him. However, Mr Monahan yesterday signalled his intention to carry on his effort for control of the company. In a prepared statement, he said he had no intention of selling his stake and that his group would press for additional representation on the board. Mr Barry Gilligan, managing director of Ewart, said that 96 per cent of shareholders voted, an unusually high turn-out for such a meeting, and that his board had the unanimous support of institutions. He called on Mr Monahan to either support the current board or make an offer to buy the stakes of all shareholders. If neither of those was acceptable, he should resign.</p>

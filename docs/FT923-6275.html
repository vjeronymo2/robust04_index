			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Milk trade fails to agree manufacturing price scheme THE UK MILK Marketing Board and the Dairy Trade Federation have failed to agree on a new way of pricing milk for manufacturing. The scheme, which was endorsed by both the Agriculture Ministry and the EC, aimed to end the much criticised system under which the MMB sets 24 different price levels according how the milk is used. The new system - due to be introduced next Tuesday  - had already been delayed earlier this year. 'New Ways of Buying Milk', as the scheme was known, would have priced milk for manufacturing according to its supply profile, with a premium being charged for regular deliveries. However, defying the laws of economics, the higher prices were set under the scheme the greater the demand for milk would have been. The MMB said that at one price level annual demand would have exceeded supply by over 1bn litres, or 22 per cent. This was partly because the UK is not self-sufficient in milk and production is restricted by EC milk quotas. But the DTF said its members would demand more milk at higher prices in order to reduce their unit costs when making dairy products. The National Farmer's Union said yesterday it was very disappointed that the MMB scheme was not going forward. 'New Ways' would have led to better prices for dairy farmers, but with a return to the end-use system the prospects of better returns had diminished. The MMB, which is planning to turn itself into a voluntary co-operative by mid-1994, said it would now be returning to end-use pricing.</p>

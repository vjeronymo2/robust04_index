Called for 1600, the ministers of the Army, Zenildo Lucena;  Aeronautics, Lelio Lobo; Navy, Ivan Serpa; EMFA [Armed Forces  Staff], Arnaldo Leite Pereira; and nine other ministers met with  Franco to discuss the problem created by Congress' rejection of  the presidential vetoes of the Salary Equity Law and by the  STF's approval of a real 10.9 percent salary increase for  employees of the legislative and judicial branches and the  Attorney General's Office.    The salary increase was obtained through the salary  conversion to URV's [Real Value Unit] by using a different base  date from that determined by the government provisional measure.    "They sent us to the kitchen with the great mass of public  employees, while they remained in the living room," a general  said in irritation.    The military was taken by surprise by the decision by  Congress and the STF just when they were beginning to accept the  government's refusal to grant the troops a 35 percent wage  increase claimed since last November.    The military ministers stressed the fact that the pressures  for a wage increase come from the bases. And they feel obliged  to give an explanation to the troops. Their irritation is so  great that they even questioned democratic stability.    "When the exercise of democracy is so sensitive to the point  of meeting the demands of groups or individuals, democracy is  weak," an active-duty military officer said.    The military's disgust was sensed by the president of the  Republic early on the afternoon of 18 March when he received in  his office a manifesto signed by more than 100 military  personnel, including retired General Euclides Figueiredo,  brother of former President Joao Batista Figueiredo. In the  document, the soldiers preach the closure of Congress and the  replacement of the STF justices by career judges.    A retired officer with influence on the president's office  attacked: "If it were up to me, they would all be arrested," he  said, meaning the STF justices.    Before attending the meeting in Planalto Palace, SAF  [Federal  Administration Secretary] Romildo Canhim said democracy is not  threatened.</p>

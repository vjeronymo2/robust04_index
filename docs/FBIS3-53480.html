The dialogue will take place on the basis of  legality and will reject dialogue with illegal parties, a  condition placed by the National Democratic Party for any such  dialogue.    The Muslim Brotherhood violently attacked its former ally  the  Labor Party, accusing it of ingratitude. It reminded the Labor  Party that thanks to the Muslim Brotherhood, several Labor Party  members were elected members of the People's Assembly and other  local councils.    A message written by the Muslim Brotherhood's Guidance  Office  and addressed to Labor Party deputy leader 'Adil Husayn says the  slogan "Islam is the solution" is a Muslim Brotherhood slogan  and that it is under this slogan that the Labor Party has made  headway here and there.</p>

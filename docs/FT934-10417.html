			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Leading Article: Pacific ties LEADERS of Pacific Rim countries will meet this month to discuss whether they should establish new mechanisms for economic co-operation. By inviting his counterparts to an informal meeting in Seattle, President Bill Clinton has raised the possibility of closer relations within Asia, which could cause misgivings elsewhere about a potential new trade bloc. Until recently, Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation - the grouping that is to meet in Seattle - has lacked substance because its 15 members have seen little advantage in promoting it. Apec nations compete fiercely with each other for export markets and have outstanding political problems (China, Taiwan and Hong Kong are all members) as well as historical enmities among themselves. Many were in because they did not want to be left out or - as in the case of the US - to ward off formation of regional blocs from that they might be exclud-ed. But the picture has been changed by an apparent increase in US enthusiasm for Apec. It is easy to see why Washington wants to find new ways to ensure harmony across the Pacific. US trade with Asia already far exceeds trade with Europe. Asia provides US jobs as well as a fruitful area for investment by US companies. But there are persistent trade frictions. At the same time, the US wants to continue to play a balancing role in ensuring Asia's security, but without the expensive troop presence that the cold war demanded. If Asian countries, with their complex web of bilateral relationships, can be persuaded to air problems in a multilateral forum that includes the US, the risks of confrontation are likely to be reduced. In Seattle, the leaders will have before them an Eminent Persons' report, which recommends specific steps towards free trade in the region and an Asia-Pacific economic community - though without a single internal market. It is not clear, however, to what extent Asia-Pacific governments will want to commit themselves to an ambitious programme of co-operation. Some south-east Asian countries, particularly Malaysia, have reservations. The likelihood of strong political commitment from the US to a new free trade area is questionable to say the least, given the difficulties of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Nevertheless, it seems that greater economic co-operation and a general commitment to reducing barriers will emerge. The world seems likely to benefit from a stable political and economic environment as well as fewer trade barriers in the part of the world that will account for a progressively greater share of exports, imports and investment. Though a move by Apec to reduce trade barriers without discriminating against outsiders would be welcome, it seems, however, no easier to achieve than global liberalisation. The Uruguay Round remains the highest priority.</p>

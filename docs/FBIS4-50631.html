			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Dispatch" on interview with Hou Zhitong by staff reporter </F> He Hongze (0149 3136 3419) and China Radio International  reporter Liu Hui (0491 2547) at the United Nations in New York;  date not given: "Arduous Tasks for Disarmament and Arms  Control--Interviewing Envoy Lou Zhitong, Chinese Disarmament  Expert"]    [Text] Envoy Hou Zetong is China's well-qualified expert  on disarmament. For many year he has constantly participated in  UN negotiations and discussions on disarmament issues. After  attending a session of the UN Disarmament Commission, which was  held not long ago, he gave these reporters an interview.    He maintained: With the end of the Cold War, great changes  have indeed taken place in the international situation. The  bipolar pattern has been smashed and the confrontation between  the two military blocs has disappeared. Nevertheless, the  military might of those countries is still around. In  particular, the United States and Russia still possess huge  nuclear and conventional arsenals. The nuclear threat has not  yet been eliminated. Moreover, at present, regional conflicts  keep emerging. The world, including Europe, is far from being  tranquil. In this sense, the issue of disarmament and arms  control remains as it was before and the task of disarmament and  arms control is still very arduous.    Envoy Hou pointed out: The main difference in disarmament at  present lies in the focal point of nuclear disarmament. Some  Western nuclear powers contend that great progress has been made  in nuclear disarmament. The current focal point should be on  the prevention of nuclear proliferation. However, many  nonnuclear countries hold that although progress has been made  in nuclear disarmament, there is still a long way to go in this  regard. Further nuclear disarmament is still a current task of  top priority. If this problem is not solved, it will be  difficult to extend the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty  indefinitely.    Attending the session with a positive and responsible  approach toward the issue, the Chinese delegation  comprehensively expounded the Chinese Government's principled  stand on disarmament and put forth a document on weapons  transfers and a proposal not to be the first to use nuclear  weapons, to which various countries in the world have attached  importance. When discussing this issue, Envoy Hou stressed the  current practical significance of the proposal not to be the  first to use nuclear weapons. He said: Since the emergence of  nuclear weapons, the world has always been under the shadow of  the threat from nuclear arms. Hence, there is the question of  upholding or opposing the use of nuclear weapons. By upholding  a policy of nuclear deterrence, Western countries argue that  nuclear weapons can be used if necessary. China and many other  countries hold a view opposed to this argument. When it  conducted its first nuclear test in 1964, China unilaterally  declared the commitment not to be first to use nuclear weapons  and not to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear countries.  Now that the Cold War has come to an end, all the parties  concerned are considering establishing a new international  order. Some progress has been made in nuclear disarmament. The  time is ripe for the five nuclear powers to sign a treaty  committing themselves to no first use of nuclear weapons.  Moreover, it is also relatively easy for them to reach an  agreement. This proposal has been well received by the  international community. It received a positive response from  Russia. In March this year, the Chinese Government officially  invited the other four nuclear powers to come to Beijing to hold  talks on the issue. However, some nuclear powers lack a  positive approach toward the invitation.    Envoy Hou also briefed these reporters on the issue of a  complete prohibition of nuclear tests. Although the current  session did not touch the issue, the Geneva disarmament  conference was carrying out tense negotiations on it.  Prohibiting nuclear tests is a universal demand of the  international community. However, in the last few decades, no  treaty on a complete prohibition of tests has been concluded.  China's stand is that the complete prohibition and thorough  destruction of nuclear weapons should be achieved as soon as  possible. Prior to this, some partial measures can be taken.  It is relatively difficult to conclude a treaty with which all  the parties concerned are satisfied and which can be subject to  international nuclear checks and to achieve a complete  prohibition of tests. In spite of this, we support holding  negotiations, and, together with other countries, we will strive  for the conclusion of a treaty no latter than 1996. At the same  time, we hold that in any treaty, the scope of the test ban and  relevant definitions should be clear and definite so that no  party will have their own interpretations of them and that the  treaty will be free of loopholes and will not be turned into  another treaty like that of 1963. This requires great efforts  from all countries.    Based on his experience in attending negotiations on the  disarmament issue over the years, Envoy Hou maintained:  Compared with previous ones, the current disarmament  discussions and negotiations are more practical, but they are  also more difficult as they are entwined with regional issues.  Nevertheless, disarmament is the common wish of the people of  the world. The work of the UN Disarmament Commission should be  strengthened rather than scrapped. It will play a more important  role in world peace and security.</p>

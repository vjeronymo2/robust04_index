			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RURAL, SUBURBAN AREAS AMBUSH BIG-CITY SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Turning the tables on urban Democrats, a loosely knit coalition of legislators  from the suburban and rural areas of the state exerted new-found muscle in the  Assembly this week and won support for a Proposition 98 school funding package  that left cities such as Los Angeles out in the cold.  </P> <P> The deal, announced Tuesday, ended an eight-day stalemate and led to Assembly  passage of a nearly $50-billion version of the state budget.  </P> <P> While legislators from both sides of the aisle warn about making too much of  the vote, some lawmakers are calling the deal "historic" because -- if Gov.  George Deukmejian and the Senate agree -- it will free up hundreds of millions  for money-starved suburban and rural schools by directing money away from urban  districts.  </P> <P> At stake is the new money, roughly $1.4 billion over two budget years, being  generated for schools by the landmark school funding initiative Proposition 98,  which was approved by voters last Nov. 8.  </P> <P> The Assembly plan to implement Proposition 98, to be amended into a long-term  school funding bill, was unusual in that it bypassed the Education and Budget  committees controlled by big-city Democrats. That was possible because Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) set up a special team of negotiators to  draft the proposal.  </P> <P> Once agreed upon by the special team, the plan was informally ratified in a  budget vote marked by a rare bipartisan alliance. Casting "no" votes were such  members of the urban Los Angeles delegation as Terry B. Friedman, Teresa P.  Hughes, Richard Katz, Burt Margolin, Lucille Roybal-Allard and Maxine Waters,  all of whom could normally be counted on to vote for a budget bill.  </P> <P> Friedman, expressing concerns shared by other members of the Los Angeles  delegation, said he refused to vote for the budget because he believed that the  school aid package was "vindictive" and "a purposeful effort to get L.A."  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Hughes, the chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, which  was bypassed by the negotiators who put together the plan, said: "I'm not very  pleased. Los Angeles is really getting worked over."  </P> <P> But while the Los Angeles Democrats were crying foul, normally powerless  legislators from Orange County, suburban cities such as Glendale and rural and  farming communities in California's Central Valley were praising the vote as  "historic" because it recognized for the first time in recent years that school  finance was out of kilter, with big-city schools drawing most of the dollars.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Doris Allen (R-Cypress), noting that Orange County schools will  get more than $69 million as a result of the agreement, called it a "foundation  for fairness" for future education funding.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Pat Nolan (R-Glendale), who played a leading role in putting the  deal together, said Republicans for years have complained that fast-growing  suburban and rural communities were being shortchanged in the annual division  by political leaders of the roughly $15 billion a year the state gives to  school districts. Because they had no hard numbers to back up their contention,  two years ago Republicans ordered a study of education expenditures. This year,  they got their first report.  </P> <P> What the study showed was that when all the various special state financial aid  programs were added up, the Los Angeles Unified School District was receiving  $1,045 per pupil, San Jose Unified was getting $1,346 for each student, and San  Francisco, Oakland and San Diego were getting $934, $810 and $702 respectively.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cries of Outrage  </P> <P> Those numbers led to cries of outrage when lawmakers compared them to much  lower figures for school districts outside the big cities. For example, in Los  Angeles County, Alhambra schools were receiving $232 per pupil, while each  student in Glendale was being backed by $192 in state dollars. Elsewhere,  Fresno was receiving $432 per pupil; Riverside, $277; Sacramento, $442, and  Chula Vista, in San Diego County, $293 per student.  </P> <P> "When we totaled the figures up, it confirmed what we had felt all along was  happening. In fact, the disparities were far worse than we had thought," Nolan  said.  </P> <P> Aside from the question of fairness, Republicans also had the law on their  side. In 1971, the California Supreme Court in a landmark decision ruled that  the state's system of financing public education was illegal because there was  a huge disparity in funding between rich and poor school districts. As a result  of the ruling, the Legislature enacted a series of laws designed to bring about  equality in funding, but the figures turned up by Assembly Republicans showed  that a huge gap still existed.  </P> <P> Those close to the issue give many reasons for the disparities in funding.  </P> <P> State funding for schools is done in a variety of ways, from unrestricted  financial aid based solely on the number of students in each district to grants  made in support of more than 50 different special programs, each one designed  to meet different needs.  </P> <P> Separate financial aid programs were created to provide extra assistance to  gifted students, slow learners and poor readers. Others, with a broader sweep,  were put together to provide extra financial aid to school districts with major  problems, such as those under court order to desegregate or those that have  large concentrations of poor and foreign-speaking students.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Unified School district, by far the largest school district in  the state, got in on the ground floor of all of the programs and was a magnet,  pulling in money for just about everything.  </P> <P> The problem for other districts was that as a result of a series of lean state  budgets in the 1980s, little new money was added to finance the special  programs. Those districts already receiving the aid continued to get the money,  but schools in newly emerging areas of the state basically were shut out.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Charles Bader (R-Pomona), in an emotional appeal to Democrats on  the floor of the Assembly, complained that "kids from identical circumstances  receive a fraction of support that other kids receive. . . . It isn't fair. It  isn't right. It's not educationally sound."  </P> <P> Helping to galvanize the legislators was the lucrative wage settlement the Los  Angeles Unified School District recently gave its teachers. The generous  settlement, which will boost teacher wages by 24% by 1990, rankled numerous  legislators, who complained that other districts could not afford to pay their  teachers as well, even though housing prices and living expenses in Glendale,  Alhambra and other communities are comparable to those in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The financing plan promoted by Republicans would take away some of the money  that would have helped Los Angeles meet its new payroll, but legislators insist  that the district will still get enough to finance the strike settlement  package.  </P> <P> (Even though Los Angeles Unified, with nearly 600,000 students, will get less  than most other districts on an average per-pupil basis, it would still get a  lump sum payment of $50.7 million under the equalization plan. By contrast,  Orange County's 28 school districts, with 348,000 students, would split a total  of $69.4 million. On top of that, school districts statewide would divide  another $521 million in unrestricted funds that they could spend for such  things as payroll during the current and upcoming budget years.)  </P> <P> Even though Nolan, Bader and other Republicans had obvious sympathy from  Democrats who represent similar suburban and agricultural districts, the GOP  legislators got nowhere until they took the extraordinary action of refusing to  vote for the proposed state budget when it came up for a procedural vote June  5.  </P> <P> What followed was an eight-day stalemate during which Republicans circulated  computer printouts comparing education funding district by district. The  disparities in funding cut across party lines. Democrats in suburban and rural  communities saw that the school districts they represented were as bad off as  districts represented by their GOP counterparts.  </P> <P> Nolan said: "We found that money was being unfairly channeled to certain large  districts at the expense of students around the rest of the state. The  printouts sent shock waves through the Democratic Caucus."  </P> <P> Normal Democratic team players such as Assemblyman Patrick Johnston  (D-Stockton) were incensed. When negotiators came up with a plan to help rural  and suburban districts, Johnston said he did not have any sympathy for Los  Angeles because "they've pigged out so much over the years."  </P> <P> Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos), who once led an informal coalition of  rural legislators that was organized to get a better deal for farming  communities, said, "The rural and suburban districts have really been getting  screwed over."  </P> <P> As a result of the stalemate, a negotiating team of four lawmakers from each  party was formed to come up with a plan.  </P> <P> The agreement that came together is designed to make school funding more equal  than it has been by directing a disproportionate share of Proposition 98 funds  to school districts that are now receiving less than others.  </P> <P> For example, the Los Angeles Unified School District's share of the new money  would amount to $86 per pupil. Oakland would get $93 per student; San Francisco  $109; San Diego $146 and San Jose $177. The statewide average would be $155 per  student. But many districts would receive more than that, with the Anaheim  Union High School District targeted for $266 per pupil; Glendale Unified, $223;  Lancaster Elementary, $267, and so on.  </P> <P> On a countywide basis, Los Angeles County schools would receive an average of  $130 per student when the Proposition 98 pie is divided up, while other  Southern California counties would get a split of the money, on a per-pupil  basis, this way: Orange County, $199; San Diego, $180; Santa Barbara, $173;  Riverside, $165; Ventura, $198; Imperial, $217, and Kern, $139.  </P> <P> Overall, when all the state dollars are counted, big-city school districts such  as Los Angeles would still be receiving hundreds of dollars more per pupil. But  the Proposition 98 plan would move the "have-nots" much closer to the "haves,"  according to Nolan. "We won't be at equal dollars per student, but this is a  major step forward. The commitment is that over the next three years we will  move the bottom-level districts up to the statewide average. That's a historic  commitment."  </P> <P> Nolan and other lawmakers say they do not see broader political implications  from the alliance of Republicans and Democrats that came together on the  proposed Proposition 98 funding plan. They do not see the same Republicans and  Democrats forming a bloc that could be counted on to pass other major bills.  </P> <P> "The reason it worked this time is that we had so much new money to spend. We  had a chance to correct things. Some schools get a hell of a lot more money  than others. The goal was to make expenditures per child more equal. That's  it," Assemblyman Sam Farr (D-Carmel) said.  </P> <P> But at least one rural Democrat, Areias, believes that the vote was the first  of many to come that reflects changing demographics in California. He points to  the rapid population growth in suburban and rural regions of the state.  </P> <P> The state Department of Finance, in a recent report, said it expects 5 million  new households to be formed in California by the year 2020. And with little  land left in central cities, most of the growth is expected to be in new  suburbs and rural areas.  </P> <P> Areias, one of the so-called Gang of Five rebellious Democrats who last year  tried to topple Speaker Brown, said:  </P> <P> "The agreement is an indication of the political clout that is moving into the  suburban and rural areas. When we reapportion after the 1990 census, rural and  suburban areas are going to get more representation and inner cities are going  to lose political power."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSED STATE AID ALLOTMENTS  </P> <P> Chart shows what each Los Angeles County school district receives per pupil for  the more than 50 special education programs financed by the state. First column  of figures shows what districts now receive. Second shows additional amount  they would receive under plan approved by Assembly this week. These sums do not  include the base per-pupil funding each district receives.  </P> <TABLE CWL="4.97IN:2.11IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yevgeniy Tyurin, general director of the </F> joint-stock company "Yarenergo": "Where Energy Disappears. A  Director's View of Economic Policy in Russia"]    [Text] Everything on earth obeys the main law of  nature--the law of energy conservation. It would not be bypassed  or skirted.    Manufacturing lives by this law (as one of the forms of its  manifestation) in the course of monetary servicing on the  market. The formula is simple: The stock of goods times the  price equals money times the velocity of circulation. It is  impossible to violate this axiom.    However, it appears that there are people in our society  who,  having made it to large official suites, believe that they can  amend the norms of existence ordained by nature. Having pulled a  snow job on the people about the economy's being reoriented  toward a worthy life, these reformers, who actually operated to  narrowly corporate, mercenary ends, staged a big game under the  name "economic reforms."    Well, the worthy life of the people is really ensured by an  appropriate stock of goods. In the broad meaning of the word,  this means an ecologically pure habitat, health care, dwellings,  amenities in daily life and at the place of work, food,  availability of services, and the spiritual content of life.    The goal of a society is to have an abundance of all of  this.  Just one question remains: How are we to arrive at such a  supply? This is where the "reformers" disregarded the law of the  conservation of energy.    Prices were decontrolled, and they shot up. Manufacturers  did  not profit by this, but rather the resellers and those above and  around them did. The "reformers" calculated and "bolstered" this  with requisite tax and price policies.    The results were not long in coming. Given the high prices  for materials and subcontracted supplies for their products,  manufacturers needed additional funds. Where were they to be  had? Of course, at a bank, with interest. The firm financial  policy immediately inflated the bank credit rate to 213 percent  a year! Once again, those into whose pockets this interest  flowed through the banks ended up in the money.    Let us move on. One must manufacture and sell his products  very quickly in order to maintain manufacturing in the  environment of high prices and a shortage of money. However, the  "fathers of the reform" had thought about this move, too.  Someone arranged things so that the processing of payments was  slowed down to infinity. The funds retained by the banks were  put to use yet again, and once again contributed to the profits  of those who were originators of the "reformist idea" in  question.    However, the aforementioned sources of profiteering are but  a  secondary product of the excesses in the transformation of the  economy. The primary, key result of experimentation with the  country can be deduced from the already mentioned enduring  equality of the energy balance in nature, and then in the  opposite sense.    The essence of it is such: Strictly in keeping with the law  of the conservation of energy, a small amount of money times the  low velocity of circulation divided by high prices brings  manufacturing to zero (to being wound down and destroyed). This  means loss of jobs and mass unemployment first, and subsequently  the hemorrhaging of intellectual, highly skilled labor and the  consistent reduction of the nation to a source of primitive  labor on the world labor market. The disintegration of the state  follows inevitably.    I will say frankly that I do not believe in the ability of  the presidential structures and the government to effectively  adjust the economic course being pursued without coercion by the  entire people. The repeated collective proposals by  manufacturers from many regions of the country to the government  to cooperate in developing and implementing a creative economic  policy, made in vain over a period of two years, are grounds for  my mistrust.    So, is everything lost, and are we doomed as a nation? I  believe that there still is an opportunity for rebirth,  provided, of course, that we take immediate action to preserve  the fruitful energy of the nation.    First. Manufacturers representing all forms of  ownership should unite around the banner of the Federation of  Manufacturers of Russia (FTR) for joint, organized actions in  the name of bringing back domestic manufacturing at a new  scientific-technical level, and should support the declaration  of the Second Congress of Manufacturers.    Second. The Federal Assembly and the FTR should  proclaim 1994 the year of a people's revision of economic  reforms.    Third. Having invited the administrations and  deputies, the FTR and public organizations should organize the  development of proposals for revising credit-financial, tax,  price, and customs policies throughout the country.    Fourth. The government and the FTR should refine  and release to the public procedures for the collection of  proposals, their honest processing, and open and systematic  analysis with a view to adopting a people's law on a long-term  economic policy.    Fifth. Having invited public organizations,  sectoral associations, and state structures, the FTR should  immediately embark on organizing intrasectoral and intersectoral  negotiations on putting price-setting in order. Special  attention should be paid to setting the maximum cost of  intermediary services regardless of the number of consecutive  resales.    It appears to me that the following three principles should  form the foundation of the agreements, among other principles.  The ratios of prices for goods and services may not differ  substantially from those at the world level. Prices for natural  resources as export products may not be lower than world-market  prices (in this instance, labor, minerals, soils, the natural  flora and fauna, water, and air should be considered the  original reference). Finally, the cost of labor as a proportion  of all products should be approximately in line with that in the  world for a similar stock of merchandise.    Such negotiations with the structures of federal power will  certainly be difficult. The development of fundamental legal  provisions for revising the reforms will certainly run into  contradictions, into mutually exclusive arguments. One point is  clear: The speeding flywheel of inflation will not be stopped in  the absence of nationwide accord. If we fail to pool together  the creative energy of Russians and channel it toward  life-giving pursuits, within the shortest possible period of  time we will be doomed as a nation and as a state.    P.S. I finished writing this letter on 5 February. On 15  February, I read information in your newspaper according to  which Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin had come out for holding  intersectoral price-setting negotiations. I mention this because  otherwise it would turn out to be improper: I would appear to be  plagiarizing Chernomyrdin's ideas.</p>

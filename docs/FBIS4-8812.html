			<p>BFN     [Text] Zagreb, April 15 (AFP) -- Bosnian Moslems started a  massive exodus from outlying districts in the Serb-besieged  Moslem enclave of Gorazde on Friday [15 April] to seek shelter  within the town, UNHCR spokesman Peter Kessler said.    "The situation is extremely tense" said Kessler, adding that  he expected the situation in the eastern enclave to deteriorate.    The exodus from northern and northeastern districts started  around 3:30 P.M. (1330 GMT) and was still going on at 7 P.M.,  Kessler added.</p>

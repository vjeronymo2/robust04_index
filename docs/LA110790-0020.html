			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAKISTAN SWEARS IN PRIME MINISTER; BHUTTO WALKS OUT  </P> <P> Nawaz Sharif was sworn in Tuesday as Pakistan's prime minister after ousted  Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto repeated charges of vote rigging and led a token  opposition walkout from the National Assembly.  </P> <P> President Ghulam Ishaq Khan administered the oath of office to Sharif at the  President's Palace after he demonstrated his majority in the 217-seat National  Assembly by getting 153 votes.  </P> <P> Bhutto's candidate, Mohammed Afzel Khan, got 39 votes.  </P> <P> Bhutto and her party deputies also boycotted the oath-taking ceremony.  </P> <P> "My election amounts to the confidence of the people in my person," Sharif told  the Assembly. "I wish to assure the people of Pakistan that I will do my utmost  to come up to your expectations."  </P> <P> Before the vote, Bhutto led her Pakistan People's Party deputies from the  chamber when their demands for a secret ballot were rejected. She later  returned.  </P> <P> The election of Sharif, the 40-year-old head of the Islamic Democratic Alliance  (IDA) and former chief minister of Punjab province, ended three months of  political uncertainty after Bhutto's dismissal in August. Bhutto has charged  that her loss at the polls Oct. 24 was the result of massive rigging.  </P></p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Lunch with the FT: The world in a spin around Planet Earl - Lucy Kellaway grabs a bite with a hamburger king Robert Earl's public relations man had initially suggested that I meet the hamburger king in Las Vegas. I could attend the opening party of the newest of the Planet Hollywood restaurants and get to meet the stars at the same time. Not wanting to be difficult, I asked if I might lunch with Robert Earl a bit nearer home. The second suggestion was an evening party, to be given by Earl at Planet Hollywood in London for Michael Caine, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in honour of a new film I had not heard of. Twenty odd years ago Robert Earl was a humble catering student and a waiter at The Savoy. Now he is the classic entrepreneur, having turned an initial investment of Pounds 50,000 into over Pounds 50m through three themed restaurant chains. These days he comes with all the trimmings: the private jet, and so many glamorous friends that seeing him on his own was going to be a problem. I explained that the 'Lunch with the FT' articles involved eating lunch with the guest, preferably without half of the film trade there too. Earl's PR agreed that I could meet the man alone at Planet Hollywood London at 1pm on the day of the party. That would be perfect, I said. In the event it was not perfect at all. The amplifiers were pumping out rock music so loudly, at the Pounds 8m theme burger bar off Piccadilly Circus, that I could feel the leopard skin banquette vibrating underneath me. 'Look] That's Robert', said the PR, pointing at the huge screen above our heads on which was playing the film of the Pounds 1m bash given last year to launch the restaurant. He kept up an amiable patter about Arnie, Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone, each of whom owns a small stake in the Planet Hollywood chain. Eventually the man himself arrived, tiny, tanned, in a dazzling shirt and Planet Hollywood bomber jacket. 'Have you ordered?' he asked in a high-pitched voice with traces of a North London accent. I said no, so he ordered for me, telling a waitress to bring Diet Coke and a selection of the house specialities. 'I'm going to Paris with Arnold in the morning. This afternoon I'll be at Harvey Goldsmith's office at three,' he said to the departing PR. 'Do you know Harvey Goldsmith?' he asked me. 'Not personally,' I said. Looking at me doubtfully he inquired whether I was 'in- house' at the FT, and what I wrote about. So I described my job, and in return he described his. 'I've just left an event in Las Vegas with Andre Agassi and Don Johnson. I'm here in London because my partner Arnold Schwarzenegger is premiering in a movie called True Lies.' He told me how many millions the film had already made in the US, how many hundreds of celebrities would be at his party that night, and how many thousands of fans would be lining the streets outside. Later that week he would be in Tel Aviv opening a restaurant, then back to see his family in Orlando for a day, before going on to Dallas. 'It's a very typical week,' he said. The next day he was off to Paris to the new site on the Champs Elysee. 'We are opening a restaurant there in March. That'll be our second attack into Europe. You are sitting in our London restaurant having lunch.' This obvious point served as a prelude to some more tendentious statements. 'This is the highest grossing restaurant in Europe. We do in excess of Pounds 15m a year,' he said pronouncing every word carefully making sure I was taking it in. 'We're pleasantly surprised we have not been labelled a tourist trap - if you look round the room it is full of Brits.' I was not quite sure how to respond. Part of the Planet Hollywood magic was meant to be the permanent queue outside, yet when I arrived there had been no one waiting at all, and the the people at the next door table looked suspiciously Japanese. Yet such was Earl's insistence that I felt sure it was my mistake: last Tuesday must have been a freakish day. He stopped, smiled and blew a kiss. 'One of my favourite waitresses,' he explained. 'Worldwide, there'll be 15 Planet Hollywoods by next week, 20 by the end of the year, 40 by the end of next year, and 100 by the end of the century.' People in India, in Jakarta and in Seoul will soon have the chance to eat their burgers surrounded by bits of film memorabilia, watching movie clips, and hoping to catch a glimpse of Sylvester Stallone. 'Stallone is here for four months filming. He's at the restaurant every night. He loves England. Being single he loves it even more.' This struck me as a non-sequitur, but I let it pass. A waitress skipped up to the table. 'That's quick]' he yelled at her above the din. 'We must have influence]' Pointing to the dishes she was laying on the table, he explained: 'These are like deep fried won-ton with barbecue cheese, that's chicken in American cereal called Cap'n Crunch, and that's blackened shrimp - quite spicy - and that's creole mustard sauce.' He popped one from the first plate into his mouth but then sat back sipping his Diet Coke, leaving me to battle singlehandedly with enough food to feed a family of five for a week. 'Are you going to have a main course after this?' he asked. 'No? Are you sure? A Caesar Salad? Try one?' He ordered for himself a small bowl of plain pasta with nothing on it. I asked if he got fed up with the food there. 'No]' he said vehemently. 'No, you can get everything here, everything. Shelly good morning,' - turning to address a well-groomed woman behind him. 'Just look at the success,' he said gesturing around him. 'That's Marilyn Monroe's dress over there. That's Judy Garland's dress. That one (pointing at a large winged vehicle dangling from the ceiling) is worth Pounds  1/4 m and is from You Only Live Twice.' In an attempt to change the subject, I asked about his other business interests. A few years ago he considered buying Tottenham Hotspur but was unwilling to do battle with Alan Sugar. Now he has turned his attention to basketball, and that very week had spent 'a few hundred thousands' buying a British basketball team in partnership with Harvey Goldsmith. 'This sport is going to take off here,' he said, in a way that brooked no argument. 'Sky TV has adopted it. Budweiser has adopted it. It's sweeping the world. Some people will show you numbers that say it's bigger than soccer. Look at that gremlin up there.' He points at a green plastic monster sitting on top of the bar. The waitress brings his modest dish. 'Hey this is getting quick] I'm really impressed]' he said. I invited him to talk about his childhood. His father, also Robert Earl, was a 1950s crooner, while his mother ran her own business in the clothing trade. He told me he had been entrepreneurial right from his days at catering college. 'Even now, I wish to be more successful. I'm being very honest with you, aren't I?' he said, putting his face rather too close to mine. 'Most people would like my job.' 'I wouldn't,' I replied, thinking of the need to be so relentlessly positive. 'Most people would, most people would,' he said, putting me right. 'My partner and I (film producer Keith Barish) flew over here on Concorde. We laughed and worked and giggled the whole time. People thought we were crazy. We'd go from talking about multi-million pound deals to physically strangling each other.' The waitress came again and he forced me to have a pudding: 'Have the brownie and ice cream, or the bread pudding with whiskey sauce.' He had another Diet Coke. He complained that he was suffering from a summer of excess, listing the exclusive resorts he has visited this year with his family, usually in the company of the Schwarzeneggers and the Barishes. The manager came over to say that Roger Myers, head of the Pelican Group - of which Earl owns 11 per cent - was there. To detain him a bit longer (we had had just 45 minutes together) I asked if his 90-year-old secretary was still alive. 'I came back for a big tear-jerker funeral early this year,' he said sadly and, brightening, added: 'But I made her famous just before she passed away. I got her government recognition, she was on television, journalists came from all over to see her. I threw a great 90th birthday for her at her golf club.' He was looking restless, trying to leave. I asked about the Dollars 1.5bn law suit filed against him by a partner of the Hard Rock cafe group, which Earl helped build up in the 1980s. The allegation is that the Planet Hollywood is a copy of the Hard Rock format; but Earl seemed unconcerned. 'I've never laid awake at night over anything. I go to bed and go to sleep.' As he left, I asked if the FT could pay for lunch. To my surprise, he said 'sure'. For the next 10 minutes I tried to catch someone's eye for the bill. But no one seemed interested, so I gave up, and crept out past the queue which by then had formed outside.</p>

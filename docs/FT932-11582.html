			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Extra supervisory powers for Bank will be delayed NEW LEGISLATION to revise the Bank of England's banking supervisory powers will not be introduced until 1994 at the earliest. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, promised last October that the government would act to give the bank express powers to refuse or revoke authorisation of banks where proper supervision was impossible. The pledge was part of the government's response to the inquiry headed by Lord Justice Bingham into the supervision of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. In July last year, the Bank of England asked for a new, explicit power to deal with banks that could not be supervised effectively, whether on structural or other grounds. Lord Justice Bingham concluded that such banks could be dealt with under the existing Banking Act, but accepted that explicit powers should be given if that would strengthen the Bank of England's hand. Responding to the Bingham report, Mr Lamont said he would vigorously pursue all its recommendations, and would introduce legislation when parliamentary time allowed. There were, however, far too many bids from departments for legislation in the new parliamentary session that will begin in November, and the banking bill was eliminated early on by the government's business managers. The only bill that is in the schedule as a piece of Treasury legislation is a 'technical and essential' measure on European Community finance. Ministers appear to have taken into account that the intense political pressure over BCCI is past its peak, and that progress has been made in the non-legislative areas of Bingham's recommendations. The Bank of England, for example, has set up new legal and investigative units in an attempt to assess better whether banks are being managed honestly and prudently. Even so, MPs who have been campaigning on behalf of BCCI's UK depositors are likely to be angered by the apparent relaxation in the government's attitude towards this aspect of recommended changes after BCCI. MPs will have an opportunity to raise the issue with Mr Lamont during the inquiry by the cross-party Treasury committee of MPs into the role of the Bank of England.</p>

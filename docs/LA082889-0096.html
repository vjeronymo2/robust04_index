			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> AILING GILLESPIE SKIPS HEARING  </P> <P> State Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie, blaming a back injury, did not  appear today at a state hearing to answer questions about whether she is biased  toward insurers in her implementation of Proposition 103.  </P> <P> "I am not pleased at her absence," said state Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana),  chairman of the Senate Committee on Insurance, Claims and Corporations, which  held the hearing in downtown Los Angeles. He said Gillespie's office had  notified him of the injury Friday afternoon and asked for a postponement.  </P> <P> Criticism of Gillespie intensified last week after she said three of the  state's biggest auto insurers will not be required to roll back rates because  they lost too much money in 1988.  </P></p>

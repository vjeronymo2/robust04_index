			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / International Company News: Portuguese bank results mixed Caixa Geral de Depositos, Portugal's largest bank, posted a 0.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Es28.8bn (Dollars 170m) for the first half of 1994, compared with the same period last year. Net assets grew 14.9 per cent to Es4,644.7bn. Banco Espirito Santo, the country's fourth-ranked bank, recorded a 5 per cent fall in net profits for the first half to Es10.6bn after a 53 per cent increase in tax provisions. Pre-tax profits rose 8.2 per cent to Es15.6bn. CGD, the only state-owned institution among Portugal's top five banks, said net asset growth was largely due to the improved performance of financial investments, particularly in foreign banks, and a 5.5 per cent rise in total lending to Es1,840.2bn. Espirito Santo Financial Holding, the holding company for BES and other financial institutions in the group, last week raised its capital to Dollars 221.9m, from Dollars 110.9m, by incorporating reserves in a bonus issue. Shareholders received one free ordinary share for each ordinary share. Banco Portugues de Investimento reported a consolidated net profit of Es4.06bn for the first half, compared with Es4.1bn for the same period last year. BPI controls Banco Fonsecas &amp; Burnay. The executive board of Banco Portugues do Atlantico, Portugal's second largest bank, has formally rejected a public offer by Banco Comercial Portugues, a smaller competitor, for a controlling stake of BPA. BCP's offer must be authorised by the CMVM, the finance ministry and the central bank.</p>

			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (17): Problem of revenue decline - Taxation is one of the trickiest areas of reform The reform of China's system of taxation is - says Mr Xiang Huaicheng, recently appointed vice-director of the State Administration of Taxation - among the 'riskiest and most difficult' elements of China's reforms. It is also among the most important. In 1978, budgetary revenues were 34.4 per cent of China's gross national product. By 1993, that had fallen to a mere 15.4 per cent. Meanwhile, the central government's share of total budgetary revenues had fallen from 59 to 41 per cent, while its share of expenditures had fallen only from 46 to 41 per cent. Because of the lack of revenue, the government is forced to rely on the printing press; because of the declining share of the central government, it is also unable to redistribute revenue across China. Much the most important cause of the declining trend in revenues was a reduction in budgetary contributions from state-owned enterprises, from 20 per cent of gross domestic product in 1978 to a mere 4 per cent in 1992. This accounted for over 80 per cent of the total decline in the share of budgetary revenues in national income. It was the intention of the reforms of the 1980s to leave enterprises with greater control over their resources. Yet this also means that the Chinese people are obtaining almost no return from the investments they have been making in these enterprises. In 1993, for example, 23 per cent of GDP was invested in state enterprises. Huge quantities of scarce resources are being swallowed up, therefore, largely for the benefit of the 18 per cent of the labour force that works within them. Administrative decentralisation has also played a role. Hitherto, revenue has been raised by locally responsible tax authorities and shared with the centre through a complex contractual system. This has created incentives for local governments to exempt local enterprises, at the expense of the centre. Meanwhile, local governments have made up the lost revenues through levies that they have not had to share with the centre. Such 'fiscal extra-budgetary funds' have grown from 2.6 per cent of GDP in 1978, to 4.2 per cent in 1993, and now account for a quarter of total budgetary resources. The decline of the centre's share in a fiscal revenue whose share in national income is itself declining threatens not just the reform, but even political and economic stability. The answer has been sought in a comprehensive tax reform that was supposed to start at the beginning of 1994, but was, in fact, initiated in July. The reform programme covers tax structure, tax administration and revenue sharing. The number of taxes is being reduced from 30 to 18, the main features being broadening and restructuring of the value-added tax (VAT), at a rate of 17 per cent on most items, unification and restructuring of the enterprise investment tax (EIT), at a single rate of 33 per cent, and restructuring of the personal income tax. At the same time, the tax service is being re-organised into a National Tax Service (NTS) and a Local Tax Service (LTS). As of July, the NTS is expected to collect all central taxes and shared taxes. Under the new revenue-sharing arrangement, taxes are assigned either to the centre, to local government, or shared. Of indirect taxes, VAT, the securities trading tax and the resource tax are subject to sharing, while customs duties and the new excise tax are assigned to the central government. Of direct taxes, revenues from the enterprise income tax on socially owned companies are to go to the level of government that owns them (so continuing the traditional socialist confusion between taxation and dividends). The system has been designed to ensure that no province becomes worse off than in 1993, but will favour the surplus and fast-growing provinces over the deficit and slow-growing ones. The World Bank estimates that central revenue collection would jump from 27 per cent of total taxes in 1992 to around 80 per cent; the central government's share of the total revenue collected would increase from about about 40 per cent of total revenue in 1992, to 52 per cent by the year 2000; and the net transfer from central to local government would jump from minus 14 per cent of tax collection in 1992 to plus 35 per cent. There should, therefore, be a significant increase in the leverage of the central government over revenue and, thereby, over local government. One question concerns the new NTS. Mr Xiang recognises the difficulty of seizing effective control over his army of 580,000 tax officials in 4,000 offices. Much greater computerisation is required, with 50 cities to be linked in this way next year. The shortage of accountants is a concern. Another problem is the low pay of tax inspectors, who earned only about Yn4,400 (USDollars 760) each in 1993, which must encourage corruption. A survey of one city suggested that 13 per cent of revenue was not collected, but Mr Xiang admits this could be a significant under-estimate. At least two other problems loom. First, that these reforms may not increase overall revenue much, if at all. Additional sources of revenue may soon be needed, the personal income tax being an obvious candidate for attention. Second and more important, tax reform can, at best, solve only half the fiscal problem. The other half is spending. There the problems of inadequate overall control and unclear assignment of responsibility remain to be solved, even in principle.</p>

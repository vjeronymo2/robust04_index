			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / UK mine suppliers link up THE CRISIS facing the UK coal industry has led two of Britain's biggest mining equipment businesses to propose creating a joint venture that will be a leading international supplier of pit supports and conveyor belts. Dobson Park Industries plans to combine its mining equipment division with Meco International, the former mining equipment division of Dowty Group, which was the subject of a management buy-out in 1989. Between them, Dobson Park and Meco supply all of British Coal's hydraulic roof supports and 80 per cent of its conveyors, used to carry coal away from the face. The joint venture, to be called Longwall International, will have annual sales of about Pounds 200m, more than 70 per cent of which will be overseas-oriented. Longwall will have strong market positions in the US, South Africa and Australia. The deal is conditional on approval by Dobson Park shareholders and the UK competition authorities. Dobson Park, which also has power tools and toys businesses, said this move would enable it to focus on the group's industrial electronics division. The two companies said considerable cost reduction benefits should result from the integration of the two businesses, and a provision of Pounds 8.5m has been made to cover costs and professional fees. Both businesses in the venture have shed about 1,000 jobs each over the past three years, as British Coal has contracted. Industry sources said it was likely the combined group's roof support businesses would be concentrated at Dobson's Wigan factory, while the conveyor businesses would be integrated at Meco's Worcester plant. Mr Alan Kaye, Dobson Park's chairman, said speculation about redundancies and closures was premature. Analysis, Page 22</p>

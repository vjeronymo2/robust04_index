			<p>BFN     [Text] Tyre, Lebanon, June 11 (AFP)--The Iranian-backed  Hizballah is planning a major anti-Israeli operation to avenge  32 trainees killed in an Israeli air raid on June 2, one of its  leaders warned Saturday.    "We are preparing an operation that will surprise the  world,"  al-Hajj Hasan Huballah told AFP.    Israel devastated a Hizballah training base in the  Syrian-controlled al-Biqa' Valley of eastern Lebanon on June 2,  killing 32 trainees and prompting retaliatory rocket attacks.    Huballah said the Katyusha rockets, which fell harmlessly on  northern Israel, were not a riposte.    He expected further Israeli military operations and  "assassinations" of Hizballah leaders as part of a US campaign  to crush opposition to Arab-Israeli peace talks.    "We're passing through a very dangerous phase.    "There is an American plot aimed at liquidating all those  who  oppose the Middle East peace process and Israel has been charged  with carrying it out," Huballah said.    But Hizballah leaders had taken strict measures to preempt  any attack. "Senior leaders have moved out of their homes,  changed cars and their daily routine," he said.    The air raid came less than two weeks after Israeli airborne  commandos kidnapped Mustafa al-Dirani, a Muslim guerrilla chief  with close links to Hizballah, from his home in the al-Biqa'.    Israel hopes al-Dirani will supply key information on  missing  Israeli airman Ron Arad whose plane was shot down over south  Lebanon in 1986.    Lebanon branded the abduction and the air raid acts of  piracy  and protested to the United Nations. It also vowed not to  disarm Hizballah until Israel dismantled its self-declared  "security zone" in south Lebanon.    The Arabic-language daily AL-HAYAH, quoting Lebanese  officials, reported Saturday that the United States submitted an  Israeli warning to the Lebanese authorities.    Israel would attack Lebanon if Hizballah carried out its  threat to launch suicide-operations against Israeli interests  around the world, according to the report.</p>

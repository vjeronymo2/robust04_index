			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading RECENT weakness in the premium on the Footsie index future met further testing yesterday, writes Terry Byland. An attempt to move the March contract higher in early trading soon failed, and for the rest of the session the stock index future played its part in restraining the underlying cash market. The March contract soon faded to around 15 points above cash value, effectively showing no premium against fair value, which is the calculation allowing for dividend and financing flows. At this point, the locals backed away and the big securities houses began to arbitrage between futures and stocks, selling the blue chip stocks and buying the stock index contract. Their operations helped a stock market already rallying. By the close of trading, the March contract had established a fair value premium of around 5 points, still weak by comparison with the 15 or so points expected at this stage of the contract's life. Traders reported significant rolling-over of March into the June contract, although with the fair value spread on the two now at about 11 points, this was an expensive move. In traded options, volume increased from Wednesday's 29,089 contracts to 37,711 yesterday. The FT-SE contract was very active with 19,226 lots transacted. BP again led the stock options at 3,145, followed by TSB at 2,699 spurred by takeover talk.</p>

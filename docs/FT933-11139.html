			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: NZ futures market to link with Sydney THE New Zealand Futures &amp; Options Exchange, acquired by Sydney Futures Exchange last year, is to link its computerised futures market with the Australian market, AP-DJ reports from Wellington. Plans will now proceed to allow trading on New Zealand futures contracts in Australia. The link is expected to increase liquidity in local futures trading. A survey of Sydney exchange members shows that between 15 and 20 of them planned to link with the New Zealand exchange. Mr Les Hosking, chief executive of the Sydney exchange, said extra liquidity from Australia and further afield would help the New Zealand financial market use futures and options on futures to manage risk.</p>

			<p><P> November 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STICKY WILE EQUALS RECORD  </P> <P> Sticky Wile equaled an American record of 1:32 3/5 for one mile on the turf in  recording a 5 1/2-length victory in the $42,000 allowance feature at Oak Tree  meeting at Santa Anita Thursday.  </P> <P> Sticky Wile, a 3-year-old filly, was ridden by apprentice Corey Nakatani under  109 pounds and paid $4.60 to win as the favorite. The time equaled the American  turf record set by Royal Heroine in the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1984 at Hollywood  Park. The clocking was two-fifths of a second off the world record of 1:32 1/5  for one mile set by Dr. Fager on the dirt at Arlington Park in Chicago in 1968.  </P> <P> Sticky Wile, third much of the way, forged to the lead around the far turn and  drew off in the stretch. Thanks Tissar finished second, a head in front of  Attend To Detail, in the field of eight.  </P></p>

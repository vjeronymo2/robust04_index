			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The results from samples collected to determine the lateral extent of contamination at known disposal locations has served as the basis for supplemental ATSDR site-specific Health Consultations. ATSDR recommended immediate response actions based upon the finding of imminent health threats. Sampling to determine the vertical extent of contamination at these disposal areas is presently being conducted to expedite complete site characterization. Site characterization and initiation of mitigation actions at known locations and at newly discovered sites are being prioritized for early action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA's assessment is that the site poses a significant threat to human health and anticipates that it will be more cost-effective to use remedial authority than to use removal authority to respond to the site. This finding is set out in a memorandum dated November 3, 1993, from Merrill S. Hohman, Region 1 Waste Management Division Director, to Larry Reed, Hazardous Site Evaluation Division Director. This memorandum and the ATSDR advisory are available in the Superfund docket for this proposed rule. Based on this information, and the references in support of proposal, EPA believes that the Raymark Industries, Inc. site is appropriate for the NPL pursuant to 40 CFR 300.425(c)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Lower Ecorse Creek Dump  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site is located in Wyandotte, Wayne County, Michigan. The site consists of the residence at 470 North Drive and three neighboring parcels of land. The site occupies a level area with the back of the lots abutting the Ecorse River. During the period between 1945 and 1955, and prior to the house at 470 North Drive being built, the low lying swampy area of the creek was filled with material from local industries. Some of the fill material contained what has been confirmed as ferric ferrocyanide, commonly referred to as ``Prussian Blue''. The blue soil was also found across the street at 471 North Drive, approximately two feet below the surface and the owner of the residence at 469 North Drive also reported that he found the blue soil in his yard. In addition, there are two vacant lots east of 470 North Drive where Prussian Blue is exposed. Neighborhood children have used portions of these lots as a go-cart track and wearing of the topsoil by the go-carts has exposed the Prussian Blue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA was contacted by the Wayne County Health Department on October 25, 1989. EPA tasked its Technical Assistance Team (TAT) on October 27, 1989, to conduct a site investigation and sampling. Sampling results were provided to ATSDR for review and assessment. ATSDR's review on November 22, 1989, concluded that ``The levels of cyanide found in the soil do present an urgent public health threat. Steps to eliminate any direct contact with the contaminated soil need to be taken immediately.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following ATSDR's determination that the presence of cyanide-contaminated wastes in an unrestricted residential area presented an immediate and significant public health threat, EPA's Emergency Response Branch initiated removal activities. On December 4, 1989, work commenced to cover the contaminated areas with six inches of clean topsoil and fill in areas of the driveway and sidewalk which had been previously excavated by the property owner. This action eliminated physical contact with Prussian Blue and related cyanide compounds which had spread throughout the area. The initial action was completed in the summer of 1990 with the establishment of a vegetative cover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Final ATSDR Health Advisory which was released on August 13, 1993, recommended the following actions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Immediately dissociate the affected residents from cyanide contamination, which is at levels of health concern in residential subsurface soils;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Implement permanent measures to remediate the contamination as appropriate; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Consider including the Lower Ecorse Creek Dump site on the EPA National Priorities List or, using other statutory or regulatory authorities as appropriate, take other steps to characterize the site and take necessary action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

In a statement issued today, the command said that PLO  Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's retreat from demanding international  protection for the Palestinians, the dismantlement of  settlements in the occupied Arab territories, and evacuation of  settlers is a new violation of the Palestinian national  consensus that negotiations with Israel should be stopped.    In its statement, the command said that it renews its call  for 'Arafat's resignation as a necessary step to learn lessons  from the Israeli massacre and to maintain Palestinians' national  rights.</p>

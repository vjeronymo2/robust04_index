			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium upturn forecast for 1995 ALUMINIUM companies will have to wait until early 1995 before the metal's price recovers to a level they would regard as reasonable, suggests the Anthony Bird Associates consultancy in its latest market analysis. It predicts that, at present exchange rates, aluminium will average 58.7 cents a lb (Dollars 1,294 a tonne) this year and 57.8 cents next year before showing a modest recovery to 62.7 cents in 1994. Bird estimates that the industry's average production costs today are 54 cents a lb but 'the relative position of the high-cost European smelters has continued to worsen, largely as a result of exchange rate changes. The cost position of the European industry is now becoming very unpleasant indeed.' Further production cuts among European aluminium smelters can be expected, Bird suggests, and smelters in the Commonwealth of Independent States are too inefficient to continue exporting to the west at the present pace. However, excess stocks of aluminium in the west will remain high for some time and Bird does not expect supply and demand to be in balance until early 1995.

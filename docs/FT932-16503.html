			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / After the Summit: Business to benefit in cold war clear-out  -Hopes raised by Clinton pledge to review old Communist era restrictions RUSSIAN and American business could have much to gain from the long overdue review promised by President Bill Clinton into the cold war legal relics which contradict US policy supporting the democratisation of the former Soviet states. Mr Clinton promised in Vancouver on Sunday to review all such outstanding regulations that Russia felt was hindering its economic development. Technology related restrictions - on imports as well as exports - comprise the 'most onerous' existing problem for US-Russian commerce, Mr Richard Jacobs, president of Newstar, a Washington and Moscow-based merchant banking and investment advisory firm, said yesterday. One plan to bring a Russian model nuclear space reactor to be exhibited in the US ran into all kinds of red tape, he said. Once permission was received, the Russians found they could not re-export it. 'The US government also requires that American companies have permission to receive technical data from Russian companies.' he said. 'They have to have an export licence to return the same data.' Mr RK 'Judge' Morris, an official with the National Manufacturers' Association, said US companies were discouraged from investing and entering joint ventures with Russia by the presence of the old Jackson-Vanik amendment, which links trade benefits and credits with emigration restrictions. As long as the law remains on the books, and the president must issue an annual waiver - as he does with China - then business will be discouraged from making long-term investments, he said. The association is also asking the administration to streamline export controls 'so they don't provided a competitive disincentive' in Russia, and to raise commercial aid. The administration must also sort out a policy dilemma regarding US credits. Is the prime purpose of the US Export-Import Bank, which provides export financing, trade or aid? If it is trade, how much risk can it be allowed to take on without a congressional approval? The same is true with the Commodity Credit Corporation which supplies funding for farm credits. The Clinton aid package for Russia includes, for example, an Dollars 82m loan to finance the sale of Caterpillar pipeline construction machinery. Eximbank, although still without a chairman and vice-chairman, went ahead and approved the loan in February. Bank officials then had to endure criticism from Congress for having made loans to a country that was not 'credit-worthy'.</p>

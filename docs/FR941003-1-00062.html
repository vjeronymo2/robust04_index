The proposed changes seek to balance the interests and concerns of various users of the Section 106 process, including Federal agencies, State Historic Preservation Officers (SHPOs), Native Americans and Native Hawaiians, and the public. The revised regulations also respond to the new Section 110 provisions in the 1992 amendments which require Federal agencies to establish historic preservation programs. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> Dates:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before December 2, 1994. In recognition of the unique trust and treaty relationships between the United States Government and Indian tribes, their enhanced role in the Section 106 process as directed by the National Historic Preservation Act amendments of 1992, and the possibility that some tribes will need more than 60 days to provide comments, the Council will provide on request an additional 30 days for an Indian tribe to submit comments. A representative of the tribal government must file such request with the Council no later than December 2, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> Addresses:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments should be addressed to the Executive Director, Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, 1100 Pennsylvania Avenue, Suite 809, Washington, DC 20004.

Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended, 16 U.S.C. &sect;470f, requires Federal agencies to take into account the effect of their undertakings on properties included in or eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places and to afford the Council a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. Public Law 102&hyph;575 was enacted in October, 1992, and contains amendments to the National Historic Preservation Act which affect the way Section 106 review is carried out under the Council's regulations. Furthermore, as part of the Administration's National Performance Review, the Council undertook a review of the current regulatory process to identify potential changes that could improve the operation of the Section 106 process and conform it to the principles of this Administration. The Council commenced an information-gathering effort to assess the current Section 106 process and to identify desirable changes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a part of this effort, the Council sent a questionnaire to 1,200 users of the Section 106 process, including Federal agencies, SHPOs, State and local governments, applicants for Federal assistance, Native Americans, preservation groups, contractors involved in the process, and members of the public. The questionnaires sought opinions on the current regulatory process and ideas for enhancing the process. The Council received over 400 responses. After analyzing the responses and holding several meetings with Federal Preservation Officers and SHPOs, the Council staff presented its preliminary findings to a special Council member Task Force comprised of the Department of Transportation, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, Native American representative William Tallbull, expert member Jane Davidson, and Council chairman Cathryn Buford Slater. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG -->  <!-- PJG /FTAG --></p>

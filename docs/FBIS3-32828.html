			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Code of Silence and Democracy"] </F>   [Text] The La Cantuta case must be transferred to the  courts of common law, and those responsible must be punished.  These are the rules of democracy and of civilization. They are  inescapable, despite the fact that many of us feel that great  injustice is done when, after having borne the brunt of an  atrocious war, in which they proved capable, moreover, of  implementing a correct and humane strategy, the Armed Forces are  made the target of pseudo-apostles of good.    In internal wars--and above all, in one as long as this one  has been and against as treacherous, cruel, and savage an enemy  as Shining Path--the tendency to form secret extermination  groups is almost spontaneous. In a recent interview, Enrique  Obando stated that in every army of the world there is a double  code: a written one that comprises the regulations and conforms  with the Constitution, and an unwritten one that in a veiled  manner authorizes the existence of groups that carry out illegal  operations. If this double code is a commonplace in all armies,  it is also one in ours, which has endured the strain of an  extremely hard internal war.    This is what occurred in Argentina. But, there, the secret  code was applied in a systematic manner, and became official  strategy. In Peru, it was applied only sporadically, never  systematically. On the contrary, the incredible, the truly  extraordinary fact, is that, beginning in 1990, the Armed Forces  were able to implement the opposite strategy. Starting from that  year, their systematic strategic policy was one of alliance with  the population, under which the Armed Forces gave arms to the  civilian patrols, food and civic aid to the disadvantaged urban  populations, and built roads in high-risk areas. An intelligent  action that enabled the capture of thousands of terrorist  leaders without firing a single shot. An astute strategy, in  sum, extremely respectful of human rights, diametrically opposed  to the strategy of indiscriminate slaughter. This is why it  produced results. This is why it had the people's support. These  are the facts.    In Peru, that code of silence did not become strategy. There  was a group of executioners, but it was a vestige of a previous  stage, and in conflict with the strategy that in the end  succeeded.    In truth, the Peruvian Army, being in no way compromised by  the investigation, has no reason to feel mistreated by it. Very  much on the contrary, the Army must proudly show everybody its  proven ability to learn and adapt its war strategy not only to  humanitarian principles but also to the reality of the only  effective action for defeating an enemy that felt it could move  among the people like a fish in the water.    Clearly, the code of silence is incompatible with democracy.  What we know today about La Cantuta is owing to the fact that a  policy split within the Army has led certain officers to reveal  the identities of those who might have been the perpetrators of  that massacre, bringing information to public light that, in  another time, would not have been made known. This, in addition  to its hard-fought rivalry with the accusing group, is why the  Army is resisting the investigation.    But justice is inevitable. And in the end, in spite of  everything, the truth shall prevail: That the Peruvian Army was  able to overcome the terrorist enemy cleanly, by intelligent,  humanitarian, and democratic means.</p>

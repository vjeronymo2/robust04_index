			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Voz Andes Newscast"] </F>   [Excerpt] Union leaders reported that at least five IESS  employees were injured in a clash with police when they were  protesting government plans to privatize the IESS. A union  leader said the injuries were inflicted by members of the  security forces during an act of brutal repression in which tear  gas and police sticks were used. I want to express my strong  condemnation of this criminal repression, the leader said. Five  of our fellow workers were injured solely for the crime of  defending social security, he added.

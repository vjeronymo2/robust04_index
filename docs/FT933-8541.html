			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Cut-price Petrus - Appetisers A sign of the times in Bordeaux is the just-released, greatly reduced opening price of Chateau Petrus 1992, as offered by its UK agents, Corney &amp; Barrow, London EC2 (071-251 4051). In advance of a very large but mostly wet vintage, not only was severe summer pruning undertaken, but from the beginning of September the whole 11 hectare vineyard was covered by plastic sheeting - a costly operation. Picking took place on three sunny afternoons between September 23 and October 1. The result was 3,000 cases of 12.8' wine  -25 per cent fewer cases than normal. No Petrus 1991 was offered, but compared with opening in-bond-London prices of Pounds 1,150, a case for the 1989 and Pounds 1,050 for the 1990, the 1992 is offered at Pounds 550 - as the quantity is limited, on allocation. * * * Invergordon Distillers recently invited a number of drinks writers to the Hebridean island of Jura to select a special release at cask strength. We nosed 20 whiskies at between 54' and 63', and now 200 bottles of this 'critics' choice' whisky have been released for sale. The 20-year-old whisky (54') has a pleasant, nutty character from refilled sherry hogshead. Enquiries to Invergordon (031-554-4404). UK price Pounds 39.95, including P&amp;P. * * * Since my article on tawny ports appeared last week the excellent port house of Niepoort has found a UK distributor. Enquiries to Bibendum (071-722 5577).</p>

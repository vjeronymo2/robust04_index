			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "R.R.": "Former Pact Members, Now the </F> `Liberal Democratic Foundation'"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- "The Segni Pact was finished just after  the elections, because it lacked a popular consensus and because  the nondenominationalist members moved away from it. Now that  La Malfa and Amato left, the Segni Pact will remain Segni and  that is enough. More than a political movement, it is an  abstraction given form by a name and aimed at a new Italian  political absurdity: opposition from the Center! Hence, Giulio  Tremonti, Berlusconi's finance minister, lent official status to  the final farewell to the referendum leader by announcing the  birth of the "Liberal Democratic Foundation," which has paid a  lot of attention to Berlusconi and which held its first, crowded  meeting yesterday at the Antonianum.    Segni's reply was extremely tough: "Now that Tremonti has  become a minister, it is obvious because he embraced Berlusconi.  It is displeasing to see deputies who, after 20 days, back away  from the programs for which they were elected and betray the  electorate." Joining Tremonti (absent due to one of his  ministerial duties) are Alberto Michelini and two other former  Pact deputies, Ernesto Stajano and Pietro Siciliani. They want  to become an important point of reference for the liberal world  within the Center-Right coalition, yet want to remain distinct  from Forza Italia. Referring to Segni, Michelini condemned "the  lack of clarity" and felt that now it is "more than likely" that  there will be a fresh division in the PPI [Italian Popular  Party]. "I am convinced that at the time of the confidence  vote, six or seven PPI senators will not be present. No matter  what Ciriaco De Mita says about it, not everyone wants the  government to fall."

			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Enough to make you turn to drink Sir, My corporation is constructing a British/Irish style pub in the Napa Valley, California. To this end, on February 3 I wrote to the chief executives of what were identified as the 56 largest brewers in the UK. I inquired whether, first, they had an interior of a pub they had closed which we could purchase and, second, if they did have one what was the name of their distributor in northern California. To date, I have had one reply, with not even the courtesy of a response from any of the others. If this is indicative of the get-up-and-go which British industry has at present then I feel sympathy for the shareholders and employees who rely on these chief executives. Graham Cook, chief executive officer, Winston's, PO Box 5417, Napa, Ca 94581, US</p>

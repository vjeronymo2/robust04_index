			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Where have all the roubles gone?: The second siege of Leningrad-St Petersburg PERESTROIKA began as a quiet revolution and turned into an undeclared war, the war of Russian society in transition. It is a battle of individual struggles for a 'normal life,' fought in city streets and in markets, in shops and in the countryside. It is a conflict in which the strong claw their way upward and the weak go to the wall. Take, for example, my friend the general. Five years ago, when red flags fluttered proudly over the Leningrad Soviet and party headquarters at Smolni, he was at the height of his powers. You would see his car escorted through the city streets. There were aides, power, influence. Members of the nomenklatura gathered at his apartment or government dacha for elaborate banquets or discreet suppers. I knew many of the guests and knew, too, that many were corrupt. I shed no tears for them now. The general was different. I have seldom met a man so honest and we became friends. Now in retirement, he is one of 'yesterday's men,' desperately worried about the future of his young son who begins school this year. His monthly R620 rouble pension is insufficient for bare necessities and what work is there in contemporary Russia for retired generals? They are two a penny, like the grand dukes who drove Parisian taxis. His wife is working through her modest wardrobe, selling clothes she can do without in commercial shops and buying food with the proceeds. The general goes to market, taking vodka bought with his monthly ration card, trading the precious bottle for a kilo of meat. He drives a decrepit, ten-year-old car and picks up fare-paying passengers to pay the petrol. If car, fridge or freezer break down, there is money for repairs. Someone comes to the door to ask whether the couple have a young child, returning shortly afterwards with a welcome German aid package. My friends laugh when they see the parcel has been rifled, the coffee and chocolate removed. 'It is probably on sale down the road. Never mind, we can use the rest.' It is hard not to feel embarrassment when old friends are so happy with so little; a few packets of flour, pasta, margarine, muesli and sausages. The general is strong and still healthy. He wants to work but plans have come to nothing and he retains his pride. 'I was offered a job as master carpenter in the gulag. You understand why I could not take it, don't you?' When the (Great Patriotic) war broke out in 1941 Svetlana was 18 and living on the Polish border. For months she walked east, several thousand miles to safety across the Urals, then fate brought her back to factory work in Leningrad and the famous 900-day siege. Now nearly 70, and looking much older, she supplements her meagre pension in a restaurant cloakroom. Her face twists into a bitter smile as she contrasts the war years with contemporary St Petersburg. 'During the Blockade there was nothing but hope. Then, we worked together for common goals. Now we are divided, people think only of themselves. It is worse, much worse, for even hope has gone.' Had she seen any western aid? 'No, though I would not be ashamed to take it, even from the Germans.' Many residents share her gloomy outlook, trudging wearily through the slush on futile searches for food they can afford. A large state grocery had cabbage, onions, beets, withered apples and unidentifiable root vegetables. No potatoes. The nearby butchers had meat (largely bone) at R80 (40p) a kilo and fatty sausage for R90.</p>

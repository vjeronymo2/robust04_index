			<p><P> August 12, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORTH WOULD GET PRISON TERM UNDER NEW RULES, ARTICLE SAYS  </P> <P> Had federal sentencing guidelines been applied to Oliver L. North's Iran-Contra  case, the recommended punishment would have been a prison term of at least 21  months, according to a published analysis.  </P> <P> North, convicted last spring of committing three felonies when working at the  White House in 1986, was fined, put on probation and ordered to do community  service -- but was sentenced to no jail time.  </P> <P> The guidelines, which recommend ranges of possible sentences to judges, were  not applied to the North case because they cover only federal crimes committed  after Nov. 1, 1987.  </P> <P> If North's actions had occurred after that date, calculations under the  guidelines "would produce a sentence range of 21-27 months in prison on the low  end, and a range of 46-57 months in prison on the high end," an article by the  editors of the Federal Sentencing Reporter concluded.  </P> <P> The nonprofit publication is circulated among federal judges, probation  officers, law professors and attorneys.  </P> <P> North was convicted of aiding and abetting obstruction of Congress, destroying  government documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.  </P> <P> The length of a recommended sentence under the guidelines in the North case  would depend partly on a judge's decision as to whether the former White House  aide had substantially interfered with the administration of justice, the  article said.  </P> <P> Other factors in determining the severity of punishment would be the value  assigned to classified documents that North destroyed, whether he was a major  or minor participant in the crime of aiding the obstruction of Congress and  whether he was considered to be in a high-level decision-making capacity, the  article said.  </P> <P> If North's had been a guidelines case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell  still could have imposed no jail time but the prosecution would have been able  to appeal such a decision.  </P> <P> Before North's sentencing, prosecutors recommended an unspecified jail term,  Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman in the office of independent counsel Lawrence E.  Walsh, noted when asked to comment on the new analysis. North's attorney,  Brendan V. Sullivan Jr., was out of his office and unavailable for comment, a  secretary said.  </P> <P> At the sentencing, Gesell told North that he lacked a "full understanding . . .  of how the public service has been tarnished" and that "jail would only harden  your misconceptions." The judge said that community service may leave North  more conscious of values that, at times, "you and your associates appear to  have overlooked in the elite isolation of the White House."  </P></p>

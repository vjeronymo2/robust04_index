			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / People: Barker boards at Resort Tim Barker, deputy group chief executive of Kleinwort Benson and a former director general of the Takeover Panel, has accepted his first outside directorship and is going on to the board of Resort Hotels as deputy chairman. He replaces David Tonkinson, 66, who has been a non-executive director of the mid-market hotel chain since 1987, becoming deputy chairman the following year. Tonkinson, a former managing partner of the Brighton office of Grant Thornton, stays on the board. 'With the current Cadbury recommendations, he was happy to stand aside for someone with as much prestige as Tim Barker,' says managing director Robert Feld. Feld adds that it is intended Barker should replace Dick Strong as chairman around the end of this year. Strong, 63, had a venture capital background - having been a director of Charterhouse Development Capital Holdings - but Feld says that it was now appropriate for someone with quoted company experience to come on board. Barker, 52, was head of corporate finance at KB between 1986 and 1990. Last November, Resort's share price had slumped as low as 16p - persistent selling by one institutional shareholder, says Feld - but it has since recovered, closing yesterday 5p stronger at 52 1/2 p despite the shares going ex-dividend. The focus in coming months is to clear up any uncertainty concerning the acquisitions of Country Resort Hotels and County Resort Hotels and to win new management contracts, according to Feld.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 4 Jan (AFP) -- The American  troops who occupy Bahia Malaga in Valle Department in the  country's southern Pacific coast area are preparing to establish  a military surveillance complex to watch the Pacific seaboard,  the morning newspaper LA PRENSA of Santa Fe de Bogota reported  today. Under the headline "Marines Know How To Radar"--a play  on the Spanish words equivalent to radar and swim, which sound  similar in Spanish--LA PRENSA says the United States will  install radar sites which will be connected to the radar network  already installed in Central America.    The arrival of between 120 and 150 U.S. soldiers, who,  according to the Colombian Government, started to arrive on 28  December as part of a civilian project construction agreement,  has aroused a lively controversy among political leaders. The  government says the U.S. soldiers' presence deals with the  construction of schools, health posts, and several kilometers of  roads in Juanchaco on the Pacific coast. LA PRENSA, however,  has reported: "The U.S. Marines in Bahia Malaga intend mainly  to conduct preliminary studies for the construction of a complex  network of radar sites at a place regarded by the U.S.  Government as the most strategic on the Pacific Ocean, near the  Panama Canal."    Citing a report from its special correspondent Fernando  Cortes, LA PRENSA, an opposition conservative paper, says the  first radar site would cover from Bahia Solano on the coast to  Panama and would link up with radar sites installed in Central  America and the Caribbean, including Colombian-owned San Andres  island. The paper continues to say that with these sites the  Pentagon seeks to curb drug trafficking in the Pacific because  the Governments of Colombia and the United States have for a  long time been aware of the growing number of Cali Cartel routes  in this area.    LA PRENSA further adds that 36 U.S. engineers are already in  Bahia Malaga and that others are scheduled to arrive aboard  several Black Hawk helicopters today. "They will be flown in  directly from the Southern Command in Panama, and along the  Humboldt current, in very covert flights to avert new incidents  with the public if Colombian radar discovers them," LA PRENSA  said.</p>

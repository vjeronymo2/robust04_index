			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Meche Garrido] </F>   [Text] The government is quite troubled by the fact that  two of the main political parties in the Coalition (the  Christian Democrats, DC, and the PPD [Party for Democracy]) are  immersed in internal elections.    There is uneasiness because these elections are preventing  the Coalition from giving more effective support to President  Eduardo Frei and his government. The situation was different  under former President Patricio Aylwin, who received ongoing  support from the alliance, especially from his own party, the DC.    More specifically, however, the internal struggle for the  presidency of Christian Democracy, a struggle that has  sharpened, has been compounded in recent days by the battle in  the PPD, which is beset by a serious problem of internal  leadership.    Much sharp criticism is being leveled at the leadership,  including the long-time leaders of the party. The most  widespread complaint in the PPD is that the congressional  election and the appointment of the cabinet has been followed by  paralysis in the party, which has done nothing about it.    The charges are being leveled directly at its current  president, Sergio Bitar. Although he is acknowledged as the  party's undisputed leader, the objection is that after he was  elected senator from the First Region, he has been unable to  devote the time to the party leadership that it requires.    Concern in the PPD is even greater because despite the  results of the congressional elections (in which it doubled its  representation to 15 deputies and two senators), the party's  profile is becoming blurred today.    The situation facing this group is marked not only by the  departure of Bitar but also by the unmistakable absence of  Victor Manuel Rebolledo and Jorge Schaulsohn. Now that the  former has joined the cabinet and the latter has taken over as  president of the Chamber, the PPD has been left even more  leaderless.    Although the efforts that Vice Presidents Jorge Molina and  Erich Schnake are making are appreciated, a large majority  agrees that the leadership crisis that has developed makes the  election of new officers urgent. But the elections are, in  principle, scheduled for September, a fact that upsets those who  want to hasten internal decision-making so that the vigorous PPD  does not yield the entire progressive sector of the Coalition to  the Socialist Party, which they acknowledge has done a good job  of keeping a high profile.    For the time being, only Deputy Victor Barrueto and  electoral  expert Jose Auth have entered the race for party posts, running  for president and secretary general, respectively.    No others have yet joined the race, as they are waiting for  the current president, Sergio Bitar, to decide whether or not to  run again. While they are waiting patiently for this PPD leader  to make up his mind, the rumor is that he will not run for  reelection because his goal is to make his name as a national  senator by devoting all of his time and effort to voters in the  strategic First Region, which he has done ever since he was  elected.    Should Bitar run again, though, he would face competition  for  the first time. This development would in itself be a change,  inasmuch as one of the main criticisms of this party is that its  leaders have always been chosen by the top echelon without an  election in which the rank and file could select the people they  wanted to lead them.    In the event that Bitar runs for reelection, he would  probably face off against Deputy Victor Barrueto, who has the  support of former Vice President Victor Manuel Rebolledo; as  long as he remains a minister, however, he says that he will  stay out of his party's internal elections.    While Bitar thinks things over, PPD spokesmen are not ruling  out the possibility that the party's former secretary general,  Deputy Jorge Schaulsohn, might decide to seek its presidency. In  fact, he himself has said that he has not yet made up his mind  in this regard. Many have their doubts, however, because this  legislator is determined to be the finest president of the  Chamber of Deputies in recent times.    The leadership crisis in the PPD has created strife among  its  various factions, and because of the existing problems no one  yet knows which candidates will ultimately face off against each  other to head up the party.    The new officers that party members elect, whoever they may  be, will have to solve some serious problems facing the PPD,  because paradoxically its growth has severely weakened its  internal organization at the national level.    One of the most visible difficulties stemming from its lack  of organization is that very few of its offices are operating in  communities and regions, just eight of the existing 12. The PPD  has major operational problems in Valparaiso, and it is thought  to have idle assets in the second, third, sixth, and other  regions.    Therefore, the challenge facing the new officers is to  institutionalize the party and renew and expand its roster of  leaders.    A broad cross-section of the party agrees that collective  leaderships need to be established since until now it has been a  party of well known figures, which was initially a source of  strength and representation. It wants to take advantage of this  asset during the current process of change and renewal.    Although the work done during the initial stage by  well-known  figures such as Sergio Bitar, Jorge Schaulsohn, Victor Manuel  Rebolledo, Erich Schnake, and Ricardo Lagos is acknowledged, the  regions and the metropolitan area are pressing for a renewal so  that there is competition in the internal elections to end the  "reign of celebrities."    As with its ally the DC, the pace of meetings and talks  within the party is picking up. On Saturday 23 April, the  economy minister, Alvaro Garcia, called a meeting to test the  internal electoral environment. It was attended by, among  others, Eugenio Tironi, Guillermo del Valle, Maria Antonieta  Saa, and Erich Schnake. Reportedly, some did not know what it  was about, while others thought that Sergio Bitar was going to  announce his candidacy. Instead, Bitar showed up to clarify that  as president of the PPD he could not belong to an internal  faction.    It was noteworthy and annoying to some in the party that  several people attending the meeting described themselves as  leftists, not progressives as the party calls them. A senior  spokesman for the PPD remarked that it was a serious mistake for  the group to describe itself as leftist; it did so because of a  desire to distance itself from other, more moderate factions,  such as Jorge Schaulsohn's.    Spokesmen for another faction were also surprised by the  greeting that Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos sent to the  meeting; some leaders, however, commented that it was  significant that the leader of the Socialist Party and the PPD  did not attend the meeting and merely sent his greetings. In any  event, the involvement of the two Frei cabinet ministers in  party politics elicited serious objections from leaders and  members.    "Lagos ought to remain above factional strife because he is  a  national figure in the coalition left," said a high-level party  leader. After Lagos sent his letter of greetings to the faction,  the feeling in the PPD was that he has to clarify his party  membership inasmuch as his dual status (Socialist and PPD  member) is untenable.    The uneasiness over Lagos's and Garcia's involvement  presumably prompted a group of deputies to look into the  possibility of sending a letter to the government saying that it  is improper for cabinet ministers to create factions in  coalition parties and be actively involved in the internal  struggle instead of devoting all of their time to their  ministries.    The internal contest for the presidency seems more personal  than anything else. It does involve some substantive issues,  however, as there have been mutual accusations about neoliberal  influence in the party.    Such influence has been roundly denied, although the culture  of classical liberalism is acknowledged to be broadly  represented. The progressive philosophy is predominant in the  PPD, however, as it seeks to distance itself from the Socialist  Party, especially after the selection of mayors, governors, and  Regional Ministry Secretariats, in which the Socialists were  winners.    Although the election of its officers is still months away,  the debate and struggle has already begun in the party, and the  pace will pick up once the current president, Senator Sergio  Bitar, makes up his mind about what to do.</p>

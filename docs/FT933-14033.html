			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Civil Service unions strike THE TWO biggest Civil Service unions, the CPSA and NUCPS will today hold their first ever Home-Office-wide one-day strike against what they see as the threat to services and jobs by market testing and the lack of assurances for the future of staff. Ballot results showed a 2:1 majority in favour of the one-day strike by both unions' members. The strike will involve immigration staff at airports and ports, some prison workers and passport office workers.</p>

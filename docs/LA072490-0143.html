			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT PLANT PUT IN LIMBO BY FORD SALE;  </P> <P> DEFENSE INDUSTRY: WITH THE AEROSPACE SUBSIDIARY UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP, THE FUTURE  OF ITS AERONUTRONIC DIVISION IN ORANGE COUNTY IS UP IN THE AIR.  </P> <P> Ford Motor Co.'s announcement Monday that it has agreed to sell its Ford  Aerospace subsidiary to Loral Corp. did little to clarify the future for the  2,700 employees at the firm's Aeronutronic defense plant here, in part because  the lease on the plant's property is not included in the sale.  </P> <P> In addition, some analysts said Loral, a New York-based defense electronics  company, is likely to sell off portions of Ford Aerospace that do not  complement its own operations. For example, the Newport Beach division  manufactures the venerable Sidewinder and Chaparral missiles, but missiles do  not fit with Loral's existing operations, analysts said.  </P> <P> Some Ford Aerospace employees leaving the Newport Beach plant Monday afternoon  said they had not received enough information to know how the sale will affect  them.  </P> <P> "We don't know enough to say much," said Norman Potter, a materials scientist  who held a blue paper handout announcing the sale to employees. "Nobody knows  much about (Loral)."  </P> <P> Ford's Aeronutronic division occupies 99 prime, ocean-view acres that the  company leases from the Irvine Co. under a contract that expires in 2052.  Sources said Monday that the lease was not included in the sale and that the  buyer of Ford Aerospace would be required to vacate the property within five  years.  </P> <P> A Loral spokeswoman said there were no current plans to sell pieces of Ford  Aerospace.  </P> <P> But Loral will assume a large debt burden with its acquisition, and some Wall  Street analysts expect the company to sell some operations, possibly including  the Virginia-based consultant BDM International Inc., a satellite manufacturing  operation in Silicon Valley and themissile group in Newport Beach.  </P> <P> Michael Beltramo, a Los Angeles defense consultant, speculated that Hughes  Aircraft Co., which submitted a losing bid for Ford Aerospace in conjunction  with Alcatel of France, may be interested in buying the missile business. A  Hughes spokesman declined to comment on that possibility.  </P> <P> Ford purchased the Aeronutronic business in 1956 and moved the operation to  Newport Beach in 1960. The division grew rapidly in the 1960s and 1970s on the  strength of the Sidewinder air-to-air missile and Chaparral surface-to-air  missile programs. In the 1970s, the Pave Tack bomb-targeting system also became  a significant source of revenue.  </P> <P> The division was highly profitable in the 1970s and early 1980s, former  executives have said, and employment at one point reached 3,500. But these  officials say Ford failed to invest adequately in the operation.  </P> <P> Aeronutronic suffered a major blow in 1985 when the Pentagon canceled the  problem-plagued Sgt. York tank-mounted gun program after an investment of $1.8  billion. That resulted in 1,300 layoffs at the Newport Beach plant.  </P> <P> More recently, the Aeronutronic unit has struggled with production problems and  a decline in orders for its mainstay missile products. Sources have said the  division is not currently profitable. Still, the firm did receive a lift  earlier this year when it received orders for a potentially lucrative  missile-guidance system, and the company's electro-optics technology is highly  regarded in the industry.  </P> <P> The sale of the Aeronutronic unit to another company would not guarantee the  operation's move from Newport Beach, but a large defense firm might choose to  relocate production to its own facilities elsewhere.  </P> <P> And that possibility worries Richard Luehrs, president of the Newport Harbor  Area Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> "We are concerned about the economic impact," Luehrs said. "We don't know what  the intent of the buyer might be. It doesn't matter who owns it; the question  is whether or not it remains an employment center."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Chris Woodyard, Michael Flagg and Dean Takahashi  contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FORD AEROSPACE SOLD TO LORAL CORP.  </P> <P> Annual Revenue: $1.86 billion  </P> <P> Total Employees: 16,780  </P> <P> Chief Executive: Donald Rassier  </P> <P> </P> <P> MAJOR OPERATIONS:  </P> <P> Corporate Headquarters: NEWPORT BEACH  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aeronutronic  </P> <P> NEWPORT BEACH  </P> <P> Tactical weapons systems  </P> <P> </P> <P> Western Development Laboratories  </P> <P> SAN JOSE  </P> <P> Satellite ground terminals  </P> <P> </P> <P> Space Systems Division  </P> <P> PALO ALTO  </P> <P> Satellites  </P> <P> </P> <P> Colorado Springs Divisions  </P> <P> COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.  </P> <P> Command/control/communications for North American Air Defense Command  </P> <P> </P> <P> BDM International Inc.  </P> <P> MCLEAN, Va.  </P> <P> Support services for military and space programs  </P> <P> </P> <P> Space Missions Group  </P> <P> SEABROOK, Md.  </P> <P> Engineering for space missions  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sunnyvale Division  </P> <P> SUNNYVALE, Ca  </P> <P> Satellite tracking and control systems  </P> <P> </P> <P> Technical Service Operation  </P> <P> HORSHAM, Pa.  </P> <P> Military range management  </P> <P> </P> <P> Space Information Systems Operation  </P> <P> HOUSTON, Tx.  </P> <P> Engineering services for Johnson Space Center  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ford Microelectronics Inc.  </P> <P> COLORADO SPRINGS, Co.  </P> <P> Design and development of advanced semiconductors  </P> <P> </P> <P> A COMPANY CHRONOLOGY  </P> <P> 1956: Ford acquires a defense and development group called Systems Research  Corp. and renames it Aeronutronic Systems Inc.  </P> <P> 1960: Aeronutronic moves to Newport Beach.  </P> <P> 1961: Ford acquires Philco Corp., a defense contractor involved in missile  development and, though its Western Development Laboratories, space systems.  </P> <P> 1962: Aeronutronic becomes a division of Philco.  </P> <P> 1963: Western Development Laboratories selected to build a mission control  center for Johnson Space Center.  </P> <P> 1965: Chapparal surface-to-air missile program, still a mainstay for the  company, is awarded.  </P> <P> 1967: Sidewinder air-to-missile program transferred to Aeronutronic.  </P> <P> 1969: Air Force Satellite Control Facility established.  </P> <P> 1976: Name changed to Ford Aerospace Communications Corp.

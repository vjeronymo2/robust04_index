			<p>BFN     [Text] Pean So, Cambodia, April 11 (AFP) -- Ethnic  Vietnamese in this small village near Phnom Penh said Monday  they could not identity the gunmen who massacred 14 of their  number, contradicting reports which blamed Khmer Rouge  guerrillas.    The gun and grenade attack also left more than 20 wounded in  the village in Tro Sla district about 30 kilometers (20 miles)  southeast of Phnom Penh, villagers said.    The Vietnamese Embassy in Phnom Penh said earlier Monday  that  local people blamed the Khmer Rouge for the attack late Saturday  on the village along the banks of the Bassac River.    But one woman whose grandson was killed when the group of  about 10 gunmen attacked said: "We do not know who they were  because it was dark."    The assailants, who were dressed in shorts and T-shirts  attacked at around 8.30 P.M. killing 14 people, mainly women and  children, the Pean So villagers said.    "They started running from the far end of the village and  when they heard the sound of children playing they threw  grenades. They did not care about young or old," said Pham  Kory, whose sister was killed and whose son and daughter were  injured in a grenade blast.    Many of the ethnic Vietnamese villagers told AFP that they  had never seen or heard of Khmer Rouge in the area and there was  no evidence of guerrilla involvement in the attack.    Lam Van Chiep, a 42-year-old fisherman, also said he did not  think the gunmen were bandits.    "It's very difficult to say who they were. Most of them wore  shorts and T-shirts and they did not steal any belongings except  for a little money," he said.    The Vietnamese Embassy statement, which originally  identified  the village as Tro Sla, called the attack the bloodiest in a  year against ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia. The Khmer  Rouge have been blamed for several massacres during the  UN-supervised elections in 1993.    Among victims was [word indistinct]-day-old infant whose arm  was torn off, said the embassy statement. Nguyen Van Ty, an  official with the local Vietnamese residents' association, was  among the victims, it added.    The embassy said the "barbarous massacre" was an attempt to  harm friendly relations between Vietnam and Cambodia.    It called on the Cambodian Government for an immediate and  effective inquiry, to bring the guilty to justice and prevent  such killings occurring again.    Thousands of people have fled Cambodia over the past two  years after the Khmer Rouge attacked ethnic Vietnamese, many of  whom have lived in Cambodia for generations.    About 30,000 refugees are stranded in border provinces of  Vietnam, unable to return to Cambodia, while another 5,000 to  6,000 are on the Cambodian side.</p>

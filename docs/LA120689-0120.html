			<p><P> December 6, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> SENIOR HOUSING PLAN OKD ON SECOND VOTE  </P> <P> A 179-unit senior citizen housing project has won approval from the City  Council, which reversed an earlier decision.  </P> <P> The council voted 5 to 0 Monday night to approve the Valley View Senior Villa  development plan, which it had previously turned down by a 3-2 vote.  </P> <P> "I think the developer has gone out of his way to make sure that this project  will be compatible with the surrounding area," Councilman Raymond T. Littrell  said.  </P> <P> The council had rejected the three-story project on Nov. 6 because of  neighbors' concerns about traffic and privacy problems that could result from  the project, which will be built on a 2.8-acre site at 12200 Valley View St.,  south of Chapman Avenue in west Garden Grove.  </P> <P> David Michelson, president of Valley View Senior Partners of Irvine, told the  council that his company had met with neighbors to find out their concerns and  has agreed to plant 40 trees on the side of the project facing residences, make  some architectural changes and install "grabber" bars in bathrooms in the  building.  </P> <P> In addressing traffic worries, the city and the developer also plan to study  the possibility of coordinating traffic signals along Valley View Street.  </P> <P> The moderate-cost housing complex will include food service and exercise  facilities.

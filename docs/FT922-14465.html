			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (6): Impact of 'downsizing'  -Competition intensifies in the workstations market THE CHALLENGE to Sun Microsystems' leadership of the workstation market has been growing in recent months. Hewlett-Packard has been gaining ground on Sun since its acquisition of Apollo in 1989. Last year it narrowed the gap; Sun had around 42 per cent of unit sales against HP's 20 per cent, but as HP achieved higher average prices the two were much closer on revenue. Powerful workstations using the UNIX operating systems started to become popular in technical sites in the mid-1980s and have since started to spread into general use, becoming one of the fastest-growing sectors of the industry. Last year, both Sun and HP had trouble keeping up with the rising demand. Mr John Coon, Sun's product marketing manager, says this expansion is caused mainly by users 'downsizing' - shifting their software from mainframes and minicomputers to client-server systems. These systems consist of top-end workstations configured as the server, or database machine, linked to low-end workstations tuned as the client's vehicle for tools and applications. John Coon notes that there is a simultaneous movement of 'upsizing' among PC users who need more power for their applications software. Although the majority of workstations are still in the technical area, computer users in the commercial world, especially in the financial sector, are increasingly preferring workstations to PCs for complex applications. The competition among suppliers has now grown so fierce that profits on the hardware have eroded. For a manufacturer to make any profit on a machine sold for under Pounds 10,000, it has to sell in large numbers. Last year the number of systems sold worldwide grew by 40 per cent, but the value of sales grew by only 30 per cent. The average price of a workstation thus fell by around 8 per cent to around Pounds 10,000. This trend is forecast to continue. Distributors and dealers talk of workstations turning, like personal computers, into a commodity market. HP's UK workstation marketing manager Mr Richard Owen disputes this, pointing out that workstations - unlike PCs - are still not fully standardised and still require more expertise than PCs both to assemble and to manage. But the distinction between PCs and workstations has certainly begun to blur. Prices overlap, with most PCs at Pounds 700-Pounds 4,000 and most workstations at Pounds 2,500-Pounds 12,000; and the user-friendliness of workstations now approaches that of PCs. Price/performance is one of the buyer's main criteria and advances by this measure are startling. The principal players leapfrog each other about every six to nine months. In selecting equipment, workstation users are often more discerning and demanding than PC users and will replace their systems more quickly - sometimes after only two years. Therefore the opportunity to sell a new model as the best available is short; and the cost of developing the next machine has to be strictly controlled to win a reasonable return on investment. The HP9000 Series 700 is generally thought to have had the advantage in price/performance over Sun's Sparcstations for some months, but Sun is expected to try to jump over HP again by late this year, according to Mr Per Andersen of market research firm IDC. While the battle is most fierce at the top end of the market for the prestige of having the fastest box, there is also a struggle at the low end, where HP and DEC are trying to shake Sun's dominant position. Most vendors have aimed to gain as big a market share as possible in the belief that this will attract software developers and thus ensure survival. Software availability is a more important criterion than price/performance for many users. The compatibility of workstations based on the UNIX standard is crucial to ensuring that software developers can port their programs to a new machine as soon as it is launched and thus benefit from the whole of its short lifecycle. All the main vendors have been trying to expand the market by taking the workstation from the technical into the commercial field. Here it is Sun which has so far had most success. Its strength in graphics and database management have been paramount. The vendors still need to find reasons why commercial users should want so much power. The answer will probably be to run complex new software which will become available in the next few years; for instance, multimedia applications. To run these will take not only a lot of power but more advanced graphics, networking and operating system capabilities. At this point many more users may decide to replace their PCs with workstations. IBM and Digital are striving to come from behind to threaten Sun and HP. Open systems purists have been sceptical about IBM'S Risc/6000 (until recently called the RS/6000) machine. Some regard it as not truly open on the grounds that the AIX operating system is an IBM proprietary version of UNIX rather than the industry standard. However, to many IBM customers this may not be any deterrent. IBM UK's AIX business unit manager, Mr Clive Parminter says its large customers are beginning to order Risc/60005 in volume. There are now several hundred software houses developing programs for the Risc/6000 and the company's Chiswick porting centre has a waiting list. The surge in sales of the Risc/6000 may be proving embarrassing for IBM, as it hoped to target the machine only at the technical sector. Instead, commercial users are adopting it rather than the AS/400 mid-range machine running proprietary software which IBM would prefer them to buy. Digital also has difficulties in the workstation market. It has been losing market share in UNIX systems for a couple of years. The company plans to overtake Sun and HP with its Alpha 64-bit chip, but it will be at least a year and maybe two before this makes any significant impact. Existing Sun users are unlikely to convert to HP, DEC or IBM in large numbers unless a wide margin in price/performance emerges. Few technical sites can afford to scrap their investment in technology or have the resources to cope with maintaining a multi-vendor environment. Therefore the battle of the vendors will be mainly for new users.</p>

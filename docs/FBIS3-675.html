Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] General Constand Viljoen  said the alliance will resume negotiations once the ANC [African  National Congress]-SACP [South African Communist Party] alliance  recognizes the sovereignty of Bophuthatswana. Johan Classen  reports:    [Begin recording] [Classen] General Viljoen held discussions  with President Mangope in Mbabatho earlier today, before the  decision was taken by the Freedom Alliance. He said the  situation in Bophuthatswana was totally unacceptable. He called  the violence total terrorism.    [Viljoen] Well, to start off, we don't rejoin the process.  And I think if that is the case, we must seriously in this  country start talking and considering partition of the country,  because if there is no way of finding a solution by  negotiations, to jointly stay and share this country, then we  must really start thinking about partition of the country.    [Classen] Gen. Viljoen predicted that the same situation  might develop in KwaZulu, and at a later stage in the Republic.  He also explained why military intervention, be it by the South  African Defense Force or the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance  Movement], was the wrong option. [end recording]</p>

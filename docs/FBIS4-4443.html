			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Letty Jimenez-Magsanoc] </F>   [Text] The military rebels are holding fast to their  "dreams." "Our dreams shall never die," renegade Lt. Col.  Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan said when asked to comment on the two  proclamations signed by President Ramos last Friday granting  general but conditional amnesty to communists, separatist  Muslims, and military coup plotters.    The "dream" consists of electoral reforms, reforms in the  military, nationalist economic policies, social justice  programs, and good government. "Not amnesty," said Honasan.    "It's a PR (public relations) program. The government knows  the rebels will not go for it. Amnesty at this point will not  solve the problem," he added. "Amnesty was never the issue. It  is skirting the issue. It ignores the root causes (of  rebellion).    "Giving amnesty shows a lack of understanding of the peace  process. The substantial portion of the peace talks is only  starting. Why is the government giving out its last card? It's  a sign of desperation."    Honasan's position contrasts with that of the president who  issued Proclamations 347 and 348 on general amnesty for all  rebel groups because, he declared "The time for talking is over.  The time to decide and act now has come."    The government peace panel is still in the process of  devising a mechanism for the peace talks proper after the  10-month tenure of the National Unification Commission (NUC)  which held preliminary talks with the military rebels.    The NUC headed by Haydee Yorac held talks with the military  insurgents from 1 September 1992 to 31 July 1993, at which time  the Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan [Revolutionary  Nationalist Alliance], Soldiers of the Filipino People, and the  Young Officers Union (RAM-SFP-YOU) presented to the Yorac panel  its dream package of reforms as their five talking points, and  they have since stuck to it.    "What was the whole point of the P11 [Philippine pesos]  million NUC exercise? It issued a five-inch thick report. What  happened to that report?" Honasan demanded.    RAM sources claimed the NUC report which has not been made  public recommended unconditional amnesty for the rightist  rebels. It drew up its report to submit to Mr. Ramos after  nationwide consultations with all sectors.    The president said the amnesty proclamations came after  almost two years of consultations with various sectors.    "We will not apply for amnesty," Lt. Col. Jake Malajacan  said  on behalf of the leaders of the RAM-SFP-YOU.    To be granted amnesty, rebels have to apply with the newly  formed National Amnesty Commission within six months of the  proclamation's effectivity starting when Congress concurs.    The INQUIRER learned that while the leaders of the  RAM-SFP-YOU reject the amnesty offer, they will "unofficially"  encourage their rank-and-file to avail themselves of it.    Ex-Capt. Danny Lim, YOU chairman and spokesman of the  RAM-SFP-YOU peace panel, said the government should seriously  address "the fundamental issues" that have beleaguered the  military.    "Amnesty is not even on the agenda," said Malajacan, member  of the military rebels' peace negotiating panel. "We are not  asking for it."    Proclamation 347 grants amnesty to all persons who in  pursuit  of political beliefs may have committed crimes punishable either  by the Revised Penal Code or special laws.    These crimes include rebellion, inciting to rebellion and  sedition, illegal assembly, resistance and disobedience to a  person in authority, unlawful use of means of publication, and  illegal possession of firearms.    Proclamation 348 grants amnesty to military and police  personnel who may have committed acts punishable under the  Revised Penal Code, the Articles of War, or special laws.    Not covered by the amnesty are crimes such as torture,  arson,  massacre, rape, and robbery.    Under both proclamations, an amnesty extinguishes any  criminal liability for acts committed by the grantee. But an  amnesty does not free him from any civil liability for injuries  or damages inflicted on a victim.    The amnesty restores the grantee's civil or political  rights.  The National Amnesty Commission shall be composed of a chairman  and three regular members to be named by the president; the  secretaries of justice, defense, and interior and local  government as ex-officio members.    The proclamation states that the surrender of firearms by  the  rebels is not a precondition for amnesty.</p>

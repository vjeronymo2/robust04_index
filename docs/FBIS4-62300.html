			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Oleg Kuzmin] </F>   [Text] Tehran, 14 May -- The main points on the agenda of  the talks that will be held by Kazakhstani Prime Minister Sergey  Tereshchenko, who arrived in the Iranian capital this morning on  an official three-day visit, will be questions of commercial and  economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and Iran. He is  accompanied by a delegation that includes the ministers of power  engineering and fuel resources, transport, the chairman of the  Chamber of Commerce, the chairman of the central bank, and  parliamentarians. It is intended that the Kazakhstani prime  minister will be received by Iranian President 'Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani.    Speaking on his arrival at Tehran's Mehrabad airport,  S.Tereshchenko stressed that "very close and friendly relations"  exist between Kazakhstan and Iran. He noted that a number of  basic documents on bilateral cooperation were signed during the  visits by the presidents of Kazakhstan and Iran to Tehran and  Almaty. Therefore, the main aim of the present visit is to step  up the work to implement the agreements that have been reached  already and to remove all obstacles in the way of stepping up  commercial and economic cooperation between the two countries.    Iranian First Vice President Hasan Habibi, who met  Tereshchenko, confirmed that the talks would focus on stepping  up the implementation of agreements signed earlier by the two  presidents, as well as on other accords.</p>

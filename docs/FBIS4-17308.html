			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Colonel Robert Bykov in the "Version" column: </F> "`Mobile Forces' in Russia. An Organization and Control Option"]    [Text] The deteriorating material and spiritual situation  of the Russian people is constantly threatening a sharp social  protest by the masses in various forms, including an explosion.    The authorities need a counterbalance. The OMON [Special  Purpose Police Force], the Spetsnaz [Special Forces], Internal  Affairs Ministry units -- these are like a sand damn against a  big river: effective for a short period and with small-scale  developments.    A more reliable barrier is needed, a new defense ring. This  ring could be so-called "mobile forces," to whose creation  Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev is devoting much time and  effort these days.    The 3-4 October 1993 events showed that the action against  the White House was actively supported only by a few prominent  generals. At the same time the General Staff -- apparently owing  to its unreliability -- was disconnected from lines of  communication with the city and troops for the entire period of  crisis.    It is known that an overwhelming majority of chief  commanders  and commanders at the Defense Ministry Collegium meeting did not  express their support for plans to use tanks to storm a civilian  installation. It can be assumed that many Russian officers in  the provinces, who have not received their monetary allowances  and food rations for two to three months, living with their  families in dismal apartments or wooden barracks, hardly  sympathized with those storming the White House. In the end the  victors themselves admitted that in October everything "was  hanging by a thread."    Was this not a reason why the possibility of employing armed  forces to accomplish internal missions was included in Russia's  new military doctrine? The concrete manifestation of this  provision can be seen in the structure and methods of organizing  the "mobile forces."    Nearly all combat-ready general-purpose divisions (brigades)  can be formed into a single fist directly subordinated to the  Russian president and defense minister. A special command and  control post is set up with independent communication and  automated control systems. (It is a good thing that they were  designed way back under the direction of the General Staff's 8th  Main Operations Directorate within the Warsaw Pact Joint Armed  Forces structure). The command and control post can well be  accommodated at the Moscow Military District's Signal Brigade.  In the Moscow area of Sokolniki there is a ready-made complex  of installations fit to station such a post. A "toy" of the  "nuclear briefcase" kind could be made for President Yeltsin,  creating the illusion of administering division command.    Airborne divisions will possibly be combined with military  transport aviation divisions (regiments); airborne assault  brigades (regiments), with helicopter units; marines, with  amphibious ships. All effectively combat-ready motorized  infantry divisions (currently one to two in a military district)  will be transferred from district operational command, to be  subsequently included into the "mobile forces." And of all this  will be commanded by a single, independent operational  directorate.    The entire "mobile force" structure will have uniform  command  and control signals corresponding to the main troop combat  employment orders. In accordance with manuals and combat  regulations (i.e., under Russian Federation laws), their  execution is compulsory for all units and formations.    At any moment, in any region of the country, in any branch  of  the Russian Federation Armed Forces, the situation will be under  the control of the person standing on top of the command and  control pyramid.</p>

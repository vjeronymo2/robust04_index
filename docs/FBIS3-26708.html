They also inspected the progress of the  Wanjiazhai project for diverting water from the Huang He. They  held forums with the provincial organs on market, prices, and  other issues. Chen Jinhua said that, with strategic foresight,  Shanxi has focused on infrastructural building in developing its  economy. It is indeed encouraging to see the vigor of the  people throughout the province in changing Shanxi's outlook.  Shanxi also had sound judgment in mobilizing the whole province  to develop "Project Hope." We have the responsibility to show  our concern and give assistance.    Chen Jinhua, minister of the State Planning Commission,  arrived in Taiyuan on 20 January with comrades responsible for  the Agricultural Department, Transportation Department, and  Investment Department under the State Planning Commission.  After listening to an account given by the Shanxi Planning  Committee and the Wanjiazhai project headquarters on diverting  water from the Huang He, they inspected some large- and  medium-size enterprises, including the Shanxi Textile Mill and  Taiyuan Heavy Machine Plant. From 21 to 24 January, Chen  Jinhua, Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng went to conduct investigation  and study in Ningwu, Shuzhou, Pianguan, Baode, Shenchi, and  Xinzhou and inspect the progress of the Wanjiazhai project for  diverting water from the Huang He. Then they went to the  Taiyuan Iron and Steel Complex and the Mining Machine-Building  Plant to conduct investigation and study. They also inspected  the expansion project for the Taiyuan Airport and the Taiyuan  Railway Station. Chen Jinhua, Hu Fuguo, and Sun Wensheng  examined in detail the key water diversion project and culvert  and walked into the tunnel, which was still under construction,  to perform a quality check. They extended their greetings to  officials and construction workers involved in the project.  Chen Jinhua pointed out: The project for diverting water from  the Huang He to the Shanxi is a great event. As Shanxi is the  country's base for energy, heavy industry, and chemical  industry, the water diversion project has attracted nationwide  attention. He affirmed that, as always, the State Planning  Commission will show concern for and support the project.  Construction has started for the key project, main canal, and  north trunk. The State Planning Commission will take concerted  action to ensure that the project is completed on time and will  deliver water to Taiyuan in 1998.    Chen Jinhua said that, under the leadership of the  provincial  party committee and government, the people of the entire  province are enthusiastic about changing Shanxi's outlook. I am  encouraged about the good and valuable things that I have  personally seen. Li Shuangliang's [Shanxi deputy to the 8th  National People's Congress] method of handling the province's  problem of accumulated spent coal is unique nationwide, and this  spirit of transforming the country's outlook is valuable. In my  view, the strategy of Shanxi's economic development conforms to  the spirit of the 14th Party Congress, is based on the current  situation and focused on the 21st century, and is based on  Shanxi while having the country and the world in mind. You have  promoted current economic growth and accumulated staying power  for further development, which will play a great role in  upgrading Shanxi's economy in the 1990's and will create  conditions for development in the next century. The efforts  made by the provincial party committee and government to step up  infrastructure building are farsighted. Chen Jinhua made the  following three proposals for Shanxi's economic development:  First, as Shanxi has favorable conditions for its economic  development, structural readjustment, and optimized distribution  of resources, I hope that you can introduce bold reforms in  ownership and accelerate the development of collective and  township enterprises. Second, it is necessary to update the  concept of proportional relations between heavy industry and  light industry and let heavy and light industries complement  each other. Third, regarding projects included in the Eighth  Five-Year Plan, it is necessary to concentrate forces to  implement the plan, make efforts to check inflation, and prevent  investment in capital construction from exceeding general supply.    Chen Jinhua called for doing well the following work  regarding market and prices: First, take note of maintaining  the overall balance and never let the difference between general  supply and demand exceed 5 percent. Second, attach importance  to agriculture and the "vegetable basket" project, protect the  interests of the broad masses of the people, and guarantee  social stability. Third, it is necessary to properly handle the  extent of price reform and the timing of introducing reform  packages. Fourth, offer correct media guidance for forecasting  the inclination of the masses. Fifth, in management over  prices, it is necessary to combine government interference with  mass supervision and strengthen price work. He emphasized that  relations among reform, development, and stability should be  properly handled.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The government and URNG [Guatemalan National  Revolutionary Unity] delegations meeting in Olso to discuss  issues related to the creation of a Truth Commission or  mechanisms to clear up the past, agreed to extend negotiations  for four more days, as suggested by the Norwegian Government, to  reach an agreement to prevent the peace process from falling  apart.    Guerrilla Commander Rolando Moran said there are still  several issues to be discussed with the government's peace  commission, which is the reason both sides agreed to remain in  Oslo where this new round of negotiations began last Monday.    He added that there is openness with respect to an  issue that has been under discussion since last year, but it is  very difficult and problematic. The main challenge is to reach  the end of the process with a political solution to the armed  conflict that will not exclude an investigation into war crimes,  because these crimes are part of the country's reality.    Meanwhile, Hector Rosada, president of the government's  Peace  Commission (COPAZ), commented that there has been  substantial progress, leading us to believe that there will be  an agreement. He also stressed that the government does not  fear confronting the truth. It is necessary for us to confront  the past in order to brave the future. However, the greatest  problem lies in doing what is right and that whatever is agreed  upon has a political reality in the short run.    Even though the negotiations are currently in the most  difficult stage, Jan Egeland, secretary of state of the  Norwegian Foreign Affairs Ministry who is participating in the  negotiations, believes that if they do not continue  discussing the issue, the entire peace process will be jeopardy.  It is for this reason that Norway has the moral obligation to  ensure that all possible instruments leading to an agreement may  be at the disposal of all parties, because these are practical  and significant problems.    In addition, it was learned that there is a rough draft of a  document presented by the UN regarding the makeup of the  investigative commission. In addition, there is another  recommendation presented by the Guatemalan civilian sector that  includes Argentine Nobel Peace laureate Adolfo Perez Esquivel.  This proposal was rejected by the government delegation because  they believe Perez Esquivel is too politicized.    Before the beginning of the talks, which were originally  scheduled to conclude yesterday, the host country was too  optimistic. Despite the fact that there is still no agreement  with respect to the Truth Commission, they underscored progress  made in the negotiations by pointing out the agreement signed on  Friday concerning the relocation of people uprooted as result of  the armed conflict.</p>

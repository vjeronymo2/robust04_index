			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Sheikh Khalid Balala [former Islamic Party oF  Kenya, IPK, activist who resigned from IPK in October 1993]  yesterday threatened to call a nationwide strike of schools and  colleges if Secretary-General Abdulraham Wandati of the Islamic  Party of Kenya and the chairman of the Universities Academic  Staff Union, Dr Korwa Adar, are not released unconditionally.  Sheikh Balala told the government that by arresting innocent  people it was inviting anarchy. He said he would organize the  preparation and distribution of one million leaflets instigating  a national strike of all institutions of learning if the two men  were not released within a week. The leaflets, he said, will  start circulating in Nairobi, and then spread to all parts of  the country. The strike itself will start next Monday.    Mr. Wandati was arrested last week in Lugari [western Kenya]  at a FORD [Forum for the Restoration of Democracy] Kenya  campaign rally allegedly over statements he had made earlier.    Dr Adar was picked up by police from his Spring Valley  residence on Friday night. [passage omitted]</p>

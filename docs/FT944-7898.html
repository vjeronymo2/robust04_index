			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Wall St plunges 91 points on rate rise fears US share prices fell more than 90 points yesterday amid fears that US interest rates would have to rise further to head off inflationary pressures. Wall Street saw frantic trading as investors rushed to sell stocks, worried that increases in rates would depress the growth of the economy and corporate earnings. Last week, the Federal Reserve, the central bank, increased the federal funds rate by three-quarters of a percentage point to 5.5 per cent, but analysts are not convinced the Fed has done enough to head off inflationary pressures. Equity markets in Asia and Europe also fell yesterday. And early today markets in the Far East opened sharply lower in the wake of Wall Street's steep fall. Tokyo was closed for a holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 91.52 at 3,677.99, its lowest level in almost five months and its largest one-day fall since February 4, when the Fed made the first of six interest rate increases intended to slow economic growth. Since Monday, the Dow has fallen almost 140 points, or 3.6 per cent. Traders said most of yesterday's selling was concentrated in the stocks of companies whose earnings are closely tied to the economic cycle. Mr Thomas McManus, an equity market strategist at securities firm Morgan Stanley, said the market was finally realising that the Fed was likely to succeed in cooling the economy. He said broad declines in Morgan Stanley's index of cyclical stocks since October 28 indicated there would be a further correction in the market. Yesterday, the firm recommended institutional clients to reduce their stockholdings and put more money into 'cash' assets such as short-term government securities. It is the latest big Wall Street firm to advise clients to cut US stockholdings, a trend which has contributed to the recent losses. Most Wall Street analysts, however, do not believe that the market is slipping into a freefall. Mr Bill Dodge, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Securities, said: 'The big question now is: Is this the start of a big sell off? I think we're already most of the way through it.' Asian and European markets, were depressed yesterday by Monday's 45 point fall in the Dow. The FT-SE 100 index dropped 42.3 points to 3,078.7. Most European bourses declined by about 1 per cent, with the exception of Italy, where the Mibtel index dropped 2.8 per cent on the news that magistrates had warned Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, that he faced questioning about bribery allegations. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 average fell below 19,000 for the first time since February. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index dropped 3.8 per cent.

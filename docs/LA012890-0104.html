			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHEN POLITICS COME TO PUSH &amp; SHOVE;  </P> <P> REPUBLICANS: GEORGE BUSH SURFBOARDS OVER ISSUES BUT DEMOCRATS COULD RIDE THE  WAVES OF CHANGE -- ON TAXES, ABORTION AND TUSSLES IN WORLD TRADE.  </P> <P> Yes, George Bush has achieved record 70%-80% favorable poll ratings while  surfboarding on international events and opportunities from Eastern Europe to  Panama. Yet not a few Republicans worry that these glories are only a flimsy  facade behind which important political dangers fester.  </P> <P> The harsh reality is that few Presidents have made a success out of four years  without a significant national agenda, and Bush's domestic policy -- unless  bold blueprints for Wednesday's State of the Union address have been cleverly  hidden -- is the strategic equivalent of a nudist colony. The political  dilemma, bluntly put, is that even if the President can keep his personal  ratings reasonably high, long-term ideological trends are going soft.  </P> <P> Three especially dangerous waves for the Administration and the GOP already  begin to surge: a rising libertarianism on abortion, a new Social  Security-related tax revolt in Middle America and indications that economic  nationalism could replace Caribbean gunboat diplomacy as the voter-desired  jingoism of the 1990s.  </P> <P> All three developments, moreover, involve major GOP intraparty policy conflicts  and strike at underlying cultural, economic and patriotic pillars of the  Republic presidential majority that began taking shape more than two decades  ago. These changes cannot be staved off with happy talk or clever tactics; they  represent something more profound: the increasing obsolescence and exhaustion  of yesteryear's fine-for-1973 and good-for-1981 GOP national-policy solutions.  </P> <P> Abortion, of course, keynotes the cultural turnabout. Along with support for  the death penalty and opposition to school busing, right-to-life commitment  became a bold banner of late 1970s conservatism. After the U.S. Supreme Court  legalized abortion in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, conservative politicians  and national GOP platforms could posture for right-to-life backers -- and did  -- while the party's pro-choice upper-class professionals and career women  yawned. Opposition to abortion became one of three or four cultural issues  shaping new Republican voting patterns from Catholic South Boston to Baptist  North Louisiana.  </P> <P> Until 1989, that is. By reopening abortion to state-level decision-making, the  Supreme Court Webster ruling drove a legal wedge into the conservative  coalition that united Tennessee fundamentalists with suburban Planned  Parenthood voters. As of 1990, GOP gubernatorial contenders are fighting  fierce, divisive primaries over abortion in key states from Massachusetts to  Texas. Church-going true-believers and upper-bracket sophisticates -- at each  other's sides during the 1980s -- are now at each other's throats. The close  collaboration of conservative politics and religion, begun in the 1970s, now  seems in decline. Jerry Falwell has had to demobilize his Moral Majority and  homosexual Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) may even win reelection in suburban  Massachusetts, despite letting a male prostitute operate out of his Washington  apartment. For the first time since 1964, cultural issues have begun to divide  Republicans as much as Democrats.  </P> <P> On the economic front, staunch conservatives and Republicans cemented a 1980s  hold on Middle America by suppressing inflation and cutting taxes, two  achievements now in some dispute. Inflation shows periodic signs of heating up  again, and a New York Democrat has an electrifying proposal to cut Social  Security taxes by $55 billion next year: Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has  launched a debate that could wind up educating and even embittering voters over  who got the tax cuts of the 1980s and who didn't.  </P> <P> In a nutshell, Middle America got the speeches; upper America got the bucks.  For most families, the big tax changes of the 1980s didn't come in modest  federal income-tax cuts -- they came in a Social Security tax rate surging from  5.8% in 1980 to 7.65% in 1990, while the income base it applied to doubled from  $25,900 to $51,300. A family with one-breadwinner income constant at $50,000  during that period would have seen its Social Security burden swell from $1,500  a year to $3,800. Some "tax-cut decade."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, however, the top tax bracket for millionaires did come down from 70%  in 1981 to 28% in 1988, setting up a stunning comparison. Consider a family  with husband-and-wife breadwinners each making $50,000 a year in salary. For  income taxes, their combined salaries put them in the 33% rate  upper-middle-class "bubble," and both their incomes are fully taxable for  Social Security at 7.65%. That means a combined federal marginal tax rate of  41%, far above the marginal tax rate of 28% paid by billionaires like David  Rockefeller or Michael Milken.  </P> <P> Not surprisingly, income and wealth shifted upward. Congressional Budget Office  numbers show 7.2% of total national income in the hands of the top 1% of  Americans back in 1977; now that same top 1% will have 11.4% of the 1990 total.  Should this comparison arouse middle-class voters, the Republicans could lose  their 1980s position as the party of tax cuts -- and regain their old New  Deal-era opprobrium as the party principally loyal to the rich.  </P> <P> Tricky transition No. 3 involves foreign policy. Republicans can no longer  count on the "we're better at dealing with the Soviets" argument, despite its  important GOP vote-getting role since the Eisenhower-Nixon years. Public  opinion's new preoccupation, by a large majority, is to consider U.S. interests  more gravely threatened by Japanese economic, financial and trade strength --  brought to critical mass by policy miscues under Ronald Reagan -- than by any  military threat from Moscow. And this same psychology lays out the new  international playing field where American voters want a game plan to recover  the U.S. economic clout and wealth lost to Japan.  </P> <P> With two recent polls showing 60%-70% of Americans glooming that Japan has  already overtaken the United States as the world's leading economic power,  1990s politics are bound to be affected. After the United States was defeated  in Vietnam 15 years ago, frustrated American voters slowly but surely embraced  military and diplomatic nationalism -- even jingoism -- over the Panama Canal  treaties in 1977, the Iranian seizure of U.S. Embassy personnel as hostages in  1980. The public applauded the invasion of Grenada in 1983, the air-strike  against Tripoli in 1986 and the recent invasion of Panama. Each machismo  episode underscored Democratic weakness or GOP strength -- or both.  </P> <P> Now, however, as voter concern refocuses on the United States' increasing  commercial and financial displacement by Japan -- cumulatively a more important  defeat than Vietnam -- electoral results may reflect that same frustration. And  if tough talk on trade and money starts replacing military saber-rattling,  domestic politics would change, too. The applause for air strikes and Caribbean  invasions once epitomized a popular reaction against long-standing Democartic  weaknesses and liberal inability to apply military power. Economic nationalism,  by contrast, would draw on voter disenchantment with the Reagan-Bush era  slippage caused by White House unwillingness to apply economic power or to  interfere with market forces in behalf of protecting U.S. national interests.  </P> <P> All three situations could -- none of this is yet certain -- signal a  metamorphosis of Republican-tilted issues and popular frustrations into  pro-Democratic circumstances.  </P> <P> The longer the Republicans control the presidency, after all, the more  troubling situations and national difficulties will have developed when the GOP  held the nation's helm. Even Democrats will begin to see more and more  opportunities for criticism and attack.  </P> <P> For the moment, as his high ratings bear witness, Bush is successfully managing  the transformation -- in part by ignoring it, and in part by playing a string  of yesterday's trumps. He has used gunboat diplomacy, anti-crime rhetoric and  drug-control bombast. But they will not be enough. The real test -- first, in  Bush's Wednesday State of the Union message, and then in his follow-up actions  -- is whether the President can seriously address three incipient mood-shifts  and role-reversals that threaten to rescript U.S. politics and ideology in the  1990s.  </P></p>

A succession of civil conflicts, an orgy of crime,  and political instability are calling in question the very  existence of the unified independent state. The living standard  has fallen as far as it can: with a subsistence minimum of 4  million coupons, the actual minimum wage constitutes 50,000; 97  percent of the population is living below the poverty line, and  for a long time the basic foodstuffs have for the majority been  bread and tea. The orgy of crime is making everyday life  unbearable, and almost every male aged between 16 and 60 has a  gun. The Georgian government is making desperate attempts to  push back the impending chaos, but the ambitions of the leaders  of the opposition, the division of society, the clan  contradictions, and the domination of the mafia groups are  making any constructive work inordinately difficult.    In the opinion of Vakhtang Rcheushvili, vice speaker of  parliament, it is essential that the republic, in order to cope  with the crisis, define its foreign policy reference points,  strive for economic stabilization, and curb the violence.  Membership of the CIS and a return to the orbit of Russian  influence could contribute to the accomplishment of these tasks  to some extent, unless the mere fact of them serves to intensify  the division of society. The opposition in Georgia is composed  of parties whose existence--in the apt observation of  parliamentary deputy G. Lordkipanidze--"becomes totally  meaningless without the `Down With Russia' slogan." A  characteristic example of such nationalist propaganda is  afforded by the recent appeal to the Georgian people of the  National Independent Party, which makes demands for the  "de-occupation" of Georgia, the immediate resignation of  Shevardnadze and his ministers, and the creation of a coalition  government of "pro-West, anti-Russian, national, and  democratic forces" and also proclaims that "the elections held  in Russia showed Moscow's true colors," that Russia cannot be a  democratic state, and that "anyone who supports Georgia's  integration in the CIS or, in any form, Georgia's continuation  in the sphere of influence of Russiashould be declared an  enemy of state interests and the Georgian nation."    Nor, equally, in the Georgian government, meanwhile, is  there  any unity on questions of the expediency of participation in the  work of the structures of the Commonwealth. In the course of the  December conflict between Security Minister Igor Giorgadze and  Defense Minister Georgiy Karkarashvili--a conflict which once  again brought Georgia to the brink of civil war--Giorgadze  accused Karkarashvili, specifically, of having thwarted the  negotiations on a defense alliance in Ashgabat. The fact that  both ministers were until recently still in office (a statement  of Georgiy Karkarashvili, in which he announces his resignation,  was carried in the Georgian press on 1 February) testifies that  the most varied approaches to the problem of Georgia's  introduction to the CIS are represented in the highest echelons  of power (Giorgadze and Karkarashvili represent particular clans  and groups, of course, but Georgia's situation is such that each  group has integral interests and, correspondingly, integral  notions concerning the political program).    Serious problems for Shevardnadze are being created also by  the "special position" of the National Democratic Party of  Georgia [NDPGr], which has the largest party parliamentary  faction. At the Sixth National Democratic Party of Georgia  Congress at the end of December 1993, membership of the CIS was  seen as an "abdication of responsibility for Georgia's future,"  and addressing a meeting of the Europarliament, Gia Chanturia,  the chairman of the party and well-known Georgian dissident,  called for a weakening of Russia's influence in the republics of  the former USSR and predicted for Georgia the role of some  bridge between East and West. Evaluating the results of  Shevardnadze's course as a failure in all spheres of foreign and  domestic policy, the national democrats, who have supported the  head of state since his return to Georgia, advocated a change of  government and parliamentary elections no later than the spring  of 1994. Chanturia declared that withdrawal from the government  and the objections in principle to the policy of the authorities  do not signify the NDPGr's switch to the opposition, but this  does not make it any easier for Shevardnadze since he is  deprived of the support of a most influential political party.  In addition, certain prominent figures who performed leading  roles in Georgia in 1992-1993, Tengiz Sigua, for example, have  also opposed membership of the CIS. There is quite a banal  paradox: easing the political opposition is possible only to the  detriment of practical interests.    The bitter nature of the polemic surrounding  Georgian-Russian  relations is largely connected with another most acute  question--the problem of the republic's territorial integrity.  The position of Russia (or of certain circles in Russia) at the  time of the Abkhaz war was taken very hard in Georgia, and the  conflict surrounding South Ossetia equally affects the very  essence of relations between the two countries, but the greatest  significance is attached to the situation in Ajaria, Georgia's  sole autonomy, where peace and a certain stability have been  preserved amid the Georgian disturbances. Aslan Abashidze,  chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Ajaria, has said repeatedly  that he cannot conceive of a Georgia outside of an alliance with  Russia, and people from the ranks of those closest to him make  no secret of the fact that relations between Moscow and Batumi  will intensify and strengthen regardless of the positions of the  central leadership in Tbilisi. The leaders of Georgia's national  radicals are inclined to see in Abashidze's firmness the "hand  of Moscow" and are exploiting in every possible way the theme of  a repetition of the "Abkhaz scenario" in Ajaria, but, and this  is typical of the current situation in Georgia, they are by no  means endeavoring to look for a compromise and reconsider their  views for the sake of civil peace and the unity of the country.    Zurab Zhvania, chairman of the Green Party, just about the  most serious independent politician and a decisive supporter of  Shevardnadze's policy, once observed: "Georgia's tragedy is that  the political confrontation is unfolding against the background  of the struggle of mafia clans, an unprecedented flowering of  corruption, and the domination of consumerism in all walks of  life, that is, a total crisis of the civil society." A revival  of the healthy self-awareness of the nation, the restoration of  a normal moral climate, and a simplification of the political  situation are becoming most important tasks, which (however  utopian this may be for spiritual questions) have to be tackled  by political methods. It is possible that the formation of the  Georgian Citizens' Union (SGG), a new grassroots  organization founded in December 1993 by several of the  country's top politicians for the purpose of erecting a barrier  in the way of petty political demagogy and ensuring support for  constructive constitutional, economic, and cultural work, will  contribute to a certain brightening of the situation.    The idea of the need for a large association which could  assume responsibility for the country's future was first  expressed a year ago by David Berdzenishvili, a leader of the  Republican Party, but Shevardnadze showed no enthusiasm for such  projects throughout 1993. Only after the arguments about  Georgia's membership of the CIS had shown that the search for  concord among politicians was doomed to fail did the head of  state consent to head the Citizens' Union. "At this critical  time," Georgiy Baramidze, a member of parliament from the Greens  and deputy chairman of the SGG, declared, "the best part of  Georgia's political spectrum has resolved to unite around a man  personifying a specific policy," whose authority "was a  tremendous stimulus to the consolidation of all constructive  forces of Georgian society." The cementing role in the Citizens'  Union was performed by the Green Party, whose leader  simultaneously holds the position of vice president of the  European Green Association, and also the Party of Peace and  Freedom (Afghan veterans), whose chairman, Nodar Giorgadze,  former instructor of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth  League Central Committee, who was responsible in Kabul for ties  to Afghan youth, retains his decisive influence on the  organizations of Afghan war veterans in Georgia (11,000  persons), and also the Tbilisi Citizens' Union (the Tbiliso  Society), which rendered Shevardnadze decisive support in the  critical fall days of 1993.    The creation of the Citizens' Union has evoked harsh  opposition criticism: Nodar Notadze, leader of the People's  Front, called the new organization "red-brown" and claimed that  its very existence is a threat to the foundations of Georgian  democracy. I. Tsereteli, chairman of the National Independence  Party, accused the Union's activists of a "betrayal of the  interests of the motherland" and so forth. Georgiy Baramidze,  deputy chairman of the SGG, treats such philippics with  composure. He is convinced that only a large all-Georgia  organization arranged along territorial lines is capable of  universal constructive activity and can serve as a model of the  future Georgian society; Baramidze surmised that the hour when  Georgia once again values not an ability to shoot from an  automatic weapon or juggle slogans but an ability to work with  people is not far off.    The political situation in many republics of the former  USSR,  in the Transcaucasus and Central Asia primarily, confirms once  again the old idea that public institutions and power structures  that are optimal for European countries with a stable political  culture could prove disastrous or ineffective for states that  are experiencing an entirely different inheritance. Eduard  Shevardnadze, the head of Georgia, is attempting to find ways of  reining in the chaos without resorting to dictatorship here and  without abandoning the gains of democracy, but he is constantly  encountering difficulties connected with the moral state of  society. Under these conditions only a policy capable of  ensuring a synthesis of national tradition and the experience of  the Soviet period and the mechanisms of government and values of  the end of the 20th century could guarantee a way out of the  crises.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the self-regulatory organization (``SRO'') charged with primary oversight of municipal securities dealers' activities, the MSRB has proposed a series of measures designed to prevent ``pay to play'' practices in the awarding of municipal securities business. These measures include a prohibition against municipal securities dealers, conducting certain types of municipal securities business with an issuer if the dealer or affiliated persons, subject to exceptions, made political contributions to officials of the issuer who could influence the awarding of that business. The measures also include separate provisions requiring municipal securities dealers to maintain records and to disclose aggregate information to facilitate compliance and examinations with the goal of promoting investor confidence in the integrity of the municipal securities market. As discussed below, the Commission believes that the proposal is consistent with the Act and will advance the goals of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The market for municipal securities is characterized by great diversity and high volume and comprises an estimated 50,000 issuers including state governments, cities, towns, counties, and special subdivisions, such as special purpose districts and public authorities. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  There are approximately 1.3 million municipal securities issues outstanding, representing over $1.2 trillion in securities. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  In 1993, 17,000 new issues took place with a record value of $335 billion. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  As discussed below, negotiated underwritings have become the predominate method of underwriter selection. The MSRB's proposal is designed to address abuses involving political contributions inherent in using negotiated underwriting as a method of underwriter selection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities and Exchange Commission, Division of Market Regulation,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Staff Report on the Municipal Securities Market, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (September 1993) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Municipal Securities Report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> '') at 1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Flow of Funds Accounts, supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  note 6. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This record financing was heavily influenced by refundings. Nevertheless, the level of long term new money financing, representing 49% of the financing for the year, reflected continued market growth. In 1993, there were $142 billion of new money long term financings, compared to $81 billion in 1988, a 75% increase. ``A decade of Municipal Finance,''  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> The Bond Buyer <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  (Jan. 6, 1994) at 24.

Increasing Use of Negotiated Underwritings <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The types of securities generally issued by municipalities include general obligation bonds (secured by the full faith and credit and general taxing power of the issuer), revenue bonds (secured by the revenues of a particular project), and conduit bonds (securities issued to finance a project that is to be used in the trade or business of a third party, typically a private corporation or non-profit entity). At one time general obligation bonds were most prevalent. Today, however, most offerings consist of revenue bonds. During the past few years, the municipal bond market also has experienced a proliferation of complex derivative products. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Among these are principal and interest strips, pooled municipal investment vehicles, detachable call options, and new variable rate securities. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

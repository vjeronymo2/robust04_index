			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Power companies cautious on VAT BRITAIN'S electricity companies have warned ministers that the imposition of value added tax on domestic fuel bills will lead to a sharp rise in disconnections. They are pressing for 'further' financial help for customers with low incomes. They have also advised the government that the VAT changes, due to be implemented in April, will increase bills by more than the tax element because of costs associated with a significant increase in bad debts. The industry's concerns are expressed in a private letter to Mr Kenneth Clarke, chancellor, and other ministers by the Electricity Association, which represents the UK's 20 largest power companies. The letter is an unusual foray into the political arena and reflects industry fears that the consequences of VAT will be far more severe than ministers acknowledge. Electricity company anxieties have increased following speculation that the chancellor will impose the full 17.5 per cent tax in April, rather than 8 per cent then and the rest the following year as previously announced. The association's letter will add weight to the campaign by some Tory backbenchers for the VAT plans be scrapped or for relief for less well-off consumers to be increased. In the letter, Mr Roger Young, the association president, warns that the imposition of VAT will reverse the trend of falling prices and disconnections set in motion by privatisation three years ago. The letter says 'One possible complication will be refusal by some customers to pay the specific VAT elements of their bills. After the normal counselling process, this will lead to our member companies using their powers to disconnect supply to obtain full payments from customers.' Mr Young, chief executive of Scottish Hydro-Electric, says companies are also concerned about additional account collection workload and costs 'which will flow through to all our customers'. Yorkshire Electricity estimates at Pounds 6m the cost of installing token meters likely to be needed to help customers with difficulties paying VAT-inflated bills, says Mr Young. The company estimates that an additional 75,000 will experience difficulties, around 80 per cent of whom will need a token meter at a cost to the company of Pounds 100 each. 'Against this background the steps the government takes to protect the position of customers on low incomes are of key importance and we would urge you to provide further help to them in the best way you can.' If the estimates of Yorkshire, one of 15 regional distribution companies, are typical and correct, more than 1m power consumers would experience payment difficulties and the cost of metering would be more than Pounds 90m. The letter says that since privatisation three years ago the number of disconnections for non-payment of bills has fallen by 84 per cent. Domestic electricity bills have fallen 4 per cent in real terms between 1985 and 1993.</p>

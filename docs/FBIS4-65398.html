			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Warnemuende (DDP/ADN) -- Despite the savings in  the Bundeswehr budget, there will not be any reduction in troops  in the states of former East Germany nor will any investment  plans be dropped. This was stated by Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe on the sidelines of a sitting of the Bundesrat defense  committee in Warnemuende on Monday [16 May]. Contracts  totalling almost a billion marks will be awarded to the  construction industry this year for the seven large-scale  Bundeswehr projects in eastern Germany, including establishing a  marine technology academy in Parow near Stralsund and the  planned move of the marine office to Warnemuende.    Ruehe also announced that troop numbers would be increased  according to plans in the east, increasing from the present  19,200 to 23,000 soldiers and almost 7,000 civilian employees.  The figure of 20,000, by which the Bundeswehr is to be cut over  the next few years, will mainly be saved in the states of the  former West Germany, the defense minister said. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview to Radio Liberty, Ukrainian  President Leonid Kravchuk announced his final decision not to  participate in the next presidential campaign. The newspaper  DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA published today an excerpt from this  interview. In short, the president explains his decision as  follows. The election to the Supreme Council will definitely  drag out and be held in two rounds. Then, no sooner a new  parliament gets a chance to work than the presidential election  will follow. It hardly makes sense to do this in such a short  time. Second, in Leonid Kravchuk's opinion, participation in  the elections would mean that he justifies the present economic  and social situation. Third, the president believes that other  candidates for this post do not direct all of their efforts at a  constructive program, but at proving that he failed to perform  his duties.    To be perfectly honest, the declaration by Leonid Makarovych  Kravchuk came as a surprise, if only because we learned about  the decision of the president, who was elected by all the  people, not from a national source but from the foreign media.  Although we learned from the sources close to the president  that he retains his point of view, one cannot rid oneself of  doubts regarding the reasoning of Leonid Makarovych. He does  not want to exacerbate the political situation by his  participation in the elections. But will his lack of  participation not produce exactly this kind of result? Can one  perceive the participation of Leonid Makarovych in the elections  as his protection of the present complex economic and social  situation? Perhaps on the contrary, is it not his lack of  participation that will rather testify to the incorrectness of  the previous course?    Finally, his third point about criticism of the president on  the part of his rivals in the campaign. Can one ever imagine an  election race without this in any democratic country? In one  word, the decision by Leonid Makarovych Kravchuk not to  participate in the next elections for the Ukrainian president  contains more questions than answers.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, May 8, IRNA -- Majles speaker 'Ali Akbar  Nateq-Nuri Sunday [8 May] lambasted the signing of the  Gaza-Jericho agreement between the Zionist regime and the  Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) last Wednesday and  stressed that the Palestinian nation would not give in to  abjection.    Speaking at the open sessison of the Islamic consultative  assembly (majles), he termed the compromising trend of talks  between Yasir 'Arafat and the Zionist regime as well as the  signing of the Gaza-Jericho compromise deal as gradual  humiliation of the PLO leaders and a bitter and regrettable  development for the world of Islam and the muslims.    "It is crystal clear that the heroic nation of Palestine  will  continue their fight against occupiers of al-Quds and repulse  the usurpers from al-Quds to materialize the divine promises,"  he stressed.    Turning to the victory of the African National congress in  the all-race presidential elections in South Africa, Nateq-Nuri  described it as a great and sweet event for all nations  especially for the people of South Africa.    Congratulating the ANC leader Nelson Mandela and the South  African nation on the victory, he expressed hope that Iran and  South African relations would expand in all fields.</p>

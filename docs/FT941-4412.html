			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / Sizewell computer queried Scientists advising local authorities over the safety of the proposed Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk are not convinced of the reliability of an important computer system. The prototype system is designed to monitor all reactor functions and give early warning of any fault. The scientists, led by Professor Tony Goddard of Imperial College, London, are recommending that an assurance is obtained from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate that the system will not be approved until reliability tests are validated. The system, developed by Westinghouse of the US, is already being installed in Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised water reactor nuclear power station, although the inspectorate has yet to give it final clearance. Inspectors have indicated that they may be able to issue a licence within the next few months. However, they are still awaiting further submissions from Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator which is building the Pounds 2.03bn B station. and wants to proceed with a Pounds 3.5bn twin-reactor C plant. Members of the British Computer Society have previously expressed concern about the complexity of the computer system. Prof Goddard's team is also recommending that local councils seek clarification from Nuclear Electric on the amount of spent uranium fuel to be stored at Sizewell.</p>

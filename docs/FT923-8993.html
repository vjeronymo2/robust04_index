			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / New broom sweeps the decks: The scale of restructuring by BP's new chief executive has surprised analysts Only six weeks after jettisoning its chairman and chief executive Mr Robert Horton, BP yesterday surprised the City again by unveiling an aggressive programme to yank the company back on to a profitable path. As the company announced its second-quarter results, new chief executive Mr David Simon bit the bullet. He halved the dividend to 2.1p, wrote off Pounds 1bn of restructuring costs and assets and promised to axe 10 per cent of the remaining workforce. The widely-expected dividend cut was a reversal of his predecessor's policy of maintaining the dividend at all costs - one of the main issues over which Mr Horton is believed to have clashed with BP's board. The rest of the programme was Hortonesque. Mr Simon said BP would concentrate on its core businesses of exploration and production, refining and marketing, and petrochemicals. He confirmed that it was seeking to sell its nutrition arm, reclassified as 'non-core' earlier this year. The pace, however, has been quickened. BP has raised its target for cost savings from Dollars 750m (Pounds 393m) a year to Dollars 1bn a year by 1994  -entailing 11,500 job losses - and set a target of earning Dollars 2bn a year in net replacement cost profits within three years. Otherwise, the programme was the same as that outlined to analysts by Mr Steve Ahearne, chief financial officer, days after the boardroom coup which removed Mr Horton. It entails reducing capital expenditure by 25 per cent to Dollars 5bn in both of the next two years, and speeding up the assets divestments, with a target of between Dollars 1.5bn and Dollars 2bn this year and in 1993. Mr Ahearne said yesterday this would enable BP to start paying off its Dollars 16bn debts at the rate of Dollars 1bn annually from next year. The real surprise was that BP had plumped to take the Pounds 1bn restructuring and write-down charge for all this as a one-off hit. Taken as an exceptional item, this transformed a Pounds 107m profit on a replacement cost basis - slightly better than expected - into an unprecedented Pounds 812m loss. 'BP has decided to take all the pain of the redundancy costs in one go, and to write down the values of the assets for when they don't sell them for what they are worth,' said Mr Alan Sinclair, analyst with Smith New Court, the London brokers. Some Pounds 472m of the charge is to cover redundancy costs - 11,500 jobs are to be lost from a workforce which has already been cut by more than 8,000 since the appointment of Mr Horton in 1990. About 1,500 jobs will go in the UK, mainly from the research and engineering divisions, for an expected saving of Dollars 180m a year. The rest of the jobs will be in European and US operations. The other Pounds 544m is asset write-downs, to cover the expected losses associated with BP's disposal programme. The charge is spread across BP's businesses, including Pounds 175m from exploration and production; Pounds 351m from refining and marketing; Pounds 185m from chemicals; Pounds 101m from nutrition; and Pounds 204m from corporate and other businesses. However, the importance of the dividend cut, which will save the company about Pounds 450m a year, should also not be underestimated. Mr Simon said the dividend was now rebased to a level which allowed for sustainable growth. It was set to be covered by cash flow, and did not rely on the success of the divestment programme. The cut was broadly in line with expectations, although some analysts had suggested a cut of 33 per cent or 40 per cent would have been sufficient. Analysts also said they believed the medium-term financial programme was a prudent one, although there was concern over whether BP would be able to achieve the scale of assets disposals it was planning in a difficult market conditions. 'I think they are definitely moving in the right direction, and this will help restore confidence in the management.' said Mr Fergus MacLeod, analyst at County NatWest. 'They have cut the dividend and stopped over-spending, and will benefit when the economic environment starts to improve.' Mr MacLeod believed BP would still be able to start paying off its debts next year even if it did not make all its planned asset sales, given a modest upturn in the economy. Without it, prospects are bleak. But any growth in the economy would bring an immediate improvement in profits from the refining and chemicals businesses. BP is more heavily tied to the crude price than its main rivals because it is a less integrated company, with lower refinery input. Mr Horton once claimed that every Dollars 1 a barrel increase in world oil prices added Dollars 200m to BP's bottom line. While BP is well-placed for recovery, observers say there are still long-term concerns about structure of the company, and about the geographical spread of its exploration and production activities, which are too reliant on mature and declining fields in the North Sea and Alaska. Moreover, while the new management has pledged a change in leadership style, it remains to be seen whether Mr Simon will be more successful than his predecessor at carrying through structural changes without further damaging the company's morale. If Mr Horton was known as the hatchet man, BP's employees may be wondering today what that makes their new boss.

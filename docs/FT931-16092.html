			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: Ahold reports turnover in US up 12.9% to Dollars 6.3bn AHOLD, the Dutch-based supermarket group which owns four big US grocery store chains, said 1992 turnover rose by 7.3 per cent to Fl 22.3bn (Dollars 12.3bn), with US turnover growth outstripping the gain posted in the Netherlands. The US, which generally accounts for roughly half of group sales, saw a 12.9 per cent turnover rise to Dollars 6.3bn. Of this increase, 7.2 per cent was due to the fact that New York-based Tops Markets had been consolidated for only 39 weeks in 1991 compared with a full 53 weeks in 1992. Dutch turnover was up 9.1 per cent at Fl 11.2bn. Ahold, which is due to publish 1992 profits on March 18, said overall turnover would have been 3.7 percentage points higher if it had not been for the dollar's decline. Partly compensating for this was the 53-week financial year, which flattered sales figures by around 2 percentage points.</p>

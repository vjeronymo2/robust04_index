			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report from Georgia by correspondent Georgiy </F> Ratishvili, including recording of interview in office with  Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Abkhaz  Republic, by unidentified correspondent -- from the "Novosti"  newscast]    [Text] Today the sapper units of Russian peacekeeping  forces have continued the search and clearing of mines both on  Abkhaz and Georgian territories. The checkpoints will probably  start operating soon. Work has been going on since dawn to set  them up. Also today, work resumed on repairing the 25  meter-long bridge across the Inguri. It will be used by  military formations of Russia's Transcaucasus group of troops to  enter the Gali areas of Abkhazia. This is precisely the  peacekeeping contingent that will create conditions for the safe  return of refugees to Abkhazia in the near future. Now that the  issue of the introduction of the Russian peacekeepers into the  area of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict has been completely  resolved, these forced immigrants have a real chance of  returning home.    [Correspondent] Vladislav Georgiyevich, how do you assess  today's decision by the Federation Council that Russian troops  can be used in the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia?    [Ardzinba] In Abkhazia the decisions of the Federation  Council and the president's decree have been received with  satisfaction. We hope that the deployment of the troops on the  border between the Abkhaz and the Georgian states will create  the necessary conditions to prevent a new war, to stabilize the  situation in the region, and to continue talks on a full-scale  settlement of relations between Abkhazia and Georgia. After the  troops are deployed, we will be ready to consider questions  connected with the resumption of work by communication lines  linking Russia with the republics of the Transcaucasus, and  generally we hope that Russia's economic policy in relation to  Abkhazia, whose population has shouldered all the hardships of  war, will change.</p>

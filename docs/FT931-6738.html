			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Forgotten rights Yesterday's smart rise in UK equities ends two weeks of torpor during which the market was caught between fear of rights issues, hopes for recovery and the dwindling return on cash. With ICI's Pounds 1.3bn cash call now postponed until June, investors have evidently tired of shadow-boxing on the first point. But that does not leave much headroom from here. Yesterday's rise was led by the big overseas earners rather than domestic recovery stocks. Results from the likes of NatWest this week showed scant evidence of an upturn. Besides, ICI will not be the last to announce a rights issue before the reporting season is over. With around Pounds 2bn in rights issues and Pounds 5bn soaked up by gilts issues this year, institutional liquidity is already starting to look stretched. The Pounds 500m net inflow into unit trusts during January was encouraging, but only a portion will flow into UK equities. Besides, the ICI rights issue alone will account for perhaps three months' inflows at that rate of progress. When the government starts funding in earnest in the spring, competition for savings can only increase. The strength of blue-chip stocks could be a sign of renewed overseas interest. That would relieve the pressure on domestic cash. Having seen sterling bounce from an all-time low against the D-Mark this week, foreigners may be tempted to see the UK currency as a safe bet. The mood of continental stock and bond markets suggests some optimism that the Bundesbank will cut interest rates. If that was combined with nascent economic recovery at home, sterling would certainly benefit. The worry is that waiting has proved thankless in the past.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Red line opts for bottom line THE RED ARMY is finally succumbing to capitalism. Russian army officers made redundant after the collapse of the Communist regime are to be taught by British university lecturers how to set up and run small businesses. Officers trained to revile western ideals will be urged to embrace them under a government-backed scheme unveiled yesterday. Starting in November and funded by a Pounds 317,000 Foreign Office grant, courses will be offered in financial management, accounting and marketing. The initial course will involve more than 800 officers who lost their jobs when the Soviet armed forces were disbanded. Former intelligence officers, submarine commanders and logistics chiefs are expected to be among the trainees at four new business centres established in Moscow, Tula, Tomsk and Nizhny Novgorod by lecturers from Coventry University. The lecturers say they are ready to launch an offensive on the old ideals of men and women who had spent most of their lives in a managed economy. Mr Noel Hibbert, director of the university's European Training Agency, said: 'We've already found a big problem with their marketing skills. They hit upon ideas for a business without finding out if there's any demand.' While setting up a separate course in democracy, lecturers had to persuade a former nuclear submarine commander that there was no demand for a company selling reconnaissance film. Another officer with experience of ground-to-air weaponry was dissuaded from planning a toy company making boomerangs. The three-week training schedule promises to be an assault course in finance with tests in auditing and management skills. The final obstacle for officers hoping to join the ranks of entrepreneurs targeting Mother Russia will be an interview with officials of the staunchly capitalist European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In return for an equity stake in any company it deems worthy of backing, the EBRD will offer credits worth up to Dollars 30,000 (Pounds 19,500). 'They're queueing up to join the courses,' said Mr Hibbert. 'It means we can assist with the demobilisation of Russian armed forces.' Aware of the sensitivity needed to deal with the one-time elite of the Warsaw Pact, the university has decided to train 36 senior Russian officers in Coventry as lecturers in the new year. They, in turn, will spread the capitalist message to some of the 450,000 military personnel made redundant after the fall of communism.</p>

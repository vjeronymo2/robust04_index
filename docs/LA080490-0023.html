			<p><P> August 4, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SILVEIRA SHOOTS A 71, LEADS BY ONE AT MEMPHIS  </P> <P> Larry Silveira overcame two shots into water hazards to shoot an even-par 71  Friday and hold a one-shot lead midway through the St. Jude Classic at Memphis,  Tenn.  </P> <P> Silveira, who set a course record with a nine-under-par 62 for a three-shot  lead Thursday, completed two rounds over the 7,006-yard TPC Southwind course at  133, one shot ahead of Buddy Gardner and Loren Roberts. Gardner shot 69 and  Roberts 68.  </P> <P> Silveira, a former University of Arizona All-American, had four birdies, two  bogeys and a double bogey on day when play was interrupted by lightning and  rain. He found the water on No. 4, taking a bogey, and on No. 11, where he had  the double bogey.  </P> <P> "I was out there grinding away," Silveira said. "I putted well, but I didn't  hit my iron shots close enough. I had a lot of 20-30 footers."  </P> <P> The second-year PGA Tour player, whose best finish is a 10th in the Deposit  Guaranty Classic this year, was at even par for the day when he missed a  one-foot tap-in for par on the par-3 14th. He got that stroke back when he  birdied the 18th from 20 feet.  </P> <P> "You never know when you're going to play good," Silveira said. "It's  day-by-day out here, as you can see with a nine-shot difference today."  </P> <P> Gardner managed to offset a bogey-4 at the 186-yard fourth hole with three  birdies.  </P> <P> Roberts, competing after a three-week layoff, got his game together after a  double bogey on the 146-yard 11th hole, which was his second hole of the day.  </P> <P> Even with a bogey and a double bogey in the homestretch, former British Amateur  champion Kitrina Douglas held her lead after two rounds of the British Women's  Open, in Woburn, England.  </P> <P> Douglas shot a two-under-par 71 in the second round, played in intense heat,  and reached the 36-hole mark with a 140 total.  </P> <P> One stroke behind her was Helen Alfredsson of Sweden.  </P> <P> Midway through the round, Douglas led by five-shots, but she had a bogey on the  15th and a double-bogey on the 17th.  </P> <P> "In these conditions you take the bad breaks with the good, so I have to be  satisfied," Douglas said.  </P> <P> Douglas had five birdies in the first 11 holes.  </P> <P> Former champion Corinne Dibnah of Australia also had trouble at the 17th,  carding a nine after hitting a shot into the woods.  </P> <P> Muffin Spencer-Devlin, who was two shots off the lead after an opening-round  71, hit two tee shots out of bounds off the first tee and recorded a  quadruple-bogey nine on the hole. She dropped five more shots in the next five  holes and ended the second round with an 81.  </P> <P> Bob Charles shot a six-under-par 66 to claim a one-shot lead over Dewitt Weaver  and Harold Henning after the opening round of the Paine Webber Invitational at  Charlotte, N.C.  </P> <P> Charles, winner of two Senior PGA Tour events this season, had four birdies on  the front nine and added a fifth with a 50-foot putt on the 436-yard 13th hole.  </P> <P> Arnold Palmer, designer of the Pipers Glen course, and tour money leader Lee  Trevino were in a group at 70 that also included Dave Hill, the winner the last  time this event was staged, in 1988.  </P> <P> Ronan Rafferty of Northern Ireland shot a 67 and kept his three-shot lead at  the halfway mark of the PLM Open at Malmo, Sweden.  </P> <P> Rafferty, who tied the course record with a 64 Thursday, had a 36-hole total of  131. That is 13 under par on the 6,892-yard Bokskogen course and the fourth  lowest 36-hole score on the European Tour this season.  </P></p>

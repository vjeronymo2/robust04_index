			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Losses at Lloyd's analysed EXTERNAL Names at Lloyd's of London stand to lose a larger proportion of their assets than Names who work full-time in the market, according to a new analysis of the Lloyd's losses for 1989. Warnings of losses have brought the appointment of Sir David Walker to investigate in what circumstances Names working at Lloyd's may have been placed on more profitable syndicates than those to which outside Names were allocated. The assets of Names underwrite insurance business. In a letter published in the Financial Times today, Mr Richard Spooner, an external Name who estimates he will lose Pounds 150,000 for the 1989 underwriting year, says working Names are expected to lose 12 per cent of the assets they pledged, compared with 16.5 per cent for external Names. His figures are based on forecasts by the managing agents of Lloyd's syndicates and released over the last few weeks. They include estimates of losses for the 4 per cent of agents who did not provide forecasts and are provisional. Mr Julian Crispin, chairman of Sedgwick Underwriting Agents, stressed that external names had fared better than working names in profitable years such as 1986 and 1987. Lloyd's said: 'You can prove anything with figures if you have enough of them. There is not a lot we can add until the Walker inquiry reports in late May.' Letters, Page 21</p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OTHER LIVES: CITIZEN JANE BY CHRISTOPHER ANDERSEN (HENRY HOLT: $19.95; 389 PP.)  </P> <P> "Citizen Jane" also touches on the price required for success in Hollywood, but  does so by trundling out truckloads of celebrity-bio cliches. Or so it seems;  after a while it's easier to conclude that Christopher Andersen's subject, Jane  Fonda, has simply lived one of the prototypal show-biz lives (travel to North  Vietnam aside).  </P> <P> Unloved daughter of a much-married leading man; rich, horse-riding, rebellious;  deflowered by older man, college drop-out; discovers hidden acting talent and  necessary Svengali, becomes sex symbol, marries director; rebels again, finds  new self and new Svengali; remarries, redivorces, strikes out on her own. . . .  You get the idea. With a few exceptions -- who knew that she passed up starring  roles in "Bonnie and Clyde," "Rosemary's Baby," "Carnal Knowledge" and "Dr.  Zhivago"? -- we seem to be acquainted with Jane's story before Andersen relates  it.  </P> <P> But familiarity isn't the only problem. Although Andersen has interviewed all  the famous Fondas, "Citizen Jane" reads as though it were based on others'  accounts. One longs for Fonda to speak in the present tense -- something that  occurs only in the last few pages. Andersen's colorful writing and  pop-psychologizing simply don't make up for his failure to compose a  considered, reflective portrait. Perhaps it's true that when Jane's mother  committed suicide there was "a glint from the tiny razor blade that lay on the  floor near her right hand," or that the men in Jane's life have been father  substitutes, but emphasis on such things reveal an author willing to sacrifice  insight for voyeurism. Andersen seems to have gathered most of the facts with  which to complete the puzzle of Jane's life (and it is a puzzle, considering  that "Miss Army Reserve Recruiting of 1962" became Hanoi Jane in 1972 and  Workout Jane by 1982), but he's forced the pieces, hard, into place.  </P></p>

			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Government legal services may be put out to tender SEVERAL government agen-cies and departments are considering contracting out their legal services - including sensitive enforcement work - to private law firms, as part of the drive to contract out Civil-Service functions. The Health and Safety Executive is expected to be among the first agencies to place work done by in-house lawyers with the private sector. It is considering 'market testing' routine enforcement work in health and safety prosecutions. The pollution inspectorate, is also thought to be considering the contracting out of routine prosecution work. The employment department is looking at placing local advice out to tender in the regions and the Treasury solicitor's department is considering contracting out routine property work and litigation. However, Sir Nicholas Lyell, attorney-general, has warned against over-enthusiasm in contracting out legal work. In a guidance note to government departments, he suggests that the scope for contracting out legal services is limited and warns of the need to retain effective in-house legal capacity. Sir Nicholas says it would not be appropriate to use the private sector for 'core governmental work' where ministers and legal advisers need to maintain a close confidential relationship. Sir Nicholas says that sufficient in-house capacity must be retained within the government legal service not only to service core work but also to provide him with legal assistance in his role as the government's chief legal adviser. The First Division Association, which represents lawyers in the government legal service, has expressed concern over the potential loss of jobs that contracting out could bring.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Armenian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Despite the conspicuous failures and considerable  loss in men and material on the fronts in recent days, the  Azerbaijani authorities are adamantly continuing to put out  disinformation about alleged advances by the Azerbaijani  National Army.    The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters  reports that in fact the Azerbaijani National Army's renewed  large-scale offensive along the Karabakh-Azerbaijan conflict  line has again failed. According to preliminary reports,  Karabakh Army units basically maintained their defensive  positions during fighting which has been taking place all along  the front line since the early hours of 7 January, and in  certain sectors they even launched counterattacks and ousted the  enemy from the captured positions. There are dead and injured on  both sides. Casualty figures are being determined, but the  losses suffered by Azerbaijani side are several times greater.    The battles were still continuing as of 1200 today.</p>

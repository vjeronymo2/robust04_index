			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The cabinet held a meeting this evening and  discussed the Israeli aggression. It stressed the importance of  domestic unity and bolstering the legitimate security forces  with all available means to continue their role in safeguarding  the homeland's security. It also decided to ask the foreign  minister to hold preliminary contacts to call for a UN Security  Council meeting to debate the Lebanese complaint and condemn the  Israeli aggression. The cabinet meeting began at 1730 today at  B'abda Palace under the chairmanship of President Ilyas  al-Hirawi. Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri also attended the  meeting. The meeting continued until 2115. After the meeting,  Information Minister Michel Samahah announced the following  official decisions:    [Begin recording] [Samahah] At the invitation of Prime  Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, the cabinet held its weekly meeting at  the Presidential Palace this evening. The meeting was chaired  by President Ilyas al-Hirawi. At the outset of the meeting,  President al-Hirawi discussed the Israeli aggression against  Lebanon on the morning of 'Id al-Adha when the Israeli enemy  staged a commando operation and abducted Lebanese citizen  Mustafa al-Dirani from his hometown in al-Biqa'.    The defense minister then submitted a detailed report on the  Israeli act of aggression. He explained the practical moves  made by the Lebanese Army to confront this operation. The  foreign minister presented a report on lodging a complaint with  the UN Security Council and the contacts Lebanon has held on the  subject.    The cabinet then discussed the Israeli aggression and  stressed the importance of bolstering the domestic unity and the  legitimate security forces with all available means to continue  to perform their role in safeguarding the homeland's security.  The cabinet decided to have the foreign minister hold  preliminary contacts for a meeting of the UN Security Council to  debate the Lebanese complaint and condemn the Israeli  aggression. [passage omitted]    [Question] Did the cabinet discuss the proposals from the UN  secretary general [words indistinct] Lebanon and Israel  regarding al-Dirani?    [Samahah] Lebanon regrets very much this stance by the UN  secretary general. The United Nations is required to implement  its resolutions instead of offering to mediate on an issue that  requires implementation of international law and UN principles.  It is impossible to equate the case of one who fell in Lebanon  during an aggression against Lebanese territory and that of a  Lebanese citizen abducted from his home on Lebanese territory by  an Israeli force that violated international laws and Lebanon's  sovereignty. Lebanon demands that this citizen be released  immediately, along with all Lebanese detainees in Israeli jails  and in detention camps in occupied Lebanese territory in the  south.    [Question] In light of the information available, what in  your views was the goal of the Israeli operation?    [Samahah] The operation is designed to complement the  Israeli  plan manifest in the recent bombings, specifically the bombing  of Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq Mikha'il and of the  Phalangist Party headquarters. In this case and in those cases,  the Israeli enemy sought to sow division and doubts within  Lebanese society and in the people's unity and their state's  capabilities. The president, the prime minister, and all  ministers stressed that there is no room for leaving the Israeli  links that act in various ways to strike at Lebanon's unity and  to confuse the Lebanese people's trust in their legitimate  establishments, especially the security forces and the Army and  their unity in confronting the Israeli enemy. Lebanon will  confront all Israeli operations at this time when our country is  facing important challenges, primarily the peace negotiations  and Israeli attempts to bend the will of the Lebanese and Arabs,  particularly Syria at this stage of the negotiations.

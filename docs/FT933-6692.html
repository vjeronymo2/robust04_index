This opening programme investigates why the BBC and the British government kept so quiet in 1942 about evidence of the systematic annihilation of the Jews despite the fact that the BBC came under strong pressure to warn those in Hitler's occupied territories about the 'final solution'. It is a good night for fans of wildlife programmes. Survival reports on the condition of the Andean condor, a vulture now found mainly in California and the mountains of South America (7.30 ITV).

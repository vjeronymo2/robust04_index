			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFING PAPER;  </P> <P> NORTH AFRICA MOVES TOWARD JOINT MARKET;  </P> <P> THE NEWS:  </P> <P> Leaders of the 17-month-old Arab Maghreb Union will meet Saturday in Algiers to  advance plans for a North African common market that would parallel the more  unified European Community upcoming by the end of 1992.  </P> <P> Substantial progress is considered possible on an agreement to eliminate trade  barriers and customs duties, allowing free circulation of goods among the five  Maghreb countries -- Algeria, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia. Also up  for discussion, but still probably not ready for adoption, are similar  proposals to eliminate travel restrictions for Maghreb citizens.  </P> <P> Politically, last month's unexpected municipal elections victory by Muslim  fundamentalists in Algeria will be high on the agenda. And the five are to  decide whether to establish a permanent seat for the Arab Maghreb Union. Until  now, the organization's headquarters has rotated along with the AMU  chairmanship every six months.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Background:  </P> <P> Faced with severe economic troubles at home and potentially crippling cutbacks  in their access to European markets, the five AMU countries agreed Feb. 17,  1989, to set aside decades of political squabbling and competition in favor of  greater economic cooperation. The hope: that unity would give them a stronger  voice in dealing with Europe and that greater mutual trade among the member  countries could make up for any European trade lost after 1992, the target date  for Western Europe to institute a true common market.  </P> <P> "Our aim," King Hassan II of Morocco said, "is to turn the Arab Maghreb into  one country, with one passport, one identity and a single currency."  </P> <P> At first glance, the five countries could hardly be less suited to development  of a common market. Trade among them has averaged only about 3% of the region's  total trade, while trade with Europe is over 60%.  </P> <P> Moreover, the economies of the member countries often overlap. The olive oil  that directly or indirectly supports 30% of Tunisia's farmers is also a big  moneymaker for Morocco. The same is true, to a lesser extent, for those  countries' citrus and phosphate exports. Algeria and Libya both rely heavily on  their oil exports and petrochemical industries. Mauritania produces a lot of  fish, but so does everyone else.  </P> <P> Although building intra-Maghreb trade is clearly not going to be easy, the five  nations feel they have much to fear from European union.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Threat:  </P> <P> Agricultural-based economies like Morocco's and Tunisia's perhaps have the most  to lose from Europe's rush toward 1992. Until now, their agricultural exports  have flowed across the Mediterranean duty-free, but the inclusion of Greece,  Portugal and Spain in the European Community -- countries that also have plenty  of citrus, olives and wine to export -- has produced a lot of teeth-grinding on  the southern Mediterranean rim.  </P> <P> The Maghreb Studies Assn. in London estimates that Morocco's agricultural  exports to Europe will be cut in half after 1992. Its wine production, the  association declared, "will be almost all closed down."  </P> <P> Moreover, all the Maghreb countries have reason to worry about what effect the  free flow of people across European borders will have on the 3 million workers  now in Europe who are currently sending their paychecks home.  </P> <P> Countries such as France, West Germany and Belgium are already making noises  about tightening entry restrictions on North Africans, and an open border  policy will likely mean other European countries will be encouraged to impose  similar clampdowns.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is they see this big monolith growing up on the other side of  the Mediterranean, and they want to see if there's something they can do about  it," said one analyst.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Europe's View:  </P> <P> The European Community has been anxious to reassure the North Africans. "The  fact that we are going to have one market and not 12 markets will definitely  make things easier for them," said one European Community analyst posted in  Algiers. "There is no doubt that the creation of this '92 market is going to be  for them more of an opportunity than a problem."  </P> <P> The European group recently negotiated an agreement allowing the Maghreb  countries to maintain existing trade levels in products such as citrus even  after 1992. A separate agreement on textiles allows countries such as Morocco  and Tunisia to accelerate exports up to a certain level and leaves the door  open for continued negotiations. But privately, many European leaders fear that  if North Africa's economy does get worse, it will only mean more illegal  immigration from the Maghreb. Accordingly, the European Community has proposed  a 40% increase from the current $160 million in annual aid that it sends to  North Africa -- an idea that is still far from winning consensus.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Progress So Far:  </P> <P> Since the union's initial meeting in 1989, AMU committees have been formed to  study almost every conceivable facet of cooperation, and some headway has been  made.  </P> <P> In the discussion stage is construction of a Maghreb Highway from Libya to the  Atlantic, establishment of a common airline (Air Maghreb) and funding of a  common investment bank. Tentative accords have been signed exempting  cross-border investors from double taxation.  </P> <P> Algeria already has an operating pipeline transporting natural gas through  Tunisia and on to Italy, and a second pipeline is in the works that would  access Europe, across Gibraltar, through Morocco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Political Complications:  </P> <P> With the region's long history of cross-border squabbling, the Arab Maghreb  Union faces political hurdles as well.  </P> <P> A January summit was hampered by a new flare-up in the Western Sahara dispute  that has kept Morocco and Algeria at odds for years. (Algeria supports the  Polisario rebels who dispute Morocco's claim to the former Spanish colony.)  Mauritania accuses Morocco of favoring rival Senegal in a bloody conflict  between those countries. And Tunisia and Libya have a history of military  conflict.  </P> <P> Indeed, Libya and its mercurial strongman, Col. Moammar Kadafi, have been a big  question mark from the beginning.  </P> <P> Kadafi, a vocal champion of Arab unity, insisted at first on an immediate and  total merger joining all five Maghreb countries and four other African states.  To accommodate him, the inaugural AMU text described the union as "only one  essential stage on the way to the creation of Arab unity."  </P> <P> But privately, leaders of the Maghreb countries believe that they have had a  moderating influence on Kadafi. In any case, said one analyst, they feel more  comfortable "having him inside the tent than outside the tent."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Outlook:  </P> <P> For all the barriers, Maghreb officials predict they will eventually make  progress toward greater unity, if only because they have to. "Any country in  the world cannot afford to live alone now," said Algerian diplomat Belkacem  Madani. "The world has become very small, and that means the necessity of links  between nations."  </P> <P> Maghreb Union: a Regional Snapshot  </P> <P> MOROCCO  </P> <P> Leader: King Hassan II  </P> <P> Population: 24.2 million (1989 est.)  </P> <P> Area: 269,756 square miles  </P> <P> Capital: Rabat  </P> <P> TUNISIA  </P> <P> Leader: President Zine Abidine ben Ali  </P> <P> Population: 8.1 million (1989 est.)  </P> <P> Area: 63,170 square miles  </P> <P> Capital: Tunis  </P> <P> LIBYA  </P> <P> Leader: Col.

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ASSAULT RIFLES  </P> <P> This letter is to answer Ann Cox-Clasby of Laguna Beach about her comments on  state Sen. David A. Roberti's bill on assault rifles (March 19):  </P> <P> Fully automatic firearms have been outlawed by the federal government for at  least four decades. Guess what: The criminals and drug dealers have them  anyway. Illegal arms come into this country just like cocaine does: by the ton.  It has also been against federal law to modify a semiautomatic weapon into a  fully automatic one. Guess what: The criminals and drug dealers do it anyway.  </P> <P> The laws already exist to deter the criminal, but they are not enforced.  </P> <P> Disarming the law-abiding citizen is unconstitutional, illogical and won't even  slow down the killing.  </P> <P> LEON M. CANZIANI  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

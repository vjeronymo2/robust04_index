			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / International Company News: Japanese tyre-makers decline YOKOHAMA Rubber and Sumitomo Rubber, leading Japanese tyre-makers, reported lower pre-tax profits for the year to end-December, blaming the decline on increased personnel costs linked to Japan's labour shortage and higher interest rates. Yokohama Rubber said pre-tax profit fell 14.7 per cent to Y12.74bn (98.2m), although total sales rose 3.2 per cent to Y295.15bn and sales of tyres rose 4.8 per cent to Y211.6bn, despite the downturn in Japanese car sales last year. In common with many other Japanese companies, Yokohama reported a fall in liquid assets, particularly in cash, which declined from Y16.8bn to Y5.35bn. Companies, unable to raise new funds on an ailing stock market and balking at higher interest rates, tapped their liquid assets. Yokohama expects the weakness in the Japanese vehicle market to be reflected in slower sales this year, but is hoping new products will stimulate demand. It said the 'difficult conditions' would be exacerbated by an appreciation of the yen and an increase in trade friction. For the year, Yokohama expects sales to rise by about 3 per cent to Y305bn, with pre-tax profit slightly lower at Y12.3bn, and after tax profit falling from Y6.9bn to Y6.7bn. Sumitomo Rubber reported a 1.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profit to Y11.54bn on a 3.9 per cent increase in sales to Y254.36bn. The company said that sales rose for new product lines, particularly tyres for snow conditions, while sales of sports and related equipment advanced 7.5 per cent during the period. This year, Sumitomo is predicting an almost 6 per cent increase in sales to Y270bn and a slightly higher pre-tax profit at Y12bn. After-tax profit, which rose 30.2 per cent to Y7.2bn last year is expected to decline to Y6bn.</p>

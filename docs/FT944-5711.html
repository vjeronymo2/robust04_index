			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / BT to tighten accounts methods British Telecommunications is tightening accounting methods at one of its operating divisions after an investigation by Oftel, the telecoms regulator, ended inconclusively. Mr Don Cruickshank, director general of telecommunications, said that because of BT's accounting methods it had proved impossible to determine whether the group had been unfairly subsidising services offered by BT Managed Network Services, a division with turnover of Pounds 60m a year. A number of telecommunications companies had complained that BT was cross-subsidising MNS services.</p>

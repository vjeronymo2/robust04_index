Brigadier Lagos Henriques  Lidimo was appointed for the government's side, while the  Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] appointed Lieutenant  General Mateus Ngonhamo.    The two generals named to the FADM Supreme Command still  have  to be confirmed by the Supervision and Control Commission [CSC].    The main task of government Brig. Lagos Henriques Lidimo and  Renamo Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo will be to guide and lead the  troops of the future single and nonpartisan army until the new  government, which will emerge from the general elections  scheduled for October, is sworn in. Brig. Lagos Lidimo, 44, was  born in Mueda, Cabo Delgado, and joined the Popular Forces for  the Liberation of Mozambique [FPLM] in June 1966, having  attended a commander course on weapons at Vistrel Military  Academy.    From 1970 to 1974, he was deputy security and operations  chief for Cabo Delgado Province. Between 1975 and 1994, he was  head of the Senior Official Security Directorate; Protection  Regiment commander; Military Counterintelligence, CIM, director;  military commander for Zambezia Province; commander of the  Maputo Military Garrison; and commander of the border security  troops.    In turn, Renamo Lt. Gen. Mateus Ngonhamo, aged 30, was born  in Dombe District, Manica Province. He told the press he joined  the ranks of the armed movement in 1978 as a soldier and rose to  lieutenant general in 1992 after commanding the Renamo forces in  the southern region, with a base was located in Chibuto  District, Gaza District.    We received reports saying that, as well as presenting names  for the FADM Supreme Command generals, the government and Renamo  also presented lists containing the names of 62 officers who  will attend a leadership training course on 7 February, with  each side bringing in 31 men.    Those officers will join the General Staff as well as some  of  the main commands, which will be part of the FADM structure.    With regard to training the infantry forces, special forces,  marines, and mine removal personnel, NOTICIAS has learned from  General Tobia Dai, head of the government team to the CCFADM,  that all courses are to begin in the first half of February.</p>

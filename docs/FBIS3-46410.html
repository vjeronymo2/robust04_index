			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, January 28 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng met with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev  and his party, at Zhongnanhai, here today.    Welcoming Kozyrev and his party, Li said that the policies  of  good neighborliness, friendship, mutual benefit and cooperation,  set by Chinese and Russian leaders during President Boris  Yeltsin's China visit in 1992, are "correct".    These policies conform to the essential interests of the two  countries and the two peoples and should be adhered to.    On Sino-Russian ties, Li said that the bilateral relations  had a fairly long history. The two countries share long borders  which should be peaceful and friendly ones.    He said that the economies of the two sides are  complementary, adding that Sino-Russian economic and trade  relations have experienced rapid development.    The trade volume between China and Russia reached 7.6  billion  U.S. dollars last year, which is less than four percent of the  total Chinese foreign trade value in 1993.    Li said that both China and Russia should take practical  views to explore new ways for further bilateral cooperation.  Relevant departments of the two sides should promote contacts  and conduct some large-scale cooperation.    Li, on behalf of the Chinese Government and in the name of  himself, invited Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to  visit China.    Kozyrev expressed gratitude for Li's invitation. He said  that the invitation from President Yeltsin to Premier Li for a  future Russia visit was still valid, adding that an early  meeting between Russian and Chinese prime ministers will be  "very important".    Kozyrev said that Russia is willing to acquire a in-depth  understanding of China's economic reform experience. He himself  will also tour south China's Shenzhen city to this end.    Li said: "The national conditions in China and Russia are  not the same; China's practice is for reference only to your  country."    Noting that Russia is rich in natural and human resources,  Li  said he believed that the Russian people will overcome the  temporary difficulties. China wishes to see a stable Russia  with a growing economy, he added.    Li also briefed the Russian guests on China's foreign  policies. He said that after the Cold War, the world is facing a  multi-polarization trend. Yet the world is not peaceful. New  conflicts and contradictions keep occurring. The gap between  the north and the south is further enlarged, Li said.    Kozyrev said that the world is not single-pole nor  bi-polarized but multi-polarized.    In this changing world, Kozyrev said, to improve  Russian-Chinese ties is a top priority in his country's foreign  affairs. He said that the constructive partnership between the  two sides should be enhanced and reach new heights.    Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Dai Bingguo, Chinese  Ambassador  to Russia Wang Jinqing, and Russian Ambassador to China Yegor  Rogachev participated in the meeting.</p>

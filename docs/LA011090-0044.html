			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> Eagles Won't Fly: The Eagles, the band that defined the hugely popular  "California sound" in the '70s, isn't planning a reunion despite a report  Monday in the Hollywood Reporter. A source close to several ex-Eagles branded  as "inconceivable" a full-scale reunion by the group, which broke up amid  considerable bitterness in 1982. The source suggested speculation about a  reuniting may have been triggered by former Eagles leaders Glenn Frey and Don  Henley appearing on stage together last fall during two Henley concerts in  Southern California and by Henley's subsequent comments that the two may  occasionally write songs together again.

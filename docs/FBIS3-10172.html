			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Uruguay monitored through 24  February.    The public sector's financial deficit in 1993 was  approximately $143 million, 1.1 percent of the gross domestic  product. The surplus registered by the central government since  1991 became a deficit in 1993 because of a drop in revenues and  an increase in expenses in real terms, along with a decline in  the surplus of public companies.

The fund will be used to finance modernization  projects.

			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / International Company News: GM takes Dollars 950m charge to cover closure scheme GENERAL Motors announced yesterday that it would take a Dollars 950m pre-tax charge against third-quarter earnings to cover additional costs from its programme to close 21 redundant manufacturing plants in North America. The news came just 24 hours after GM reached a new three-year labour agreement with the United Auto Workers union which will sharply push up the company's pension costs, while allowing it more freedom to relocate laid-off workers to new plants. News of the charge came after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, where the company's shares had fallen Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 44 1/2 yesterday in reaction to the labour deal, which fell short of GM's aims and Wall Street's hopes. The company, which is to report third-quarter figures on Thursday, said the charge resulted mainly from greater productivity gains than had been expected when it first made a provision for the plant closing programme. This meant fewer jobs would be available within the group for workers from plants that GM was closing, which in turn would push up its job security costs. Under a long-standing job security programme, GM continues paying its workers even after they have been laid off. However, the company said even with the charge it believed it could attain its 1993 financial goal for its North American automotive operations - to break even before interest, taxes and non-cash healthcare expenses. Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit information agency, said earlier in the day it had revised its rating outlook for GM to negative from stable because of the new labour pact. It said the reported provisions of the agreement would not bolster the company's cost-cutting efforts in North America as had been anticipated before. GM's market share performance had been disappointing in recent quarters, S&amp;P said . These factors heightened uncertainty about the company's ability to achieve meaningful profits in North America, it added.</p>

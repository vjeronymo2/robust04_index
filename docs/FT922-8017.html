			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / Letter: Auditors: questions of responsibility and of cost (1) Sir, Mr Philip Wood's call (Letters, May 13) for the Caparo case (limiting auditors' liability) to be reversed is both welcome and timely. How appropriate that you should publish it on the same day as the radical Auditing Practices Board proposals to widen the power and scope of auditors. Although auditing is long established, it is not yet the oldest profession in the world. It should therefore heed carefully Kipling's famous warning about 'power without responsibility . . . .'

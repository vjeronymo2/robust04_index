			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Clowes damages appeal fails MR PETER CLOWES failed yesterday in his appeal against a High Court ruling this year that he is liable to meet a civil damages claim launched by the Department of Trade and Industry and should make a Pounds 6m interim payment. The Appeal Court unanimously rejected Mr Clowes's claim that the ruling, made by Sir Donald Nicholls, the vice-chancellor, was flawed. Mr Clowes is serving a 10-year jail sentence after his conviction for fraud in February this year. He was said to have cheated investors in the Barlow Clowes investment group of an estimated Pounds 113m. The DTI paid Pounds 150m in compensation to investors.</p>

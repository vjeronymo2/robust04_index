			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Coal arm quizzes DTI on its future British Coal Enterprise, the job-creation arm of British Coal, is seeking urgent clarification by the government of its future before the privatisation of its parent. Mr Philip Andrews, BCE chief executive, said the Department of Trade and Industry had indicated that a decision would be made before November. He said the uncertainty was affecting staff morale and customer confidence. The department said yesterday that it was examining all the options. It said: 'Everyone agrees that they do a very good job, and we want to make sure that those skills don't disappear.' It denied that there had been a decision deadline. BCE, which was formed in 1984, estimates that it has been finding jobs or training for redundant miners at the rate of 100 a week. It also provides soft loans to small businesses in coalfield areas at rates subsidised by the government through British Coal. The privatisation of the corporation, due on December 24, will leave BCE without financial support. Mr Andrews said he believed BCE could raise funds through the City, or international sources such as the European Investment Bank. There were structural programmes which would provide matching funds to cover BCE's operating costs of about Pounds 5m a year.</p>

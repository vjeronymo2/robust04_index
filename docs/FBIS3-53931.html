			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] It was announced at the UN Security Council [UNSC]  last night that the UNSC held unofficial consultations and  failed to agree that the conditions required for lifting the  embargo imposed on Iraq have been met.    This decision was expected at this point in time. However,  reliable diplomatic sources there have said that the next UNSC's  review of the embargo, due to be held in March, will witness  further positive developments, and that these developments will  push for the lifting of the embargo imposed on Iraq.    A diplomatic source has explained to the Iraqi News Agency  correspondent in New York that a reading of the positions of the  UNSC members during yesterday's consultations strongly show a  flexible British position, particularly since the speech  delivered by the British representative to the United Nations  during the UNSC consultations was free of any strong accusations  or additional conditions.    The source added that there is evidence that the British  position will be better during the next consultations the UNSC  will hold in March, when the political stage will be set for the  lifting of the sanctions.    Other sources said that the UNSC consultations have almost  seen a consensus on the need to lift the sanctions. All UNSC  members, except U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, called for  lifting the sanctions.    In a statement to reporters yesterday, French ambassador to  the United Nations Jean-Bernard Merime affirmed that the French  position on Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 has remained  unchanged. He said Iraq's position on this paragraph should be  the yardstick to be heeded for lifting the oil embargo imposed  on Iraq. He added that things will be good when Rolf Ekeus,  chairman of the UN Special Commission, and Hans Blix, director  general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, submit their  reports per Paragraph 22 of the aforementioned resolution,  reports which could help lift the embargo.    Rolf Ekeus had informed a REUTER correspondent at the United  Nations that he would leave for Baghdad early February for  political talks with Iraqi officials. He added that his talks  will focus on the overall developments pertaining to the  dismantlement of the sanctions.    In his statement to reporters, French ambassador Merime has  not denied that there are differences between France and the  United States over the lifting of the Iraq sanctions.    Other diplomatic sources have said that the Spanish  ambassador stressed, during the UNSC deliberations, the need for  the UNSC decisions to be guided by Chapter VII of the UN  Charter, and to be free of any political purposes. These  sources noted that the Brazilian ambassador was more frank and  clearer. In his speech, he affirmed that the UNSC and the  Sanctions Committee must not act in a manner that harms the  Iraqi people, or hurts their national economy.    The Brazilian ambassador affirmed that Paragraph 22 of  Resolution 687 is clear. He added: The UNSC must be firm in  the implementation of its own resolutions, a firm implementation  of which is demanded. Diplomatic sources said that this remark  by the Brazilian ambassador was meant to reject the addition of  any fresh conditions to the provisions enshrined in Paragraph 22  of the aforesaid resolution, which provides for lifting the  embargo imposed on Iraqi exports, including oil, once Iraq  implements the provisions 8-13 enshrined in Resolution 687,  which address the weapons of mass destruction--the provisions  which have actually been implemented.    The PRC ambassador strongly called for lifting the embargo  imposed on Iraq and ending the Iraqis' suffering. He, along  with the Russian, Nigerian, and Brazilian ambassadors, called  for amending the traditional statement issued by the UNSC every  60 days so that it may note positive developments in the Iraqi  position.    As for the speech delivered by the U.S. representative to  the  United Nations, it was a paper she received from Van der Stoel,  a Netherland national, the so-called Human Rights Commission  rapporteur, during a meeting they had in the Hague last week.  This paper included a string of lies and falsehoods that  characterized the U.S. position.    Radio London said that the UNSC consultations reflected  differences among the UNSC members, adding that the French  position was strongly favorable to Iraq.</p>

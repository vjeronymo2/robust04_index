			<p>BFN     [Text] Shijiazhuang, May 25 (XINHUA) -- The Jingtang Port  in Hebei Province will be built jointly by Beijing and Tangshan  into an international port city by the end of the century, a  port official said today.    The official said that Jingtang Port, or the  Beijing-Tangshan  Port, is designed to handle 6.5 million tons of cargo annually  by the end of 1995.    The port's handling capacity will rise to 12 million tons a  year by 2000, he added.    In July 1993, Tangshan, a major coal mining and  manufacturing  center in north China, signed an agreement with Beijing to  jointly build the new port in Wangtan Township, Leting County.    The port, 95 kilometers southeast of Tangshan, opened to  foreign ships on July 18, 1993, he said.    The Tangshan City Government is building a 44-sq-km  development zone around the port, he said.    A 77-km railway now links the port to the  Beijing-Shanhaiguan  Railway Line, he said, adding that direct dialing service to the  rest of China and the world is available in Jingtang.    The Tangshan City Government has decided to focus on the  growth of transportation, processing and high-tech industries in  the development zone, he said.    To date, the port authorities have approved the undertaking  of 93 projects in the zone in cooperation with Chinese and  overseas firms, he said, adding that these projects will involve  1.7 billion yuan in total investment.    Work has started on nine projects, including a seamen's  hotel  and an office building, he said.    Jingtang is set to increase its population to 300,000 by the  end of the century, he said.</p>

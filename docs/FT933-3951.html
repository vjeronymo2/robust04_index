			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Credit Lyonnais sets up commodities arm CREDIT LYONNAIS, the French investment bank, has formed a new derivatives arm to concentrate on over-the-counter commodities products. Credit Lyonnais Rouse Derivatives will extend the company's existing commodity swaps and hedging arrangements into structured finance deals. Mr Chris Mason, managing director, said: 'Now almost all of our business is in traditional corporate hedging. In five years' time, I think we'll be earning 80 per cent of our income from these new financing deals.' The new group is looking to design tailor-made arrangements for corporate clients to hedge raw materials costs on a long-term basis. It offers companies a chance to hedge their exposure over several years and longer than is available on the world's futures exchanges. Mr Mason believes the food sector offers good potential to expand its structured finance deals since hedging is so rare in the industry. The new company is targeting users of coffee, sugar and cocoa as part of its marketing campaign. It has worked out hedges for six European consumers of orange juice over the past 18 months and recently signed up several Florida producers. CLRD is working on a model for hedging the green pound - the currency in which agricultural producers are paid EC subsidies - for which Mr Mason sees great demand from many food companies. More traditional areas in which CLRD hopes to make a big impact are airline financing, project financing for mining companies and aluminium leasing. Mr Mason says the use of swap deals and swaptions to stabilise jet fuel costs can reduce the funding levels of an airline finance arrangement by 100 basis points or 1 per cent depending on the amount of leverage involved. In addition, a hedging arrangement for the output of, say, a mining company, can be set in advance when funds are being put together for its development.</p>

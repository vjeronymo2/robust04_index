			<p>920526 FT  26 MAY 92 / Afghan leaders' peace deal AFGHANISTAN'S two warring guerrilla leaders emerged from talks yesterday saying they had agreed on a lasting peace, Reuter reports from Pul-e-Charki, Afghanistan. New defence minister Ahmad Shah Masood and fundamentalist guerrilla chief Gulbuddin Hekmatyar promised no return to the open warfare which erupted in Kabul after the overthrow of former Soviet-backed President Najibullah last month. The two men spent seven hours in a tent in a dusty gully 10km from Kabul, accompanied by mediators from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, before emerging to declare agreement. They then joined together in Moslem prayers. Guerrillas from both men's forces stationed nearby lit up the sky over Kabul with celebratory gunfire as news of the peace agreement spread. Mediators announced they had reached a pact between the two men last week, but that document was vaguely-worded and attempts to bring them together were repeatedly cancelled by officials citing security worries. Yesterday's talks were held on territory held by Mr Hekmatyar's Hezb-i-Islami forces, in a spot ringed by heavily-armed and nervous guerrillas. His guerrillas were forced out of Kabul to its southern fringes in the battles of late April and early May.</p>

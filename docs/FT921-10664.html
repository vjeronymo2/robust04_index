			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Elf expects 7.5% fall in profits ELF AQUITAINE, the larger of France's two state-controlled oil groups, yesterday estimated that 1991 net profits would show a 7.5 per cent decline. It attributed the setback to the decline in oil prices over the period, a depressed chemicals market, and steep growth in acquisitions and investments. Given the pressure on margins, the results were satisfactory, said Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, the chairman. According to Elf's estimate, net income fell to FFr9.8bn (Dollars 1.81bn) from FFr10.6bn in 1990, on sales up to FFr190bn from FFr175bn. This contrasts with the 41 per cent net profits increase expected for 1991 by Total, Elf's smaller state-controlled rival. Total depends more heavily on refining and has a lower exposure to oil price changes. The French government was due to sell just over 2 per cent of Elf's shares, worth about FFr2bn, before Christmas, but the plan has been shelved awaiting a fuller stock market recovery. Mr Le Floch-Prigent said it was up to his state shareholder to decide when to sell and he had no information on its plans. Elf's capital spending rose by 35 per cent last year to FFr42.5bn, including the acquisitions of a Norwegian oil group, refineries and filling stations in the UK, Spain and Germany, and Occidental Petroleum's North Sea acreage. Acquisitions of 48m tonnes of proven reserves and discoveries of 41m tonnes helped lift total reserves by 13.6 per cent to 475m tonnes. This was well on track for the group's ultimate target of 600m tonnes, said Mr Le Floch-Prigent. Elf was successfully continuing with its policy of getting a balance between its upstream and downstream businesses, so that half of last year's FFr19bn operating profits came from exploration and production, with the rest from refining, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Overall operating profits were FFr20.5bn in 1990. Three years ago, Elf drew nearly two-thirds of its operating earnings from upstream activities. By sector, operating profits in exploration and production fell to FFr9.5bn from FFr11.8bn, while earnings from refining and marketing rose to FFr4.6bn from FFr1.4bn, helped by an exceptional gain.</p>

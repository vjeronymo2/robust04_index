			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Westminster taxpayers 'have not suffered loss of money' Westminster City Council taxpayers have not suffered any loss of money through alleged gerrymandering, a public inquiry was told yesterday. The claim was made by Mr Anthony Scrivener who was opening the defence for Dame Shirley Porter, the former council leader. It is the first time that she has given a detailed response to allegations made five years ago. She and nine others were accused of gerrymandering in a provisional report by Mr John Magill, the district auditor. He found that council homes had been sold off in an attempt to attract potential Conservative voters into marginal wards before a closely-fought local election. Mr Magill is recommending that the 10 councillors and council officials should pay a surcharge of Pounds 21m, the sum which he believes was wasted. Mr Scrivener disclosed that he had obtained the opinions of three leading accountancy firms. All three 'wholly disagreed with the approach' taken by the district auditor when he had calculated the surcharge. 'In fact, there was no loss,' he said. The firms will be revealed later in his submission, which is expected to last up to four days. Mr Scrivener added that the district auditor had made 'a series of surprising and unique conclusions'. It was the first case in which a district auditor intended to surcharge councillors who had a scheme approved by a leading barrister before it was implemented, he said. He said that in the district auditor's report he had largely relied 'on the contents of political meetings as evidence for what happened in the council. That has never happened before'. He said councillors were well aware of the difference between what was said at political meetings with colleagues and what was decided in the council chamber with the advice of officials. The district auditor's report contains a long series of 'strictly confidential' political papers written by Dame Shirley and her colleagues for discussions in secret meetings.</p>

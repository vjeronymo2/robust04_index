With unusual speed, and not without help from certain  news agencies, rumors that the president's state of health had  deteriorated and that V. Chernomyrdin probably went to the Black  Sea coast to seize power in the country started to circulate in  the capital.    Although a little later the president's administration and  the government apparatus put out explanations to the effect that  everything is in order as regards the president's health, while  the need for Chernomyrdin's trip to Sochi was prompted by the  fact that the president has to sign an amended draft federal  budget to enable the State Duma to begin its discussion as soon  as possible, Monday morning passed off fairly nervously in many  of the capital's political lobbies and corridors of power.    Meanwhile, rumors of an imminent coup d'etat again started  to  circulate in political circles last week. Matters have reached  a point whereby a coup scenario has been actively circulated in  the State Duma and published in OBSHCHAYA GAZETA. Thus, there  is every reason to believe that last week's main event was that  no coup took place in our country.    Of course, the appearance of the latest putsch scenario  should be regarded as nothing but a common political  provocation, most likely undertaken with the aim of causing a  split in the executive branch's ranks. But we cannot fail to  notice a certain ordinariness in the situation. In several  recent years, starting in approximately 1988, the country has  regularly been rocked every few months by rumors of imminent  coups and putsches. Whereas there have been only two real  putsches -- in August 1991 and October 1993. Therefore we  cannot fail to ask ourselves: Why does the putsch problem arise  so persistently over and over again? Moreover, it arises in  Moscow at the highest echelons of federal power, at the same  time as the rest of Russia quietly lives its own life.    Recent observations of the dynamics of the development of  relations in the federal power system allow the detection of an  obvious regularity: Fuss and nervousness always begin at the  moment when the president is either absent or not engaged in  energetic political activity. The reason for this regularity is  no mystery: The Russian state structure's stability does not  rely on democratic institutions or on a balance between the  branches. The current regime's weakness lies in the fact that  it has gotten stuck halfway between totalitarianism and  democracy (or the other way round). Under this regime the state  of all democratic institutions depends on the actions (or  inaction) and the state of health of one person -- the  president. When applied to Third World countries an analogous  situation a customarily called a personal power regime.    We are witnessing a paradox: A strong executive branch  ensures stability in the state given an opposition parliament,  which cannot upset this stability. But at the same time the  executive branch itself, namely the federal executive branch, is  starting to discover signs of its own unstable state.    It is no longer a secret to anyone that the president,  especially in recent months, has been "in the shadows" much more  often than is warranted by the situation existing in the  country. Discussion of the reasons for this remains a taboo  topic for the public and mass media. Such discussions have been  declared unpatriotic. Whereas extremely vigorous debates about  this are being conducted in various corridors of federal power.  The president has only to provide just a little extra fuel for  these conversations (by going on leave, for example) for a fuss  to start in political lobbies and corridors of power and the  level of nervousness to reach the highest reading.    We have had an opportunity to observe all this during the  last week. Deputy V. Isakov's apparently quite unexpected  statement about the possibility of electing the president by a  kind of Assembly of the Land was immediately followed by a  statement from the opposite flank. M. Poltoranin proposed that  presidential and parliamentary elections be postponed until  1998. Almost simultaneously, as if on command, two movements --  "The Realists" and "Accord for Russia's Sake" -- were  established in Moscow. In actual fact they are preelection  blocs. A noteworthy detail is that the blocs' policy statements  say nothing about participation in the election campaign now  under way for local organs of power, although much is said about  presidential and parliamentary elections. It is logical to ask  why. Because elections to federal organs of power are not due  to take place for another two years. At last the latest putsch  scenario has appeared.    The evolving situation is surprisingly similar to that which  arose in Russia at the beginning of last summer. Then, let us  recall, all political forces threw themselves into preparing for  early parliamentary elections. This was at a time when both the  Supreme Soviet and the Congress, which were naturally against  these elections, were functioning. A constitution preventing  the holding of them was in force. In short, at that time early  parliamentary elections objectively seemed an unrealistic  possibility. BUT THEY TOOK PLACE! True, the route toward them  lay through the bloody events of September-October. It is hard  to say how exactly the development of the current situation will  repeat last year's situation. There are many similarities. But  besides this there is one really striking fact: The president's  edict on early presidential elections on 12 June 1994 is in  force. It is all the more surprising that the president  rescinded dozens of laws and edicts after the new constitution  was adopted. But not this edict.    It can be assumed that the ruling nomenklatura and leading  politicians are perfectly well aware of this. Their behavior  gives strong grounds for concluding that their actions are based  on the realistic possibility of an early presidential election.  It cannot be ruled out here that they are banking on the fact  that this election will take place in the not too distant  future. Although nobody is saying this openly.    The actual prospect of an early presidential election makes  the ruling nomeklatura extremely nervous and compels it to  commit acts which are not always well thought-out. Acts, for  instance, like the statements on the possibility of canceling or  postponing the general presidential election. Here, voluntarily  or involuntarily, Poltoranin and Isakov presented a united front  in support of the ruling nomenklatura, which is extremely  alarmed by the possibility of a politician like V. Zhirinovskiy  winning the election, because this would inevitably bring in its  wake the replacement of the nomenklatura bosses. For his part  Zhirinovskiy -- like, incidentally, other political leaders --  is strengthening his party ranks with increasing vigor. The  appearance of the putsch scenario does not look accidental  either. The possibility of an attempt to solve the problem by  means of force should apparently not be discounted.    However, while a president who has demonstrated, contrary to  all rumors, that he is healthy, energetic, and completely  capable is in power, we should most probably not fear such a  scenario of the development of events. There are two mutually  complementary methods of avoiding the distinct possibility of a  serious political crisis. Above all the president should  obviously make maximum effective use of the assets he has  available thanks to the new constitution, primarily a strong  executive branch, in order to stabilize the situation in the  economy. At the same time, although it is an extremely  difficult task, the state's democratic structure must be  strengthened. Within the framework in which the existing  constitution allows this to be done. Specifically, a Law on the  Constitutional Court must be adopted as soon as possible and all  participants in the political game forced to fulfill all  constitutional provisions unconditionally and strictly. Strong  presidential power is without any doubt capable of stabilizing  the economy. But a strong state, which everybody is talking  about at the moment, which does not have support in a developed  civic society will always be threatened by palace coups.  Therefore, once stability in the economy has been achieved  there must be further constitutional improvements in the area of  the democratic state structure and in the direction of  strengthening the representative branch and achieving a balance  between the branches, which will indicate the strengthening of  ties between the state and civic society. But in conditions of  economic instability (and three months' experience of the State  Duma's activity proves this convincingly) a weakening of the  executive branch in favor of the representative branch will most  likely lead to anarchy and then to seizure of power.    By taking these steps the president could lead the country  to the next presidential election and lay the foundation for a  new Russian democratic tradition: the legitimate primacy of  state power.    Otherwise, if the trend of preserving the situation (and  consequently preserving the democratic transformations and  economic reforms) is maintained, there will be a permanent  threat that the country will roll backwards. Just like the  threat that a most acute political crisis will arise. For  example, in the event that the election is won by a candidate  unacceptable to the highest political and state nomenklatura,  events could develop on the pattern of those which took place in  Algeria two years ago. When Islamic fundamentalists won the  parliamentary elections and the ruling regime annulled the  election results and declared a state of emergency in the  country. The state of emergency in Algeria is still in force.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vladivostok, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim  Yong-sam arrived here from Khabarovsk on Tuesday morning and  visited the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet, winding up his  seven-day trip to Russia and Uzbekistan.    On board an anti-submarine ship anchored alongside the  fleet's pier No. 33, Kim toured the warship's decks, torpedo  launchers and command post, guided by the fleet commander.    After the tour, he said it had taken nearly half a century  for a South Korean president to overcome the cold war and visit  Vladivostok, even though the city is within hailing distance of  the Tumen River.    "Standing here today, I've come to believe that the  half-century tragedy of the Korean peninsula has come to an  end," he remarked.    Noting that the ship he visited had fought on the allied  side  in the Persian Gulf war, Kim said South Korea had also joined  the allied effort in the war, adding that South Korea and Russia  will cooperate closely to ensure world peace and the security of  Northeast Asia.    "I'd like to share the impression I've got from Russia's  efforts at reform and openness with all peace-loving peoples,  and I sincerely hope that the day will soon come when the last  legacy of the cold war will disappear from the Korean peninsula  so that the way to this city will become much shorter and easier  for South Koreans," he said.    Kim's visit to the Russian fleet bore significance in that  it  has raised the possibility of South Korean-Russian military  cooperation, a ranking official accompanying Kim said.    Earlier in Khabarovsk, Kim met with the Khabarovsk  provincial  governor on the issues of South Korean corporations operating in  the Province and the interests and rights of ethnic Koreans.    In Vladivostok, he met the maritime province governor.    Kim is to leave for Seoul on Tuesday evening.</p>

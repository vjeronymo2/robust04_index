Most of the earth work of the project has been completed and  the first electric line has been laid on this section of the  Beijing- Guangzhou railway.    The upgrading project of the electrification section, which  is about 283 km long, started in March 1993. It is expected to  open for traffic by the end of 1995.    It is one of the ten key projects of China's railway  construction during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period  (1991-1995).

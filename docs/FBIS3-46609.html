			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Clarification" issued by King Norodom Sihanouk on 2 </F> January]    [Text] Yesterday and today, that is on 1 and 2 January,  BBC television carried an important report on the restriction of  press freedom in Cambodia, including a threat by the government  threat against any newspapers and journalists criticizing King  Norodom Sihanouk.    Concerning this matter, I, Norodom Sihanouk, would like to  emphasize again that there has been no punishment nor arrest of  any journalist or newspaper for criticizing, attacking,  insulting, or slandering me. No one has been arrested,  threatened, or accused because of me. Moreover, no courts will  examine nor make judgment on any newspaper or journalist because  of me.    In the case that there is any unfair or incorrect report in  newspapers affecting me, all I will do is make a clarification  like this one.    I would like to stress again that national and international  newspapers, radios, and televisions in Cambodia enjoy  100-percent full freedom. Cambodia's liberal democratic system  in the 1990's, at present, and in the future is as free as the  liberal democracy in France, the United Kingdom, Australia, the  United States, and other countries in the Western world.    [Signed] Norodom Sihanouk</p>

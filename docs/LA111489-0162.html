			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAR MARKET SLUMP FUELS 1% DECLINE IN OCTOBER RETAIL SALES  </P> <P> Retail sales, pulled back by a sluggish automobile market, fell 1% in October  for their first decline in eight months, the government reported today.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department said overall sales dropped to a seasonally adjusted  $144.5 billion last month after rising 0.9% in August and 0.7% in September.  </P> <P> The last time retail sales fell was in February, when they dropped 0.4%. They  were unchanged in June.  </P> <P> The October decline was the largest since a 6.7% drop in January, 1987.  </P> <P> Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity and  are watched as a sign of the extent to which the Federal Reserve's policy of  fighting inflation by tightening credit is slowing the economy.  </P> <P> Auto sales, lacking major incentive programs during the month, plunged 5.1% in  October. Car sales, which represent about 20% of the retail total, had been  propped up by incentives for much of the year and rose 0.5% in September and  2.2% in August.  </P> <P> The October decline was the largest since auto sales fell 26.5% in January,  1987.  </P> <P> Excluding the automobile category, retail sales edged up 0.2%.  </P> <P> Sales of durable goods -- items expected to last at least three years -- fell  2.7%, their steepest fall since a 2.8% decline in October 1987. Durable sales  were flat in September after gaining 2% in August.  </P> <P> The durable goods market has been particularly hard hit by the Fed's  interest-rate policies because such purchases often are financed by loans.  </P> <P> Sales of building materials rose 0.9% after falling 1.3% in September and  advancing 1.7% in August. Furniture and other home furnishing sales edged up  0.3% following a 0.6% drop in September and a 1.6% gain in August.  </P> <P> Sales of non-durable goods edged up 0.1%, following a 1.1% gain in September  and a 0.1% decline in August.  </P> <P> Non-durable categories showing increases were department stores, up 0.3%;  grocery stores, 1%; apparel, 0.2%, and drug stores, 1%.  </P> <P> Non-durable categories posting declines were gasoline stations, down 0.9%, and  restaurants and bars, off 0.2%.  </P> <P> For the three months from August through October, overall retail sales were up  6.3%. Sales for the first 10 months of 1989 were up 6% over the same period of  1988.  </P></p>

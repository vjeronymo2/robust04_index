			<p><P> December 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EDISON'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE MAY RETIRE NEXT YEAR;  </P> <P> UTILITIES: IF A PROPOSED $2.4-BILLION MERGER WITH SAN DIEGO GAS &amp; ELECTRIC  IS STILL PENDING WHEN HOWARD ALLEN TURNS 65 IN OCTOBER, THE BOARD MAY WANT HIM  TO STAY ON.  </P> <P> Howard P. Allen, the outspoken and colorful chairman of Southern California  Edison Co. and its holding company, said he might leave once he reaches the  utility's retirement age of 65 next October, but he added that he will wait  until August to decide.  </P> <P> In an interview, Allen also confirmed that he met earlier this month with each  member of the state Public Utilities Commission to say he was thinking of  retiring -- even though the company's controversial $2.4-billion proposed  merger with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. will probably remain unresolved at  the time of his departure.  </P> <P> "I felt that I should call on each commissioner and tell them that I would be  at normal retirement age in October and that I would be making a decision in  August on this," Allen said in the interview Thursday.  </P> <P> Opponents of the merger suggested that Allen might want to remove himself from  public scrutiny since his gruff style has been something of a lightning rod for  critics in San Diego.  </P> <P> Other observers said they doubt that Edison's board will let Allen -- the  architect of Edison's aggressive diversification -- go easily, since he is also  the moving force behind the merger.  </P> <P> Asked whether he wants to retire, the 36-year Edison veteran sidestepped the  question. "The board could conclude that it would be better if I stay on a year  and wind this thing up in the interests of consumers and an orderly  transition," he said. But he added, "I believe in normal retirement. A lot of  mischief can be played by well-intentioned, good people who stay on too long."  </P> <P> Likely candidates to succeed Allen include SCEcorp Executive Vice Presidents  John E. Bryson and Michael R. Peevey.  </P> <P> "It's difficult to tell how things will sort out because (Allen) exerted such a  strong hand in the company for a number of years," said Bud Moeller, a  utilities analyst with Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, an energy-consulting firm in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> Patrick Power, a former PUC administrative law judge and a lawyer specializing  in utilities issues, said: "He's a hard act to follow. . . . But I don't see  (Edison) losing direction. . . . If they stick to their business, they'll do  just fine."  </P> <P> Allen would leave behind an Edison career that climaxed with the company's  aggressive moves into non-regulated businesses that helped it earn record  profits in an increasingly competitive climate.  </P> <P> Allen put together the plan to merge Edison with SDG&amp;E, a deal that would  create the nation's largest supplier of electricity if it passes the lengthy  federal and state regulatory process now under way.  </P> <P> The proposed merger, though it has been approved by the San Diego utility's  board, has drawn heated opposition from local San Diego groups contending that  a merger would mean less control, higher rates, fewer jobs and more pollution  in their city. Edison denies the charges. Some critics have argued that Allen  himself has been insensitive to the concerns of San Diegans -- a charge that  Allen disputes.  </P> <P> Would Allen's retirement mollify the merger's opponents?  </P> <P> "I think there are some people here who would be glad to see him go, but I  don't think it would lessen the opposition," said Bob Hudson, executive  director of the broad-based Coalition for Local Control, a San Diego group  opposing the merger. "It's not a personality issue; it's about air pollution,  rates and local control."  </P> <P> Allen, a native of Upland and a former Stanford Law School professor, joined  Edison in 1954 as a lobbyist in Sacramento. He has been president of the  company since 1980 and chairman and chief executive since 1984. He holds the  same three titles with the parent company, SCEcorp.  </P> <P> Under Allen's stewardship, Edison has managed to steer away from investments in  troubled nuclear projects or savings and loans that have proven disastrous for  other utility companies. Faced with federal and state regulations that require  Edison to buy power from independent producers at rates set by regulators,  Allen oversaw the creation of a power producer, Mission Energy, a separate  subsidiary of SCEcorp, to sell power to Edison.  </P> <P> Allen has been a vocal opponent of such regulations.  </P></p>

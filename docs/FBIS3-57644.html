			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belsky] </F>   [Text] Moscow January 27 TASS -- Former Soviet Defence  Minister Dmitriy Yazov, one of the 1991 August failed coup  leaders, now tried for high treason admitted on Thursday that  troops had been brought into Moscow regularly between 1990 and  1991 and it had never been registered in any documents.    Yazov said that in the majority of cases former Soviet  President Mikhail Gorbachev had issued only "oral instructions,"  adding that even the deployment of troops in Baku in january  1990 had not been preceded by such "formalities" as a written  order of the Soviet president.    At the previous hearings, the former defence minister denied  statements that plans had been made to storm the White House,  the seat of Russian President Boris Yeltsin at that time.    He admitted that the coup attempt was unconstitutional as  were the measures taken against the former soviet president who  was removed from power and isolated at his Black Sea dacha.    He said the reasons for declaring a state of emergency in  the  former Soviet Union were extraordinary and much stronger than  was envisaged by the law on the state of emergency.    Yazov stressed that he had ordered the troops on high alert,  but denied he had ordered Soviet Air Forces on full combat  readiness. He noted that all orders to the troops had been sent  by the command of the airborne troops, who, apparently, have  overstepped their powers.</p>

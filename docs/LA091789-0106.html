			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AN ALARMING TREND  </P> <P> This Tuesday, for the first time, candidates for San Diego City Council will be  running for office under a "district only" format, meaning that candidates will  be elected exclusively by voters living within a candidate's home council  district.  </P> <P> Before this year, council candidates ran within the district in the September  primary, with the top two vote-getters entering a citywide runoff election in  November. But no more. Voter approval of Proposition E last November mandates  that council members be elected solely by the district they seek to represent.  </P> <P> Because this year's council elections are the first to be held under the new  district-only format, we're not really sure what to expect. We do know that  voter turnout in the past primary elections for these four council seats --  Districts 1, 3, 5 and 7 -- has shown a steady decline since the mid 1970s.  </P> <P> In fact, the last time these four seats were up for election, in 1985, voter  turnout in the primary set an all-time low, at 16%. The election before that,  in 1981, was only slightly better, with a turnout of 22.5%. This decline  parallels voter turnout trends in California and the United States.  </P> <P> This gradual, but unrelenting, erosion in public participation is cause for  alarm. Passive acceptance of a system perceived to be working can be the  beginning of the end of the historical reasons it was founded: freedom to  exercise our vote, to preserve our liberties, rights and privileges.  </P> <P> CHARLES G. ABDELNOUR  </P> <P> San Diego City Clerk  </P></p>

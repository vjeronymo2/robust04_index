			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / 'Civilian glove for Nigeria's military fist': The latest twist in the country's muddled search for democracy 'PART farce, part tragedy, total confusion,' commented a retired Nigerian diplomat after a weekend which saw a dramatic twist in his country's muddled search for democracy. It would not be possible to re-run the annulled presidential elections held last June, President Ibrahim Babangida told Nigerians on Saturday. Instead, an interim government would soon take charge. But he failed to answer the question everyone was asking: when will the soldiers, in power since 1985, return to barracks? There is growing suspicion that the move is not simply a further delay in the military handover to civilians, still officially set for August 27. Instead, it could be designed to extend Gen Babangida's hold on office well into the future. Co-opted politicians drawn from two weak parties, lured by the massive oil-financed patronage that Gen Babangida dispenses, could help him put 'a civilian glove over the military fist', as one Nigerian described it. Such a ploy could exacerbate rather than resolve the country's political and economic crisis. Window-dressing will not improve the domestic standing of a deeply unpopular regime. Nor will it satisfy western governments and creditors, who have made clear that rescheduling the country's Dollars 34bn (Pounds 22.8bn) external debt depends not only on economic reform, but on the ending of military rule. Some Nigerian analysts suggest that Gen Babangida is ready to go, but needs a safe way out. 'A civilian government, yes, but one that he is certain will be able to guarantee his security, and not investigate allegations of corruption,' as one put it. Others fear the general has become wedded to power. He has postponed the transition to democracy three times before, but always giving a new date for the termination of military rule. This time he gave no deadline. 'It confirms what we have been saying for three years now, that Babangida is not planning to go,' says Mr Olisa Agbakoba, president of Nigeria's Civil Liberties Organisation. 'But what has changed is that the parties have collaborated in the extension of military rule. This means that they are no longer the focus of civilian opposition to this regime.' In the deal reached at the weekend, the executives of the Social Democratic party (SDP) and the National Republican Convention (NRC) agreed unconditionally to form an unelected interim government - without knowing its powers, duties, membership or term of office, or whether Gen Babangida will remain president after August 27. Resistance from other quarters has so far proved ineffectual. The Civil Liberties Organisation proposes a mass stoppage which will 'paralyse the economy'. But unemployment is high, the trade unions are weak and labour leaders seem as susceptible as the politicians to being co-opted. Meanwhile, Mr Moshood Abiola, the SDP's apparently successful presidential candidate in the June poll, seems stymied, notwithstanding his considerable support in the predominantly Yoruba and mainly Christian south. Though Mr Abiola is retaining his claim to the presidency, his own party executive is co-operating with Gen Babangida. Mr Abiola has denounced the interim government, described his party's participation as a sell-out, and told a crowd in Lagos on Saturday: 'I am prepared to face the firing squad of President Ibrahim Babangida.' But with Mr Abiola deserted by the SDP executive, Gen Babangida will not need to take such drastic action. The party's split was emphasised yesterday when 24 of its 30 state chairmen denounced the national chairman's call for an interim government. The weak state of the parties is hardly surprising. They are both creations of the government. Their credibility was already impaired because the original presidential candidates in October 1992 (in an earlier, also aborted, campaign) were banned from further political activity. But these leaders are still among the power brokers, and significantly seem to have opted to avoid confrontation - no doubt bearing in mind that there seems little likelihood of an effective challenge to the president from within the army. Among these power brokers is the group of religious and community leaders known as the northern elders which met last Thursday. They backed the interim government, and their delegation to Abuja included the presidential front-runners last year, Mr Shehu Yar'Adua and Mr Adamu Ciroma. Equally significant is the stance of the other main non-party pressure group, led by retired General Olusegun Obasanjo, who led Nigeria's military regime from 1976 until handing over to an elected civilian government in 1979. Although the fiercest critic of Mr Babangida's presidency in recent months, he has given guarded support to the proposal for an interim government. 'The country cannot be allowed to drift indefinitely. We have to move forward somehow,' he said on Sunday. 'It's not the best solution, or even the fourth-best solution, but when all other sensible routes have been blocked by this president, I think we have to take it.' The sentiments go to the heart of the opposition's dilemma: confrontation is either not feasible or it is potentially destabilising, but going along with an interim government may be playing into Gen Babangida's hands. If they are to placate the sceptics, Gen Obasanjo and his colleagues have to show there is a middle way: that participation in an interim government will curtail the president's time in office and not unwittingly extend it.</p>

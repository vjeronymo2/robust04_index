Comrade Kim Chong-il in the work exposed the reactionary  nature of all abuses of socialism and their falsity and gave  scientific answers to the questions of principle arising in  defending the cause of socialism and carrying it to  accomplishment.    The work has evoked widespread repercussions upon the  political, public and press circles of the world in the last one  year since its publication for the invincibility and profundity  of its contents.    Former journalist of the Russian paper IZVESTIYA Ivan  Robodap  who had read the work said in an article titled "Hard Blow":    "Comrade Kim Chong-il, with a clear-cut analysis, dealt a  crushing blow to the attempts to hamstring and reverse the true  significance of the contents of socialism, labelling it as  `totalitarian', `barracks-like' and `administrative and  commanding'. He completely unmasked the slanderers and renegades  of the people's cause."    The revolutionary parties of the world are unanimous in  saying that the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il gives perfect  answers to the questions raised by the present times and serves  as a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon for all the  progressive political parties aspiring after the building of a  new society. They adopted the work as their must book or passed  decisions supporting it.    A meeting of the Political Bureau of the new Communist Party  of Great Britain adopted the work of Comrade Kim Chong-il as a  must book of the party and distributed it within the party,  while the people's front of workers, peasants and students of  Peru discussed the work at its political committee and adopted a  resolution supporting it.    Seminars on the work were held by the group for the study of  the chuche idea of Comrade Kim Il-song in Austria, the Burkina  national group of the chuche idea, chuche idea study groups and  organisations for friendship and solidarity in Nepal, Tanzania  and other countries.    The Rwandan committee for the study of the chuche idea made  public a statement supporting the work and mass media of  different countries including "BOLSHEVIK", the magazine of the  All-Union Bolshevik Communist Party, carried articles  introducing the work. And figures of political, public and other  circles issued statements explaining the importance and  significance of the work.    Director General of the International Institute of the  Chuche  Idea Shuhachi Inoue who is the first winner of the  "International Kim Il-song Prize", said after reading the work:    "Socialism collapsed in some countries. But this cannot  change the trend of the time. Today, mankind sees Korean-style  socialism, the tower of success of socialism which stands in  bolder relief, and gains confidence in socialism and its  prospect from it. Frankly speaking, socialism is immediately  Korea and vice versa today."    Eric Trevett, general secretary of the Central Committee of  the New Communist Party of Great Britain, said that the work of  Comrade Kim Chong-il is a highly important work which deals a  telling blow to the imperialists, world reactionaries and  revisionists and inspires the revolutionary peoples of the world  with hope and courage.    The work of Comrade Kim Chong-il is a powerful ideological  and theoretical weapon which gives a decisive blow to the  counterrevolutionary moves and dastardly sophism of the  imperialists and the foes of socialism and powerfully propels  the socialist movement in the present times.</p>

			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISN'T THE REAL WALL ST. INTERESTING ENOUGH?;  </P> <P> RASCAL MONEY BY JOSEPH R. GARBER (CONTEMPORARY BOOKS: $17.95; 401 PP.;  0-8092-4285-0)  </P> <P> You could almost make a case that Wall Street has been ignored in literature.  "Bonfire of the Vanities" was the first important novel on the subject to be  published in 50 years. The last one before that was Dos Passos' "The Big Money"  (1936). These two are the only major works that come to mind.  </P> <P> In addition, there's been only a smattering of minor works that could be called  literary -- Louis Auchincloss' "The Embezzler," a satirical play called "The  Henrietta" and a lighthearted poem, "Pan in Wall Street," all written decades  ago, and all of which could fit into into a single briefcase.  </P> <P> Upton Sinclair, who specialized in capitalism, wrote novels about the meat  packers and the coal barons but not about the stock market, and few characters  from fine novels ever have even worked on Wall Street. There's Nick Carraway  from "The Great Gatsby," a bond trader, and then Tom Wolfe's bond trader -- but  who else? No writer has done for the stockbroker what Sinclair Lewis did for  the real-estate agent or Arthur Miller for the traveling salesman, and the last  interesting bookkeeper to come out of a novel is Uriah Heep.  </P> <P> The scarcity of Wall Street novel is curious, considering that Wall Street is  the capital of capitalism where fortunes are won and lost every day, where 45  million of us are directly invested and millions more are indirectly involved.  Enough nonfiction books on investing are published each year to fill several  library shelves, and readers have an insatiable appetite for financial stories  in magazines. Why is it, then, that these money-making dramas are so rarely  played out in fiction?  </P> <P> One explanation is that financial maneuverings on Wall Street are so  complicated that to describe them correctly and still hold a reader's interest  is next to impossible. It's no problem for the how-to writer who knows he has a  captive audience: People will slog through hundreds of incomprehensible pages  if they think there's a profit in it. Not so with a novel. By the time you've  explained how your main character, a futures and options speculator, hedges his  long position by selling baskets of stocks he doesn't own, you've lost the  narrative drive and nobody much cares what happens to him.  </P> <P> A second explanation is that the people who write novels have it in their heads  that Wall Street is very dull. I don't know where this notion got started, but  it certainly was shared by all the participants in every creative writing class  I took -- at Yale, even, which is a regular boot camp for Wall Street. Whenever  we had to describe an interesting subject in 300 words or less, the subject  always was a hot dog vendor or a lady sleeping on a park bench, and never an  investment banker, a mergers-and-acquisitions specialist, a securities analyst.  The professors didn't actually say Wall Street was dull, but the artsy  viewpoint was that financial types were unromantic and shallow, not to mention  piggy, and could hardly inspire a mediocre short essay, not to mention a  350-page opus.  </P> <P> When we went to New York on a creative-writing trip, it was not to visit Wall  Street at the opening bell but rather the Fulton Fish market at 5 a.m. There  was something worth being creative about.  </P> <P> I don't know this for a fact, but I wouldn't be surprised if such diverse  talents as Updike, Hemingway, Salinger and Bellow also believed that Wall  Street was dull, or else they would have at some point put it in a story. Since  baseball, fishing, adolescence and being Jewish appealed as subjects to these  great writers, then Wall Street must have seemed terrifically boring for them  to have overlooked it.  </P> <P> (I went to school in the late 1960s, when the idea of Wall Street's being dull  was widely accepted. In the recent college classes, where there's wild  enthusiasm for the $250,000 starting salaries on Wall Street and 75% of the  students aspire to careers in mergers and acquisitions, perhaps Wall Street has  become more popular in the writing seminars).  </P> <P> The truth of the matter is that Wall Streeters do, in fact, try as hard as they  can to appear to be dull. They accomplish this by all wearing the same tan  Burberries and dark suits, carrying the same burgundy briefcases, behaving  predictably at public functions, and saying nothing to reporters that is  remotely odd or controversial. This helps along the impression that they aren't  really worth writing about, and may have kept the better novelists off their  trail.  </P> <P> This brings us to "Rascal Money," a new Wall Street novel that if nothing else  ought to be praised for simply having been written. On the other hand, the  author, described in the publicity blurb as a "well-respected business  analyst," must think that Wall Street is pretty boring himself. I'm presuming  this because of the considerable effort he makes to jazz up his story with  silly characters, including a mobster named Guiseppe Verrazano (alias Joey the  Bridge), a Hopi Indian, a demented computer hacker, two bumbling KGB agents,  several thugs from the Japanese Order of the Chrysanthemum, an advertising  executive who batters her husbands and leaves them in traction, and a CEO's  wife who writes pornographic novels on the side.  </P> <P> The basic plot -- small and unprofitable company run by inept manager attempts  to acquire large and profitable company run by very capable manager -- is  exactly the kind of thing we've been reading about in the newspaper, but here  it's lost in gratuitous nonsense. A big crane falls on corporate headquarters,  the KGB agents try to assassinate the computer hacker, General MacArthur is  dragged up from the Inchon Landing, a Hollywood producer attempts to seduce  adoring starlets at lunch, and there are stories within stories from Icelandic  literature.  </P> <P> Also, we're introduced briefly to a gay Jesuit prom queen; Daphne X, a black  woman who's against sexism; Rama Krishna Shapiro, a "saffron-robed wellness  therapist," and a banker named Nick Lee, whose real name turns out to be  Nicodemus Leibowitz even though his parents are Anglicans. These are only a few  of the silly characters -- caricatures mostly -- who detract from the story.  </P> <P> "Rascal Money" could have been a satire, except that half the time it's trying  to be serious, and by then it's too late.  </P> <P> My purpose is not to criticize this uneven first effort, but simply to point  out that it's one more example of a novel that isn't really about Wall Street.  </P> <P> Come to think of it, with Boesky in jail and Bilzerian convicted, Milken  indicted, Warner chasing Time, Time chasing Warner, Warner chasing Paramount,  Kravis suing Kohlberg (or is it the other way around?), Pickens raiding Japan,  Japan buying the Rockefellers, and Campeau nearly ruined, who needs Wall Street  fiction, anyway?  </P></p>

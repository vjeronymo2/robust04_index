			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SAVVY TRAVELER: A WAR OF REMEMBRANCE IN NAGASAKI  </P> <P> Every few days, as a luxury foreign cruise ship emerges from the Inland Sea of  Japan and enters the harbor, the old woman watches.  </P> <P> The ship takes the same route the Portuguese did hundreds of years ago,  rounding a natural anchorage and heading for a berth at one of Nagasaki's  piers.  </P> <P> Tugboats greet the ship with toots of their horns. And, as it approaches the  main ship terminal, its passengers -- most of them American -- are suddenly  treated to the tinny sounds of American standards blaring from four  loudspeakers: bad recordings of "Whistle While You Work," "Davy Crockett," "Zip  a Dee Doo Dah" and "When You Wish Upon a Star."  </P> <P> The old woman watches the passengers disembark and head for their assigned tour  buses. They will only be in port for a few hours. Some will go to Glover Garden  or the Madame Butterfly House. Others will go to the Confucius Shrine.  </P> <P> But the old woman sits and wonders how many will go to the Atomic Bomb Museum  and Peace Park. She leaves her house and goes to the museum to greet any  visitors that might arrive. She wants to tell her story.  </P> <P> Forty-four years ago this week, on Aug. 9 at 11:02 a.m., an atomic bomb was  dropped above the northern part of the city that turned Nagasaki into a valley  of desolation. It killed 73,884 people and injured 76,796 others. Another  120,820 were left homeless.  </P> <P> Hideko Yoshiyama knows these figures precisely because she was there. And she  survived.  </P> <P> I found her standing outside the museum. The building is a moving monument of  apocalypse. It was crowded with children, many only 4 and 5 years old.  </P> <P> "Every schoolchild in Nagasaki comes here," she said. "We consider it an  essential part of their education."  </P> <P> The children watch a film about Aug. 9, made in 1952 by the U.S. Army. The  grainy black-and-white documentary shows the destruction, the devastation, the  death.  </P> <P> "The A-bomb is terrible," says the announcer. "It hurts us. Please, no more  wars. These children will never return. They are resting in some unknown place  dreaming of a peaceful Nagasaki."  </P> <P> For Hideko Yoshiyama it is a recurring dream and a recurring nightmare.  </P> <P> "It was a hot summer day, just like today," she said. She was 22 years old at  the time. "I was in the office of the Mitsubishi Steel Works (about  three-quarters of a mile from the center of the explosion).  </P> <P> "Each morning I commuted by tramcar to work. In the early morning hours of Aug.  9 the air-raid sirens sounded. We escaped to the mountains. But no attack came.  Then later we returned to work."  </P> <P> Shortly before 11 a.m. she was back at her desk when it happened. When she  touched the doorknob it was very hot.  </P> <P> "I smelled magnesium, then the windows blew in," Yoshiyama said. "I started to  bleed. I fainted, lost consciousness. I have no idea how much time I lost. When  I woke up I was covered with glass, and many slivers of glass were imbedded in  my body.  </P> <P> "I got up and went into the office. Most of my fellow workers were dead,  covered by the rubble. The whole building had been destroyed, and I was  standing in the middle of a deformed steel skeleton. I fainted again."  </P> <P> She ran from the building. "Along the way I saw nothing but dying people. It  was as if we had all stopped breathing. Everything was reduced to  shapelessness. There was no time to contemplate the unthinkable. But I remember  thinking that I could not see a single blade of green grass.  </P> <P> "When I got to the air-raid shelter it was already full. People were crawling  to the river to drink the water, and they were dying from the water, but they  didn't know it."  </P> <P> In the underground center she heard a co-worker calling her name. "She asked me  what happened. I did not know what to say. She asked me for water. I got her  some. I said, 'You look very beautiful.' She smiled and sipped the water. And  then she died."  </P> <P> Three days later Hideko's mother found her. "She took me to her house in a  small two-wheel cart. There was no food to eat, nothing to drink. The  vegetables were half-cooked by the heat. But we didn't know anything about  radiation. We ate them."  </P> <P> Ten days later, when she went to comb her hair, it fell out. Her gums were  bleeding, she had a severe fever and diarrhea, and she began to urinate blood.  "My mother took me to the doctor, but he said nothing could be done. He told my  mother to take me back."  </P> <P> Hideko began to hallucinate. "I felt I was dreaming. I was in Paradise. And  someone was calling my name. It was my father."  </P> <P> One of her sisters died a year after the blast. Her second sister died in 1987  from leukemia.  </P> <P> Miraculously, Yoshiyama survived.  </P> <P> She has been hospitalized 16 times. She's had lung operations, and one of her  breasts has been removed. Glass slivers from the blast are permanently imbedded  in her other breast.  </P> <P> But Hideko Yoshiyama firmly holds onto her life. For her, Aug. 9 is every day,  her permanent mission and a continuing struggle to pray for peace, to educate,  to remember.  </P> <P> "The yen may be powerful," she said with a smile, "and the expense of getting  to and from Japan may be high. But nothing is more valuable than life. People  should come here and see what happened so that they will know never to do it  again. Nagasaki should be the last place on earth to be destroyed by nuclear  weapons."  </P> <P> The Atomic Bomb Museum receives 50,000 foreign visitors a year. "But it's not  enough," she said. Hideko and some of the other survivors find it odd that in  this nuclear age many world leaders have visited Japan, but no U.S. President  has ever visited Nagasaki to see what really happened.  </P> <P> "On this anniversary I hope I can put this terrible and terrifying experience  into human perspective," she said. "I appreciate the preciousness of being  alive, the dignity of human life.  </P> <P> "I have experienced in my flesh and witnessed in my eyes the horror of the bomb  and the misery of war. I have lived in the fear of radiation. It gives me more  encouragement to talk about my experience.  </P> <P> "I would like to meet the leaders of nuclear powers. If I ever get that chance,  I would ask them to join hands to make this world free from nuclear threat.  </P> <P> "Until then," she said with a sigh, "the prayer for world peace continues."  </P> <P> She wished me a good trip back home.  </P> <P> "I hope that you will sometimes think of me, an old woman in Nagasaki, a  survivor."  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The Atomic Bomb Museum and Peace Park in Nagasaki is open daily from 9 a.m. to  6 p.m. April through October, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. November through March.  Admission is 50 yen for adults, 30 yen for children.  </P></p>

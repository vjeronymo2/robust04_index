			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / 'Such a bright talent has been so cruelly lost to us all' Mr John Major yesterday paid tribute to a 'formidable opponent' whom he liked and respected. The prime minister's praise came as scores of tributes to John Smith were offered by politicians of all parties and by figures from many areas of public life. The Queen sent a personal message of condolence to Mr Smith's widow, Elizabeth. UK business figures issued tributes, recognising that Mr Smith had sought a constructive relationship with the City and industry. In Westminster there was widespread praise for the former Labour leader's integrity, his strong political convictions and his keen wit. Labour MPs expressed the certainty that, had he lived, Mr Smith would have led the party to win the next general election. In a crowded Commons chamber, Mr Major spoke of his 'deep shock and sadness' at Mr Smith's death. He described him as 'one of the outstanding parliamentarians of modern politics'. He could 'shape and move' the Commons, and knew exactly how and when to move from one mood to another for maximum effect. 'These are formidable skills, they are rare skills,' said Mr Major. 'And even for those against whom those skills were deployed, it is hard to bear that we will never see or hear those skills in this House again.' From the Labour benches, Mr Neil Kinnock, Mr Smith's predecessor as Labour leader, said he was 'desolated' by news of his death. He said his grief was mixed with anger: 'Anger that he has gone when his vitality and his value were so clear, anger that he has been denied the chance to show the full scope of his great talents in the highest office.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also spoke of the 'injustice that such a bright talent, so close to the point of fulfilment, has been so cruelly lost to us all'. He added: 'We have lost today one of the foremost parliamentary talents of our time.' Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister, said Mr Smith had been an outstanding leader of the opposition: 'His dignity, his mind, his solemnity and his sense of humour made him ideal for the job.' Several union leaders - with whom Mr Smith had not always enjoyed an easy relationship - expressed deep sadness. Mr Alan Jinkinson, general secretary of Unison, the UK's biggest union, said: 'The Labour party and the country have suffered a huge and devastating loss.' Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, spoke of 'a tragic loss for the whole country'. Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, said the business community would be 'very sad' at the death of such a 'talented parliamentarian with whom it has enjoyed a friendly and constructive working relationship'. Mr Peter Morgan, director-general of the Institute of Directors, said: 'John Smith was a very decent man and will be a loss to British politics. 'He recognised the key role which business had to play if his policies were to be fulfilled.' Mr Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister, was among European socialist leaders who paid tribute. 'I am shocked and stunned,' he said. 'This man loved life, he was joyful. He was a fervent European.'</p>

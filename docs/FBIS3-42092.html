			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By United News of India] </F>   [Text] Bombay, Jan. 21 -- The Tarapur Atomic Power Station  (TAPS) will switch over to indigenously developed mixed oxide  fuel (MOX) in a phased manner from its next refueling stage in  February, shedding its dependence on imported enriched uranium  for power generation, Nuclear Power Corporation managing  director S.K. Chatterjee said on Thursday.    Mr. Chatterjee told news persons that this would be the  first  experiment of partly using the indigenous fuel to operate the  Tarapur Atomic Power Plant in view of the uncertainty about  renewal of supply of enriched uranium from France under the  India-U.S.- France tripartite agreement which ended in October.    He said that to begin with, two bundles of mixed oxide fuel  along uranium stock from the previous contract was over, would  start using a mix of low-enriched uranium and MOX at the TAPS.    Mr. Chatterjee said "We are [word as published] no fuel  problem till the end of 2,000 AD."    However, he said the options for procuring enriched uranium  would continue to be explored. "We would buy it from whosoever  was willing to give it to us," he said while asserting that  "enriched uranium or no enriched uranium, we have to, and will  run TAPS and have uninterrupted power generation."    Mr. Chatterjee said the Atomic Energy Commission chairman  had  already said that India had the capacity to run the two units of  TAPS project -- one indigenously -- and also had the capability  to produce enriched uranium.    Indian scientists had fully perfected the art of producing  MOX and using it as a substitute to enriched uranium for  operation TAPS.    Mr. Chatterjee said TAPS would complete successful operation  of 25 years on April 1, 1994 and enter into the 26th year. "We  will run it for another 14 years."    He said the safety assessment for renewal of operations had  already been completed by SARRA [expansion unknown] after  inspection.</p>

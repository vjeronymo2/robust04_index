			<p>931224 FT  24 DEC 93 / Food &amp; Drink: For Christmas, an irreverent priest - A crumbling colonial hotel in Macau gave Kieran Cooke an unrepeatable lunch The monsignor was rolling a string of spaghetti unenthusiastically onto his fork. 'The worst part about being in Rome was the confessions. The smell of garlic. It would knock you over. And the sins were so boring - I was expecting far more spice. It was very disappointing. I thought the Italians had more imagination.' He put his head back and laughed uproariously. There is nothing more irreverent than an irreverent priest. We were starting Christmas dinner in the darkened dining room of the Bela Vista hotel in Macau, that strange postage stamp of Portuguese territory stuck on the rump of China. It was 1978. Manuela shared our table. She was on her way to see her daughter in Tokyo. One day, the daughter had arrived home in Rome to say that she was going to marry Yoshi, her judo teacher. The daughter had become a black belt but the marriage had hit the canvas. Manuela was taking a couple of days in Macau to brace herself before coming to grips with the judo instructor. The monsignor once supervised marriage annulments in California. 'They're very modern over there. They would come looking for annulments not only on the grounds of physical non-consummation but saying the marriage was psychologically non-consummated as well.' Another frenzied laugh, like a happy horse rising on its hind legs. The other diners looked on curiously. Portuguese men with blazers hung elegantly on their shoulders endeavoured to prise open bread rolls. Jewelled ladies hacked away at pieces of ancient mutton. The Bela Vista is now a tasteful, if expensive, rest house. Back in the 1970s, it was a crumbling colonial pile, with Russian-style plumbing and shocking electrics. Once, staying in one of its rooms with sinking bed and heavy, southern European furniture, I pulled the curtain closed. It fell down on top of me, filling my lungs with the dust of Portuguese explorers. People visited the Bela Vista because it was different. It was famous for its magnificent view over the Pearl River estuary - and its truly diabolical food. The owner, a corpulent Portuguese colonial who drank vast quantities of white port, laboured hard at serving up the inedible. The coffee was especially famous - the best purgative in the east. At opportune times, as in the middle of Christmas dinner, the owner would have full-blooded arguments with his wife. At least, one assumed it was the wife. She was never seen. We called her the V-bomber: all you heard was a high-pitched whine and then a crash as porcelain hit the wall. Manuela was asking the monsignor about the Pope. The monsignor had done time at the Vatican as a papal diplomat. 'He's pleasant enough.' A priestly pause. 'But all this talking in 46 languages and running around the world kissing the tarmac - I prefer my popes a bit more dignified. Behind high walls. Only appearing to say something momentous occasionally.' We tried to identify what vegetables had been served. Whatever they were, they had met with an accident somewhere along the way. The monsignor liked the pope's conservatism. 'If it was me - which it never will be - I'd go back to the Latin mass. We need more incense, more candles, more mystery.' The dining room had plenty of mystery. The lighting was on the blink. The waiters were a central feature of the old Bela Vista. It didn't matter if the lights were on or off, they always bashed into the tables, upsetting soup spoons between bowl and mouth or causing forks to become lodged in ear lobes. Their average age was well over 60. They were the only Chinese I have ever heard use the word 'Chow'. They all had much-mended, starched, white uniforms. If you so much as paused between mouthfuls, your plate would be whisked away. Meals were over very quickly - no bad thing considering the quality of the cuisine. 'What's that?' asked Manuela. A waiter had, rather unsteadily, set down a flaming dark mass in the middle of the table. 'Christmas pudding?' I suggested. There was a pop and a tired wheeze, like the air going out of a balloon. The pudding shrank to an eighth of its size. 'It's a miracle,' said the monsignor. We didn't touch it. There was a miracle of sorts. Someone produced a round of rich Portuguese cheese. The blue-blazered men, their elegant ladies and all of us dug in. The owner, satiated after another high-spirited kitchen encounter, lit candles and brought round the port. A very scratched fado record was playing. Eyes were wetting. 'Do you know,' whispered Manuela, 'I once knew a young, very handsome English seminarian in Rome. He decided to give it all up after studying for years.' 'Sex again, I suppose?' sighed the monsignor. 'No, not that at all,' said Manuela. 'He came to my house one morning with such a look on his face. I will always remember it. Resigned yet contented, as if he had finally discovered the essence of something. 'He said he'd been walking through the early-morning market. He had gone past the flower stalls and then through all the piles of fresh vegetables. 'He stopped and looked around. There and then, he decided that he could not go on with his studies. He said the vegetables had done it.' The monsignor roared.</p>

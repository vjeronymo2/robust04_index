			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / International Company News: Finnair warns of difficult period as deficit widens FINNAIR, Finland's national airline, yesterday announced a steep increase in its loss for last year and warned that the current 12 months would again be extremely difficult, Reuter reports from Helsinki. However, the slight upturn in the Finnish economy gave hope for an improvement, it said. 'The poor domestic market situation means that the 1993-94 financial year will be tough, but the steps which have been initiated and the slight upturn in the economy give hope for an improvement,' Finnair said. For the year ended March, Finnair posted a FM415m (Dollars 75.3m) loss after financial items, compared with a deficit of FM197m in 1991-92. Turnover was FM5.46bn, against FM5.44bn.

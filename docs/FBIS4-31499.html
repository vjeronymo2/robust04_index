			<p>BFN     [Text] According to officials of the Council of Europe, the  new Hungarian law on foreigners violates two paragraphs of the  European Human Rights Convention. The new law decrees that  certain foreigners have to undergo an AIDS test; this is  contrary to stipulations of the international agreement which  bans discrimination and disallows judging applications for  asylum on the basis of health. This is what the  English-language BUDAPEST WEEK writes.</p>

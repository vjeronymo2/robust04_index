			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: DISNEYLAND AREA: FOCUS;  </P> <P> WHAT ALL THOSE SIGNS MAY INDICATE TO VISITORS  </P> <P> Neon signs, blinking signs, square signs, round signs, signs with letters  missing and every other type of sign imaginable inundate the area surrounding  California's largest amusement park -- Disneyland. Adding to the visual  pandemonium are utility poles and wires that extend along Harbor Boulevard as  far as the eye can see.  </P> <P> Newcomers deciding to take a drive or a stroll along Harbor Boulevard between  Katella Avenue and the Santa Ana Freeway might very well wonder whether they  took a wrong turn and ended up in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Some of the older inns and motels, toiling amid all the joviality and  merrymaking in Walt Disney's dynasty, are starting to show signs of wear. The  consensus among merchants and residents in neighborhoods bordering the Magic  Kingdom is that the area has taken a turn for the worse.  </P> <P> An ad hoc group called the Anaheim Committee for Traffic Solutions --  consisting of city officials, motel and hotel owners and local business folks  -- is ready to do something to rescue the area. Is am important consideration  for Anaheim: The Harbor Boulevard strip sees 12 million visitors a year.  </P> <P> The group has been meeting monthly at the Jolly Roger Inn near Katella Avenue  and Harbor Boulevard to determine what to do with the aging, overbuilt  community. Among the possibilities under discussion are:  </P> <P> * Formulating a uniform sign code; using monument or ground-level signs.  </P> <P> * Concealing utility wires underground. (In mid-January, the City Council  decided to commission a $146,000 study to determine whether to place  underground the utility lines in the Disneyland-Anaheim Convention Center  area.)  </P> <P> * Improving traffic flow and congestion (perhaps through a monorail or people  mover).  </P> <P> * Improving landscaping.  </P> <P> The 20-year-old Anaheim Convention Center, just across the street from  Disneyland, is undergoing a $50-million expansion and renovation. When work is  completed in the spring of 1990, the center will include a 150,000-square-foot  exhibit hall and a 530-space parking structure underneath.  </P> <P> In 1987, 35.3 million people visited Anaheim and Orange County and spent $5.1  billion on dining, shopping and entertaining, according to the Area Visitors  and Convention Bureau. (Visitor totals for 1988 have not yet been compiled.)  </P> <P> But the hotels, motels and other businesses along the Harbor Boulevard-Katella  Avenue axis depend heavily on new attractions to draw more visitors into the  area. The hope is that Disneyland's new ride, Splash Mountain, scheduled to be  ready for the influx of summer tourists, will help reverse 1988's 2% occupancy  decline for the 17,000 motel and hotel rooms surrounding the park.  </P> <P> Population  </P> <P> Total: (1988 est.) 5,034  </P> <P> 1980-88 change: +4.4%  </P> <P> Median Age: 27.9  </P> <P> Racial/ethnic mix:  </P> <P> White (non-Latino): 48%  </P> <P> Latino: 45%  </P> <P> Black: 1%  </P> <P> Other: 6%  </P> <P> By sex and age:  </P> <P> MALES  </P> <P> Median age: 27.2 years  </P> <P> FEMALES  </P> <P> Median age: 28.8 years  </P> <P> Income  </P> <P> Per capita: $11,075  </P> <P> Median household: $30,104  </P> <P> Average household: $33,432  </P> <P> Income Distribution:  </P> <P> Less than $25,000: 43%  </P> <P> $50,000-74,999: 16%  </P> <P> $25,000-49,999: 32%  </P> <P> More than $75,000: 9%  </P></p>

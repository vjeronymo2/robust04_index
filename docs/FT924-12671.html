			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Japanese avoid decision on product liability law A JAPANESE government panel considering the introduction of EC-style product liability laws has declined to make a judgment and requested that another panel be established to review the controversial issue. The Social Policy Council, part of the prime minister's department, was supposed to deliver a final decision yesterday on liability laws, debated for 17 years and facing opposition from manufacturers who fear Japan would become a more litigious society. In the final report, a sub-committee of the council said a product liability law was desirable, but its introduction was impossible without the support of manufacturers, so another committee should attempt to reach a consensus. Japan has no formal product liability law, and injured consumers have to negotiate with a producer or to launch negligence actions. Since 1945, only about 150 product negligence cases have been decided, and courts are reluctant to set a clear precedent for fear of prompting a rush of cases. The prime ministerial panel considered removing the legal requirement to prove a manufacturer's negligence, and allowing an injured consumer to prove only that the product was defective, a proposal modelled on EC guidelines on product liability. While not delivering a judgment, the panel said a new law was unlikely to make Japanese consumers as litigious as those in the US. The panel said the legislation would have little impact on economic growth, while inflation would rise by up to 0.3 per cent if manufacturers added liability insurance premiums to their prices. In negotiations between Japan and the US over 'structural impediments' to trade, Tokyo has argued that US liability laws encourage excessive litigation, increasing costs for manufacturers and making US business uncompetitive. However, Washington argued that Japan's present system gives producers an unfair competitive advantage at the expense of consumers. The Keidanren, the country's main business federation, welcomed the panel's decision yesterday not to make a recommendation. But consumer groups said the panel's decision was an unacceptable concession to industry.</p>

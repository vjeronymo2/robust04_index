			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Fashion: Slipping in and out of style To Ireland this week for an 'in-depth' look at the world of Lycra in the company of a bevy of lissom fashion assistants. The fashion assistant is a breed unto herself. Paid a pittance, she nevertheless manages to make your very expensive designer suit look like last year's leftovers. She spends much of her life in cupboards, sorting through some of the world's most expensive clothes and this has taught her a thing or three. It means she can spot the provenance of anything sartorial, from a designer suit to a handkerchief, with all the devastating accuracy of a cruise missile. Thought you had picked a bargain in Surbiton? Felt pleased with your understated buy from Tesco? You will not fool her. Her laserbeam eyes tell you that she knows just where you bought it and exactly how much you paid. If there is one thing she knows it is what is in and what is out. While you are still working out how to put together this year's understated, natural look (all white and floaty) she has moved on and is into glamour. Her heels are high, her lipstick red, her hair piled high. This is no new-age mystic searching for inner truth (that was last year): this year's model is the dangerously bad and wicked vamp. She has come in out of the flower-filled fields and night-clubs, preferably gay, are now her natural habitat. All that sorting through of fashion cupboards (not to mention the odd chic gift from grateful fashion houses) has given her a confidence that belies her years. If she has a credo it is this - if in doubt wear black. Gathering for dinner in one of Dublin's jolly eateries (La Stampa, very much to be recommended) we looked much like a widows' coven - nothing but black as far as the eye could see (except for my six-year-old New York number. 'Oh, how lovely that you are wearing a print,' said one). For those of you who are more than 17 years old, whose stomachs are less than washboard flat and who have been wondering just how you wear this year's tiny slip-dress, I will pass on to you the fashion assistants' secret. Firstly, buy it in black. Secondly, get one of Hue's Total Body-Shapers (Pounds 18.95 a time from House of Fraser stores). Made from nylon and Lycra Spandex this gives what in the trade is called 'total body control' - everything from the top of the bosom down to the ankle. It is no good protesting that this poses serious physical challenges for that is not the point - if you want to look good in a slip dress then, as one of the more voluptuous assistants pointed out, you just have to cope with the inconvenience. If you are exceptionally young and exceptionally thin you can wear it with long stay-up stockings (Marks and Spencer's stockings have the most staying power). For those who are aged over 30 it may be more instructive to observe what fashion assistants do when they graduate to being editors. Then they wear their flirty slip dresses in layers (black, bien sur). The dress goes over a longer tube-like skirt, and over the dress goes a loose top and they add bright red lipstick and sexy, high-heeled, strappy shoes. That is this week's news. By the time you read it the fashion assistants may well have moved on.</p>

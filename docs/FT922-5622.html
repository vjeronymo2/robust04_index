			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / ANZ Grindlays asked to make Pounds 97m provision: Bombay Stock Scandal ANZ Grindlays, India's largest foreign-owned bank, has been asked to make a Rs5bn (Pounds 97m) provision for possible losses at its Bombay branch in India's securities market scandal. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, which asked ANZ Grindlays to make the provision, also asked State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, to provide Rs7bn. Directors of Australia's ANZ Group, parent of ANZ Grindlays, said earlier this week that they did not anticipate any losses from the Indian upheavals and that ANZ Grindlays had reconciled all its banker's receipts, a form of IOU at the heart of the scandal. By issuing banker's receipts, banks pledged later delivery of securities for which they supposedly had already paid. They were used as collateral to fund purchases of shares in Bombay's stock market. Two small banks which issued large amounts of receipts have been put into liquidation by the Reserve Bank: Bank of Karad and Metropolitan Co-operative Bank. The extent of the involvement of ANZ Grindlays and State Bank emerged last week after a meeting of banks to reconcile their accounts, but the Reserve Bank attempted on Wednesday to force them to provide cover for the possible losses. Standard Chartered of the UK is believed to have exposure of Rs3.62bn to Bank of Karad and Rs5.3bn to Metropolitan Co-operative Bank. Some Indian officials believe that the Pounds 50m provision which it has made against possible losses is inadequate. However, the exposure of ANZ Grindlays arose because nearly Rs5bn was credited to the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, a Bombay broker, against a cheque issued by National Housing Bank. The exposure of NHB to bankers' receipts is Rs13bn. The Reserve Bank considers ANZ Grindlays' action in crediting the proceeds of the cheque, drawn in favour of the bank, to an individual's account violated international banking laws. ANZ Grindlays contests this, saying it is 'established banking practice'. The Reserve Bank's decision to ask for full cover is seen as a move to end the stalemate and force ANZ Grindlays to settle the dispute with NHB, which is owned by the Reserve Bank, either bilaterally or in court. Bankers in London say that despite the high amounts of exposure of some foreign banks, they may be able to recoup part of the lost money through legal action and that the Reserve Bank's move to put banks into liquidation would make it easier to track the money.</p>

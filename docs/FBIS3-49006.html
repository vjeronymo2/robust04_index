The programme is to be financed by the nuclear safety fund of  the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and  the tenders are to be opened on March 4 in the presence of  bidders.    The first stage of improvements to make safe the four  obsolete units of Soviet design was completed last week when the  the oldest unit, which had been in service since 1974, was put  back into operation. This unit had been closed in September  1991 on the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy  Agency.    Apart from the four units of 440 megawatts, the plant  comprises two more modern units, each of 1,000 megawatts. The  power station provides between 30 percent and 40 percent of  energy used in Bulgaria.</p>

			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Valleys scheme condemned THE VALLEYS programme launched four years ago to revitalise the economic and social life of south Wales has failed, according to a paper to be presented to a Labour party conference in Neath tomorrow. Mr Kevin Morgan and Mr Adam Price of the University of Wales College of Cardiff, say the Pounds 800m funding was largely recycled money and had not tackled the core problems. They call the scheme 'essentially a marketing exercise'. 'Some of the problems the programme sought to address are as bad now as when the initiative was launched.' New priorities are needed if south Wales is to prosper after the recession, they argue. Mr Morgan and Mr Price call for a firm political commitment to the industrial valleys for the creation of a balanced economy - the valleys must not be seen merely as commuter belts for the M4 corridor between Newport and Llanelli. They say the programme 'has done nothing to temper the decline in regional policy expenditure, nothing to prevent the attrition in government support for the the training and enterprise councils and nothing to alleviate the chronic financial weaknesses of local government in the valleys.' The aim of reducing unemployment by between 25,000 and 30,000 has been rendered 'hopelessly unrealistic' by the recession.

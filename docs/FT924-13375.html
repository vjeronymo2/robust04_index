			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Satellite telephone venture launched THE race to provide global portable communications by satellite is heating up with the announcement that Nokia Mobile Phones, the world's second largest mobile phones manufacturer, and Inmarsat, the London-based international satellite communications co-operative, are working together to develop a satellite based mobile telephone system, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. Inmarsat believes the market for handheld satellite phones will grow to up to 2m users in seven years. Nokia's role in the joint project would be to provide handsets while Inmarsat, which already provides global communications through its 11 geo-stationary satellites, would provide the network.</p>

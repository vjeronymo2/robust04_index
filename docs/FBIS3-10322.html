[Begin unidentified speaker recording] A total of 33.3 percent  of those surveyed said they would vote for Arena; namely,  Armando Calderon Sol. Ruben Zamora of the tripartite FMLN  [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front], Democratic  Convergence [CD], and MNR [National Revolutionary Movement]  coalition follows him with 19.8 percent. Fidel Chavez Mena  comes in third with 8.9 percent. [end recording]    On congressional elections, (?30.1) percent said they would  vote for Arena, 16.2 percent said they would vote for the FMLN,  and 10.3 for the PDC. The [name indistinct] and the CD took  fourth and fifth place, respectively. Among those polled on  congressional and presidential elections, 7 percent were  undecided and approximately 25 percent declined to give an  opinion, which keeps the possibility of runoff elections open.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording] We must be honest and  responsible by saying that with only a few weeks left before the  elections, the polls are not infallible. We do not know how the  undecided and those who refuse to comment will vote. [end  recording]    [Words indistinct] all over the country, 18 percent favored  Arena and 10.4 percent the FMLN. The PDC came in third with 6.1  percent, but 52.3 percent of those surveyed declined to comment.</p>

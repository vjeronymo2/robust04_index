			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / People: Banking on a rights issue KLM Royal Dutch Airlines' long search for a finance director has finally ended with the appointment of Rob Abrahamsen, a senior executive at the airline's main bankers, ABN AMRO, writes Ronald van de Krol. Abrahamsen, who joins on January 10, comes to the job with extensive experience in project financing, including the complex financing of new aircraft, now normal practice for capital-intensive airlines like KLM. But it is already clear that one of his main challenges in the year ahead will be to put together a rights issue for KLM now that the Dutch national carrier's plans for a four-way partnership with SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines have fallen through. Abrahamsen's task will be made slightly easier by the fact that the Dutch government, which owns 38.2 per cent of the airline, has already expressed its willingness to take part in any issue. So far, KLM has refused to be drawn on either likely timing or size. The increased importance of finance in KLM's future is reflected in the decision to make Abrahamsen a member of the executive board. The previous finance director, Peter Alberda van Ekenstein, who left the airline in April, did not have a seat on the board. Abrahamsen, a 55-year-old Dutchman, spent 25 years at the Netherlands Bank of South Africa, including a three-year stint as chief executive officer. Returning to the Netherlands in 1987, he spent a short time with the Netherlands Investment Bank before joining ABN in 1989, a year before its merger with AMRO. In his last job at the bank he was head of global clients and asset management and trust.</p>

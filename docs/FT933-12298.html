			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: VAT 'fraud' by stores HAVING SPENT much time working abroad, I now have frequent opportunities to host numerous overseas visitors, whom I naturally encourage to spend freely in our shops. To my extreme embarrassment, however, I find that some of our major stores have a policy which appears to defraud overseas residents of some of the VAT amount that the tax legislation entitles them to. This is done by making an administrative charge, or by refusing to make any refund other than through a third party who, in turn, deducts an administrative fee from the VAT amount. Can visitors insist on a refund of the full VAT amount? Suppliers of goods are not obliged to operate the VAT refund scheme but, if they do, they have to comply with the conditions of the scheme. No doubt, some take the view that, because of the extra work involved, they should make a charge for operating the scheme. Some retailers use refund companies to make the refund arrangements. If an administrative fee is to be charged, the retailer should explain this clearly to the customer. There is no question of the full amount of VAT not being refunded in appropriate cases. This does not mean that a retailer cannot make a charge for operating the refund scheme. The rules are set out in HM Customs and Excise Notice 704, which you can obtain from your local VAT office. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

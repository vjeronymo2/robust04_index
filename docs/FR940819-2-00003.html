			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under this program, farmer programs borrowers can receive immediate financial relief from their FmHA payment obligations. FmHA projects that approximately 60,000 borrowers affected by 1993 disasters will request assistance under the set-aside program. Of these borrowers, approximately 20,000 have installments that came due January 1, 1994. If these installments are not paid by January 1, 1995, or otherwise set-aside, the borrower will be two installments behind and will no longer be eligible to receive disaster set-aside assistance. Borrowers more than one payment behind will be able to receive more assistance and offered more options through FmHA's loan servicing program under 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S. However, borrowers who cannot obtain servicing through 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S may be able to cure their delinquency with set-aside assistance. The set-aside program will be better for some borrowers than the servicing program provided through 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S since the set-aside will be a faster process, eligibility requirements are easier to meet, paperwork is less, and some borrowers will be able to be back on track after one payment is set-aside. The Agency realizes that although this may not be a solution to finding the borrower a feasible plan, it may provide temporary assistance to borrowers needing that type of relief. It will allow some borrowers to use sources other than FmHA to maintain their farm operation and allow them to work out their financial difficulty over the next year or so. Borrowers can cure their FmHA delinquency while at the same time continue farming and find the means to recover from the affects of the disaster. Other borrowers may prefer to use the year to voluntarily liquidate. This regulation will therefore provide options to prevent the foreclosure of borrowers in both of these instances. It is because of these reasons that implementation of this regulation as an interim rule is crucial to providing assistance to borrowers with the most urgent need while keeping them in business or allowing them crucial time to make optional choices. Borrowers who are not eligible for the DSA program, or who need more extensive servicing, will still have the opportunity to be considered for FmHA's primary loan servicing program as set forth in 7 CFR 1951&hyph;S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The set-aside program allows eligible borrowers to move one FmHA annual installment for each loan to the end of the loan term, thereby quickly eliminating the immediate financial stress. The installment set-aside may be the one due immediately after the disaster or, if that installment is paid to the neglect of other creditors or family living and operating expenses, then the next scheduled installment may be set-aside. Borrowers who received primary loan servicing after the disaster will not be eligible for the disaster set-aside, as restructuring of the account resolved the financial distress for the current and next production/marketing period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reporting requirements imposed on the public by the regulations set out in 7 CFR 1951&hyph;T are necessary to administer this program. Borrowers must request DSA in writing and be able to show from their actual production income and expense records that because of the disaster, their projected income was reduced to an amount that would prevent payment of all family living and operating expenses, and paying amounts due FmHA and/or other creditors. The addendum is needed in order to amend the promissory note/assumption agreement to reflect the amount set-aside and provide for collection on or before the final due date of the loan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Indicate how, by whom, and for what purpose the information is to be used and the consequence to Federal program or policy activities if the collection of information was not conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information required of FmHA farm borrowers is collected by FmHA loan servicing officials to facilitate an effective decision-making process when considering set-aside requests.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The effectiveness of this regulation is dependent upon collection of information from the borrower and the ability to execute an agreement for future repayment of the set-aside installment. Without this information, the Agency cannot provide disaster victims with the servicing they most desperately need in an expedient manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, the burden imposed by this regulation is described as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Written Request for DSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The letter of notification about the DSA program requires borrowers to respond in writing if they wish to be considered for set-aside. Written response can be limited to one sentence with signatures of all persons liable for the FmHA debt. The burden is limited to the time it takes the borrower to read the notification letter and prepare a signed written request. The average response time is estimated to be 15 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Production, Income and Expenses Records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The letter of notification about the DSA program also requires the borrower to provide actual production, income and expense figures for the production/marketing period in which the 1993 disaster occurred, unless this information has already been provided to FmHA. The majority of the borrowers who request DSA will have already provided these records because of other FmHA regulations that require annual year-end analysis of the farming operation. The average response time is estimated to be 5 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Addendum to the Promissory Note/Assumption Agreement for the Disaster Set-Aside Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In order for eligible borrowers to participate in the DSA program, an addendum must be signed for each loan installment set-aside and attached to the promissory note/assumption agreement. This addendum must be signed within 30 days from the date the borrower is notified of eligibility. The addendum provides an agreement from the borrower that the installment being set-aside, plus accrued interest on any principal set-aside, will be paid on or before the final due date of the loan. The addendum is completed by FmHA personnel. The burden imposed on the borrower is limited to the time required to read and sign the addendum. The average burden time is estimated to be 5 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Describe any consideration of the use of improved information technology to reduce burden and any technical or legal obstacles to reducing burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The information collected is of such type and nature that the use of improved information technology, such as data and word processing, would not significantly reduce the public burden. The Agency has not identified any legal obstacles to reducing reporting burdens associated with this regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Describe efforts to identify duplication.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Every effort has been made to avoid unnecessary duplication of information collected. Any information that was previously collected concerning the debtor that remains relevant is utilized to reduce the public burden.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev, 4 Jan -- The second working sitting has taken  place of the the All-Ukrainian Electoral Committee of the  Democratic Association bloc, which unites parties and  organizations of national democratic orientation such as Rukh  [People's Movement of Ukraine], URP [Ukrainian Republican  Party], DemPU [Democratic Party of Ukraine], KUN [Congress of  Ukrainian Nationalists], Prosvita [Enlightenment], SOU [Union of  Officers of Ukraine], and others. Chaired by the URP honorary  chairman, Levko Lukyanenko, the sitting considered and  coordinated lists of the bloc's candidates in separate Ukrainian  regions. Rukh was accused of destructive activity in that some  local NRU organizations, in particular the one in Kharkov, in  spite of prior arrangement had composed lists of candidates of  their own. People's Council Chairman Ivan Zayets brushed aside  these accusations saying that this situation was the result of  the sluggishness of other organizations who had not made up  their mind yet exactly in which districts to nominate their  candidates. It was decided to organize regional tours by  leaders of the bloc's parties to settle contentious issues  locally. The second part of the sitting discussed the name of  the bloc and its pre-election slogans.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank explains 3i decision - Company will realise Pounds 52m net profit from sale of entire holding Mr George Mathewson, Royal Bank of Scotland's chief executive, yesterday explained the bank's decision to dispose of all its 7.3 per cent stake in 3i, the investment trust company which was floated yesterday by the high street banks. Royal Bank, one of seven banks which owned 3i jointly with the Bank of England before the offer of Pounds 711m of its equity yesterday, was the only bank to dispose of its entire stake. In contrast, Bank of Scotland did not sell any of its existing stake. National Westminster Bank will retain the highest stake of the banks, with its stake falling to 17.94 per cent compared with the previous 22.9 per cent. All the stakes were diluted by a Pounds 288m rights issue element of the flotation. Sir George Russell, 3i chairman, said that NatWest wanted to be a 'major and long-term shareholder, which we certainly welcome'. The bank said that it viewed 3i as a good company which it wanted to retain as a long-term investment. Mr Mathewson said that Royal Bank had sold its stake in a placement because the rights dilution of its stake would have prevented it from continuing to equity account the holding, and so include rises in 3i's net assets in profits. He said that after deducting the already accounted rises in 3i's net assets, Royal Bank would be left with a net profit of Pounds 52m from its sale. This would be taken as an exceptional item in the second half of its financial year. Mr Mathewson said that Royal Bank had decided to sell its stake immediately rather than 'leak it out in little bits', because although 3i was a good company, 'we are not in the business of outguessing the equity market'. He emphasised that the raising of extra capital had no strategic implications for the bank, which indicated its interest in buying a building society. 'This has no broader tactical implications whatsoever,' he said. The banks have agreed not to sell any further part of their remaining stakes within a year without the agreement of Baring Brothers, the merchant bank sponsoring the issue. Any bank selling more equity will consult the others first. Mr Hugh Young, general manager of Bank of Scotland, said the bank's stake had fallen to 2.47 per cent from 3.02 per cent because of dilution. It had never equity accounted its stake, taking only 3i dividends into profits.</p>

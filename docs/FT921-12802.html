			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / Survey of FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): What job-changers should know - Pensions / An employee who leaves early is entitled to a deferred pension in a company scheme, yet administrators often fail to explain the situation PEOPLE WHO change jobs tend to be confused about what happens to their benefits in the company pension scheme. Such employees, often referred to as early leavers, still appear to be treated as 'poor relations', by comparison with those who remain with the company. Legislation over the past few years has improved their position, narrowing, though not eliminating, the gap in benefits between early leavers and stayers. But it has also created a complicated scenario. The latest report from the Occupational Pensions Advisory Service (Opas), published at the end of October, showed that early-leaver problems were the largest source of complaints (about a third). Many employees, it said, were still baffled by their entitlements, and administrators failed to explain the situation adequately. An employee who changes jobs is entitled to a deferred pension in the company scheme, based on salary and length of service at the time of leaving, revalued until retirement to allow for inflation. Alternatively, he can take the cash equivalent, known as a transfer value, which can be transferred to another occupational pension scheme or invested in a pension contract with a life company. However, in calculating the transfer value, the scheme's actuary is required to estimate the amount of deferred pension at retirement, how much that pension will increase in retirement, and how long the employee will live. He must also discount these benefits (including spouse's benefits) back to the present. So the actuary has to make various assumptions about inflation, pension increases, mortality and investment returns. Opas found that complaints by early leavers fell into the following categories: Delay in obtaining a quotation; Misunderstanding over the conditions under which a quotation is valid; Failure to appreciate that the value can vary with time and changing market conditions; and Concern over the value itself. We asked a number of consulting actuaries and pension consultants about their procedures regarding transfer values, and how they dealt with such complaints. Delay in obtaining a quotation Most transfer-value calculations are relatively straightforward, in actuarial terms, now that the 1990 Social Security Act requires all the deferred pension in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension (GMP) to be revalued in line with the retail price index, up to 5 per cent a year. Indeed, many actuaries have written the calculation procedures on computer diskettes, and the schemes themselves run the programmes with parameters provided by the actuary. The quotations can be produced very quickly. Delay arises in checking data about the employee and initiating the procedures, and will be compounded if more than one organisation is involved. Many schemes still have their records separate from the company's employee records, especially if there are several autonomous operating companies within a group but one centralised pension scheme. If there is a mass redundancy programme involving several hundred employees, most of whom want transfer-value quotations at the same time, delay is inevitable. The main complaint from employees is that they submit their application for a quotation and then hear nothing for months. They would appreciate at least an acknowledgement of their application and an apology that it will take several weeks to process. Scheme administrators, despite work pressures at such times, should make this simple courteous act. The House of Commons social security committee last month called for employees to be provided with up-to-date transfer values on an annual basis  -presumably included in the annual benefit statement. Some pension schemes already provide this information. Misunderstanding of conditions In making a transfer, the sequence of events is usually as follows: 1, The employee obtains a quotation. He or she then . . . 2, Considers the situation and decides to take a transfer; 3, Looks at the market and talks to a life-company intermediary, either independent or tied; 4, Decides to make the transfer; and 5, Formally asks the trustees of the scheme to arrange the transfer of benefits to a named pension scheme or life company. There can be a delay of several weeks between obtaining a quotation and formally requesting a transfer, and here misunderstanding arises. With a formal request for transfer, the transfer value is calculated at the time of the request and its value is guaranteed in that, when the trustees eventually pay over the transfer, the amount will be the value at either the time of the request or at the date of transfer if this is higher. But this guarantee does not apply to an informal request for a quotation. In theory, such quotations only apply on the day the calculation was made. The value should be calculated afresh when the formal request is made. Most consultants now advise their client schemes to give a guaranteed period during which the quotation is valid  - usually two or three months - and to inform the employee on the quotation form of this period of validity. Transfer values can vary This leads to the third complaint: Transfer values are not like deposit accounts, which never fall in money terms. There are short-term fluctuations in transfer values as market conditions change, particularly the rate of discount, linked to the assumed investment return, used by the actuary, even though the deferred pension itself steadily increases in value. When actuaries calculate transfer values, they follow guidance laid down by their profession: GN (Guidance Note) 11, issued by the Institute of Actuaries and the Faculty of Actuaries. But this guidance note is far from specific, and allows actuaries freedom to use professional judgment in their calculations, particularly on the rate of interest used in discounting. Many actuaries base the discounting rate on the yield from long-term gilts, reviewing their rate as frequently as once a month. If yields rise, then actuaries will increase their rate of discount, resulting in a lower transfer value, and vice versa. So if yields have risen between the employee's obtaining a quotation and formally requesting a transfer, he will get a lower value transferred, by comparison with the value given on the original quotation. All consultants advise their clients to warn employees on the quotation form that values can vary - up and down - over shortish periods. So employees, when obtaining a transfer-value quotation, should first check the period of validity (one major consultancy firm said it did not give any guaranteed period); then, if they feel that interest rates are going to rise, they should play safe and make a formal request within the guaranteed period. Actual transfer value The final cause of complaint is the transfer value itself: employees invariably consider it too low. But of even more concern is the variation in values calculated by different actuaries. The flexibility given to actuaries in GN 11 can result in a wide variation in values for the same deferred pension. Consider a hypothetical case: An employee, aged 35 exactly, has been a member of his company scheme for 10 years. It provides a pension of 1/60th of earnings at retirement at age 65 for each year of service, with, on his death, one-half spouse's pension. His pensionable earnings at present are Pounds 24,000. His deferred pension, payable from age 65, is currently 10/60ths of Pounds 24,000 - Pounds 4,000 a year. This will be revalued each year, the scheme providing the statutory minimum on the non-GMP element. The transfer value quoted by various consultants, assuming pensions in payment are increased by the RPI up to 5 per cent a year, were:  -------------------------- Consultant A Pounds 18,085 Consultant B        17,300 Consultant C        16,350 Consultant D        15,500 Consultant E        12,500  -------------------------- The main cause of these variations is the discount rate, reflecting assumptions about mortality and investment return. Even a difference of one percentage point can have a considerable impact over 30 years. There is nothing the employee can do about this variation, even if he or she is aware that some schemes give higher values per unit of pension than others. It is not even certain that the scheme's actuary is obliged to reveal his assumptions. There is a need for the actuarial profession to tighten up on its guidance note, to ensure that such variations are narrowed. Otherwise it may find it difficult to oppose the threatened introduction by a Labour government of a statutory standard basis of calculation, which would ensure that the same deferred pension would produce the same transfer value. Meanwhile, the employee would not succeed in any complaint made to the pensions Ombudsman, Michael Platt, who has made it clear that he would accept the actuary's professional assurance that the transfer value had been calculated in accordance with GN 11. So there is still room for improvement in transfer values, and employees should urge their employers and the authorities to make them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed "report": "Russian-Japanese Negotiations </F> Scheduled for Late February"]    [Text] It has finally been announced simultaneously in  Moscow and Tokyo that the long-awaited vice foreign ministerial  talks between Russia and Japan and working level meetings on the  bilateral peace treaty within this framework will be held in  Moscow on 21-22 February. These vice ministerial talks will be  the first official meeting between Russian and Japanese  representatives to be held since President Boris Yeltsin's visit  to Japan last October. As a result, significant attention from  many nations, including third party nations, has been focused on  the talks.    Although there are still over three weeks before the talks  begin in Moscow, at this time we can probably go ahead and make  the following assumption; that is, the talks will be held in a  less friendly atmosphere than there existed at the time of  Yeltsin's visit to Japan.    Several recent incidents have clearly accounted for the  cooling down of bilateral relations. Above all, the major  factor is the dumping of radioactive wastes in the Sea of Japan  by the Russian Navy and apprehensions that it may be repeated.  Of course, efforts have been made by both nations toward  seeking a solution to the problem, but so far not everything has  been settled.    Meanwhile, Japanese fishing boats have violated Russian  territorial waters, and it has been reported that the Japanese  Government plans to review its credit extension program to  Russia, particularly on temporarily suspending humanitarian aid.    More important, however, is that political developments in  both nations are raising great concerns over future bilateral  relations; that is, there has been cabinet reshuffling in the  Russian Government, and the political reform bills have not been  passed in the upper house of the Japanese Diet so far. There  are concerns in Japan that revisions in Russia's reform policy  due to the reshuffling of the cabinet of Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin may adversely affect its foreign policy, including  its relations with Japan, and result in Russia taking a more  hard-line attitude.    On the other hand, there have emerged views in Russia that  even if the main core of the current administration of Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa were to remain in power, the  administration could get stronger, resulting in its taking  tougher stance regarding relations with Russia. In this  backdrop, it can readily be imagined that the most important  task for the two nations in the bilateral talks is to assure  each other that there will be no changes in policy regarding  political matters.    For that matter, steps have already been taken by the two  nations toward this end. For example, it can be recalled that  on the opening day of the Russian Federal Assembly, the upper  chamber of the Russian parliament, President Yeltsin made  remarks stressing that he still has final say over Russian  foreign policy as before and that there will likely be no  changes to it. The president's remarks were directed at Japan.  As for Japan, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is also deputy  prime minister, has stated in a news conference that on Russian  aid, there will be no changes in the Japanese Government policy.    It is expected that at a meeting of influential people of  Russia and Japan scheduled to be held in Tokyo in early  February, steps will be taken to deepen mutual understanding and  strengthen mutual confidence that has recently been complicated  by problems. In the last several years, an important step  regarding bilateral relations was taken whereby the two nations  have been able to change their past relation of conflict into  one of mutual understanding and cooperation. What is important  now is to maintain what has been achieved, prevent reversal, and  continue on the path toward establishing a true partnership  between the two nations. It is hoped that political dialogue  between Russia and Japan, including the upcoming bilateral  talks, will contribute toward this goal.</p>

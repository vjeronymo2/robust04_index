			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Perfumes' fate sealed with a sniff: A victory for fine fragrance houses might not mark the end of the war The world's biggest perfume manufacturers are savouring the sweet scent of victory after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission report yesterday on fine fragrances; while Superdrug, the discount chain which has been their most persistent critic, ponders the sour smell of defeat. By exonerating the manufacturers of using anti-competitive practices to overcharge consumers, the report has removed the threat of an unseemly price war which would severely damage the industry's profits, undermine its distribution methods and cheapen the exclusive image of its brands. For Superdrug, part of the Kingfisher retailing group, waging a high-profile campaign to force leading perfume houses to supply it directly, the decision is a sharp disappointment. 'The MMC report has left us high and dry,' the company said. However, though the perfumiers have won the battle, it may not mark the end of the war. The perfume houses' traditional way of doing business is likely to remain under continued challenge, both in the courts and as a result of the changing nature of the industry. The issues at stake are unusually complex. Not only are the methods used to market and distribute perfume probably unique in industry, but the legal picture is confused by the overlap between the European Union and national competition law. Indeed, to a far greater degree than any other recent monopolies case, the perfumes affair underlines the difficulty of applying to competition policy the European Union's principle of 'subsidiarity', which seeks to leave many decisions to national authorities. In weighing its decision, the commission was obliged to recognise that its scope for action was to some extent limited by the fact that the European Commission had already exempted the distribution of perfumes from the full force of competition law. The exemption has taken the form of approved agreements which permit perfume houses to restrict supplies to retailers meeting certain standards - stocking a broad range of products, displaying them in acceptable conditions and using trained staff to sell them. Such agreements have also been allowed by Brussels in other industries, such as cars and consumer electronics. However, in most cases they are permitted on the grounds that the products are complex and need after-sales service. In perfumes, however, the justification is that the products are luxury goods, which depend for their appeal on an aura of exclusivity maintained by high price, large investments in marketing and a sophisticated sales environment. This argument was accepted by the MMC, which acknowledged the importance of snob value to the success of perfumes, which it termed 'a conceit, a confection created as much by the copywriter as the parfumeur.' High prices, the commission agreed, were a vital part of the formula. That, however, is not a universal view - even inside the European Commission, where some officials believe the perfume regime owes more to skilful lobbying by a small band of predominantly French producers than to the alleged uniqueness of the product. Some retailers and consumer organisations go further. They insist the perfume industry's main objective is to keep profits artificially high by refusing to supply stores which sell at cut prices. Though the MMC found no evidence to support this accusation, it is at the heart of a pending European Court case brought by Leclerc, a large French supermarket chain. Leclerc is challenging Brussels' approval of selective distribution agreements used by Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy, two leading perfume houses. Should the court find in Leclerc's favour, the whole issue of special treatment would be reopened and Brussels could be forced to re-examine its policy of exempting other industries from competition law. Some similar issues are raised by another legal battle, over the ice cream market. Mars, the US confectionery company, has brought actions in Brussels and European capitals challenging the distribution policies of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products manufacturer which is the world's largest ice cream maker. Mars claims Unilever is restricting competition by preventing rival brands from being stocked in the freezer cabinets it supplies to many small retailers. The case is being investigated by both the European Commission and the MMC. The dispute also centres on how far it is legitimate for producers to control access to distribution channels in which they have invested heavily, and may pose a further test of the jurisdictional boundaries between European and national competition authorities. Whichever way the legal arguments go, the perfume industry faces mounting pressures on other fronts. Recession has depressed demand, leading to sharp drops in sales volumes which have only partly been offset by higher prices. Manufacturers everywhere are being forced to run harder. In an effort to win back consumers, they have sharply stepped up new product launches. In Britain, where there are more than 400 perfume brands on sale, there were 92 launches between 1990 and 1992, almost three times the number in the previous three years. Though perfumes cost little to develop and produce, the investments needed to market them can be huge. In Britain, according to the MMC, perfume manufacturers last year spent on marketing almost half as much as they earned in sales revenues. L'Oreal of France, the industry leader, spent more than Pounds 50m three years ago to launch Dune, now a best-selling fragrance. But Dune's success is exceptional. Most new perfumes fail, and many do not recoup their launch costs. The stakes have been raised further by the consolidation of much of the industry into the hands of a few big groups with deep pockets, powerful distribution networks and lavish marketing budgets. As well as L'Oreal, they include Unilever, the French luxury goods group LVMH, and Elf Sanofi, part of Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company. Furthermore, competition is creeping into distribution. The MMC estimates that a sixth of wholesale domestic perfume sales in the UK, which totalled Pounds 181m, was supplied from the 'grey' market. This is fed by so-called parallel imports which bypass manufacturers' authorised channels. A further Pounds 50m - a third of the value of manufacturers' authorised sales - was made through duty-free shops, at discounts of as much as 60 per cent on normal retail prices. This trend has not gone far enough to satisfy Superdrug and other discount retailers, which sell perfumes at as much as 30 per cent below retail prices by buying supplies on the 'grey' market. Superdrug complained yesterday that the report was internally contradictory. On the one hand, the MMC had attributed much of the increased competition to Superdrug and other unauthorised retailers, but on the other hand has refused to compel the perfumes houses to supply them freely. Superdrug argues that 'grey' market sources are both expensive and scarce. It says unless it can obtain new sources of supply, its perfume sales will remain limited to about 60 stores, where it has spent some Pounds 1.2m on counters and displays. Nonetheless, there are signs that harsh commercial realities are forcing some smaller manufacturers to relax traditional distribution restrictions. Parfums Worth has agreed to sell through Superdrug, while in France, the Carrefour supermarket chain has persuaded Pierre Cardin to supply it. Some observers believe more barriers will crumble. 'The market is going to change,' says Ms Nina Stimson, managing editor of European Cosmetics Markets, an industry magazine. 'Throughout Europe, suppliers are starting to break ranks.' Just how far and how fast may depend partly on the length of the recession. Most observers believe it will be a long time, if ever, before top brands such as Chanel, Dior and Guerlain are affected. But the steadily mounting pressures on the industry suggest that, whatever competition authorities say, for some perfume makers at least, life may never be quite the same.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UK PERFUMES: SWEET AND SOUR  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Typical cost and prices               Pounds       Margin     RRP incl.

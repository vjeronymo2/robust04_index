Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's visit to Washington  and his meetings with President Clinton and his staff are an  escalation of this Israeli activity. This is especially so  since Rabin's visit coincides with the date set by the Security  Council to adopt its resolution on the massacre at the holy  al-Ibrahimi Mosque. Yitzhaq Rabin is depending totally on the  U.S. to prevent the UN Security Council from adopting a decisive  resolution that secures protection for the Palestinian people  from the Zionist settlers and the oppression of the Israeli  occupation soldiers.    It is well known that the U.S. role to date has prevented  the  Security Council from adopting such a resolution. What is worse  is that Yitzhaq Rabin declared in Washington that he is not  willing to commit himself to any UN resolution that contradicts  Israel's intentions. He rejects sending a UN peace-keeping  force to the occupied Palestinian territories. He also refuses  to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers.    What is even worse is Rabin's statement that Israel will not  bargain over its security!!! Meanwhile, the security of the  Palestinian people, including women, children, and the elderly,  is not important to Rabin and his government.    Yitzhaq Rabin is turning the equation upside down. He is  demanding security for the Israelis and the terrorist settlers  instead of committing himself to protecting the Palestinian  people under the wicked Israeli occupation.    The U.S. Administration, in the first place, and the big  influential countries in the UN Security Council, in the second  place, should adopt a just resolution that forces Israel to  abandon its intransigence, accept the formation of an  international force to protect the Palestinian people, and agree  to evacuate the settlements and disarm the settlers. Otherwise,  the peace process, which these countries are concerned about,  will come to a crossroads with no clear directions or become  permanently paralyzed.    The peace desired by the Palestinians and the Arabs is not  just any kind of peace. A peace that is established at the  expense of the Palestinian people, who are facing campaigns of  containment and annihilation, is no peace at all.</p>

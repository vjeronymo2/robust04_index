			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / Green fridge wins backing of Treuhand Germany's Treuhand privatisation agency said yesterday it would finance production of a so-called 'green fridge', a refrigerator which operates without ozone-killing chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), Reter reports from Berlin. Environmentalists have campaigned for months to save the DKK Scharfenstein company in eastern Germany from liquidation by gathering 65,000 orders for the refrigerator. Treuhand board member Ludwig Traenkner told reporters that DKK would still go into liquidation but that the government agency would pay for 405 out of 1,800 workers to make the new product. The remainder would go onto work-creation schemes. The fridge's secret is a coolant based on a mixture of propane and butane, as opposed to chlorine and fluorine. The Treuhand was sceptical but was pushed into supporting it by Bonn.</p>

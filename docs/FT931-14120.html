			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Mobile telephone call costs may fall sharply THE COST of mobile telephone calls could fall sharply later this year following an agreement between existing network operators and a new competitor. Mercury PCN, owned equally by Cable &amp; Wireless and US West, intends to launch a low-cost mobile telephone service tailored to domestic customers and small businesses this year. It has agreed charges with British Telecom and Mercury Communications for interconnecting their respective networks. The agreement clears the way for the launch of the service and could force the UK's existing mobile phone operators, Cellnet and Vodafone, to lower their prices. While the charging structure has not been disclosed, it will allow subscriber prices which are substantially below the costs for interconnection between existing networks. A peak rate call placed from a BT network to an existing mobile telephone currently costs the customer 33.6p a minute, about the same as the cost of a call to Athens and only a little less than a transatlantic call. It is thought that Mercury PCN has secured an agreement which could bring the price of a call close to existing land-line rates of 10p a minute. Mercury PCN said yesterday that the company believed that existing interconnection charges were too high for domestic customers and that the key to expanding the market was lower prices. Without a guarantee of a large market, Mercury PCN would have found it difficult to justify the substantial capital investment involved in launching the new service. Shares in Vodafone and Cellnet fell sharply on the news. The issue of charges for the interconnection of individual operators' networks is one of the most critical in the UK's deregulated telecommunications market. It fundamentally affects a new competitor's pricing structure and was a serious bone of contention between BT and Mercury in the early days of the UK telecommunications duopoly. Mercury PCN is likely to be the first UK company to launch a personal communications network, an advanced person-to-person portable telephone system based on computer technology. A second service in which Hutchison has a stake is not expected to go live until next year. The effect on Cellnet and Vodafone remains unclear. Both launched low rates packages towards the end of last year to attract new customers. London stocks, Page 40</p>

			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA;  </P> <P> CITY COMMENDED FOR RECYCLING PLAN  </P> <P> County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez commended the City Council for its  "forward-looking and forward-thinking" automated recycling program.  </P> <P> Speaking to members of the council Tuesday night, Vasquez said Brea had taken a  leadership role "in developing innovative methods of recycling." He presented  Mayor Gene A. Leyton with a plaque from the county citing Brea's efforts.  </P> <P> During the meeting, representatives of Brea Disposal Inc. demonstrated the  automated recycling truck to show how the system works. The trucks will begin  picking up recyclable items and garbage around the city on Monday.  </P> <P> Glass and plastic containers, aluminum cans, newspapers and other items will be  collected from green, 110-gallon cans that were distributed to residents  earlier this week.  </P> <P> Other refuse will be stored in similar black cans for disposal.  </P> <P> "This city has a futuristic look," said Vasquez. "We are facing a critical  level of crisis in a throwaway society. This is a move which we hope other  cities will follow."  </P> <P> The automated trucks are operated by one employee instead of two, and a  mechanical arm is used to lift a can and dump its contents.  </P> <P> Collection days for Brea residents will not change, but the recyclable items  will be picked up twice a month instead of weekly.

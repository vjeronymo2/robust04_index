			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Business Travel (Update): Mailbox In May AT&amp;T launches what it claims is the first international mailbox service for travellers wanting a 24-hour base for receiving and sending messages and faxes wherever they may be. The US operator's new service, called WorldPlus, gives subscribers a mailbox and service centre accessed via touch-tone or voice-response. In addition to storing and replaying messages, WorldPlus allows users to reply to the number from which a message has been received at the flick of a button, and to send multiple messages and faxes as instructed. Subscribers pay Pounds 50 a year standing charge, then pay for services on a usage basis. The charge for messages and faxes is flat-rate.</p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: AL GREEN "I GET JOY." A&amp;M **;  </P> <P> POP STARS ***** GREAT BALLS OF FIRE **** KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOOR *** GOOD  VIBRATIONS ** MAYBE BABY * AIN'T THAT A SHAME  </P> <P> An album of roughly half-religious and half-romantic songs like this one by the  Rev. Green isn't a good idea. Those who prefer one kind of music don't want to  be bothered -- on the same album -- with a lot of material from the other  genre. And in this case, the scales tip more toward gospel, as the lyrics of  some of these romantic songs have religious overtones. Green seems to be more  interested in not offending religious fans than pleasing his pop/R&amp;B  audience.  </P> <P> Green -- the top romantic R&amp;B singer of the early '70s, known for his  passionate, near-orgasmic style -- switched to gospel in the late '70s. In the  last few years, though, he's been easing back into romantic R&amp;B. But he's  not singing love songs with that same old passion. His edge is gone. Maybe he  doesn't invest the same fervor into those love songs because, as a cleric, he  now regards that material differently. For whatever reason, as a romantic  singer, he's sunk from great to just above average. Thus, the religious half of  this album is fine. The pop/R&amp;B parts, though, are bland. The message is  clear: Green should stick to what he does best, which, these days, is religious  music. Duff Marlowe  </P></p>

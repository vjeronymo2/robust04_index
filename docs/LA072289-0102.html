			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILANDER, SVENSSON GIVE SWEDEN A 2-0 ADVANTAGE OVER YUGOSLAVIA  </P> <P> Jonas Svensson and Mats Wilander gave Sweden a commanding 2-0 lead over  Yugoslavia in their Davis Cup semifinal after both won singles matches Friday.  </P> <P> Wilander, ranked fourth in the world, struggled before defeating Goran Prpic,  7-6, 6-1, 6-0.  </P> <P> Earlier, Svensson beat teen-ager Goran Ivanisevic, 6-4, 7-6, 3-6, 6-4, on the  clay courts at this seaside resort.  </P> <P> Sweden, trying to reach the final for the seventh consecutive year, has never  lost a Davis Cup best-of-five competition after winning the first two singles.  </P> <P> The winner of this semifinal will play the United States-West Germany winner.  </P> <P> Stefan Edberg, replaced by Svensson in singles after spraining his ankle last  weekend, and Anders Jarryd will be heavily favored to wrap up the Swedish  victory in today's doubles.  </P> <P> The reverse singles are Sunday.  </P> <P> "This looks good. I've felt all the way that we would win this Davis Cup  match," said John-Anders Sjogren, Sweden's captain and also Wilander's personal  coach.  </P> <P> Wilander saved a set point at 6-7 before winning the first-set tiebreaker, 9-7.  Prpic lost the last point when he hit a forehand wide as the Swede was coming  to the net.  </P> <P> After the second set was tied, 1-1, Wilander won 11 consecutive games. Prpic  had only one break point during that run, but Wilander saved it to go to 4-0 in  the third set.  </P></p>

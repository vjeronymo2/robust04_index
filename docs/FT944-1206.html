			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / International Company News: US bank cancels contracts Bankers Trust, the US bank which recently bowed to regulators over some parts of its derivatives activities, has agreed to cancel two foreign currency derivative contracts sold to a customer in the US. The customer, Federal Paper, said it was planning to take a Dollars 12m pre-tax gain in the current quarter following the cancellation of the two contracts. It had earlier reported pre-tax losses of Dollars 19m on the contracts, which it said were forward contracts (agreements to buy or sell a currency at some time in the future) and caps (option-type contracts which put a limit on an interest rate or foreign currency liability). Eastman Kodak said it had extinguished a further Dollars 1.7bn of debt, taking to Dollars 6.4bn the total debt it had erased this year and completing its debt-reduction programme.</p>

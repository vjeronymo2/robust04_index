			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (11): High stakes in the ITV poker game UNDER THE HAMMER: THE ITV FRANCHISE BATTLE by Andrew Davidson Heinemann, Pounds 16.99, 318 pages THE STORY of how the ITV franchises were put out to competitive tender and the elaborate Pounds 1bn poker game that went on all over the UK for more than a year is one of the most extraordinary in business history. From January 1 both bidders and viewers will have to live with the consequences. Several thousand television professionals will have lost their jobs and about Pounds 300m a year will go to the Treasury instead of the current Pounds 100m or so. Companies such as Thames, with a 25-year programme making tradition, will head for the wilderness. In the depths of an advertising recession some of the 'winners' could yet go to the wall for bidding too high. There is also at least a question mark over how much serious ITV programming can survive in prime time in what will inevitably be a more remorselessly commercial industry. Andrew Davidson has successfully captured the mood of the great game - the surreptitious meetings in country house hotel, the bluff and double bluff, the tension and the fear of putting a number in an envelope that will determine whether a company lives or dies. As he says, television is not only the most powerful communication tool yet invented, it can also be 'one of the most exciting, frustrating, malicious, greedy and cynical industries there is.' The anecdotes bring out an additional dimension - the farce. They include the story of how the executives from Granada, travelling round the Tyne-Tees region in preparation for a hostile bid, ran straight into David Reay, the Tyne- Tees chief executive, in the lobby of a Newcastle hotel. Then there was the chaos of the Polygram, Palace Picture, Mentorn bid against London Weekend. On the night before the bids had to go in someone in their headquarters - the Groucho Club in London's Soho - tripped over a computer lead and wiped out the eight page summary of their bid. They only just managed to rewrite it in time for the printers. Executives at Central, which bid only Pounds 2,000, nearly had a heart attack when they picked up a story that the Rizzoli media group was planning to bid against them with one of their own shareholders. In fact, they had been discussing Centrale - the Italian word for the centre - in this case London. The funniest and most telling story of all comes from Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT, who did not trip over any computer leads and saw off the Groucho bid. Bland found himself sitting opposite to Sir Jeffrey Sterling, the P&amp; O boss who had advised Margaret Thatcher on the broadcasting legislation, in spite of knowing little about broadcasting. 'Oh Jeffrey,' said Bland. 'I've just been invited to head a commission to look into the shipping industry.' 'But you don't know anything about shipping,' said Sir Jeffrey (now Lord) Sterling. 'I think I know as much about shipping as you do about broadcasting . . .' replied Christopher Bland, allowing time for his little joke to sink in. Apart from being an hilarious read the book provides useful insights into some apparently inexplicable decisions, such as why TV-am thought it could hold on to its franchise with a bid of only Pounds 14m - Pounds 20m less than the winner - when it knew it faced two powerful rivals. Andrew Davidson suggests, plausibly, that TV-am may have interpreted words of praise from the Independent Television Commission for its Gulf War coverage, its training and contribution to improving the broadcasting bill, as a sign that it was safe, that the ITC would invoke 'exceptional circumstances' to set aside higher cash bids. Thames Television, which bid Pounds 32m, a figure that was unlikely to be the highest for the London weekday franchise, clearly suffered from similar unfulfilled hopes. Under The Hammer is an extraordinary tale of extraordinary events, but for all the panache of its story-telling the book is light on analysis and context and concentrates almost entirely on the big companies and the big battles. 'Those looking for an answer to the perennial question, 'whither broadcasting?' will search in vain,' the author explains. He does, however, provide four and a half pages of explanation as an appendix. You also have to look in the appendices for a significant interview with Mr George, now Sir George, Russell, ITC chairman. There the ITC chairman makes explicit what has been clear for some time: that the ITC used the terms of the Broadcasting Act quite deliberately to stop even more money flowing out of the system to the government. As a result some rough justice was dispensed, both to existing ITV companies which were deemed to have overbid and to outsiders which were excluded for the same reason. The consequences of the great ITV franchise battle are far from over. The only hope now is that the government is capable of learning a lesson and will approach the debate about the future of the BBC with a less dogmatic frame of mind.</p>

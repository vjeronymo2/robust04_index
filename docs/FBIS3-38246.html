			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Conor Cruise O'Brien article: "Danger Abroad If Only You </F> Look"]    [Text] Washington -- President Clinton's State of the Union  message on Tuesday [25 January] was long on domestic affairs,  short on foreign policy, which got two pages out of 15. This is  clearly how the American people want it at present. Up to a  point, this is to be welcomed. It is better for the U.S. and  the world that the U.S. Government should give priority to those  things it can do something about than that it should continue to  toy with the dangerous illusion of a new world order, a global  Pax Americana.    Yet there are other illusions, almost as dangerous. The  prevailing illusion, which the President has been fostering, is  that the world has become a much safer place than it used to be.  The President's European trip was presented in such a way as to  encourage that comforting notion.    Cosy pictures of a jovial Clinton with a Yeltsin at least  doing his best to smile carried the message that the Russians  now love us and the bad old days are over. Signs that there is  a great and growing number of Russians who don't love us at all,  and yearn to return to the bad old days, are excluded from the  world of presidential social calls.    A glaring example of escape from reality into a roseate  world  on that presidential tour was the case of the meetings with the  President of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, who promised to get rid  of his country's nuclear weapons. In the atmosphere of the  tour, the distinction between promise and fulfilment was  ignored. So was the fact that Kravchuk had already made such a  promise, and been overruled by his parliament. Nor could anyone  possibly allude, in that euphoric atmosphere, to the forces that  are beginning to tear Ukraine apart, with its nuclear weapons up  for grabs between contending ethnically based military factions.    The President who promised, and the parliament which  overruled him, and the country which both of them represent may  all have vanished from the scene before the year is out. But  for the moment, that most tenuous of promises holds the  international stage. That last expression has become more than  a metaphor, in the age of television. A pastoral illusion,  conjured up by the camera, keeps grim reality at bay. One is  reminded of Marie Antoinette and her world of make-believe in  the Petit Trianon on the eve of disaster.    There was just one moment in the State of the Union message  when the President took account, only implicitly, of the actual  state of the world outside America. This was when he promised  that there would be no further defence cuts. That sober and  sensible promise was at variance, however, with the general  thrust of his reassuring message.    The President is doing well, right now, in domestic matters,  and stands high in the polls. Whitewatergate has not yet begun  to hurt. But it is as a leader of the free world that Clinton  continues to fail to impress. It is not just a question of  conducting policy by photo calls, though that is a significant  part of the trouble. More important is the fact that he has  lost authority in the most vital area: that of defence.    He has done so as a result o his attempt to challenge the  military establishment on the question of gays in the military.  The military establishment is not normally a monolith, but an  assemblage of competing factions. The fact that these groups  have to compete for presidential favour in the allocation of  resources an over senior appointments and promotions is a great  factor making for health in the system, in the sense of  maintaining the reality of civilian control.    But Clinton's profoundly misguided initiative on gays in the  military had the effect of causing the establishment to close  ranks against him, and to defeat him. As he retreated before a  skilfully orchestrated public relations barrage financed out of  the military budget, he sacrificed his Secretary of Defence, Les  Aspin, who had tried to carry out his policy, and became his  scapegoat.    When his choice as replacement, Bobby Ray Inman, withdrew on  his own initiative, Clinton could think of nothing better to do  than to nominate Aspin's deputy, William J. Perry. The Pentagon  indicated satisfaction. The whole protracted episode has  seriously weakened presidential control over defence policy and  therefore also over foreign policy.    The weakness is apparent in policy towards NATO and the  Partnership for Peace idea. This is now taking the form of  associating the East European countries with NATO, but not  admitting them to membership in it. In an important article  this week, Henry Kissinger has challenged this idea, urging full  membership for those countries.    The case is a strong one. If, as is well within the bounds  of possibility, Russia returns to an aggressive posture, the  West will need to draw a clear line somewhere. It is not now  doing so. "Associated" status leaves the East European countries  in a grey area. To Russian expansionists -- clearly a  significant force in the new Russian parliament -- exclusion of  the East European countries from NATO sends the signal that the  West will not defend these countries if they are attacked.  There is an ominous Korean precedent here. The U.S. did not  formally guarantee South Korea as it did other countries. North  Korea, with Stalin's approval, saw this as a green light, and  the Korean war was the result. A clear line was not drawn then,  and is not being drawn now.    In general, the leadership of the West hardly seems in good  shape to handle the great challenges likely to be coming from  the East. European union is a myth as far as formation of  foreign policy is concerned. American leadership under Clinton  is a photocall facade, for the moment at least. It is likely  that the eastern challenges, as they develop, will eventually  produce a greater degree of Western unity and leadership. But  the early stages of any new challenges may involve us all in  some unpleasant surprises.</p>

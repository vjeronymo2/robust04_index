			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Acts of derring-do - Sponsorship Sponsors are often either ignored by the media or criticised for playing safe and supporting only the classical repertoire and old masters. It is therefore quite novel for them to come under attack from journalists for being too daring. Several sponsors have drawn flak from their critics in the last few weeks by supporting the contemporary arts in all disciplines. But it is in the area of the visual arts that a battle has really been engaged. The Turner Prize was attacked on Channel 4 with sweeping accusations of a 'modern arts mafia'; and Damien Hirst's decaying carcasses provided a frisson of controversy at the elegant black-tie dinner to celebrate the prize at The Tate Gallery. Journalists queued up on either side to defend or attack the winners of the Barclays' Young Artist award. The Wilson Twins' photographs of battered rooms where a murder may have taken place lent a different angle on corporate hospitality suites. BP's sponsorship of the third re-hang of The Tate was attacked by Brian Sewell, a critic not known to pull his punches; he urged BP to suspend its support of the Tate, presumably to teach Nicholas Serota, the director, a lesson for daring to wake people up. So, as sponsors line up with contemporary artists at their most demanding and the battle rages with the critics, here comes the next brave sponsor - NatWest. The NatWest 90s Prize for Art is a deliberate attempt to strike a balance between the warring factions. Only those entrants who have mastered basic artistic skills will win. However, at the official announcement at The Royal Society of Arts on April 29, the next chapter in this exciting drama will be on display. The NatWest prize and its judges - Anthony Mould (chairman), Chantal Joffe (last year's winner), Craigie Aitchison and Diana Rigg - are going to show that there is life beyond the narrow band of London arts schools that scooped many of the other prizes. Who said sponsors were afraid of controversy? One part of the media that cannot be accused of attacking sponsors, because it has a deliberate policy to ignore them, is the BBC. The charter renewal of the BBC in 1996 has pushed the corporation into debating its future with its consumers. At a recent seminar on the future of the BBC as a cultural patron, the most lively debate concerned the failure of the BBC to credit sponsors adequately. Though the delegates were told by the corporation that things had improved, no one believed it. The BBC's case was not helped when everyone realised that the BBC is about to publish updated guidelines on sponsorship without bothering to discuss them with the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts - or, for that matter, with anyone else in the arts or sports field. The guidelines, which were written five years ago and are happily ignored by everyone in the sports field but ruthlessly adhered to by the arts programmers, could be replaced by even more draconian rules. The BBC has yet to make up its mind whether it wants sponsorship for programmes. Nobody is pushing them. But surely it could get its act together in giving the arts a fair deal when it comes to the coverage of sponsored arts events being broadcast? Watch this sound bite. The new award for great patrons of the arts from Montblanc, the pen maker, is welcome news. Not that Montblanc is giving prizes to sponsors  - that is ABSA's job, through its award schemes throughout the country. Montblanc's prizes were awarded at a grand ceremony at the Opera-Comique in Paris last Wednesday to the great and the good of the cultural world. One of the four categories, the 'private vision award', went to Simon Rattle, music director of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra; he shared the award with Lincoln Kirstein, one of the founders of the New York City Ballet. Each winner received Dollars 25,000 for the arts organisation of his choice; and a Montblanc 'Octavian' pen. Simon Rattle announced that his cheque would go to save an educational project with his orchestra that would have otherwise been lost due to cuts in public funds. Richard Eyre, the National Theatre's director, represented the UK on the judging panel and called on private sponsors to shame governments by their generosity - an interesting angle that the BBC might like to ponder. Classic FM has confounded its critics by revealing that it has around 4.3m listeners. It is no surprise then to find it attracting business sponsorship. The latest to sign up is British Gas, which is to sponsor a new programme Classical Gas for 26 weeks in a package worth approximately Pounds 200,000. British Telecom tops the chart of British sponsors and is therefore a most appropriate backer for ABSA's national conference at the Barbican this June, as well as other parts of the ABSA operation. Evaluation will be the key topic of the conference, which will bring together ABSA's business members and the members of its development forum for arts managers. The debate should be lively as sponsors need more than ever to measure the benefits they are looking for if they are to justify their corporate budgets. Colin Tweedy is director general of the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts</p>

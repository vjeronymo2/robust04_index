			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECOND LANGUAGES;  </P> <P> CULTURAL MIX TRANSLATES INTO A BOOM  </P> <P> When Luis Orlando Arias was a young delivery boy in his native El Salvador, one  of his favorite stops was the Japanese Embassy. He would gaze wistfully at  posters of Japanese temples and graceful women in kimonos strolling under the  shade of cherry blossom trees. He yearned to learn more about the culture he  had grown to admire, but the dream seemed as distant as Japan itself.  </P> <P> Then he came to Los Angeles. Within a few years, Arias developed a taste for  sushi and made new friends at Little Tokyo piano bars and arcades. A school bus  driver who speaks English and Spanish, Arias has been studying Japanese at Los  Angeles City College with the hope that it might someday broaden his  opportunities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Triumph'  </P> <P> "For me it's been a dream come true, a triumph," said Arias, 36, who still  harbors dreams of travel to Japan and plans to study Korean next.  </P> <P> Increasingly in this multilingual city, learning a second or third language is  becoming an advantage, if not a necessity. The practicalities of doing business  in an international capital, as well as the simple desire to communicate with  new neighbors from Latin America and Asia, is fueling a surge in the popularity  of foreign languages in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles phenomenon is part of a burgeoning national movement, spurred  by the desire to make the country more competitive, according to experts in the  field. Since the mid-1980s, high school and college foreign language  enrollments have been rising significantly throughout the country. Berlitz  Learning Centers for adults, the world's leading language school, reports  significant national growth, with California among the leading states.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growing Demand  </P> <P> Students are flocking to classes -- particularly Spanish and, increasingly,  Japanese -- on university campuses and at some community colleges and private  language schools throughout Los Angeles County. Some schools report a growing  demand by private firms and public agencies for classes offered at the  work-site and tailored to their needs. The translating and interpreting  business, meanwhile, is booming, with the ranks of court interpreters almost  doubling each year, according to leaders in that field.  </P> <P> The city's diverse ethnic mix provides unique combinations of languages and  students. Downtown lawyers and bankers, eager to do business with the Orient,  crowd Japanese classes; Korean merchants setting up shop in East Los Angeles  practice their Spanish; a jeweler at I. Magnin studies Korean to better serve  his growing Asian clientele.  </P> <P> Those attracted to foreign language classes "are reading the same information  we're reading that says the future of Los Angeles is multicultural," said  Marianne Kanter, coordinator of language courses at UCLA's extension program.  "And they're preparing themselves for that eventuality."  </P> <P> Carmelita Arsena Thomas, who runs the study-abroad program at Los Angeles City  College, also credits the new interest in languages to the realization that, in  international trade, "our competitors are beating us at our own game because  they have an edge of dealing with other cultures on their terms. Finally, the  American business community is becoming aware that we have to know the language  and culture of countries we want to do business with."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fastest-Growing Language  </P> <P> Japanese is favored among businessmen, the fastest-growing language in the  city, according to language experts. Some schools are also seeing increased  demand for other Asian and some Middle Eastern languages. While traditionally  strong Romance languages, particularly French, are holding their own, Spanish  remains overwhelmingly the most popular language.  </P> <P> Syrian-born Anahid Warwarian, 23, an accounting major at Los Angeles City  College, said she decided to learn Spanish soon after coming from Canada to Los  Angeles, where she found that Spanish is the city's "second language." Though  she already speaks four languages, Spanish has helped her interpret for her  jeweler husband and his Latino employees, she said.  </P> <P> "It's imperative that we learn to appreciate Latino culture and the language  since we live in the heart of it," said Derrick Harrison, a free-lance writer  who lives in Echo Park. After struggling through a Spanish class at the  community college last semester, Harrison compares not knowing Spanish in Los  Angeles to "going to a symphonic concert, listening but not being able to hear  the brass or the violin sections."  </P> <P> Suddenly, international bankers and merchants who floundered in high school and  college French and Spanish classes now listen to Japanese language cassettes on  their drive in to work, practicing with colleagues in the office.  </P> <P> Until Kenneth Slade joined the international law firm of Morgan, Lewis &amp;  Bockius, he thought that "studying languages was something you did in high  school," he said. But when Slade moved to California from the East Coast a few  years ago, he found the large Japanese presence here "startling."  </P> <P> "New Yorkers like to think of themselves as the beginning of the country and  California as the place where the country falls off," he said. "But to the  Japanese, California is the gateway and New York the backwater."  </P> <P> Now a frequent business traveler to Japan, Slade wants to learn enough Japanese  to at least show his new clients that "we are interested in them and their  country." More than a dozen of his colleagues join him at a class offered  through UCLA extension at the firm's downtown law offices.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Help Them Move Up  </P> <P> Mickey Jannol, a vice president at the downtown Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co.,  is taking a Japanese class with about 20 colleagues. Many, he said, hope the  class will help them move up in the Japanese firm. "I think that learning  Japanese is an advantage and also demonstrates a greater ability and commitment  (to the company) on my part," Jannol said.  </P> <P> For free-lance commercial photographer Bruce Ayres of Culver City, who spent  his teen-age years in Japan, the growing importance of the Japanese language in  the business world is "like coming full circle," he said.  </P> <P> Ayres, 37, is increasingly finding work among Japanese advertising agencies  that come to California to produce commercials. His plans are to eventually go  to Tokyo to directly market his work there. In a world growing smaller by the  day, Ayres said, "We can no longer afford to take the egotistical position of,  'Let the rest of the world learn English.' "  </P> <P> Earlier this year in Washington, a task force of the National Governors' Assn.  came to a similar conclusion. Addressing the need to make the country more  competitive in world trade, the task force urged that all college graduates be  conversant in a second language and that training begin as early as the first  grade.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Insular Students'  </P> <P> "How are we to sell our products in a global economy when we neglect to learn  the languages of our customers? How are we to open overseas markets when other  cultures are only dimly understood? How are our firms to provide international  leadership when our schools are producing insular students?" asked Gov. Gerald  L. Baliles of Virginia, chairman of the association.  </P> <P> David Edwards of the Washington-based Joint National Committee for Languages,  an umbrella organization of foreign language teachers and educational  associations, said there are several signs already pointing to a shift toward a  more multilingual society. "We bottomed out in the late '70s," he said "By the  mid-1980s, we began to see a turnaround."  </P> <P> The signs include:  </P> <P> * More students taking foreign language classes in high school than at any time  in the previous 70 years.  </P> <P> * For the first time since 1971, more than 1 million college students enrolled  in classes.  </P> <P> * Enrollment has doubled in several states over the last two years.  </P> <P> * And, among all states, California ranks second only to New York in high  school foreign language enrollment, showing a 22% increase in recent years.  </P> <P> Last spring, the California Department of Education published its  recommendations for foreign language instruction, including a call for schools  to start training in the early grades. The report has been called unprecedented  in its forcefulness and is meant to offer guidance for school districts  throughout the state.  </P> <P> The report set a new direction for public school teaching, calling for what  educators describe as "community-based teaching," an emphasis on speaking a  language rather than the more traditional method of writing and memorizing  grammar rules. The approach is already popular among private adult schools such  as Berlitz.  </P> <P> The state recommendations also promote another new trend in the field known as  "conservation," calling on schools to help children who already speak foreign  languages to continue to develop their skills.  </P> <P> "We have this fantastic resource of language in our state," said Adele Martinez  of the state Department of Education who helped prepare the report. "And the  need is so urgent and immediate that we have to look at using the resources we  already have."  </P> <P> Yet despite the momentum in the foreign language field, she said, "changes  don't happen overnight."  </P> <P> Already there are shortages of teachers and interpreters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Demand Outstrips Supply  </P> <P> Despite an exponential growth in the ranks of interpreters in the Los Angeles  County Superior Court system, the court's demand outstrips the supply. The  courts are short an average of nearly 10 interpreters each day, said Ed  Johnson, director of the court's interpreting and translating services.  </P> <P> In 1962, the court employed five full-time interpreters at a cost of about  $29,000 per year. Today the court -- the largest single employer of  interpreters in the county -- keeps more than 450 on the payroll at an annual  cost of $6 million. The interpreters speak about 80 different languages among  them.  </P> <P> Noting that UCLA's extension program is perhaps the only school in the area  offering state-accredited interpreter training, Johnson said there is a need  for more of these programs. Meanwhile, the court's judges are trying to address  the problem, including instituting an in-house training program of their own.  </P> <P> Another example of the difficulty in meeting the new demand for language  services can be found in the teaching field. Last year there were 80 Japanese  language teaching positions available at universities throughout the country,  but only 15 new doctoral graduates to fill them, said Noriko Akatsuka, a  professor of Japanese at UCLA. A similar shortage exists this year.  </P> <P> At UCLA, the demand for Japanese classes has more than tripled in recent years,  with students turned away from full classes, Akatsuka said. At City College, a  crossroads for many of Los Angeles' ethnic communities, enrollment in language  courses has almost doubled over the last couple of years to about 2,300 per  semester, department Chairman Roger Fernandez said.  </P> <P> Most students take the courses to fulfill the state school system's foreign  language requirement, but the classes also attract those who want to learn a  language for their job or for more personal reasons.  </P> <P> Japanese classes have drawn significant numbers of Asian-Americans interested  in learning their ancestors' language. And other students, such as music  teacher Barbara Hasty, who recently completed a course in Chinese, are learning  languages because they want to be able to communicate with members of Los  Angeles' diverse ethnic communities.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Common Ground'  </P> <P> "It creates some common ground," said Hasty, who has numerous Asians among her  students at East Los Angeles College.  </P> <P> Alfredo Mendoza, chairman of the college's foreign languages department, has  seen a steady rise in the numbers of Asian students taking his Spanish classes.  Some are merchants who operate small businesses in the neighborhood and want to  learn the language of their customers and employees, he said.  </P> <P> Similarly, other Los Angeles merchants are taking Asian languages to deal with  local Asian customers. Erik Laykin, vice president of Laykin et Cie., jewelers  at the I. Magnin downtown store, is learning Korean because, over the last  decade, the area has come under the growing influence of nearby Koreatown,  changing the store's clientele. About a third of the store's customers are now  Korean or other Asians who buy fine jewelry "with a passion," Laykin said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unprecedented Growth  </P> <P> Private language schools, which cater to a post-college clientele, are also  experiencing unprecedented growth.  </P> <P> U.S. enrollment at the international Berlitz Language Centers, which has  offices in 26 countries, grew by 37% from 1986 to 1988, said spokeswoman  Patricia Zse. In California, enrollment jumped 55% in the same period.  </P> <P> Despite the dramatic surge, the United States has a long way to go to match the  demand in Japan, which remains Berlitz's fastest-growing division worldwide,  she said. "The Japanese have always been quick to realize that if they're going  to get ahead, they have to speak English," she said.  </P> <P> Guillermo Frixione opened One-Twelve USA Language Services about four years ago  in Burbank, hoping to capitalize on the demand for English classes by the  city's large immigrant population. Long waiting lists for English classes at  the city school district's adult schools -- which has reached 50,000 at times  -- show the desire of newly arrived immigrants to learn the language of their  new homeland.  </P> <P> But though most of his classes started out teaching English, Frixione was  surprised to find that demand was outstripped by a stronger need for Spanish,  especially among companies who contract with his firm's job-site program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Two-Way Program  </P> <P> Several manufacturing firms with predominantly Spanish-speaking staffs have  contracted with the firm for a two-way program that provides Spanish classes  for English-speaking managers while teaching English to workers, Frixione said.  </P> <P> Frixione's clients, like those at most language schools for adults, run the  gamut from manufacturing plants and service industries, such as hotels with  largely Latino work forces, to a wide array of public agencies.  </P> <P> Some hospitals, like many public agencies serving Latino communities, still  depend largely on bilingual staff to interpret for patients. At Bay Harbor  Hospital, for example, the hospital offers translation services in more than a  dozen languages through its diverse staff. Nearby Los Angeles Harbor College  occasionally provides teachers for classes at the hospital on medical  terminology for Spanish-speakers participating in the hospital's interpreting  program.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Increasingly Frustrated  </P> <P> Still, Dr. Richard Goldin, who is affiliated with the hospital, said he became  increasingly frustrated by his inability to communicate with Spanish-speaking  patients. "Interpreters are worthless" when it comes to translating the  vagaries of pain, said Goldin, a specialist in arthritis and rheumatism.  </P> <P> So, when the hospital offered a Spanish class for physicians about three years  ago, he signed up.  </P> <P> Goldin, who teaches residents at the hospital, said that in his lectures, he  tells them that in a city with such a large Spanish-speaking population as Los  Angeles, doctors "owe it to their patients to know their language. . . . You  can get a . . . lot deeper in a person's skin if you can talk to them."  </P></p>

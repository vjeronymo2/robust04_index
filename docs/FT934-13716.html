			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kaufhof takes specialty message to New York - The efforts of a German retailer to launchan ADR programme in the US RARELY does a chief executive of a large German company take the trouble to fly to North America to present his company to US investors; even more rarely, amid Germany's deep recession, does that chief executive have an optimistic message to communicate. Today, when Mr Jens Odewald, chief executive of Kaufhof Holding, launches a series of presentations to investment institutions in New York and Boston, he will have done both. He will tell the institutions that group turnover for the current year is set to rise by more than 10 per cent from the DM20.46bn (Dollars 12.58bn) made last year. He has already predicted a substantial rise in earnings for the group after net profits of DM222.4m last year. The presentations will coincide with the launch of Kaufhof's sponsored American Depositary Receipt (ADR) programme for its shares. The retailer will become one of the handful of German companies to set up such a programme. The move falls short of the commitment to the US investment community shown by Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial company, which early this month obtained a full listing for its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Kaufhof is majority-owned by the privately-owned Swiss-based Metro Group, and the interests of institutional shareholders will always be secondary to those of Mr Otto Beisheim, proprietor of the DM60bn-plus Metro empire. However, the timing of Kaufhof's ADR programme seems designed to prompt investors to draw parallels with Daimler-Benz - and Kaufhof will emerge favourably from the comparison, even if for accounting reasons they will not be comparing like with like. When Daimler-Benz came to New York it announced a loss of DM949bn for the first six months of the year (under US accounting rules). The Cologne-based Kaufhof group is one of a small group of large German companies which will be able to increase earnings (under German accounting rules) and turnover in 1993, the nadir of the worst recession in Germany since the second world war. Among fellow members of the DAX index of 30 leading shares, only a few banks and construction companies will be able to match this performance. The recession has hit consumer spending hard and Mr Odewald expects the German retail sector to shrink by a real 1 to 2 per cent this year. The group's performance has less to do with market conditions than with the strategy that the 53-year old Mr Odewald has pursued since he took over as chief executive in 1985. Under Mr Odewald, Kaufhof has diversified away from department store business, which has been at the heart of the group since it was founded 115 years ago. The focus of the expansion has been specialty retailing. 'There is no growth to be had out of department stores,' Mr Odewald said in an interview last week. 'Specialty stores on the other hand are increasing sales by 10 to 13 per cent a year. 'The merchandise is the same as in a department store, but the business is far more profitable. Your costs are lower because you tend to be in a suburban area rather than the city centre, and the concentration on one market niche gives the consumer a clear answer as to why he or she should go shopping in this store rather than anywhere else.' The group began its move into the specialty sector in 1985 with the acquisition of a stake in Saturn-Elektro, a consumer electronics store based in Cologne. Following a mixture of acquisition and organic growth, sales in this segment have risen from DM270m in 1987 to an expected DM4bn to DM4.5bn this year. Other specialty activities include Reno, a low-price shoe-retailing chain, and Vobis Microcomputer, Europe's largest retailer of IBM-compatible personal computers. Kaufhof bought 50 per cent of Vobis in 1989, taking its holding to 65 per cent at the beginning of this year. Within three years, sales have grown from DM300m to DM1.5bn in 1992 and a projected DM1.8bn to DM1.9bn for the current year. A further market segment is tourism: last year Kaufhof bought a majority stake in Kuoni, the Swiss tourism company. Sales in this area have grown from DM200m in 1975 to some DM6bn this year. Specialty retailing last year accounted for 28 per cent of group sales and 44 per cent of profits, while department stores generated 48 per cent of sales and 47 per cent of profit. Mr Odewald will today tell investors that specialty retailing has the potential to increase to between 35 per cent and 40 per cent of the business portfolio by 1997. He is confident that the group will maintain its resilience to the difficult consumer spending environment of the current decade. 'Specialty retailing is the runner of the 1990s,' he believes. Investors appear to share that optimism. The shares have climbed by more than 35 per cent since the beginning of the year, and at DM568 yesterday are 7 per cent higher than when Kaufhof announced its ADR plans earlier this month.</p>

			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / A new car industry set to rise in the east: The German translation of the Japanese gospel of lean production The air in Eisenach appears to encourage religious zeal. In the town where Martin Luther first translated the Bible into German, the European motor industry is now trying to translate the gospel of Japanese lean production into German. Opel, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, yesterday officially opened its DM1bn, (Pounds 400m) assembly plant where less than two years ago the east German motor industry was building antiquated Wartburgs. For GM, the Eisenach plant is a chance to demonstrate that on a greenfield site in Europe it can achieve the high quality, productivity and efficiency of the Japanese 'transplants' set up by Nissan, Toyota and Honda in the UK, and which have already sprung up across North America in the last decade. For the hard-pressed German government it is a chance to show that reunification can lead to the rapid regeneration of east German industry. Yesterday was an occasion for proclamations of faith, both in the industrial re-birth of east Germany and of GM. 'Today we must say 'Go east], young man, go east',' declared Mr Jack Smith, GM president, yesterday. In North America the GM president plans to close 21 plants by the mid-1990s, but in Europe GM needs new capacity to respond to a market that has reached record sales levels for seven successive years. In terms of sales volumes the boldness of the GM vision - the speed of execution in Europe contrasts vividly with the picture of GM's lumbering bureaucracy in North America - has already been rewarded. In eastern Germany Opel has emerged as the number one make ahead of Volkswagen. Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, came to Eisenach for the first time on January 8, 1990, and is the driving force behind GM's push into east Germany. GM may need the extra volumes offered by Eisenach, but Mr Hughes insists, 'We have only one interest and that is to make sure that the lean production process is in place in all its purity, regardless of volume. We could have a fast start-up and not have the process in place, but we are not going to sacrifice the process.' He clearly thinks that Eisenach can act as a catalyst for Opel's huge and expensive west German operations. GM Europe has brought together a small management team of like-minded believers, who have long experience either of GM's North American joint ventures with Toyota (Nummi) and with Suzuki (Cami), or who have been drawn directly from Toyota in the US. 'We call them advisers,' says Mr Hughes, 'but in another sense they are more like missionaries - and we are in need of conversion. It is close to religion, it is a life philosophy, it is that different'. He says: 'It needs a complete change of thinking. Under mass production the individual was subordinated to the machine. The manpower was paced to the pace of the machines. In lean production the machines are paced to the men. Lean production is oriented towards people, while mass production is oriented to capital and equipment. 'The mass production of Henry Ford has no future. Lean production is the second great industrial revolution, after the invention of the assembly line.' According to Mr Hughes, GM has already tried elements of lean production in pilot projects at European plants, from team working, to zero-defect production strategies, just-in-time components delivery and continuous improvement techniques. 'When you combine all the elements of people, materials, equipment and systems, the results can be staggering. We would normally need much more than 3,000 people to get the same capacity as Eisenach with 2,000 people.' Mr Hughes says he is targeting Eisenach to operate at the level of the Japanese transplants. 'We have reason to believe we will achieve this. We would hope to be far more efficient than any of our European competition.' Eisenach has been designed to produce two GM ranges, the Astra small family car which started yesterday, but more importantly it will become the second plant in Europe - along with Zaragoza in Spain - for production of GM's new generation Opel Corsa/Vauxhall Nova, to be unveiled next year. Output should eventually reach 150,000 cars a year. For the moment GM has not only the advantage of a greenfield site and an enthusiastic and young workforce eager to learn new working methods, but also wage rates are 40 per cent of those at its Russelsheim plant, near Frankfurt. The gap is supposed to close somewhat in the next few years, but for the moment the Eisenach workers receive no extra holiday pay, no 13th month of salary and they work longer hours than their pampered colleagues in western Germany - 40 hours a week versus 37 1/2 . They also receive only 24 days holiday a year against 30 days in the west. The seeds of division and tension are plain to see. With 19 per cent official unemployment in Eisenach and as much as 43 per cent unofficial unemployment in the Thuringen region, Mr Volkmar Jonik, a 34-year-old production supervisor, who joined Opel from the old Wartburg plant, admits that many were euphoric to get the Opel jobs at Eisenach. 'We cannot have everything at once,' he says, but he admits tensions are rising. 'We pay the same prices for many things, for petrol, for food, rents are rising, but we only get half the pay.' Last week Mr Louis Hughes took his GM Europe top executives on a character-building course to the Swiss Alps. He managed to get them abseiling together, but it remains to be seen whether he can scale the automotive cliffs of a united but still socially divided Germany.</p>

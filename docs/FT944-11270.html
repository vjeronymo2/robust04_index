			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Emerging Markets: Peru steps out to woo the investors - The Emerging Investor Strong economic recovery after years of recession underpins the stock market boom that is making Lima the new darling among Latin American emerging markets. Selected Peruvian stocks - particularly in the mining, banking and cement sectors - have featured consistently among Baring Securities' list of best performers worldwide over the past couple of months. Peru is also making its debut in the international capital market place. Six weeks ago, Banco Wiese became the first Peruvian company to raise capital through a level 3 ADR issue on the New York stock exchange. The offering was heavily oversubscribed and institutional investors who bought in saw immediate gains of nearly 20 per cent. Equally significant is that Peruval, the stockbroker, has just succeeded in raising more than Dollars 50m of venture capital for its newly-constituted company, Peru Real Estate. 'This is Peru's first venture capital deal,' says Mr Lorenzo Sousa, joint managing director of Peruval. 'Five Peruvians went to New York and raised Dollars 22m in 48 hours, with PaineWebber underwriting more than Dollars 50m. We've raised real money on nothing but a project. That's unprecedented.' Peruval's backers are institutional investors in the US and Europe, including George Soros' Quantum Fund, Lehman Brothers and Martin Curry of Edinburgh. The project offers them a 37 per cent internal rate of return over the medium term - 'more than realistic in today's Peru,' says Mr Sousa. Three main factors have helped spur recent investor enthusiasm for Lima. Firstly, the realisation that spectacular economic growth is solidly based; secondly, highly encouraging third-quarter results from some leading companies; and finally President Fujimori's late October visit to New York, where he completed a busy programme of promotional contacts with investors and the business community. Lima's general share index registered a rise of 8.7 per cent last month, while the selective index of 15 blue chips put on 8.5 per cent. By the end of October, market capitalisation had jumped to Dollars 8.3bn, putting on 3 per cent in the month and 64 per cent since the start of the year. Volumes traded in both September and October were about Dollars 370m, some 60 per cent higher than August. The daily average traded over the past 12 months has been Dollars 13.5m, with foreign investors accounting for maybe 45 per cent of the total. Recent activity, it is true, comes after a sluggish period from April to July. The index put on some 40 per cent in the first quarter of the year, on domestic economic growth prospects and increased direct foreign investment. The Dollars 2bn purchase by Telefonica, the Spanish group, of a controlling share in formerly state-owned telecommunications companies Entel and CPT gave the market a special boost. Like all other Latin American stock markets, however, Lima responded negatively to the successive rises in US interest rates and, in lesser measure, to the assassination in March of Mr Donaldo Colosio, the Mexican presidential candidate. More than a quarter was knocked off values in the April to August period. 'Lima isn't immune to the generalised rise and fall of world markets,' says Mr Jose Miguel Gamarra, head of research at Baring's Lima office. 'But the real difference here is Peru's excellent economic performance which is not found in other emerging markets.' Peruvian GDP has grown by 12.3 per cent in the first nine months of the year with the fishing and construction sectors each topping 30 per cent growth. Last year, output rose by 6.5 per cent. Inflation, meanwhile, seems to have been tamed. October price rises in Peru  -at less than 0.3 per cent - were lower than in most of the developed world. Inflation looks likely to end the year below 18 per cent. On the back of these achievements, large companies are turning in sharply improved performances. Mr Miguel Palomino, director of Peru's recently-opened Lima office of Smith New Court, says the 24 leading Peruvian companies he monitors closely are expected to announce 1994 profits on average double last year's. The turnround in companies' performance answers the question of whether, with current p/e's of about 25, Peruvian stocks are overvalued. 'If you are looking backwards, maybe yes, but projecting ahead to 1995, definitely no,' says Mr Palomino. He predicts an average p/e of about 15 for the coming year for market leaders. Since current strong growth follows years of recession (GDP dropped 25 per cent between 1988 and 1992), Peruvian companies find themselves with installed capacity to spare - at present, only about 60 per cent is utilised, allowing for rapid expansion on minimal investment. With Peru investing heavily in upgrading infrastructure and consumer demand picking up, local analysts are still tipping the basics as best local bets for growth. Mining companies Buenaventura (silver and gold), Minsur (tin), SPCC (copper) and Milpo (lead and zinc) are highly recommended, for their management as well as their prospects. Cementos Lima, newly transferred to the private sector and Cementos Norte Pacasmayo, which is soon to be privatised; brewers Backus and Johnston and CNC; and CPT and Tele 2000, the telecommunications companies, are the stocks on every broker's list of recommendations. Peru's financial sector, too, 'is going to grow like crazy,' says Mr Palomino. The Banco de Credito, Peru's largest bank with some 29 per cent of all deposits, showed profits of Dollars 30m in the first nine months, while Banco Wiese, the second private bank, notched up profits of Dollars 21m. Following the success of Banco Wiese's ADR issue there should be several more Peruvian issues in coming months. The Delgado Parker telecommunications group will launch Pantel, and Cementos Lima will follow its June international over-the-counter offering by registering a number of its shares under the ADR mechanism. Prospects for further stock market expansion are good. The Fujimori administration's aggressive privatisation programme is in full swing and a residue of state-held shares (the state is initially retaining about 30 per cent in privatised telecommunications and energy sector companies) will gradually be released on to the local market. According to Peruval, these initial public offerings could boost Lima's market capitalisation from its present Dollars 8bn to about Dollars 14bn by late next year and Dollars 19bn by 1996. With general elections coming up in less than six months, the stock market might be expected to go through a bumpy patch. No serious challenger to Mr Fujimori, however, shows any desire to deviate from the firm economic lines set by the current administration and analysts expect sustained annual growth of at least 5 per cent for the next three or four years.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Ten best performing stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                          Friday    Week on week change Stock                         Country   4/11/94     Dollars        %  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Norte Pacasmayo                  Peru    4.3376      0.8707    25.12 Aksa Akrilik ve Kinya Sanayii  Turkey    0.7847      0.1336    20.53 Eczacibasi Ilac                Turkey    0.0991      0.0146    17.30 Lucky Securities              S Korea   30.4874      4.3715    16.74 MDX                          Thailand    4.4881      0.5948    15.28 Daewoo Securities             S Korea   47.5503      5.7398    13.73 Kia Motors                    S Korea   23.4615      2.7446    13.25 Cho Heung Bank                S Korea   18.0666      1.9953    12.42 Korea First Bank              S Korea   17.5648      1.7536    11.09 Koc Holding                    Turkey    0.6883      0.0650    10.42  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Baring Securities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

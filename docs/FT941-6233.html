			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK set to take lead in North Sea oil stakes Britain could overtake Norway this year as western Europe's biggest producer of oil and natural gas liquids and might be able to maintain a forecast peak output of 2.5m barrels a day until 1998, according to Wood Mackenzie, the Edinburgh-based energy consultancy. Norway's contribution to North Sea output would fall to 49 per cent from 53 per cent in 1993 while UK production was expected to rise by 30 per cent this year. The decline in Norway's share would occur despite an expected 9 per cent increase in output to a record 2.59m barrels a day, WoodMac said. It estimated that 327 field production days would be lost in Norway this year, up from 160 in 1993, because of scheduled maintenance. That included the shutdown of the Ekofisk centre, the hub for oil and gas fields that feed into the Norpipe transportation system. 'Scheduled maintenance is expected to result in the deferment of over 23m barrels of production in 1994 compared with 16m barrels in 1993,' the consultancy said. Unscheduled stoppages in 1993 accounted for 14 per cent of total lost production days, it added, resulting in the deferment of more than 2m barrels of oil and natural gas liquids. Four new Norwegian fields were expected to be brought on stream this year, contributing some 80,000 b/d a day. But the new supply would be staggered throughout the year and therefore would not have a significant impact on Norway's production profile. On the UK side of the North Sea WoodMac believed that the present build-up of production to a forecast average of 2.5m b/d this year might be maintained to 1998. The figure is the highest since 1987 and, if achieved, would represent a second peak in UK North Sea production. The forecasts coincided with the publication yesterday of official figures confirming the surge in UK petroleum production. In the three months to the end of January oil output was 30m tonnes, a 21.4 per cent rise from a year earlier, according to the Department of Trade and Industry. Natural gas output rose by 15.4 per cent. The optimistic outlook of the WoodMac study was based on the likelihood that a record number of new fields - 62 - would receive development approval in the next three years or so. Those included some with large potential reserves, such as the Foinaven and Schiehallion fields, which British Petroleum and its partners have found in deep water west of the Shetland Islands. The fields likely to be developed contain at least 3.5bn barrels of oil and 13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, equivalent to about 30 per cent of the UK's remaining commercial reserves. Their importance in sustaining higher levels of UK output is such that by 2000 they could account for 40 per cent of total oil production. The WoodMac analysts conceded that the persistence of prices for the benchmark Brent Blend of under Dollars 15 a barrel would erode the confidence of companies. But their research suggested that a relatively high level of development activity would continue on the UK continental shelf. The study estimated that investment of Pounds 15bn in real terms would be needed to develop the fields. Peak annual expenditure of Pounds 3bn would be in 1996, when it would account for 70 per cent of the industry's expected capital spending. Ms Kate Jackson, a WoodMac analyst, said the fields under study showed a bias towards oil, whereas gas figured more prominently in previous years. The potential gas production of the fields of 3,000m cubic feet a day by 2000 was unlikely to be required, she said, even though independent gas marketing companies were lining up sources of supply to compete with British Gas when the domestic market was opened up to competition beginning in 1996. The development timetables of some of the mainly gas fields could slip, she said, until gas demand increased in the early years of the next decade.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Tory MPs fight shy of the ERM AS THEY emerged from a series of crisis meetings, prime minister John Major and chancellor Norman Lamont must have been dismayed yesterday at their party's apparent lack of enthusiasm for the exchange rate mechanism. In the constituencies, party members were bemused as they struggled to make sense of events experts on their television screens are unable to agree on. 'The average member in the last 24 hours is just totally, utterly confused,' said Mr Malcolm Griffiths, Conservative association chairman in the Tory-held Langbaurgh constituency. 'They don't really understand what's going on. I'd think that covers a fair number of MPs too.' It is vital to the credibility of both Mr Major and Mr Lamont that they win their party's support for the resumption of sterling's participation in the ERM, assuming the system survives the French referendum on Sunday. The party conference in Brighton is just two weeks away and in spite of the cabinet's unanimous backing, it was clear that it was far from shoring up support lower down the hierarchy. Loyalists like Mr Terence Higgins, former chairman of the Treasury and Civil Service select committee, tried to portray Tory Euro-sceptics as a hard-line minority who 'have created a greater impression of disunity in the party than in fact exists'. But what was striking yesterday was the extent to which antipathy to the mechanism and the concept of fixed exchange rates appeared to have spread beyond the most vociferous of the 'usual suspects'. Many MPs wanted to see the ERM reformed to make it more flexible. Such pragmatists are the people Mr Major and Mr Lamont urgently need to win back. Sir Ivan Lawrence, MP for Burton and chairman of the home affairs select committee, was among those who said the ERM was 'nothing like flexible enough'. He said: 'We are so much at the mercy of gambling by the banks - it helps them and hinders us to have a set level below which you couldn't go. I have always thought tying ourselves into the ERM was not good for the economy. My economic betters may have better judgment than I but emotionally I am against it.' Mr George Walden, MP for Buckingham and a former junior minister, said the mechanism had to be 'rejigged'. Emu was not 'a very plausible aim after all this'. He called for consideration to be given to linking sterling to the reformed mechanism 'in some lower and looser form'. Mr Peter Ainsworth, MP for ultra-safe Surrey East, said the past few days had demonstrated that fixed exchange rates were 'fallible'. But he backed the way the government responded to this week's crisis. 'It was the only option yesterday to get out. It is prudent of the government to make it a temporary suspension.' Mr Winston Churchill, MP for Davyhulme, also voiced strong support for the chancellor, characterising the government's attempt at honouring its ERM obligations as 'brave but forlorn'. The crisis was 'likely to prove excellent news for those who feared the worst'. Among those who unreservedly opposed a return to the ERM was Mr John Wilkinson, MP for Ruislip-Northwood, who said it was 'not acceptable' for the government to 'swan' back into the mechanism and warned of trouble in next week's Commons debate. 'They have another thought coming if they imagine they will have our unconditional support.' Support for a return to the mechanism 'as soon as we can' came from Mrs Edwina Currie, MP for Derbyshire South and another former minister. If Britain remained outside the ERM, there was 'a fear it would affect foreign investment'. In the constituencies, the past two days' events have also aroused strong feelings. Moves towards closer European integration have been questioned by some Tory supporters who had not previously challenged the concept. 'It's very sad the stability Europe offered has proved to be a bit of an illusion,' said Mr Harry Davies, chairman of the Stockton north Conservative association. Mr Davies, who is on the left of the Tory party, believes the crisis will make party members reassess their views on Europe, and force Conservative leaders to review the policy of total reliance on inflation control. He hopes it will lead to greater flexibility. He said: 'I joined the Conservative party because I didn't like dogma.' There was a general feeling that Mr Major's survival chances were better than Mr Lamont's. Mr Davies said he had a 'soft spot' for Mr Heseltine, although many Conservatives think him 'a little erratic'. It was very unlikely that Mr Major would go. But he warned: 'It's a little like football when the team's in trouble and the chairman says, I have the fullest confidence in the manager. And then, the next week, he goes.'</p>

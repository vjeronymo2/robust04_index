			<p>BFN     [Text] Rwanda is obviously still at the top of the news.  On the one hand there is talk of negotiations that might start  between the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] and the government,  but details of this are still extremely unclear.    Meanwhile, things are speeding up in Kigali as far as  fighting is concerned. Shells fell just now right by the  runways at the airport, and all air traffic is halted for the  moment. Simone Remont, RTBF special correspondent, is still  there, and she has just called us:    [Begin Remont recording] The situation has worsened  considerably in Kigali this morning. Mortar fire started again  at dawn, and has not stopped, and it is coming very close to the  airport. For example, at 0900 they hit the apron, less than 200  meters from where we are, as convoys of Belgian peacekeeping  troops are completing their withdrawal to Kigali airport.    The district of Gikondo, southeast of the town center, is a  densely populated area. There has been firing this morning.  Encircling maneuvers continue. The RPF is seizing all the  strategic points around the capital.    This morning, two convoys went to the north and south of the  town to pick up about 30 expatriates, including 12 Belgians.  These are the very last operations of the kind, and the  departure of the paratroopers should be completed today -- if  the shooting permits, of course. But perhaps this is a just a  warning to tell them to hurry. Anything is possible after the  12-hour time limit. [end recording]    The arrivals continue, and just before 1000 a seventh plane  bringing people evacuated from Rwanda back to Belgium landed at  Zaventem airport. It was a Sabena airbus, coming from Nairobi,  with 158 people on board.</p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICHIGAN STATE TAKES ON NATIVES;  </P> <P> ALOHA BOWL: NO. 22 SPARTANS FACE NO. 25 RAINBOWS IN HAWAII ON CHRISTMAS DAY.  </P> <P> Michigan State's strength and Hawaii's speed make the Aloha Bowl a tossup,  Spartan Coach George Perles said.  </P> <P> No. 22 Michigan State (7-4) plays No. 25 Hawaii (9-2-1) Christmas Day (12:30  p.m. PST, Ch. 7) in a game that pits a Big Ten Conference power against the  wide-open offense and tenacious defense of a Western Athletic Conference  contender.  </P> <P> "We're a little bit bigger on the line than some of their people -- not all of  them," Perles said. "They're a little quicker. So it's a wash."  </P> <P> "That's why they're calling it an intriguing matchup," Hawaii Coach Bob Wagner  said.  </P> <P> The Spartans are seven-point favorites, but Perles said his team is not paying  attention to oddsmakers.  </P> <P> "If we don't win the football game, it's not going to be because of the  weather, it's not going to be because of the time zone, it's not going to be  because of distractions," Perles said. "It's going to be because the University  of Hawaii is a better football team."  </P> <P> Michigan State, making its fifth bowl appearance in six years, brings a  seasoned team. Its losses were all to nationally ranked teams -- Notre Dame,  Miami (Fla.), Michigan and Illinois. It lost those games by 21 points.  </P> <P> All-American linebacker Percy Snow, winner of the Lombardi and Butkus awards,  anchors the Michigan State defense.  </P> <P> The Spartans allowed 13.6 points -- least in the Big Ten and sixth best in the  nation. They ranked 11th in the nation in total defense, allowing 285.2 yards,  and 11th against the rush with 100.8 yards.  </P> <P> The Spartans are intimidating on offense as well, with All-American left tackle  Bob Kula leading a line averaging 281 pounds. Behind them, tailback Blake Ezor  averaged 124 yards, seventh best in the nation.  </P> <P> Hawaii's "spread" offense, a run-and-shoot passing attack and option running  game, should keep the Rainbows from having to run into the full force of  Michigan State's stunt 4-3 defense.  </P> <P> "I think we'll do all right because overall they're probably a bit larger than  us, but I don't think they have the team speed or quickness we do," slot back  Dane McArthur said. "It will be a real thinking game for our offense."  </P> <P> The Rainbows, making their first bowl appearance, were fifth in the nation in  scoring offense, with 38 points. They scored 60 points or more against three  opponents and 56 in a rout of then-No. 18 Brigham Young.  </P> <P> Garrett Gabriel finished 11th in the nation in passing efficiency. Running back  Jamal Farmer, who won WAC newcomer and freshman of the year honors, set an NCAA  record for most touchdowns by a freshman with 18. He gained 986 yards, 242 in  Hawaii's season finale against Air Force.  </P> <P> "It's like playing two teams," Perles said. "Normally a team that plays the  option doesn't throw the ball well and vice versa. They do both, and that's why  they have such an outstanding record."  </P> <P> Hawaii led the WAC and was sixth in the nation in rushing defense, allowing an  average of 96 yards. The Rainbows also led the WAC in total defense (320.2  yards) and scoring defense (20.7 points).  </P> <P> Although outsized by Michigan State's line, Hawaii's quickness could also be a  factor on defense.  </P> <P> "I think we can match up with our speed," rover back David Maeva said. "We have  to use that to our advantage."  </P> <P> Hawaii will be without All-WAC nose guard Dana Directo, who suffered a  herniated disk in his back.  </P></p>

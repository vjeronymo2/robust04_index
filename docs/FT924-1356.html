			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / It's a wonderful life: In 1992 Major snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, yet his new year prospects look rosy Mr John Major's political career looks far more promising this Christmas than it did a year ago. Oh yes it does. A brief recapitulation will make the point. In December 1991 the prime minister was rightly given credit for his part in negotiating the then newly minted Maastricht deal. Against all expectations, he achieved terms that had been agreed in advance by the entire cabinet. He thought that the package had therefore been pre-sold to parliament and the people. It was, he said, 'game, set and match' for Britain. That should have given him a warm glow. If so, it did not last. Before Christmas day dawned Mr Christopher Patten, then chairman of the Conservative party, had warned Mr Major that he could lose the forthcoming general election. What was worse, the Treasury thought so too. The contest could not be postponed for more than six months. There was scant reason to assume that the recession would end before the government's time was up. Without some indication that an economic upturn was on its way the Conservatives' chances of survival seemed to the party's leaders to be slim. There was no precedent for a fourth election victory in a row. It did not look like one would be set in 1992. Labour was apparently more popular than it had been since 1979. Its leader, Mr Neil Kinnock, was confident; its shadow ministers looked like winners. In contrast, the government appeared tired, devoid of new ideas, ready to be replaced after nearly 13 years in office. We may therefore conclude that the prospect for Mr Major last Christmas must have seemed awful. It was just a year since he had stepped into Number 10 Downing Street. The prime minister had conducted himself well during the Gulf war, but had achieved little else, apart from the necessary abolition of the poll tax. Losing the election would cost him his job as Conservative leader. He faced an ignominious end to a brief spell as the unknown prime minister. If history remembered him for anything, it would be for failing his party. As we know, the nightmare did not come true. The triumph was Mr Major's. On April 9 the electorate demonstrated, conclusively, that it would not contemplate a Labour government, not even one formed by Mr Kinnock's remodelled party. Less than 35 per cent of the votes cast were for Labour. That is a smaller proportion than was achieved after the winter of discontent in 1979. No wonder it now looks like the party of permanent opposition. Even a Clintonesque change of policy following a report from the its new Commission for Social Justice might not save it. The Tories scored a fraction under 42 per cent in April, virtually the same as in 1987 and 1983. The events of the recent autumnus horribilis aside, theirs is now becoming the party of permanent complacency. This simple arithmetic transformed the outlook for Mr Major. He became Conservative prime minister in his own right, not merely the fortunate victor of a party leadership contest. He could appoint his own cabinet, promote his own policies, and lead Britain towards Europe in the manner of his own choice, rather than that of his predecessor. He could look forward to being prime minister in the year 2000, presiding grandly over celebrations financed in part by the proceeds of the new national lottery announced yesterday. He can still do so, in spite of everything that has happened since the election. His reputation has been torn to shreds during the 13 weeks since Black Wednesday, but he is still there. To those who live by power, that is what counts. Mr Major continues in possession of the levers uniquely available to a British prime minister - the patronage, the ability to make or break the careers of his colleagues, the loyalty of (most of) his party. His popularity has vanished, but much of it can be won back. His authority has dwindled, but most of it can be recovered. He can repair his reputation, if not completely, then in sufficient measure for him to be able to do his job. More to the point, he can assume that most people will feel better off next Christmas. When the measures of economic optimism are once against positive, some of his popularity will be regained. The press has (so far) failed to dislodge the chancellor; for his part Mr Norman Lamont, who looks understandably tired, can tell himself that the economic cycle has not been abolished, that the September 16 devaluation, plus lower interest rates, plus a US recovery, must have a beneficial effect on the British economy. Most of Mr Major's colleagues believe that the government's recovery began six weeks ago, following the prime minister's parliamentary victory by a majority of three in the celebrated vote on the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty. If you accept this, the period of maximum demoralisation is seen to have been only seven weeks. It began when Britain fell out of the exchange rate mechanism on September 16 and ended on November 4, when the Tories scraped home late at night in the Commons. During all that time no minister or official apologised for the sudden collapse of the government's European and economic policies. The administration has simply reasserted itself. If fate has no more shocks in store, Mr Major's second Maastricht success, in Edinburgh last weekend, will be seen to have closed a chapter that, in time, could shrink to a footnote. Yet we have all, the prime minister included, learned a great deal. Mr Major and his colleagues have been given the roughest possible lesson in the realities of governing with a majority of only 21. Since any dozen Tories can, in cahoots with the opposition, topple the government, the Cabinet must proceed with caution. This suits Mr Major's temperament. The chancellor's Autumn Statement introduced a cautious incomes policy for public sector workers, with hopes of a knock-on to the private sector. It threw in a timid U-turn towards an industrial policy. When Mr Michael Heseltine has completed his review of pit closures it will doubtless contain a careful reference to 'energy policy', an interventionist phrase until recently abhorred by Tory ministers. Social security remains sacrosanct, and uncut. Thus have Mr Major's Conservatives moved to the left of, say, Mr Bill Clinton's Democrats. The country now perceives the prime minister's principal weaknesses, which include a stubborn defence of what has become indefensible, a reluctance to move ahead of his party, and an assumption of grandeur combined with a deficiency of grand ideas. It is also aware of his strengths, which lie in the area of one-to-one negotiations, deal-making, attention to detail, and willingness to consult his colleagues. Once the unknown Mr Nice Guy, Mr Major has become the all too well-known flawed politician. He cannot be cast in the heroic mould of his predecessor, which is a great relief. He is down to size: an ordinary chap who made a dreadful mess of his extraordinary job a month or so ago and is now recovering. We are getting to know him better. That is just as well. He could be around for many Christmases to come.</p>

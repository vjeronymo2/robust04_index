			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Pepped up for the counter-attack: Why drugs companies have their eyes on the market for non-prescription medicines World drugs groups are scrambling for position in the market for drugs that can be sold without a doctor's prescription. This week's Dollars 2.9bn acquisition by UK-based SmithKline Beecham of the retail healthcare business of US pharmaceutical group Sterling Winthrop was the largest, but not the first in a series of deals by groups jockeying for position in the 'over-the-counter' market. But in spite of their fashionableness, non-prescription pills are unlikely to prove a panacea for drugs companies troubled by slowing sales growth that has resulted from government attempts to curb healthcare costs. While some may generate long-term profits, the high costs of launching and marketing products in a competitive sector means many may fail to make decent returns. For now, the over-the-counter market appears deceptively attractive. SmithKline Beecham estimates world sales in the market last year rose by 7.1 per cent to Dollars 32.5bn. IMS International, the London market research company, forecasts the US market should increase from Dollars 17.4bn last year to Dollars 24.2bn by 1997. For drugs companies, the non-prescription market offers an opportunity for growth when other areas of their businesses are under pressure. The prescription medicines sector expanded by only 4 per cent in 1993, says IMS. But it is not just the lacklustre performance of other sectors which is fuelling interest in the over-the-counter market. 'The basic driving force is the need of governments to rein back healthcare spending,' explains Mr Chris Weighell, strategic planning manager of IMS International. 'In many cases, particularly in Europe, health ministries are re-fusing to reimburse the cost of drugs, forcing patients to pay for the medicines themselves over the counter.' The pharmaceuticals companies are also keen to sell formerly prescription-only medicines over the counter because it allows them to extend the product life of their drugs. This has become increasingly important for the drugs groups because patents on half of the 50 top-selling US medicines will expire in the next four years. Broker Goldman Sachs estimates that this year alone 17 drugs with combined US annual sales of Dollars 2.8bn will lose patent protection. That would be serious in any circumstances - in the past drugs companies assumed that they would lose 50 per cent of revenues within two years from drugs whose patents hadexpired - but the impact now is greater. Producers of identical, non-patented 'generic' drugs are entering markets earlier once patents expire. The result is a fall in prices: the price of generic versions of Naprosyn, made by US drugs company Syntex, fell by 95 per cent after its patents expired in January. Some drugs companies have even launched generic versions of their own drugs before patent expiry. To combat such pressures, companies selling patented drugs are trying harder to market them as over-the-counter products in the run-up to patent expiry. 'If they can create a strong brand, the product can generate revenues for decades,' says Mr Peter Glynn-Jones, managing director of strategic development at SmithKline Beecham consumer healthcare. The pharmaceuticals groups manufacturing prescription-only drugs have an advantage in the over-the-counter medicines market: 'Critical to the success of over-the-counter medicine is its prescription-only heritage,' says Mr John Walsh, president of US group Warner-Lambert's consumer products division. 'Ten of the top 11 over-the-counter products in the US were previously prescription-only medicines.' Among the medicines whose patents expire soon and could, assuming regulatory approval is granted, be sold without a prescription are some of the world's top-selling drugs. They include: anti-ulcer drug Zantac, Glaxo's best selling medicine, and Zovirax, Wellcome's herpes treatment and the world's fifth largest-selling drug. The sales potential of such drugs is, in theory, huge: sales of prescription products have been known to increase more than five-fold. Take Gyne-Lotrimin, a virtually unknown prescription anti-fungal medicine for vaginal infections marketed by US company Schering-Plough. Prescription sales in 1990 were worth only Dollars 22m. A year later, after being launched as an over-the-counter product, sales reached Dollars 120m. But in spite of the rapid projected growth for the over-the-counter market, many drugs groups which want to enter the over-the-counter market do not have the expertise, international distribution network, or size to succeed. 'The pharmaceutical groups are good at discovery, development and marketing to doctors. That expertise does not carry over well to over-the-counter,' says Mr Walsh at Warner-Lambert. Mr James Dudley, managing director of consultancy James Dudley International, says: 'Scale is vital. In order to earn a good return on your investment you have to have a good range of products to reach the shelves of the pharmacist or supermarket. You also need size to achieve the purchasing power to swing good deals in consumer advertising.' SmithKline Beecham bought Sterling Winthrop's business partly because of the latter's expertise in selling over-the-counter drugs such as Panadol, the world's best-selling painkiller after aspirin. Many large groups which have drugs they want to become over-the-counter products, but which have little presence in the non-prescription market, have admitted their weakness and set up alliances with companies strong in consumer marketing. Glaxo and Wellcome have forged separate pacts with Warner-Lambert. Merck has teamed up with Johnson &amp; Johnson, the US consumer products group. Yet such alliances will not guarantee sales success. Despite the growth of the total over-the-counter market, it is a tough environment. Unlike Schering-Plough's drug Gyne-Lotrimin, which was launched into a market with no established rivals, sales of many drugs may not exceed their pre-patent expiry prescription levels. Aleve, for example, Syntex's over-the-counter version of Naprosyn, is competing in the competitive market for analgesics (painkillers). Brokers Lehman Brothers expect it to generate sales in the US of no more than Dollars 200m a year, compared with prescription sales of Dollars 1bn last year. Similarly, the market for indigestion treatments is likely to prove exacting, with four similar new over-the-counter products being launched over the next two years. Lehman Brothers predict US non-prescription sales of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet will reach only Dollars 150m by 1998. That compares with pre-patent expiry sales of Dollars 650m last year. Even if decent sales are achieved, profitability is far from immediate. The launch and marketing costs are so high that typically products do not break even for at least three years, says Mr Glynn-Jones. If profits are made, margins are likely to be less attractive than in the prescription business. Boots Healthcare International, the non-prescription business of Boots, the UK retailing and pharmaceuticals group, estimates a successful over-the-counter company can achieve margins of 15 per cent. In contrast, brokers James Capel reckon a well-run drugs group can achieve operating margins of 29.3 per cent. Such sales and earnings projections, as well as the recent alliances and acquisitions, assume that prescription products will be cleared by regulatory authorities for sale over the counter - but at least in the US such clearance has proved far from automatic. The federal Food and Drug Administration advisory committees have refused to recommend, at least for the moment, SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, Merck's Pepcid, Wellcome's Zovirax, and Upjohn's Rogaine. They have yet to be convinced the drugs would be safe and effective when sold over the counter. In spite of relatively fast market growth, the road to profitable over-the-counter sales is far from uncertain.</p>

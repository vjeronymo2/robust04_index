			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Investors switch into sterling SUPPORT from Japanese and UK institutional investors buoyed the pound yesterday as financial markets began to take a more sanguine view of the repercussions if there is a change in the British government. Investors switched money into sterling on calculations that a Labour administration or a hung parliament was unlikely to lead to large-scale selling of the pound. As a result, sterling gained half a pfennig in London to close at DM2.8425. Government gilt-edged securities gained about half a point, while on the London stock market the FT-SE 100 Index of leading shares rose 3.3 to 2,404.2, continuing Monday's steady performance after a 65-point fall last week. Over the past few days, markets have taken heart from repeated assertions from Labour that it would keep sterling within its existing band in the European exchange rate mechanism. That has calmed investors, who last week worried that an incoming Labour administration would trigger a run on the pound. In such an event, the new government might be forced to increase interest rates, holding back faint stirrings of economic recovery. Yesterday's events indicate that many investors have come to terms with a Labour-led coalition or a Labour victory after tomorrow's general election. Mr Bill Simpson, an economist in Barclays Bank's foreign exchange division, said the buying pressure for sterling was due to fund managers 'appreciating that the room for further downward movement in sterling is limited and that there is plenty of upside potential'.

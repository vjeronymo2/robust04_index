			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Company News: General Re shares tumble on weak results SHARES in General Reinsurance lost about 10 per cent of their value yesterday morning, falling Dollars 8 1/2 to Dollars 79 7/8 , after the US insurer reported a sharp deterioration in first quarter underwriting results and warned that the rest of year would probably be 'unsatisfactory'. The news came as American International Group, the large composite insurer, also said it saw no pricing improvement in the domestic property-casualty industry. Its own shares slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 83 1/2 , and the two announcements caused shares across the industry to weaken. Aetna lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 ; Cigna fell by Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 51 7/8 ; and Travelers lost Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 20 7/8 . General Re, the largest reinsurance company in the US, reported a fall in operating profits, from Dollars 135.1m to Dollars 116.5m. The figure is struck before realised investment gains, which increased from Dollars 15.3m to Dollars 30.3m, and an accounting change item, which added Dollars 61m. After-tax profits, therefore, were Dollars 207.8m, against Dollars 150.4m. The company said underwriting results had been 'very disappointing' - the combined underwriting ratio for the property-casualty companies worsening from 99.7 per cent a year ago to 105.4 per cent - and warned more bad news was to come. 'Based on the first quarter results, the lead time required for our initiatives to take effect and several major insurance industry losses which have already occured in the second quarter, underwriting results are likely to be unsatisfactory for the balance of the year,' said Mr Ronald Ferguson, chairman. Meanwhile, AIG reported first-quarter profits of Dollars 413.9m after tax, up from Dollars 375.4m a year earlier. Pre-tax realised capital gains amounted to Dollars 28m compared with Dollars 23.6m. On the general insurance side, there was a tiny underwriting loss, compared with a Dollars 24.8m profit a year earlier. But net investment income increased by 9.2 per cent to Dollars 308.8m, taking operating profits to Dollars 308.2m compared with Dollars 307.9m last time. Operating profits from the life side increased by 16.1 per cent to Dollars 141.5m, while financial services contributed Dollars 62.4m (Dollars 47m). The insurer said it had not seen 'any material change in the pricing environment in the domestic property-casualty industry since the last quarter' but noted that several specialty classes of business continued to do well.</p>

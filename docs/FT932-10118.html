			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Uncertainty grows over Independent ownership UNCERTAINTY grew last night over the future ownership of Newspaper Publishing, publishers of The Independent and Independent on Sunday, following the failed attempt to buy the Observer, Raymond Snoddy writes. The company declined to comment on reports that the two principal shareholders, El Pais of Spain and La Repubblica of Italy had let it be known formally they each wanted to increase its stake from 18 per cent to 25 per cent. Both companies bought part of their holding at Pounds 5 a share but the latest package of shares went at Pounds 1.90 a share to Cerruti, the Italian manufacturer of printing presses. If El Pais and La Repubblica end up jointly owning a majority stake this would call into question the position of the founder of The Independent, Mr Andreas Whittam Smith, as both chief executive of the company and editor. Last week Sir Ralf Dahrendorf resigned as chairman of Newspaper Publishing partly because of opposition to the plan to buy the Observer but also because of what he saw as Mr Whittam Smith's increasingly authoritarian style of management. The company is urgently seeking a new chairman and Mr Ian Hay Davison, already a non-executive director, is seen as favourite. In the six months to March Newspaper Publishing had pre-tax profits of Pounds 341,000 but the company is likely to face increasing competition once The Guardian completes its expected purchase of the Observer. As a result of the last re-financing, limits on the size of individual shareholdings were removed. This means that Newspaper Publishing is now open to takeover should it run into financial difficulties and need to raise more capital.</p>

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTINENTAL AIR REPORTS LOSS OF $88.3 MILLION  </P> <P> Continental Airlines Holdings, which considered bankruptcy two weeks ago, said  Tuesday that it lost $88.3 million in the third quarter on revenue of $1.5  billion.  </P> <P> Continental, the Houston-based parent of Continental and Eastern airlines,  blamed high fuel costs and soft travel demand for much of the loss.  Continental's results were also hurt by a $17-million severance payment to  former Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who agreed in August to sell his Continental  stock and options to Scandinavian Airlines Systems at nearly three times the  market price.  </P> <P> The airline said its results were hurt by a $15-million expense related to the  SAS transaction.  </P> <P> Airline industry analysts said Tuesday that Continental's results were in line  with expectations. Other airlines, including Delta and USAir, have reported  large fuel-related third-quarter losses.  </P> <P> Continental Chairman Hollis Harris said in a statement that fuel costs  "exacerbated our losses." He said fuel had surpassed wages as the airline's  greatest expense, and that Continental's fuel bill in October was $70 million  higher than in normal times. Jet fuel prices have risen dramatically since  Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.  </P> <P> Continental's difficult financial situation caused it to consider, but reject,  a bankruptcy filing two weeks ago. The company instead said it would sell  assets to raise money and look for help from a possible investor.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, however, the airline said it was taking its valuable Honolulu-Tokyo  route off the market. The airline had said earlier that it might sell its Air  Micronesia unit, which holds the governmental authority to fly from Honolulu to  Tokyo.  </P> <P> Continental's third-quarter loss doesn't include results of its Eastern  Airlines subsidiary. Eastern, which is in bankruptcy proceedings, has been run  by a court-appointed trustee since April 10. Continental lost $158 million on  revenue of $1.7 billion in the third quarter of 1989, a period when Eastern  posted huge losses.  </P> <P> For the first nine months of 1990, the company lost $97 million on revenue of  $4.9 billion. That compares to a loss of $522.8 million on revenue of $5  billion in the first nine months of 1989. Continental released the earnings  statement after the markets closed. The company's stock closed up 12 1/2 cents  at $2.75 a share on the American Stock Exchange on Tuesday.  </P></p>

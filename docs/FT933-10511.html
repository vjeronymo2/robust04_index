			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Tough US line urged on air pacts PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's advisory airlines commission is recommending a tough response to governments which violate bilateral aviation treaties with the US. In its final report, approved on Monday, it urged multilateral negotiations on a range of aviation issues and enforcement of bilateral pacts 'through all means, including renunciation and suspension of privileges and services when violations occur'. The commission cited France's termination of its US bilateral agreement and Chancellor Helmut Kohl's letter to President Clinton threatening termination of the German accord as 'only two of the most prominent examples of the problems the US government faces in trying to preserve and expand competition internationally'. Bilateral pacts can no longer protect US interests, the commission said. 'The increasingly contentious bilateral relationships already mentioned are resulting in agreements or de facto relationships either markedly more rigid and protectionist than before or seriously out of balance.' The commission envisages a free flow of cross-border airline investment. The US should approve foreign investment of up to 49 per cent voting equity in US airlines, but only 'in the context of bilateral agreements which are reciprocal and enhance the prospects of securing the ultimate goal of pro-competitive, multinational agreements. The foreign investor must not be government-owned, and the investment must advance US national interest.' Another report out this week, from the Economic Strategy Institute, an influential Washington think-tank, warns that overseas investment in the US airline industry has enabled high-cost foreign producers to dominate low-cost US companies. This erodes the US industry's competitive position and destroys US jobs. Gains by British Airways from its investment in US Air will shift Dollars 350m (Pounds 234m) a year in revenues to BA from US airlines and cost the US economy 3,500 jobs, the report says. Opening the US market to all foreign airlines could cost Dollars 4bn and jeopardise 40,000 jobs.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - Industry (25): Prescription for cuts is managed competition - Healthcare The need to cut budget deficits is forcing most governments to look critically at the cost of healthcare, one of the largest components of public expenditure in advanced economies. Spending on health as a proportion of national income has more than doubled in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development over the past 30 years. This increase has been driven by a number of factors, including the extension of healthcare to cover whole populations. Unit costs such as the salaries of doctors and nurses have risen and new and more expensive types of treatment have been devised. The ageing of populations has also had an impact, since elderly people make greater use of health services. Much of the burden has been borne by the public purse. With the notable exception of the US, between 70 per cent and 90 per cent of health spending in most advanced economies is financed publicly. Healthcare typically accounts for between 12 per cent and 15 per cent of public expenditure. The rate of growth of health budgets has eased in recent years. Some countries such as Germany and Ireland have even managed to achieve cuts in the share of GDP going to healthcare during the 1980s. The slowdown has been achieved by a combination of measures that health economists have dubbed 'managed competition', the use of market-type incentives to raise efficiency and improve the quality of care. These measures have been found to work in a wide range of countries with very different health systems. In some, for example, healthcare is paid for out of taxation. In others, it is financed by compulsory insurance contributions paid either to private insurers, public bodies or a mixture of both. The extent to which patients are expected to contribute towards treatment costs, the methods of reimbursing hospitals and doctors, and the role of the private sector also vary considerably. Yet despite these differences, a recent OECD study of health reforms in seven European countries found a remarkable degree of convergence in the policies adopted to curb rising costs. The common key was universal funding under government direction - even where private insurers pay for health services. Only governments can provide the discipline on costs to bear down on hospitals, surgeons and the pharmaceutical industry. And only governments can insist on universal coverage, which allows medical care to be allocated according to need, rather than ability to pay. Without this universal cover, insurers select the healthier groups, leaving the vulnerable and ageing with no cover or reliant on state-funded safety nets. The result is that - as in the US - the middle classes pay twice: once for their own health insurance and again through taxation for the safety net. The creation of a capped, universal budget does not, however, mean socialised medicine delivered through a centralised bureaucracy. Managed competition establishes quasi-markets in which hospitals, doctors and other health organisations compete to provide health services. This provides incentives to improve efficiency through, for example, less frequent use of hospitals for simple operations and greater use of daycare. Costs are also reduced by paying for healthcare by contracts for the provision of services rather than through fees for each item of treatment which encourages 'overtreatment'. When Ireland switched to an annual 'capitation fee', doctors' consultation rates fell by a fifth. Several other policy changes can also help in reducing the gap between healthcare demand and funding. These include 'co-payments' by patients, which encourage them to behave more like consumers in balancing demand against cost. And competition between the organisations that fund healthcare can improve the quality of services and provide further efficiency incentives. In the Netherlands, ambitious reforms plan to offer a choice of insurance packages, all offering a basic minimum but with different levels of service and additional benefits. The US is the one advanced economy that relies largely on voluntary private insurance to provide its healthcare and has yet to adopt managed competition. The result is that health spending is still rising and accounts for 14 per cent of GDP (the OECD average is 8 per cent). While much of the cost is borne privately, the burden of employer-financed insurance cover weighs heavily on business. And the cost of the two publicly-funded safety net schemes, Medicare and Medicaid, has spiralled, so that health accounts for a higher proportion of public expenditure than in some countries with health services entirely funded from the public purse. The ambitious Clinton reform plan involves most of the elements of managed competition, with universal coverage, budget capping and capitation payments. It is in difficulty in Congress, and now seems unlikely to survive intact. But the compromises and most of the alternative plans under discussion would move in a similar direction - though perhaps less radically. While the exact shape of the US healthcare system by the end of the decade has yet to be finalised, it, too, is likely to join the convergence in other OECD countries. Successful though managed competition has been in slowing growth in health spending, the pace of reform needs to develop and intensify to cope with the continuing increase in demand for healthcare. A recent survey of 10 OECD countries by National Economic Research Associates, the economic consultants, found that on present trends, all would face a shortfall in funding by 2000. The shortfalls ranged from 2 per cent of GDP in the US to around 9 per cent in the Netherlands. The gap is partly caused by demographic change. Increased life expectancy may not mean more direct medical care: the extra cost of treating the very elderly is likely to be offset to some extent by the decline of chronic diseases among younger people. But there will be an increase in demand for geriatric care and social services for the elderly, encouraged by the decline of the extended family in which older people were cared for by younger relatives. But it is also caused by rising expectations about the quality and amount of health services, fuelled by the arrival of new and more expensive forms of treatment. Healthcare is a 'merit good' in economists' terms: as people become better off, they spend an increasing proportion of their income on health services. The correlation between health expenditure per capita and overall income per capita has become more pronounced in recent decades. This suggests that the struggle to contain the burden of healthcare on public budgets will have to continue into the future, using all the techniques in the armoury of managed competition.</p>

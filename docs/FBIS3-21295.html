On behalf of detained Islamic Action leaders, he issued an  appeal today to youths of the Islamic Groups [al-jama'at  al-islamiyah] urging them to make the month of Ramadan a  starting point for discarding violence and aggression and for  opening a constructive dialogue because it is the course  accepted by wise people, because there is an atmosphere of  freedom, justice, and security, and because the side that is  afraid of dialogue has a weak argument.    Concluding his appeal to the Islamic Groups youths, Shaykh  al-Hallawi said: Fear God, abandon this sedition, and listen to  the counsel of the trustworthy scholars.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRANSTON'S PROMISE ON BONDS TOLD;  </P> <P> S&amp;L SCANDAL: SENATOR'S APPEARANCE AT MEETING DISRUPTED BY LEADER OF GROUP  THAT LOST MILLIONS IN LINCOLN SAVINGS FAILURE.  </P> <P> Shirley Lampel, an outspoken leader of more than 23,000 investors who purchased  now-worthless junk bonds at Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan offices, said Saturday  she has won a pledge from Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) to assist them in their  efforts to get their money back.  </P> <P> Cranston made the promise during a 10-minute private session with Lampel Friday  night in Orange County. Cranston met with the 58-year-old Tustin woman after  she disrupted a forum on women's issues that the senator hosted at a high  school in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "This is the only way I can get ahold of you," Lampel had shouted at Cranston  from the audience.  </P> <P> Lampel gained prominence last month when she and two other bondholders  testified before the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee that  they held Cranston personally responsible for their losses.  </P> <P> The three represented more than 23,000 people -- most of them elderly  Californians -- who lost an estimated $220 million by investing in bonds issued  by Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp., which has filed for  bankruptcy court protection.  </P> <P> Cranston was one of five senators who had intervened with federal regulators on  behalf of Lincoln owner Charles H. Keating Jr. during a 1987 investigation of  the Irvine thrift. Keating contributed $1.4 million to the senators' campaigns  and other causes they supported.  </P> <P> Critics have charged that Lincoln would have been seized by the government in  1987 if the senators had not intervened in the case. By the time the government  finally took control last April, the Irvine thrift had piled up more than $2  billion in federally insured losses.  </P> <P> The five senators, whose intervention is being investigated by law enforcement  authorities and the Senate Ethics Committee, have denied responsibility for the  losses incurred by taxpayers or by the elderly bondholders.  </P> <P> While Lampel still blames Cranston for her misfortune, she emerged from the  meeting with a much kinder view of the senator than she had expressed earlier.  A Democrat and former Cranston supporter, she said she was treated with  courtesy by the senator and his aides.  </P> <P> "I elicited a promise that he's going to be active in helping the bondholders,"  Lampel said in a telephone interview. She said she was "absolutely positive"  that the 76-year-old senator will keep his promise because his political future  may depend on it.  </P> <P> Cranston's popularity in California has slumped dramatically in recent weeks as  a result of his involvement in the Lincoln scandal. A recent Times Poll found  that his favorable rating had fallen to 32% from 56% last October.  </P> <P> Lampel said she warned Cranston that he had better live up to his promise to  help the bondholders if he expects to be reelected to a fifth term in 1992.  </P> <P> "I said to him last night, 'You've got two years. A lot of good can be done in  the next two years. You can turn it around,' " she said.  </P> <P> Lampel said she felt "absolutely positive" Cranston would keep the pledge to  help the bondholders because she received the telephone number of one of his  aides, who invited her to call at any time. "I now have access to the senator,"  she asserted.  </P> <P> She said Cranston's aides had promised to contact her again in mid-January.  </P> <P> Cranston did not tell Lampel precisely what he intended to do to help the  bondholders, but he mentioned that he has asked the General Accounting Office  to investigate whether federal regulators can be held responsible for allowing  the bonds to be sold at Lincoln offices. The GAO is the investigative arm of  the Congress.  </P> <P> If the GAO finds that the federal government failed to properly regulate the  bond sales, Cranston has said he will press for government repayment of the  bondholders. Meanwhile, the bondholders also are pressing lawsuits seeking  restitution from Keating and Lincoln.  </P> <P> Lampel said she felt bad about disrupting Cranston's meeting at Century High  School, but she knew of no other way to get an opportunity to talk with the  senator. She said she was very nervous about sitting down with the powerful  senator, but she forced herself to do it because she believes the other  bondholders are looking to her to speak for them.  </P> <P> "I made up my mind that no matter how my heart pounded, I would not run from  the room," she said.  </P> <P> Lampel was not the only citizen who disrupted Cranston's meeting. Shortly after  Cranston opened the forum, which was attended by about 40 people, a small group  of conservative Republican youths threw bogus $100 bills at the stage and  shouted, "Have some more money senator; that's the only way you listen."  </P></p>

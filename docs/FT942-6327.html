			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Less than a full EU welcome for Italy's rightwing Neo-fascist ministers of Italy's new government coalition made their first appearance on the European political stage yesterday and found that not all hands were extended in welcome. The Belgian telecommunications minister, Mr Elio di Rupo, refused to shake hands with his Italian opposite number, Mr Giuseppe Tatarella. He is one of five Italian ministers from the rightwing National Alliance, and one of three from its neo-fascist core, the MSI, two of whom made their debut at the Council of Ministers in Brussels yesterday. Mr di Rupo, a rising star in Belgium's socialist firmament, and whose Italian father came here after the second world war, broke all the club rules on welcoming newcomers to the European Union Council, and underlined it by issuing a statement. For the first time in the history of the European Community and Union, he said, the Council counted among its members the representatives of an 'ideology that has been condemned for ever'. Disquiet about the neo-fascist presence is widespread, although few senior officials or ministers are prepared to discuss it. Officials from Germany, Spain, Greece, and Portugal in particular say that they fear it might make fascism respectable in their own countries once again. Meanwhile, the European parliament's dominant socialist group has voted not to work with the Italian neo-fascists. Yesterday, the Danish social democrat telecommunications minister, Mr Helge Mortensen, admitted under questioning that he, too, had not seen fit to shake hands with Mr Tatarella, because 'I did not find it suitable'. Mr Tatarella was not unprepared for his reception. He observed to Mr di Rupo that it was Benito Mussolini's regime in Italy that had first abolished the handshake - in favour of the Roman-style fascist salute. The Greek presidency of the EU calmed the waters by issuing a bland declaration on democratic principles. Among the larger member states, there was mostly silence yesterday. Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said his government 'had no reservations about working with the Italian government'.</p>

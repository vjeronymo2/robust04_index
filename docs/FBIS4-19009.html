			<p>BFN     [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Klaus Kinkel, foreign  minister and Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] chairman,  has called for a clear definition of the Bundeswehr's assigment.  At a meeting with the Executive Committee of the Bundeswehr  Association, Kinkel was quoted by the FDP press office as saying  that "permanently playing around with figures" regarding the  strength of the Bundeswehr is wrong. Kinkel clearly rejected  the reasoning that the size, structure, and efficiency of the  Bundeswehr should mainly be determined by the availablity of  state funds. In the meeting, FDP Secretary General Werner Hoyer  emphasized that the Armed Forces are "not light switches that  can be turned on or off according to short-term fluctuations in  demand."</p>

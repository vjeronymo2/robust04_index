Nukes Likely To Further Dampen  Market"]    [Text] The week started off brightly, as investment  psychology momentarily perked up on account of (1) customer  deposits on the rise, (2) trading volume restored to a  respectable level, (3) advancers dwarfing decliners and (4)  stabilized interest rates.    Financial stocks took the spotlight Monday, led by the 4.27  percent boom in the banking corner, as the Korea Stock Price  Index (KOSPI) marched 9.45 points higher to 912.83.    Asset plays, which looked promising for the week, lost their  steam quite early. The Seoul bourse retreated during the next  four sessions as the persistent unloading of blue-chip stocks  took a toll on the market. Participation did pick up, however,  as many investors came off the sidelines; their buying patterns  were very discriminatory, favoring stock with individual merits.    No theme was able to clearly sustain momentum, such was the  case for the volatile banking sector. The composite index had  settled well below the 900 point-floor to 893.07 by Friday's  closing bell. A very mild technical rebound, at best, was  witnessed on Saturday's half-day session as the market nudged up  0.92 percent.    The long-winded bearish run has been clearly burdened by the  delay in lifting the foreign holdings limit, while effects from  the government's market-cooling measures introduced Feb. 2  continue to dampen sentiments.    Furthermore, as a large number of stock will be injected  into  the stock market through capital increase, the supply side will  be beefed-up. Should the demand for Korean equities fail to  respond correspondingly to such a rise, equilibrium prices will  fall. Institutions, particularly those with fiscal years ending  in March, are likely to be quite conservative during this week.    Holding a rather risk-aversive stance, they will shun from  disrupting their 1993 performance. Also, as the end of the  month approaches, many firms are allocating funds for dividend  payments and corporate taxes in addition to capital setting  aside for brisk facility investments, leaving little left for  direct investment in the stock market.    Hence, the market may remain featureless over the week, as  no  themes are expected to be highlighted.    On the positive side, client deposits are indeed rising  along  with healthy transaction volumes of late. The President's  upcoming China visit may very well bear some fruit for the  Korean equities market.    The Ministry of Finance has just announced that trust funds  will be permitted to raise capital, as the case for specific  funds for foreign-investment only, also the foreign ceiling, is  to be gradually lifted from the second half.    Nevertheless, we foresee a continuation of bearish  conditions  for the week. The KOSPI should fluctuate near the 900 level,  led by the exertions of individual investors. News of  heightened tension with the North will weigh the market down for  a short while.    Despite further consolidation, low- and medium-priced stocks  are expected to draw buy orders in the earlier part of the week  as A/D ratios exceed 1.0.    However by the week's end, we may very well see interests  return to blue-chip counters, which have fallen by a big margin.  Our recommendations for the week are Jinro Ltd., Pohang Iron  &amp;  Steel Co. and Kumho Co.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 18 TASS -- ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA frontpages  an article dealing with the deployment of a peace-keeping force  in the zone of the Georgian Abkhazian conflict. The seriousness  of the situation in central Asia and the Transcaucasian region  cannot but worry the Russian leadership. The governments of  Western countries should be equaqlly interested in the  settlement of armed conflicts, specifically, in the  Transcaucasian region, the newspaper writes.    "However, quite unexpectedly for us, the West assumed a  negative stand on the issue," ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA points out.  According to U.N. Secretary-General Butrus Buturs-Ghali, the  U.N. would not object to Russia's peace-keeping efforts in the  Transcaucasian region, but Moscow will not be given the status  of U.N. troops. The newspaper quotes the words of Russian  Deputy Defence Minister Georgy Kondratiev, now visiting  Abkhazia, who emphatically refuted reports saying that the  peace-keeping operation had already been started, and stressed  that "the planned reconnaissance of the terrain is now under  way, which should ensure the preparation of the peace-keeping  operation."    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA also carries a material on this subject,  specifically, an interview with Gennadiy Fedosov, ambassador at  large of the Russian Foregn Ministry, who believes that it is  necessary to move Russian peace-keeping troops to the zone of  the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict. "The whole experience of the  conflict shows that it is impossible to maintain peace, which is  shaky enough, without a peace-keeping force," the newspaper  writes. According to Fedosov, Russia needs peace in Abkhazia in  no smaller degree than the conflicting parties. "Another  outbreak of bloodshed in Abkhazia is fraught with the threat of  a dramatic expansion of the conflict. It may easily spread  across Georgia's borders," the newspaper stresses.    Aleksandr Livshits, head of a group of experts of the  Russian  president's administration, comments in ROSSIYSKIE VESTI on the  president's decrees dealing with housing loans, housing  certificates and the sale of unfinished apartment houses. In  his opinion, the decree on housing certificates is the most  important one, because it gives a chance to all those who want  to buy a flat on the instalment system. "of course, additional  instructions of the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank  will be needed. However, a way to bringing down the acuteness  of the housing problem has been cleared," Livshits writes.    TRUD carries a statement of the Russian union of  industrialists and entrepreneurs, who express concern over the  growth of crime and violence against Russian business people.  "It is necessary to understand clearly that the situation is  getting out of control, which means that extraordinary measures  should be taken. On their part, Russian industrialists and  entrepreneurs are ready to support any resolute steps of the  president, the federal assembly and the government, aimed at  imposing law and order and ensuring the guarantee of the  individual safety of Russian citizens," the statement says.    "A criminal terror has swept Russia. The presidential decree  alone is not enough to put an end to it," KRASNAYA ZVEZDA  writes. The newspaper points out that crime is threatening today  not only the safety of individual citizens, but also the very  foundations of Russia's statehood. This is why society is  demanding resolute actions from the authorities. "The  president's decree, whether it is good or bad, is actually the  only real step taken by the authorities in this direction," the  newspaper stresses.    PRAVDA continues to discuss the crime problem in the country  and the president's decree "on urgent measures for protecting  the population against gangsterism and other manifestations of  organised crime." The newspaper carries an article on this  subject by A.Murashev, former head of the Moscow Interior  Ministry department and now deputy to the State Duma from the  Russia's Choice Movement. According to Murashev, "the decree  will not affect in any way the organised crime. It will affect,  in the first place, ordinary business people and will become an  extremely dangerous weapons for settling scores between them."    Touching upon this subject, NOVAYA EZHEDNEVNAYA GAZETA  quotes  the opinion of Issa Kostoev, chairman of the committee for  constitutional legislation and judicial and legal issues at the  Federation Council. He points out that "some of the provisions  of the decree are obviously at variance with the Constitution  and the criminal procedure code of the Russian Federation" and  expresses hope that the prosecutor-general's Office, the  Interior Ministry and the Federal Counterintelligence Service  will issue instruction, which will rule out a possibility of the  abuse of power by the authorities.</p>

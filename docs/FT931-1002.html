			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Lifeboats launched in City rescue SOME SMALL and medium-sized banks are receiving financial support from the Bank of England, the Bank disclosed yesterday. Yesterday it took the unusual step of disclosing that in the second half of 1991 it launched financial lifeboats for a number of small and medium-sized banks. A lifeboat involves either the Bank putting funds into a troubled bank or the injection of money from commercial banks with a guarantee from the Bank. A Bank executive said yesterday some small banks were still in receipt of Bank funds. The Bank refused to disclose which banks had been rescued. However, Lord Spens, one of the acquitted defendants in the Guinness trial, claimed in the House of Lords that City Merchants Bank, part of the Invesco MIM group, had received Pounds 40m from National Westminster Bank and that an indemnity had been given to NatWest by the Bank. It is also understood that the Bank played a role in organising a Pounds 200m cash lifeboat for National Home Loans, one of the UK's largest mortgage lenders, in July 1991. The funds were provided by the eight largest UK clearing banks. The Bank rescue of small banks was prompted by the withdrawal of wholesale deposits - or deposits from financial institutions and professional investors - from these banks. Deposits were withdrawn for a number of reasons: Small banks were thought to be particularly vulnerable to the recession and losses on bad property loans. Three small banks, Chancery, Eddington and British and Commonwealth Merchant Bank, had already been closed. The closure of BCCI in July 1991 led local authorities in particular to re-evaluate where they placed their funds. After the closure of BCCI some small banks saw a withdrawal of virtually all local authority and public-sector corporations' deposits, according to the Bank. The Bank's official policy is to act as a lender of last resort to banks only if the collapse of a bank poses a threat to the financial system. The Bank said in mid-1991 it believed there was considerable nervousness in the financial markets and that the collapse of small banks could have had damaging consequences. A banker yesterday disputed that the financial system had been at risk at the time. A Bank executive said it was too early to say whether the Bank was likely to lose any money from the lifeboat operation.</p>

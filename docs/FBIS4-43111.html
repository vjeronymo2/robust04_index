			<p>BFN     [Text] Istanbul (AA) -- Selim Atalay reports -- The U.S.  secretary of state and the Russian foreign minister held a joint  news conference here today confirming that Russia will sign the  Partnership for Peace [PFP] document.    Andrey Kozyrev announced that he will go to Brussels to sign  the document. He did not indicate the date on which the  document will be signed, but said "in the near future."    Asked what exactly is needed for Russia to sign the PFP,  Kozyrev did not reply for a while, showing his displeasure at  the question, but then said: "That is the last question to be  asked in connection with the PFP."    Kozyrev pointed out that there will be differences in the  implementation of the PFP in line with the characteristics of  each country. Russia's situation will be approached within this  framework, he said.    The Russian foreign minister also spoke of "a comprehensive  organization excluding the mutual right to veto."    Kozyrev pointed out that he met with U.S. Secretary of State  Warren Christopher for two and one-half hours and then met again  at dinner yesterday, adding: "Very fruitful talks were held at  dinner. We made progress because Tansu Ciller was with us."    Secretary of State Christopher stressed that the United  States is pleased that Russia is going to sign the PFP, and said  that even if they have differences of opinion, there exists a  basis for reaching a solution.    Replying to a question on the conflict between Armenia and  Azerbaijan, Christopher recalled that he met with Azerbaijani  President Aliyev. The secretary of state pointed out that the  solution should be found within the framework of the CSCE, and  opportunities must be created for the continuation of the  cease-fire. He added that Kozyrev agreed with him regarding  this issue.    Meanwhile, Christopher and Kozyrev announced that they  agreed  to propose that the United Nations impose sanctions on North  Korea. Christopher stated that they will submit a draft  resolution to the United Nations "in the coming days" to impose  sanctions on that country and to convene an international  conference on the issue of North Korea's nuclear power. He  explained that U.S. President Clinton and Russian President  Yeltsin discussed the North Korea issue on the telephone.    Kozyrev pointed out that the issue of sanctions and the  issue  of an international conference are directed at "a single aim,"  adding: "We cannot tolerate a violation of the nuclear  nonproliferation agreement."</p>

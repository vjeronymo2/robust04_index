			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Electrolux posts sharp decline to SKr253m ELECTROLUX, the Swedish household appliances multinational, announced a sharp drop in profits (after financial items) for the first quarter of the year to SKr253m (Dollars 43.41m) from SKr414m for the same period of 1991. Income for the first quarter of last year included a SKr184m capital gain for divestments in the company's commercial services business area. If that is excluded the group made a 10 per cent improvement in its profits for on-going operations for the first quarter. A 2 per cent growth was recorded in sales to SKr19.46bn from SKr19.23bn in the same period last year. The earnings per share after full tax dropped to SKr0.20 from SKr3.60 in the first quarter of last year. The shareholders yesterday approved Electrolux's decision to maintain its dividend at SKr12.50 per share. In his address to the shareholders Mr Leif Johansson, president, said the restructuring programme of the past two years with the closure of 10 plants and a cut of 15,000 in the workforce had 'radically improved the production structure as well as productivity'. He added that inventory costs dropped by more than SKr1bn last year with a 'significant improvement in the cash flow'. He said Electrolux was moving into a phase when it would devote more resources to selling in existing markets as well as intensifying the search for new ones. Electrolux said that the European market for its products had slackened during the first quarter especially in the Nordic countries, but it added that there were also signs of stagnation in Germany. By contrast demand in the US market increased for household appliances but from a low base in the first quarter of last year. Overall profitability in the group's household appliances division rose.</p>

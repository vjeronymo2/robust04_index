			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Rwandan rebels name Hutu president in peace gesture Tutsi rebels of the Rwanda Patriotic Front yesterday named a Hutu, Mr Pasteur Bizimungu, as president of what they say will be a broad-based government of national unity, in an apparent attempt to reassure Rwanda's Hutu majority that they have nothing to fear under the new regime. The RPF is due to install a new government in the capital Kigali today as the remnants of the old Hutu government and army joined the mass Hutu exodus into Zaire. As a long-time member of the RPF, however, Mr Bizimungu is not expected to inspire confidence among supporters of the late Hutu president, Gen Juvenal Habyarimana. The new prime minister, Mr Faustin Twagiramungu, is also a Hutu, but real power will almost certainly remain in the hands of Gen Paul Kagame, the military commander who formed an army of Tutsi exiles in 1990 to fight the Habyarimana dictatorship. The RPF is understood to be offering government posts to members of the old ruling party who were not implicated in the genocide of Rwanda's Tutsi population following the assassination of Gen Habyarimana in April. The new government's chances of receiving international recognition are high, particularly since a special UN reporter on human rights identified the former government as having been involved in directing the massacre of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. The US has given representatives of the old government five days to leave Rwanda. Their bank accounts have been frozen. Moves are also afoot in the UN to expel the Rwandan representative on the Security Council. 'The UN will have little choice but to deal with the new government,' Ms Alison Desfoges, a consultant with Human Rights Watch Africa, the US-based human rights group, said yesterday. 'But the international community will also be in a strong position to exert leverage over the RPF, as the new government will be heavily aid-dependent.' France's position will be critical to the success of the new regime. Its military intervention in Rwanda came too late to save Tutsi lives, and now not even the 'civilian safe havens' established by French troops in the south-west of the country have been able to stem the flight of the Hutu population into Zaire. The retreating Hutu army is, however, sheltering behind French lines, and there are signs that the French are uncomfortable protecting perpetrators of genocide.</p>

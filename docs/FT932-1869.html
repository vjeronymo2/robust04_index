			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (8): Where big is beautiful and rational - Electricite de France, the world's biggest utility, still rides high ONE OF the paradoxes of Europe's electricity market is that it was one of the world's biggest monopolies, Electricite de France, which has done most to promote the concept of a competitive electricity market for Europe by gaining access to customers outside the borders of France. Indeed, some say its initial (and abortive) attempts to sell power direct to German industry in the 1980s were the catalyst for the European Community's present efforts to enforce third party access (TPA) into the Continent's transmission grids. EdF's aggressive export policy sprang from expediency rather than ideology. It needed to raise revenue in order to fund its ambitious of nuclear plant construction programme in the 1980s, which was France's typically forthright response to the oil scarcities of the 1970s. The export drive then gained further impetus from the expectations of continuing economic growth. When these hopes collapsed, EdF's heavy dependence on base-load nuclear plant (accounting for 73 per cent of its total output at the end of last year) left plenty of spare capacity for export. EdF pitched its prices at levels low enough to deter other European utilities, notably Italy's Enel, from expanding their own generating capacity. Exports thus began to rise dramatically from the early 1980s, when plant completions began to swamp demand growth and again, after 1987, when the cross-Channel inter-connector with Britain was completed. At the end of 1992, foreign sales stood at around 12 per cent of EdF's total output, earning it Ffr12.4bn. Exports are expected to continue rising, before eventually flattening out at around 70 TWH by 2000. Contracts have already been signed committing EdF to much of this additional business. This sounds like the kind of open market trading the EC is keen to develop. But other European producers are beginning to complain that it is a one-way trade and that they have little access to the French market, despite some recent import deals. Perhaps more seriously, they say they cannot complete against a company which is buttressed against domestic competition and which enjoys the economies of scale of large monopoly. The break-up of EdF and its possible privatisation is something which many, including the European Commission, would like to see. EdF is expected to resist this robustly, although some restructuring along EC lines is underway, including the introduction of greater price transparency between its constituent parts. EdF's view of privatisation was reflected earlier this year in a series of highly critical reviews of the UK experience. The reports, which EdF commissioned from outside consultants, concluded that privatisation in Britain was characterised by price increases, economic disruption, short-termism and, ultimately, the replacement of a state monopoly with a monopolistic private one. Nor is EdF enthusiastic about another Euro-hobby horse - the 'unbundling' of its various interests to prevent cross-subsidisation. The benefits of an integrated business, it believes, include better prices and standards of service. It has the support of politicians, who believe that the French system works well. EdF has a point when it comes to the domestic market. Its reliance on nuclear power, with all the back-end costs that will ultimately entail, must surely rule out full privatisation. The inability to privatised the UK's nuclear stock has already proved the extreme reluctance of the private sector to accept nuclear risk. Privatising EdF's thermal and hydro stock would also, it claims, increase prices. Yet there is pressure for change which is likely to become more insistent in the next few years. Firstly, EdF is facing increasing generation challenges inside France which could hinder its export ability. Its stock of 900MW and 1,300MW pressurised water reactors (PWRs) have suffered a number of generic problems since the late 1980s, including faults in the steam generators and cracking of vessel heads. Repairing them is costly in money and time: replacing a steam generator, for example, closes a power station for three months. Capacity is also reduced during the company's regular and five and 10-year safety reviews, which currently last four months and cover about a fifth of EdF's reactor every year. In spite of its surplus of baseload capacity, EdF has also found itself short of peak-load capacity, as seen in the drought of 1989 which sapped its hydro-electric output and led to the import of some 6 TWH of power. A push into the space heating market has also increased EdF's sensitivity to temperature changes. It estimates that by the end of the decade each one degree C drop in temperature will raise national demand on its system by 2,000MW. Therefore, while export contracts are unlikely to be terminated, EdF is looking closely at two-way deals, such as the contract signed recently with Britain's PowerGen, allowing it to import up to 850MW at peak demand times. A second export-limiting factor is the weakness of the transmission system. Spending on grid reinforcement has taken second place to investment in new nuclear generation over the past two decades and domestic as well as international lines are said to be near maximum loading. Finally, new entrants could come on the scene as the nuclear reactors near the end of their lives. Originally this was to have started to occur in the next 10 years, though EdF now intends to extend their operational life from 30 to 40 years. Whether this can be achieved remains to be seen. But either timescale would entail a largescale replacement programme, nuclear or other, which EdF can ill afford at a time when it is committed to reducing the foreign debt built up dring its last big construction phase.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by M. Shahidi: "The Juggling of the Methuselah </F> of Imperialism"]    [Excerpts] In the wake of the diplomatic battles that began  between Iran and Britain with the summons of our charge  d'affaires to the British Foreign Office on Thursday [28 April],  the British mass media initiated a heavy political onslaught  against the Islamic Republic of Iran. [passage omitted]    One cannot know with certainty what diplomatic or propaganda  objectives are being pursued by the British, but certain issues  that could be considered close to the truth can be mentioned  regarding the current British-Iranian relations. The following  points may help in shedding light on the latest act of  politico-propagandistic blackmail by Britain:    1. Washington encountered defeat in disrupting financial  dealings between Iran and Japan as well as the European  countries, which resulted in its losing face on the  international level. Therefore, Britain in its capacity as the  European political pillar of the United States resorted to this  new politico-propagandistic blackmail to unite the Western front  against Iran. [passage omitted]    2. The contempt that Whitehall is sustaining in view of the  categorical stance of the Iranian leadership and government and  the British Government's pressure, which it tried to exert by  various means, has not been able to have the slightest effect on  Iran's stance on the Rushdie issue. [passage omitted]    3. The fact that the latest British propaganda coincided  with the session of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO]  contact group, especially on the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  cannot be considered incidental.    It is no secret that the Islamic Republic of Iran is the  foremost proclaimer of the oppression of the Bosnian Muslims,  while the British Government is considered among those directly  to blame among the so-called civilized Western countries for  this situation. So far all the efforts to lift the embargo  against the Bosnian Muslims have been foiled by the government  of Great Britain! [passage omitted]    4. Despite our categorical denial of these accusations, and  while we consider ourselves innocent of any connection with the  internal crisis in Britain that stems from its domineering  policies, we cannot refrain from being amazed at the  double-standard approach of the West in general and Britain in  particular toward the same matter. How is it that the British  Government actively supports Iranian terrorist organizations  whose hands are stained with the blood of thousands of innocent  Iranian people and officials and there are overt contacts  between the leaders of these terrorist organizations and the  British officials? London endorses these meetings and contacts  without any qualms and considers them symbols of democracy, but  raises a hue and cry over the "possibility" of Iran's links with  the IRA. [passage omitted]    In our opinion, the latest British ploy stems from the  weakness and impotence of the Methuselah of 19th-century  colonialism in resolving its domestic crises and its sheer  helplessness in the face of the decisive stances of Iran, and it  is doomed to failure from the outset.    Thus, the Islamic Republic of Iran should adopt a more  aggressive politico-propagandistic policy and should rub the  nose of the British into the dust and show that country that  pursuing the policies of the arch-Satan will not benefit it.  Therefore, it is necessary that this old Methuselah of  colonialism should relinquish its melancholia [malikhowlia] and  learn that the protection of the boundaries of countries and  reciprocal respect in political relations is the primary  principle of wholesome diplomatic relations and the adoption of  a policy without dignity that resorts to political machinations  and false accusations cannot pressure a capable government to  change its stance.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Hong Kong court clears seven of corruption THE Hong Kong stock exchange corruption trial ended dramatically yesterday when the seven men charged were found not guilty after nearly two days of deliberation by the jury. The High Court trial, which sprang from investigations into the conduct of Mr Ronald Li, the former head of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, casts doubt over similar charges to which Mr Li last year pleaded guilty. It is unclear, however, whether the verdict will affect the four-year prison sentence he received in October 1990 for soliciting preferential allocations of shares in companies due to be listed on the exchange. In the trial just ended, six defendants were charged with accepting or soliciting preferential allocations of shares. The seventh, Mr Li's son Alfred, was charged with aiding and abetting the other defendants. On Saturday, Mr Justice Mortimer, told the jury that a ruling by the Appeal Court concerning the application of the colony's Bill of Rights had altered the basis upon which they were to judge the allegations against the six. The Appeal Court removed the offence of unlawful possession from the colony's law after it found that it was inconsistent with the Bill of Rights ruling that a person is innocent until proven guilty. The Appeal Court ruling meant that the defendants no longer had to prove they had permission, lawful authority, or reasonable excuse, to accept the shares.</p>

			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] ROK citizens who want to visit Mt.  Paektu must obtain an entry permit from the Jilin provincial  government before they can apply for a Chinese entry visa. The  3 May KYONGHYANG SINMUN reports on page 21 that the PRC  Government will enforce the requirement beginning on 1 June this  year. Due to the Seoul government's lifting its China travel  restrictions in April, the Jilin area is inundated with South  Korean tourists, causing "terrible shortages in transportation,  lodging, and so on." The PRC Government is also concerned about  the impact on the area's environment as well as for the safety  and security of the visitors.    According to KYONGHYANG SINMUN, South Koreans who want to  visit Mt. Paektu will have to start processing their travel  documents at least 30 days in advance. All the paperwork must  be processed by PRC Government-designated Chinese travel  agencies. The PRC plans strict implementation of the new  requirements. Koreans without proper papers will not be allowed  to visit Mt. Paektu and they will not be able to purchase  airline tickets to other cities in Jilin Province and the use of  hotels will be denied.</p>

			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Arts: Bunin comes to London ABOUT half of Stanislav Bunin's capacity audience on Wednesday at the Barbican seemed to be Japanese, since his recital debut here was sponsored by Asahi Shimbun and Japan Airlines. London has been curiously slow to welcome this Muscovite pianist, whom the rest of Europe has been celebrating since 1988. Just why, we rapidly discovered. Bunin's family tree includes not only the composer Szymanowski, but the great teacher Heinrich Neuhaus. His technique is immaculate, and yet in this all-Chopin programme he never once brandished it for its own sake. If nobody could fail to notice his tingling chord-cascades in the Second Sonata, or his racing brilliance in the B-flat minor Prelude, they were merely what the music required - but rarely gets in such generous measure. All his attention was concentrated upon realising the music, lucidly and lovingly, and he achieved some miracles of penetrating simplicity: in the trio of the Marche funebre, for example, which became quite luminous. He went in for no dramatic swaying or gesturing; usually he bent forward over the keyboard, watching the keys and his hands intently as if monitoring delicate, high-precision instruments. The result never sounded like hi-tech calculation. On the contrary, Bunin allows himself plenty of expressive rubato - sometimes, indeed, in pieces which strike me as presupposing a sterner pulse; but always in the pure service of lyrical sense. He cultivates a notably beautiful, velvety piano-sound, which affords him full-force moments without turning clangy. In the 24 Preludes of op. 28 he exploited colour-effects less than many pianists, preferring to secure all the necessary contrasts by meticulous characterisation of every prelude. With the F minor Fantaisie he was unusually deliberate, but fascinating. There is anyway something obscure, even evasive about this hugely ingenious piece: one can't expect definitive revelations of what it's about, just more or less plausible 'readings' of it. Much the same is often said of the Polonaise-Fantaisie - and of the B-flat minor Sonata. This time, however, Bunin's glorious performance of the sonata really had the impact of a revelation. Even the Marche funebre had an unfamiliar stamp (troubled and inconsolable, without pomp or strident protest) which carried complete authority; and in the first movement, Bunin's powers encompassed the essential driving urgency and an extraordinary wealth of sensitive detail. It will stay in one's mind for a long time. Meanwhile, Bunin has a considerable repertoire beyond his revered Chopin: may we soon hear him in more of it]</p>

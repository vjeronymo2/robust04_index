			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Grid's golden shares The UK electricity sector is charmed. As if a benign set of price caps, share buy-backs and takeover rumours were not enough, now comes the news that the regional electricity companies should be able to demerge their holdings in the National Grid without paying a penny of tax. The government is, of course, absolutely right not to use its golden share to extract a hefty tax payment. But many in the market had been expecting the Treasury to demand its pound of flesh. Now it looks as if the recs will be able to pass the full Pounds 4bn-Pounds 5bn value of the grid through to their shareholders. The recs could still spoil the picture if they kept the proceeds from the sale for themselves rather than handing the shares directly to investors. They could then be liable for capital gains tax. But the recs seem less keen on hoarding cash than they did in the spring. Moreover, the political row over the grid reinforces the point that they should transfer value to investors now. A cash pile would be too easy for an incoming Labour government to expropriate. The recs may not have everything going their way on the tax front. It looks as though the Treasury will profit as share buy-backs gather momentum. Last week's share purchase in the market by Seeboard will certainly incur tax. Norweb's plan for an off-market tender would be better for tax-exempt investors, but authorisation from the Inland Revenue does not appear to be automatic. While recs could achieve a similar effect by paying mega-dividends, that would be a red rag to their political critics. Rec share prices should continue to be underpinned by their ample scope to cut costs, reshape their balance sheets and deliver value from the grid. The main risk is that some managements may not pursue these opportunities with sufficient vigour. That said, high share prices in themselves - as a reflection of high investor expectations - should help keep them on their toes. Any slackness would be an invitation to predators.</p>

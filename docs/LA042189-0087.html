			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNTY FIRMS BLAMED FOR 40% OF TOXIC EMISSIONS  </P> <P> Los Angeles County industries released 29.7 million pounds of hazardous  chemicals into the environment in 1987, representing 40% of all toxic emissions  into the air, water and ground in the state that year, according to a study  released Thursday.  </P> <P> The study by the California Public Interest Research Group analyzed records  filed by 636 Los Angeles County companies last July under a new,  Bhopal-inspired federal community-right-to-know law.  </P> <P> Under the law, manufacturing firms must disclose the amount of toxic chemicals  they emit routinely and by accidental leaks or evaporation into the air, water  and ground, and the amount they transport to dump facilities elsewhere. The  total for both categories for the county was more than 91.7 million pounds, or  11 pounds per person.  </P> <P> By chemical, the consumer advocacy group's study found that 12.8 million pounds  of the toxics emitted have been linked to cancer. About 25 million pounds are  suspected of causing birth defects, sterility or genetic mutations, and another  53.6 million pounds have been linked to damage to internal organs and the  central or peripheral nervous system.  </P> <P> Estimating the precise health risks of these emissions is difficult, however,  because the reports do not specify such factors as wind conditions or the  concentrations and timing of the emissions. Without this information, it is  impossible to know the degree to which people were exposed to the chemicals.  </P> <P> An official of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible  for enforcing the law, said at the time it took effect that the disclosures  would give the public "a hint" of what to be concerned about but would not  provide enough information "to know whether you should be scared or not."  </P> <P> "Release does not equal exposure. . . ," EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said  Thursday. "It may seem very, very scary, but you can't jump to conclusions. Did  it (the chemical) go all at once or just a little bit every day? What I am  trying to say is that you cannot assume all the chemical went right into your  house."  </P> <P> The consumer group, known as CALPIRG, contends that the overall amounts are so  large and many of the chemicals so toxic that it is reasonable to conclude that  the emissions are hurting public health.  </P> <P> "When you have almost 100 million pounds of toxics being released (and  transported) in L.A. County, with its population density, the exposure is going  to be extreme," said Mary Raftery, co-author of the report. "With the amounts  this large, there is no question there's an extreme risk."  </P> <P> The right-to-know law was passed by Congress in response to the deaths of more  than 2,000 people from a poisonous gas leak in a Union Carbide factory in  Bhopal, India. It requires firms that manufacture or use at least 10,000 pounds  of one or more of 325 chemicals specified as potentially hazardous by the EPA  to report their emissions on an annual basis. The firms include food, tobacco,  textiles, petroleum, printing, metals, rubber and plastic companies that have  10 or more full-time employees.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Variety of Chemicals  </P> <P> The chemicals whose emissions must be reported include methanol, which in large  quantities can cause blindness and at low levels may be associated with  neurological effects; butyl alcohol, which is toxic if consumed but is  generally considered safe to breath in low quantities, and perchloroethylene, a  solvent known to cause cancer in animals.  </P> <P> Firms within the city limits of Los Angeles released more chemicals into the  environment than any other city in the county. Los Angeles was followed by  Torrance, Van Nuys, El Segundo, Monrovia and Long Beach, according to the  report.  </P> <P> Vernon led the county in total pounds of toxics both emitted and transported by  trucks or pipes off the company site. Vernon was followed by Los Angeles,  Wilmington, Torrance, Santa Fe Springs and El Segundo.  </P> <P> Statewide, Orange County was second to Los Angeles in pounds of toxics released  and transported, followed by San Bernardino, Humboldt, Alameda, Contra Costa,  Santa Clara and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> The emissions into water, such as canals, were from pipes, open trenches, waste  water treatment facilities and storm water runoff. By ground, the toxics were  either injected underground into wells at the firms or transferred to public or  privately owned storage, disposal and treatment plants. By air, the chemicals  were emitted from such sources as building ventilation systems and smokestacks.  </P> <P> CALPIRG is trying to build support for state legislation sponsored by  Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda) to require companies to report their use  of toxics and the amounts of toxic byproducts they generate. The federal law  requires disclosure only of toxic releases and transportation of toxic  chemicals.  </P> <P> The organization also is backing a bill by Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin  (D-Fremont) to establish an institute to promote research into reducing use of  toxic chemicals and to assist businesses in reduction techniques.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOXIC CHEMICALS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY  </P> <P>  The California Public Interest Research Group ranked cities according to the  total of toxic chemicals released directly into the atmosphere in 1987 and the  combined total of chemicals released and transferred to waste sites or into  sewage systems. The chemicals included 325 types considered by the federal  Environmental Protection Agency to pose a threat to the environment and public  health. Amounts are expressed in pounds.  </P> <P> TOTAL RELEASES AND TRANSFERS  </P> <P> 1. Vernon: 27,000,000  </P> <P> 2. Los Angeles: 8,000,000  </P> <P> 3. Wilmington: 7,600,000  </P> <P> 4.

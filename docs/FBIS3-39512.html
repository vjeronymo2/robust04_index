This is what  Ambassador Jean De Ruyt, chairman of the circle of friends (the  so-called Amicale) of Belgian diplomats wrote in a letter to the  minister. Last week, De Ruyt published extracts from the letter  in the Amicale's newsletter.    The Staes affair concerns the visit of Muslim leader  Amanullah Khan from Kashmir to Brussels in October 1993.  [passage omitted]    In his letter, De Ruyt adopts a particularly critical stance  regarding Willy Claes. Among other things, he writes that in  instances where the administrative responsibility of an  ambassador is at issue, "this responsibility may not be  personalized, nor may it lead to judgments relating to the  individual involved."    "To the extent that various people (in Brussels) were  involved in the incident, we believe that it would have been  better to wait until the investigation had yielded the necessary  elements, before making ambassador responsible for what  happened."    "For someone who has devoted his entire career to the  department, showing a professional commitment to which many of  his colleagues could bear witness, these personal attacks (by  Willy Claes -- DE STANDAARD editor's note), to which he was  unable to respond, caused moral damage from which it will be  difficult to recover."    De Ruyt went on to indicate that the Amicale was considering  whether or not to write a letter to the director general of the  chancellery, in order to point out the problems arising with  regard to the issuing of the visa. These problems include: A  "complex mass" of circulars on the affairs, which "in some cases  seem barely compatible"; the "difficulty of accessing" the  equipment that provides the "black list," and the fact that only  alphabetical lists in Roman type are used; and finally, the fact  that the responsibility is divided between the head of station  and the chancellor.    Let us remember, in the chamber of deputies in recent  months,  Minister Claes has stated repeatedly that the instructions for  issuing visas were "very clear," and "extremely precise."</p>

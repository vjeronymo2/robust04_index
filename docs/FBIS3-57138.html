			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Moscow Mayak Radio Network in Russian at  1415 GMT on 20 January carries a report by Mayak correspondent  Aleksandr Ruvinskiy on the work of the State Duma.    Ruvinskiy questions the wisdom of the proposed bill on the  status of deputies, as well as the reasons behind some of the  government's decisions, such as the refurbishing of the White  House and moving government offices there at a considerable cost  to the taxpayer. He then adds that Sergey Shakhray held an  interesting news conference today at which he explained the role  of his faction, the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, in the  Duma, and his reasons for accepting a ministerial post.    Shakhray says: "For the first time in three-and-a-half  years, an opportunity--this is a very gentle, preliminary  assessment--an opportunity has arisen for a coordinated activity  of the legislative and the executive powers in the area of  regional policy. Representatives of our faction in the State  Duma are heading three committees: the Committee for Matters of  the Federation and Regional Policy; the Committee for Matters of  the Commonwealth and Compatriots; and the Committee for Local  Self-government. In fact, the entire regional spectrum is  covered by these committees in the State Duma.    "The position of the Party of Russian Unity and Accord is  also very influential in the upper chamber--the Federation  Council. My acceptance of the post of minister for  nationalities and regional policy was influenced by another  consideration that is very important to me. Our analysis shows  that 1994 will be a very difficult year with respect to  interethnic relations. There is a threat of interethnic and  regional strife and even conflict. In this situation, it would  have been very easy to feel insulted by the downgrading from the  status of a deputy prime minister to the status of a minister or  to find another plausible reason--since the administration  provides numerous opportunities to do so--and to resign from the  government having adopted a position of a constructive or  non-constructive opposition and criticism. For me, such a  position would be unacceptable from a moral and professional  point of view. As long as there is an opportunity to influence  regional policy, a chance to avert or minimize the negative  consequences of possible conflicts, I will continue to work."</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Peers resist Lloyd's regulation Lord Henley, a government spokesman, told the House of Lords last night that no case had been made for bringing any element of the Lloyd's insurance market under the provisions of the Financial Services Act. He resisted an amendment to the deregulation and contracting-out bill which sought to end the self-regulation practised by Lloyd's under the terms of private legislation approved by parliament in 1982. Lord Williams of Elvel, who moved the amendment from the Labour front bench, said there was a question mark over the future of Lloyd's as a result of losses which could be attributed to incompetence and the failure of self-regulation. He said that if the amendment were approved it would put the insurance and reinsurance activities carried out under the Lloyd's umbrella on a sure footing for the future. Lord Marlesford, the only Conservative peer who took part in the debate to speak in favour of the amendment, described himself as a 'victim' of Lloyd's. He said it was an act of myopia which had led parliament to grant Lloyd's immunity from the Financial Services Act. Lord Marlesford suggested that a future ruling by the courts could result in the minutes of the Lloyd's council being disclosed and the extent to which it had failed to protect Names being revealed. He criticised the way in which Lloyd's had 'hypothecated' profits for 1994 to meet the losses of 1991. He also called for an assurance that the Department of Trade and Industry would discharge its responsibility for determining the solvency of Lloyd's. Lord Williams withdrew the amendment, but indicated that he may return to the issue at a later stage of the bill.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Turnround at Finnish pulp and paper group ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, swung to a FM186m (Dollars 32.6m) profit after financial items in the first eight months from a FM283m deficit in the same 1992 period. Mr Jukka Harmala, chief executive, attributed the turnround to the weaker markka, greater internal efficiency and lower raw material costs. He said conditions remained difficult as European recession and overcapacity drove prices down for pulp, fine papers and board. Prices for other products were generally stable. The exceptions were newsprint and sawn products, where demand and supply were more balanced because of reduced North American exports. Sales rose to FM8.89bn, a 39 per cent increase which partly reflected the group's purchase of Tampella's forest products and packaging operations in May. It benefited from increased sales from the new Enocell pulp mill and higher capacity utilisation. The operating margin improved to FM1.97bn, or 22.2 per cent of net sales, from FM917m, or 14.4 per cent of sales. Interest expenses amounted to FM1.23bn, reflecting the group's heavy investment programme. Capital investments totalled FM2.19bn in the first eight months, due to the Tampella purchase, the Enocell project and work on a new paper plant in Germany. Tampella, the Finnish engineering group, recorded a FM65m loss after financial items in the first eight months, a sharp improvement on the FM317m deficit it recorded a year earlier. The group has undergone restructuring since it was rescued by the Bank of Finland in late 1991, culminating in the sale of its forest and packaging operations to Enso-Gutzeit earlier this year. The company's improved prospects encouraged the state to sell a big chunk of its shares in August, leaving it with a 50.6 per cent stake.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Observer: Oiling wheels of research There will be knowing smiles at BP headquarters at the news, expected today, that Sir John Cadogan, who retired last year as BP's research director, is to be director general of Research Councils - the key job in the government's new structure for running British science. It means that Cadogan, a 63-year-old organic chemist who will be responsible for dishing out more than Pounds 1bn a year to support university science, will be reunited with another old BP hand. Bob Malpas, chairman-elect of the Natural Environment Research Council, was a BP managing director during the 1980s. Former colleagues will be interested to see how Cadogan's super-confident management style goes down in Whitehall. One of his achievements at Britain's premier oil company was to introduce a system of cost-benefit analysis to justify R&amp;D spending to the BP board. Hard to believe that the Treasury will be taken in by such high-falutin' figuring when he tries to extract more money for science.</p>

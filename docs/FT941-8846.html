			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / International Company News: Neiman Marcus ahead 22% in second term Neiman Marcus, the US fashion retailer, lifted net profits by 22 per cent to Dollars 21.5m in its second quarter to January 29, helped by strong sales in its Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores and NM Direct catalogue division. The company said the stores and catalogue had a particularly good Christmas, but there were disappointing performances from the Contempo Casuals and Pastille units, both of which increased losses. Store closings due to the Californian earthquake hindered their performance. Turnover rose to Dollars 650.7m from Dollars 617.2m and earnings per share to 37 cents from 27 cents. For the first six months, net income rose to Dollars 36.7m from Dollars 33.7m and earnings per share to 58 cents from 51 cents. Mr Robert Tarr, president and chief executive, said the company expected the usual net loss in the second half.</p>

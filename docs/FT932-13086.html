			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Books: Chinese gamble over Hong Kong's future THE END OF HONG KONG by Robert Cottrell John Murray Pounds 19.99, 244 pages HONG Kong is such an amazing freak of history and the game over its future is such a gamble and so uncertain that it is surprising there are not more books written about it. One reason, no doubt, is that the story does not stand still long enough for anyone to write a book which is not going to be overtaken by developments long before it is published. Robert Cottrell, in The End of Hong Kong, solves the problem by ending the narrative in 1984. This gives the book a better shot at longevity, but a smaller claim to relevance. The book details every step of the complex quadrille danced by diplomats from Peking and London in the early 1980s, leading to the 1984 Joint Declaration under which China will take back Hong Kong at midnight on June 30, 1997. As a reference work on the era, it is excellent. Cottrell, a former correspondent of the Financial Times, includes some nice insider details from the British/Hong Kong side which flesh out the story. His description of how, during the confidence crisis in 1983, the government decided to peg the Hong Kong dollar to the US dollar at the rate of 7.80 - which survives today - is fascinating: 'There was an initial inclination to set the rate at HKDollars 8, a number which had the additional advantage of being considered auspicious in Hong Kong, because it supplied in Cantonese a near-homophone for 'prosperity'. But Bremridge felt that HKDollars 8 was too simple a number, lacking an appropriate air of scientific calculation. A slightly stronger rate, HKDollars 7.80 was arbitrarily fixed and then published. The peg was in place.' On the negotiations over Hong Kong's future, the book lacks the balance of insider detail from the Chinese side. But perhaps there was not much more to say. Thereby hangs the book's biggest problem - the outcome of the negotiations on Hong Kong's future was never in doubt. As a result, much of the detail of the negotiations, while riveting at the time, is irrelevant from a longer-term perspective. The British began the negotiations in 1982 with the position that Britain had to retain a role in the administration of the territory for it to remain prosperous. That may or may not have been true, but the point was irrelevant. China's top priority, based on what you might call Opium War psychology, was to take back Hong Kong no matter what the consequences. Not only was the outcome inevitable, but there is also a chance that the document that resulted, the Joint Declaration, may prove in the long run to be irrelevant, or interpreted by China's current or future leaders in ways entirely contrary to what the British thought they were agreeing to. As Lord Derwent aptly put it in the debate on Hong Kong in the House of Lords last December: 'The problem with the Joint Declaration is rather the same as the problem with the Maastricht Treaty. It is so cleverly drafted that it is possible for the two sides to agree on every word of the text without there being any real agreement on what it means or how it can be applied.' One of the most basic misunderstandings over the years has been over the famous Chinese promise to Hong Kong of 'One Country, Two Systems' for 50 years beyond 1997. The Chinese basically meant two economic systems, while Westerners very often assumed they meant two political systems. They didn't. In a way, the really interesting story begins where Cottrell ends - with the changes unleashed by the Joint Declaration which are transforming Hong Kong from a British colony into a Chinese city. The process is almost complete. He mentions some post-1984 developments in passing in an Afterword: the flight of money and talent in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the growing economic power of southern China; and Britain's inconclusive flirtations with Hong Kong democracy, before and after the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, which have landed Governor Chris Patten in the soup. But it is all such a moving target that it is hard to blame Cottrell for ending the story where he does.</p>

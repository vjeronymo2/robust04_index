			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The BOCs should also be authorized to provide certain long distance service for calls inbound to the cellular exchange, and the authority to provide such services is included in the Department's proposed order, which authorizes the provision of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Call Completion Services, i.e., interexchange services resulting when a caller directs a call to a subscriber of a Wireless Exchange Carrier that has instructed that carrier to forward calls to a location in another exchange area. Such remote locations may include a network address (such as a telephone or paging number) stored at the MTSO, or a voice mailbox or similar storage facility. In such cases, the BOC may provide only the interexchange portion of the call from the point where it is redirected by the subscriber's Wireless Exchange Carrier's MTSO. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed Order, Section VIII(L)(2)(b). This proposal reflects what the BOC's seek: the right to forward calls to the cellular subscriber's chosen destination (including a voice mailbox), according to the subscriber's PIC, rather than that of the call originator. The call originator might have thought he was making a local call, when the subscriber had forwarded her phone to a distant city; the subscriber pays for that long distance segment and, if she chose the BOC as her PIC, the BOC would carry the call. (See BOC Mem. 13) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The authority in this paragraph does not include the authority to provide an ``800 access to cellular'' service, which the BOCs have not sought. However, in the proposed consent decree with AT&amp;T arising from AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of McCaw, the Department has agreed that AT&amp;T arising from AT&amp;T's proposed acquisition of McCaw, the Department has agreed that AT&amp;T should have the right to market a ``calling party pays'' cellular service. AT&amp;T/McCaw Decree, &sect;IV.F.2, and competition will be served if the BOCs can offer a similar service. <FOOTCITE>49</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 49 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This service which would be offered to subscribers of Wireless Exchange Carriers would permit use of a number that the subscriber could give out that would permit callers that were willing to pay charges for wireless services to reach the subscriber through the wireless terminal. It is the Department's understanding that the availability of this service may be important to the continued rapid growth of the wireless industry and that the feasibility of this offering is likely to depend on whether the caller will know in advance what the charges for the call will be. Thus, it is contemplated that for this service to be successful, carriers may need to average airtime and toll charges so that a flat per-minute rate may be associated with the service. Thus, an exception to the requirement that separate charges for wireless access and interexchange services is appropriate in this instance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> c.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Entities Bound by the Waiver. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Unlike the BOCs' proposed order, the Department's proposed order applies to any entity that is a ``BOC'' within the meaning of the Decree. The Department does not proposed to redefine ``BOC'' for the purposes of this order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Equal Access plans. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department concurs in the BOC's proposal that they provide equal access plans, but Section VIII(L)(4)(b) of the Department's proposed order specifies the matters that those plans should describe: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Each BOC's compliance plans shall include a plan for implementing equal access on a nondiscriminatory basis in the context where the BOC access provider is also a competing interexchange carrier. These plans shall include detailed procedures for implementing equal access from any Wireless Exchange System where a BOC acquires a controlling interest after the effective date of this Section VIII(L), procedures for identifying to new Wireless Exchange Service customers their choices for interexchange services, the terms and conditions whereby unaffiliated interexchange carriers will be offered the opportunity to interconnect at any BOC Wireless Exchange Systems MTSO, the procedures for disseminating to interexchange carriers any planned changes in network services or plans for implementing new services that may affect such carriers services, procedures for assuring that any personnel of a BOC Wireless Exchange Carrier that is involved in the marketing of interexchange services shall not have access to proprietary information of other interexchange carriers, including but not limited to network interconnection arrangements and lists of interexchange carrier customers or their usage statistics; a plan for the separation of the personnel that market interexchange services from the personnel that administer presubscription; a plan for implementing Calling Party Pays service if the BOC wishes to offer such a service; a plan describing its procedures to assure compliance with Section VIII(L)(2)(e) of this Decree (including a plan for providing nondiscriminatory access to IS&hyph;41 or similar databases for all carriers); and a plan for implementing CDPD service. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The effect of these sections is to make clear what matters the equal access plans should discuss, and that there is no authority to provide interexchange services in the absence of an effective plan. A plan is only effective if not disapproved by the Department. The requirement to submit plans and the Department's responsibility to review them_and the Department's right to reject inadequate plans_should relieve the Court of the need to administer the minutiae of equal access, and should provide the BOCs sufficient flexibility in the offering of services, without the need to return to the Court for ministerial matters. Interested parties will have an opportunity to review the equal access plans and to alert the Department to deficiencies they perceive. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The Resale Will Eliminate Most Risks of Discriminatory Interconnection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department proposes that the BOCs' authority to provide interexchange services be limited to the resale of switched interexchange services provided by others. The Department has also indicated that its current view is that the BOCs should purchase no more than 45 percent of their interexchange needs from single source. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BOCs tell the Court, as they told the Department in seeking the Department's support, that ``as a practical matter, *&blank;*&blank;* it is likely that the BOCs will mostly act as resellers of switched services in this context.'' (BOC Mem. 16) Nonetheless, the BOCs seek the authority to build and use interexchange facilities. The Department believes that limiting the BOCs to switched resale will substantially reduce the dangers of discrimination, and proposed that limitations on that basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By limiting the BOCs to reselling switched interexchange services, the BOCs will not be able to construct or operate facilities, and therefore they will be unable to give their own facilities favorable treatment. Since they will be reselling other carriers' services, any discrimination aimed at favoring the BOC's service would be readily apparent at least to the carriers whose services the BOC was reselling. The benefits of that discrimination would flow to that carrier for all of its traffic, and that carrier would be competing with the BOC. Therefore, the risks of discrimination are here accompanied by a proportionately smaller benefit, reducing the likelihood of that discrimination. These dangers are further reduced by the requirement that the BOC obtain not more than 45 percent of any system's interexchange services from any one provider, thereby requiring the BOC to use three carriers and leaving less opportunity for the BOC to discriminate against other carriers, and likewise increasing the difficulty of collusive behavior. <FOOTCITE>50</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 50 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The BOCs have objected to this requirement as preventing them from obtaining the bulk discounts on long distance services that would make it possible for them to resell interexchange services. (BOC Mem. 17) However, the BOCs have not provided any evidence that the anticipated volumes will not entitle them to substantial discounts under currently filed tariffs, at reasonable volume predictions. The Department has requested further information from the BOCs on this subject. Although the BOCs argue that the 45 percent ``condition would prevent the BOCs from putting price pressure on any'' interexchange carrier (BOC Mem. 17), the Supreme Court's recent holding that all interexchange carriers must file tariffs, MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone &amp; Tel. Co., 114 S. Ct. 2223 (1994), limits the concern that the BOCs would be unable to take advantage of tariffed bulk discounts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Marketing and Unbundling Requirements Are Necessary To Ensure that Presubscription Provides a Genuine Opportunity for Competing Interexchange Carriers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Meaningful equal access is premised on the idea that procedures can be put in place to provide competing interexchange carriers a reasonable opportunity to complete for customers' business. Merely requiring the BOC to offer presubscription seems insufficient, if the BOC can bundle cellular and interexchange services together in blended, single-price offerings that do not permit customers the opportunity to compare the BOC's offerings with its competitiors'; if the BOC can market its interexchange service together with its cellular service, while requiring the customer to make separate inquiries to discover the availability of competing carriers; or if the BOC can provide a combined bill for its cellular and long distance service, while requiring its competitors' customers to receive and pay two separate bills. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

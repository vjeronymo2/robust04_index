			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans Blix, director general of the </F> International Atomic Energy Agency, by special correspondent  Romain Franklin in Vienna; date not given: "North Korea's  Nuclear Program -- the IAEA's Headache" -- first two paragraphs  are LIBERATION introduction]    [Text] International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Official  Hans Blix explains why Pyongyang's refusal to let inspectors  check its nuclear sites is a major problem.    It has now been a year since North Korea's nuclear ambitions  sparked a crisis on January 1993, with Pyongyang refusing to let  IAEA inspectors carry out a "special inspection" of two nuclear  waste sites. Such an inspection might have provided evidence as  to the nature of North Korea's nuclear program; North Korea is  thought to be engaged in a program to manufacture nuclear  weapons. In March, Pyongyang announced that it was withdrawing  from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which it had  signed in 1985, then "suspended" its withdrawal in June, a few  hours before it was to become effective. The United States has  been trying since last Summer to convince North Korea's  Communist regime to rejoin the NPT and to agree to the IAEA's  requirements. North Korea recontacted the IAEA last week;  however, the agency said on Thursday that Pyongyang still  rejected its requirements. The following is an interview with  IAEA Executive Director Hans Blix.    [Franklin] Is North Korea's attitude especially problematic  for the IAEA as well as with respect to the more general issue  of non-proliferation?    [Blix] I would say that this is the most acute and  politically most sensitive non-proliferation issue we have to  deal with. The IAEA has been demanding, unsuccessfully so far,  that a number of inspections which require additional  information and site visits be carried out, and the case has  been referred to the Security Council of the United Nations.  That the inspection process should be paralyzed in such a  manner is quite a serious matter.    [Franklin] The CIA says that North Korea could be in  possession of up to 12 kilograms of plutonium, enough to make  one or two atom bombs. Is that a fact?    [Blix] We do not know. The North Koreans have declared  having extracted minimal amounts of plutonium (from their  Yongbyon reactor). However, our inspectors have concluded that  the amount declared was not the whole picture. This could be  very serious if the amounts involved are substantial. It might  be possible to get a better idea of such amounts by checking how  long the nuclear fuel has been in place in the reactor --  whether it has been in place since the initial start-up or if it  has been changed since.    [Franklin] What did you hope would come out of the  inspection of the two sites Pyongyang has made off-limits?    [Blix] Evidence or confirmation of plutonium production  there; there is no guarantee that we will be able to determine  the amount of plutonium produced, however.    [Franklin] If all IAEA requirements are met, will you be in  a position to guarantee that North Korea is not working on a  military nuclear program?    [Blix] There will always be some uncertainty, all the more  since inspecting the Yongbyon plant does not in any way rule out  the existence of other (clandestine) facilities.    [Franklin] Is it still possible to hide an underground  nuclear facility from all current detection techniques?    [Blix] That must be no easy task.    [Franklin] But it is technically feasible?    [Blix] In Iraq, we looked for an underground plant...and  even though we did not find one, we remain cautious. Never, for  any country, do we give a 100-percent guarantee that there is no  clandestine nuclear program in operation.    [Franklin] Are the cameras installed by the agency on the  Yongbyon site still operational?    [Blix] None of them is as their film supply is now  exhausted.    [Franklin] Then, is it possible that fissionable materials  might have been taken out of the reactor in the meantime?    [Blix] This cannot be ruled out.    [Franklin] The United States, acting under a UN mandate, is  currently arranging an agreement which would make it possible to  reinstate the inspection scheme in North Korea. Some people say  this agreement is too advantageous for North Korea. What are  your basic requirements?    [Blix] We do not intend to carry out any inspection that  would not be significant, that is, which would not let us  determine whether fissionable materials have been diverted since  our previous inspection. The agreement being negotiated would  be implemented in two phases, at least. First, we ask to be  allowed to carry out the types of inspections we were performing  on the seven declared nuclear sites last year. Then we ask for  a consultation with the North Koreans on the inspection terms  for the two additional [undeclared] sites. Furthermore, such  inspections must take place on a regular basis in the future.    [Franklin] Does fissionable material smuggling create a new  danger?    [Blix] This is not a very serious problem. We never found  any enriched uranium when investigating the cases brought to our  attention by the media. As for plutonium, the amounts involved  were minimal. Likewise, we never noted a defection by any  nuclear scientist from the former USSR's military machine.    [Franklin] What other dangers may arise? Some of your  colleagues have referred to the atom bomb as becoming a "poor  man's weapon..."    [Blix] More and more developing countries are reaching the  technological level needed to separate plutonium or enriched  uranium. There is a definite overall risk, and what matters is  retaining the political will to curtail it.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukrainian presidential candidate Leonid </F> Kuchma by Stanislav Prokopchuk in Kiev; date not given:  "`...And We Will Come Down Hard on the Mafia.' That Is What  Ukrainian Presidential Candidate Leonid Kuchma Is Promising His  Voters"]    [Text] When Leonid Kravchuk was asked whom he sees as his  main rival in the upcoming 26 June presidential elections, his  answer was unequivocal -- Kuchma. The "duel" in the second  round will be with him, the present head of state believes. So,  since we recently set out Leonid Kravchuk's election platform on  the most important political and economic problems, we decided  also to allow Leonid Kuchma to speak out. Our correspondent met  with him.    Kiev -- [Prokopchuk] Leonid Danilovich, what direction is  Ukraine going to take and what will it build if you become  president?    [Kuchma] We will build a state in which someone who works  honestly has a better life than someone who refuses to work and  steals and pilfers from the state. Where a pensioner can live  on his pension rather than eke out a pitiful existence and root  around in trashcans. Where you can live a life worthy of a  human being on the minimum wage.    [Prokopchuk] How do you see Ukraine's state structure, and  what do you think of the idea of a federal land-based structure?    [Kuchma] I am a categorical supporter of strong presidential  power so that the head of state can assume full responsibility.  Initially, I even rule out the post of prime minister. I do not  want the president to be able to point the finger at anyone and  find a whipping boy and scapegoat.    As for the desire of the Dniester and Donbass regions for a  kind of economic federalism, this is a matter not of a wish to  escape pressure from the center but of its uselessness. It is  little use today. The regions are surviving themselves  nowadays, either on their own or by helping each other without  intermediaries. The country's budget is practically empty. I  was one of the first to advocate a future federal land-based  structure and greater economic autonomy for the regions, but  without this turning into political autonomy. That would spell  the disintegration of statehood. I am opposed to that kind of  structure.    [Prokopchuk] In one of your first speeches in parliament as  head of government you made the sensational statement that mafia  structures and corruption have permeated all upper-echelon power  structures. But what stopped you during your year as head of  the cabinet of ministers from seeing through to completion at  least one major case about oil, say, or the sale of metal at  dumping prices....    [Kuchma] Why did I make that statement in the Supreme  Council at that time? Because the problem of corruption and the  mafia is a matter of personnel policy. Who is in charge of the  power ministers? Not the prime minister, but directly the  president. What about the courts and the prosecutor's office?  Parliament is in charge of them. In this situation what can  the premier do except refer cases to the prosecutor's office and  make statements in parliament?    During my premiership over 1,500 criminal cases were  instigated against high-ranking corrupt officials. Now they  have all been quietly shelved. I personally dismissed the  directors of all Ukraine's oil refineries for machinations over  the export of petroleum products running into hundreds of  millions of dollars. They now have their jobs back.... I give  my word that if I win the election I will have both the powers  and the determination to deal a mortal blow against crime and to  come down hard on the mafia.    [Prokopchuk] What in your view is the way out of the  Crimean crisis?    [Kuchma] Everyone must clearly realize that Crimea is a  component part of Ukraine and proceed on this basis. There can  be no question of other terms. Second, there should be no  attempts to take back what has already been given away. The  Crimeans are asking for greater economic autonomy -- fine.  Maybe Crimea will indeed be the place where all economic  innovations are tried out. There must be an end to  saber-rattling and threats: We cannot allow yet another  "trouble spot" to appear on the map of the former Union. But  some people badly want this. The only possible way out of the  Crimean crisis is a full-scale treaty between Kiev and  Simferopol that would grant Crimea within Ukraine all possible  economic autonomy. In my view the treaty between Russia and  Tatarstan is a model for such a solution.    [Prokopchuk] What would be your way of extricating the  country from the protracted economic crisis?    [Kuchma] First, privatization. It must take place under  strict state control, as it does throughout the world.  Otherwise this will only enrich the mafia structures that are  tightly interwoven with the bureaucratic apparatus. The  foundation of the economy must be not ideological phantoms,  whatever their hue, but people's real interests. The experience  of economic development of countries like the FRG and Sweden  cogently demonstrates this in practice.    Second, the taxation system must immediately be  fundamentally  changed, since it stifles both private enterprise and state  enterprises. In this connection the budget structure must also  be radically revised, making a point of increasing the share of  expenditure earmarked for the social sphere, science, education,  and specifically for increasing pensions. After all, it is  impossible to live on pensions today.    Third. There is a need to eliminate all restrictions on the  creation of a single economic space in the CIS countries, which  over 80 percent of industry is geared toward. This question is  not just Leonid Kuchma's view but a matter of the survival of  the entire state. And the fixed exchange rate of the  karbovanets is totally disastrous for our economy and is merely  a source of fabulous wealth for certain powers that be. Its  abolition is a priority measure.    [Prokopchuk] All your election campaign opponents accuse  Kuchma of dragging Ukraine into a new inviolable Union and say  that if he comes to power Ukraine will lose its autonomy and  sovereignty. How ideally do you see Ukraine's policy vis-a-vis  Russia?    [Kuchma] Because of its geographical position, historical  past, and the entire spirit of the people Ukraine cannot play  the role of "cordon sanitaire" between Russia and the remaining  European countries that has been foisted upon it. Its  historical mission is very different: Ukraine must become a  bridge for the mutual enrichment of the civilizations of West  and East. A bridge across which the most sophisticated and  vitally necessary technologies pass.    Russia, with which we are linked by thousands of historical,  economic, and cultural bonds, is especially important in this  respect. The path of confrontation with it is quite disastrous  for Ukraine and entails total collapse and the possible loss of  statehood. Relations of "special partnership" like those  between the United States and Canada must inevitably be  established between our countries.    Finally -- a few words about economic integration, not about  Kuchma's desire to create a new version of the former Union.  Integration is the basis of the current economic prosperity of  the EEC countries. Integration, and not the subordination of  one country to others, and the creation of regional  organizations for all-around equal cooperation, as is being done  in Europe and North America. The CIS must become a model not of  "civilized divorce" but of the ability to preserve old economic,  cultural, and spiritual links while adapting them in the light  of objective conditions and to organize new links.    [Prokopchuk] So who do you think is going to win the  upcoming elections?    [Kuchma] I am sure the people will make the correct choice  26 June.... Demagoguery will no longer work, and the  presidential candidates who have made it the basis of their  activity have not got the slightest chance of winning.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Caledonia Invs raises Ivory &amp; Sime stake Caledonia Investments, the holding company controlled by the Cayzer family, has increased its stake in Ivory &amp; Sime, the Scottish fund management group, from 15 per cent to 24.9 per cent. Caledonia bought 2.9m shares in Ivory &amp; Sime on Friday at about the market price of 224p. Most of the shares, which were bought in the market, came from Abtrust, the fund manager that acquired part of Ensign Trust's 16.7 per cent holding last year. Earlier last week Caledonia increased its stake by 13 per cent after sales by Abtrust and Scottish Value Trust. Sir David Kinloch, deputy chief executive of Caledonia, would not been drawn on whether the company intended to increase its holding to 29.9 per cent. 'Obviously we have taken the holding as a long-term investment as we normally do. We hope that by stabilising their shareholder structure we will help them develop.' Caledonia has a long and lucrative record of taking large minority stakes in financial companies. Caledonia owns investment trust manager Clan Asset Management with funds of about Pounds 240m.</p>

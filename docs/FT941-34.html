			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Comalco leads power station deal A consortium led by Comalco, the large intergrated aluminium producer which is 67 per cent-owned by CRA, yesterday formally acquired the Gladstone power station from the Queensland government for ADollars 750m (USDollars 536m). To help fund the deal, Comalco and its partners required non-recourse project financing of ADollars 625m. This has been provided by a banking consortium led by Barclays Bank, and involving Commonwealth Bank of Australia, ANZ, Industrial Bank of Japan and Deutsche Bank. The transaction has attracted considerable attention, because it was the first financing of a large resources-related project whose viability could be affected by an Aboriginal land claim under the new federal native title legislation. This came into force at the beginning of the year. The purchase of the power station is tied to Comalco's plans to expand production of its nearby Boyne Island aluminium smelter. However, land in the surrounding Cape York peninsular is subject to a native title claim by the Wik people. The claim covers some of Comalco's bauxite leases, which may have to supply raw material to the smelter.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Vienna on 4 May </F> -- recorded]    [Text] I would like to announce that the European  Parliament has voted in favor of agreeing to Austrian membership  in the European Union [EU] with a majority of 374 votes, 24 no  votes, and 61 abstentions. I would like to point out that, for  me, this signifies an appreciation of the remarkable course our  country has taken since 1945. I also think this recognizes our  political and social stability as well as the achievements of  our country. I think this vote also appreciates Austria's role  and implies an obligation for Austria regarding its historical  relations with the countries of Central and East Europe. Last  but not least, it also shows that Austria is a valuable and  natural partner for the EU. With today's vote, the nations of  Europe that are members of the EU have invited the Austrian  people to contribute their share as partners in a peaceful  future. I am convinced that the Austrian people will give a  positive answer on 12 June.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> One-Year T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $9.5 billion of new  52-week bills at an average discount rate of 7.21%, up from 7.14% at the last  auction on Dec. 14. The rates were the highest since Oct. 19, 1989, when the  one-year bills sold for 7.35%. The new discount rate understates the actual  return to investors -- 7.74%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,271.00.  </P></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux in mobile phone accord Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French utilities and communications group, yesterday announced alliances with Vodafone of the UK and Southwestern Bell (SBC) of the US aimed at strengthening its position in the French mobile telephone market and entering the sector in North America. As a result, the capital of Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone (SFR), Generale des Eaux's mobile telephone subsidiary, will be increased by about FFr3bn (Dollars 567m). The group said it would use the resources to develop its cellular telecoms operations. Vodafone, which already holds a 4 per cent stake in Cofira, the holding company of SFR, will exchange its stake for a direct 10 per cent holding in SFR. The transaction will involve a cash payment of FFr880m. SBC is to take a 10 per cent stake in Cofira. It will do this through the purchase of a 22 per cent stake in a holding company which will control Cofira. Generale des Eaux will hold the balance of the shares. SBC said last night its investment would total Dollars 626m. Under the terms of the agreement, Generale des Eaux will pay Dollars 247m for a 10 per cent stake in the radio telephone franchises operated by Southwestern Bell in the Washington DC and Baltimore regions. Separately, SBC said it would acquire 10 per cent of certain French cable-TV properties owned by CGV, a Generale des Eaux subsidiary. The US group said terms of that deal were still being negotiated. The agreements reflect the desire by Mr Guy Dejouany, chairman of Generale des Eaux, to find industrial allies in its mobile telecoms activities. Earlier this year he told shareholders he was seeking the formation of partnerships with foreign telecoms operators with substantial financial and technological resources. Last week, the French government announced the award of a third mobile telephones licence aimed at stimulating the domestic market.</p>

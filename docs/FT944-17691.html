			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / Rover will renew assault on N America in push for sales Rover-produced cars will return to the North American market despite the sales failure of its Sterling-badged cars at the end of the 1980s, the chairman of BMW, Rover's parent company, said yesterday. Rovers, rather than BMWs, will also lead the German-owned group's drive into Asian markets such as China, where explosive growth is forecast over the coming decade, said BMW chairman Mr Berndt Pischetsrieder. In his first wide-ranging assessment of Rover group since BMW acquired Rover from British Aerospace for Pounds 800m in January, Mr Pischetsrieder also: Held out the prospect of tripartite co-operation between BMW, Rover and Honda - Rover's close associate under BAe ownership - wherever in the world joint projects were felt to be of mutual benefit. Made clear that BMW saw no upper limits on car production by Rover or any reason why Rover-designed products should not be produced at assembly plants overseas. Confirmed that BMW is serious in its intent to revive names from the past, such as Riley and Austin-Healey, for niche market products. Indicated that there was virtually no chance of BMW reviving past negotiations seeking to buy Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the Vickers-owned luxury carmaker - 'although I have learned in this industry if you say never you can be wrong'. Mr Pischetsrieder set out no time scale or product plans for Rover cars to return to North America. The group has made a success of its Land Rover four-wheel-drive operations in North America but it has twice had to admit defeat in the car market, withdrawing for the first time in the 1970s and again after the Sterling debacle in 1991. But 'it is unlikely that any manufacturer will be around in the years 2005-2010 if it is not present in all major world markets - so, yes, Rover will be relaunched in the US', Mr Pischetsrieder said. He gave no details of BMW's precise strategy for Asia. However, Rover, with its smaller models and front-wheel-drive technology was an obvious choice for such markets, he declared. BMW as a brand was too narrow and upmarket in its model range. He made clear that past tensions with Honda over Rover's takeover had now disappeared. As Honda itself has sought to emphasise, its anger over the sale of Rover - with which Honda had cross-shareholdings - was directed at BAe for selling, not BMW for buying, the UK carmaker. Collaboration with Honda beyond current contracts with Rover, which last up to the year 2000, could now be contemplated. Mr Pischetsrieder also said the Mini, now in its 36th year, may continue in production past the end of the century if efforts to develop a replacement were felt to have failed.</p>

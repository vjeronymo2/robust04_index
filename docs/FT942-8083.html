			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Spain drafts bill to fight official corruption The Spanish authorities have drafted a bill to reform the country's penal code in a move to close loopholes and crack down on corruption. The reforms, presented at the weekend, were drawn up at short notice following a political storm and a series of high-level resignations over corruption scandals. Mr Juan Alberto Belloch, appointed earlier this month to head both the justice and interior ministries, described the proposed reforms as 'revolutionary'. . However, the conservative opposition Popular party, described the measures as 'electoralist' in the run-up to next month's European elections and regional elections in Andalucia in which the ruling Socialist party is expected to suffer heavy setbacks. The draft bill provides for jail terms of between one and three years for government employees who use public property for their own benefit. In what is seen as a preventive measures, it also provides exemption for people who denounce civil servants for accepting or seeking bribes. Measures against insider dealing on the stock market are also tightened. The bill provides for prison sentences of between one and four years, as well as fines, for use of privileged information - one of the allegations made against Mr Mariano Rubio, the former Bank of Spain governor currently on bail. In severe cases the penalty for insider trading can be increased to six years. People refusing to testify to parliamentary committees may also in future face prison sentences of between six months and a year, or up to two years' imprisonment in the case of civil servants. Separate legislation is being prepared to tighten up on tax fraud. The measures were among a series of steps promised last month by Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, in an effort to stem the controversy over corruption and financial misconduct by senior officials. Other moves include setting up a special prosecutor's office to deal with corruption and strengthening the powers of the Audit Tribunal, which comes under the authority of parliament and is responsible for monitoring public finances.</p>

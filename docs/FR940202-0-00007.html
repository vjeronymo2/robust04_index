			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters suggested that the Board allow counterparties to rely on an external auditor's certificate or that the Board redesign the test so that a party could verify its counterparty's qualifications by examining publicly available information. The Board believes that institutions desiring to qualify as financial institutions under the rule will have a strong incentive to present information in publicly available documents, such as financial reports, showing that the institution meets the quantitative test. These reports could be verified by an outside auditor, if the participants so desire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter suggested that, for the purposes of the quantitative test, the Board should treat the aggregate risk of an affiliated group as one entity, i.e. an institution would qualify as a financial institution if it meets the qualitative test and it and/or its affiliates meet the quantitative test. If an institution fails to meet its obligations, however, those obligations are not automatically assumed by its affiliates, even though in some cases a holding company, for example, may make contributions to a troubled subsidiary. The Board believes that treating each institution separately under the rule reflects more closely the risk that institution poses for its counterparties.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters requested that the Board allow the quantitative test to be satisfied by financial contracts from several financial markets, even though the institution may not satisfy the qualitative test for each one of those financial markets. The rule would allow aggregation of financial contracts across markets for purposes of the quantitative test, but would not require an institution to meet the qualitative test for each type of its financial contracts. For example, an institution might meet the qualitative test by representing that it will engage in foreign exchange contracts on both sides of the market and meet the quantitative test with both its foreign exchange and interest rate contracts. The institution would nevertheless qualify as a financial institution, and all of its netting contracts would be subject to the Act's protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in &sect;231.3(a)(2), the Board has changed the word ``incurred'' to ``had'' to clarify that the contracts that yield mark-to-market positions of $100 million need not be entered into on a single day. Rather, the $100 million refers to positions in outstanding contracts on a single day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Charter Test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six commenters suggested that the Board supplement the market activity tests with charter tests. The commenters argued that charter tests are consistent with the approach taken in the Act and are competitively neutral for each charter type. The commenters did not agree with the Board's statement that charter tests would foster inaccurate presumptions about the riskiness of covered institutions. Rather, they believed that charter tests would promote certainty without harmful results. The commenters requested coverage for a variety of charter types, including bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, insurance companies, foreign banks (rather than solely their U.S. branches and agencies), affiliates of registered broker-dealers, trust companies, Federal Reserve Banks, Federal Home Loan Banks, and certain government-sponsored entities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board has determined not to expand the rule's coverage through charter tests. Charter tests would include many end user institutions that are not market intermediaries, which the Board believes would stretch beyond the meaning of ``financial institution.'' A charter test would also cover many institutions whose business volumes do not give rise to systemic risk considerations. Although Congress used charter tests in the Act, the Board does not believe that charter tests are necessarily the most appropriate means to expand Congress' definition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There may be certain end user institutions that reasonably can be described as financial institutions even though they are not market intermediaries. The Board has the ability to make case-by-case determinations in these instances and has done so. For example, in 1992, the Board made individual determinations in the cases of three CHIPS members. Similarly, there may be certain government-sponsored entities or international organizations that do not meet the requirements of the rule yet could reasonably be considered financial institutions due to their roles in the financial markets. The Board would consider making individual determinations in such cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Definitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters also made various technical suggestions concerning the definitions. One commenter suggested that, in the definition of ``affiliate,'' the Board replace the word ``dealer'' with ``person.'' The Board has revised the definition in &sect;231.2(b) accordingly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters requested that the Board revise the definition of ``gross mark-to-market positions'' to replace the word ``price'' with ``value'' to clarify that market participants may use their normal market valuation methods rather than the method used to price each transaction at its inception. Section 231.2(e) of the final rule reflects this revision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

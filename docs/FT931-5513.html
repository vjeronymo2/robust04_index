			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Flat-owners gain aid to cover terrorism insurance risks FLAT-OWNERS IN London and other large cities will face only marginally higher insurance premiums to cover the cost of possible terrorist damage to large apartment blocks, the government announced yesterday. Increases will be less than was originally feared because both insurers and the government have agreed to cover more of the potential risk. 'It is very much a compromise, with the main beneficiaries being flat-owners and tenants,' said Mr Tony Baker, manager of public affairs at the Association of British Insurers. Increases in premiums would be likely to amount to about Pounds 10 per year compared with Pounds 100 a year predicted earlier this year. Insurers had originally insisted that owners of large blocks of flats buy terrorism insurance from a new mutual company, Pool Re, in the same way as other commercial property owners. Pool Re, a mutual formed by the insurance industry, will officially open for business in May. It will meet all claims up to an amount equal to its total annual premium income, with the government reinsuring most claims in excess of this amount. Terrorism cover was withdrawn from standard commercial insurance policies last November, following concern about the potential losses from the IRA's mainland bombing campaign. Under the arrangements, insurers will provide terrorism cover for all blocks of flats worth Pounds 2.5m or less - as well as the first Pounds 2.5m of other blocks - as part of standard property policies. Owners of more expensive properties in London will pay only 1p per Pounds 100 ( 1/2 p outside London) for their terrorism insurance, compared with a maximum figure of 9p per Pounds 100 for other commercial property owners. Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary said: 'These arrangements . . . represent a significantly more modest contribution from policy holders than previously envisaged.' Mr Baker claimed the government was 'more exposed' as a reinsurer because of the change. Separately, insurers have downgraded their own estimates of the cost of bomb damage in the City last April to Pounds 350m, less than 50 per cent of the Pounds 800m estimate claimed only a few weeks ago. Mr Baker said claims on loss of rental and business interruption policies were now expected to be about Pounds 100m, while property damage would total a further Pounds 250m. Many of the more than 250 businesses affected by the City bomb had reduced claims by finding cheaper office space, and the downturn in the construction industry had reduced rebuilding costs. It had also not been necessary to demolish as many buildings as previously feared. The new figures 'had emerged over the last few weeks' as insurance companies finalised year-end figures.

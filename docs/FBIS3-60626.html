Functionaries from the Orientalism Institute, the Far East  Affairs Institute, and the Human Affairs Institute of the  Academy of Sciences of Russia, and professors and doctors from  the Philosophy Department of the Moscow University were invited  to the meeting.    DPRK Ambassador to Russia Son Song-pil and embassy staff  were  present. Ambassador Son spoke first.    The ambassador said that our country has achieved great  results of socialist construction in all sectors under the wise  leadership of the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    He exposed details of the vicious maneuver by the U.S.  imperialists and international reactionaries aimed at stifling  [apsal] our socialist system under the pretext of the suspicion  of nonexistent nuclear development, and noted:    As the world knows, our country has neither the will nor the  ability to produce nuclear weapons. Even if we can produce  them, for what would they be? The nuclear problem was raised in  our country as the United States posed nuclear threats to us by  deploying about 1,000 nuclear weapons in South Korea and  conducting the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a nuclear  war exercise.    Therefore, in order to fundamentally solve the nuclear  problem of the Korean peninsula, talks must be held between the  United States, the nuclear problem maker, and the DPRK, its  victim. Pressure or threats will not work with us.    The ambassador pointed out that the United States has been  delaying the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks while demanding  unjust conditions, and said:    We proposed a package solution method, which requires that  the United States and the DPRK decide what each side should do  to resolve the nuclear issue and implement their duties at the  same time. If the United States accepts our proposal and the  DPRK-U.S. talks are successfully held, the nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula will be fundamentally resolved.    After exposing the fact that Japan and the South Korean  authorities are viciously maneuvering to break up DPRK-U.S.  talks, the ambassador stressed that their maneuver is aimed at  accelerating their own nuclear weapons development and nuclear  armament by using the suspicion of our nuclear development as a  pretext.    The ambassador urged the United States to abandon its  insidious purpose and accede sincerely to the third round of  DPRK-U.S. talks, and he continued:    Our position is clear. We will not hold talks while being  under pressure. The United States must clearly know who its  dialogue counterpart is. If the United States breaks up  DPRK-U.S. talks and continues to pose the nuclear threat to us,  we will take a corresponding measure [ungdanghan chochi] of  retreating the suspension of the effectuation of our declaration  to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.    We are ready for both dialogue and war. We have a firm  economy, a strong national defense, and the might of  single-hearted unity of the people who are united firmly around  the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il. No force in the world can break up this  single-hearted unity.    Today, our revolutionary cause pioneered by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song has brilliantly been succeeded to the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il.    Our people will firmly unite around the dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il in the future too, will defend the banner of  socialism to the last, and will brilliantly consummate the  socialist cause in our country.    Speeches were made by (Kavalyov), professor and doctor of  Moscow University; (Vanin), chief of the Orientalism Institute  of the Academy of Sciences of Russia; and other participants at  the meeting.    They congratulated the Korean people on their results  achieved in the revolution and construction under the banner of  socialism, and entirely supported our principled position toward  resolving the nuclear issue.    They extended the greatest honor and gratitude to the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song, the creator of the chuche idea, and  the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, the successor of the great  leader's revolutionary cause.</p>

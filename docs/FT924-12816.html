			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: European mergers The pace of cross-border European mergers and acquisitions is always of keen interest to corporate financiers. But the marked slowdown of M &amp; A activity in the third quarter may contain a wider message for stock markets too. The recent trend is most visible in provisional figures last week from KPMG. These show that, compared with the first and second quarters of 1992, the volume and value of deals involving target companies with their headquarters in the European Community roughly halved in the three months to September. It can, moreover, be no coincidence that the three transactions currently being investigated in Brussels by the EC's Merger Task Force is the lowest number on record. Currency turbulence over the summer - heightening perceptions of financial risk - no doubt partly explains the lull. The capacity of companies to finance takeovers, moreover, will have been constrained by nervous banks and wobbly share prices. One can just about imagine a successful capital-raising on Wall Street; in the continued absence of any tangible sign of economic recovery institutions must be distinctly wary of rights issues elsewhere. Corporate deals tend to be a reliable lead indicator of stock market activity. The question for investors is whether companies are genuinely strapped for cash, or whether they believe that European asset values are still inflated. The collapse in 1992 earnings forecasts - BZW expects earnings of continental companies to rise just 2 per cent, against a 12 per cent projection three months ago - is hardly auspicious.</p>

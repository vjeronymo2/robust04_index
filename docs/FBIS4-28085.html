			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The pro-Pyongyang General  Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) on Monday  [6 June] protested police raids earlier in the day on an  educational foundation and 26 other locations affiliated with  the organization in Kyoto.    The Chongnyon's Central Committee issued a statement  demanding that Japanese authorities immediately halt their  alleged "political suppression" of Korean residents of Japan.    Police raided Kyoto Chosen Gakuen, an educational foundation  running schools for Korean students, on suspicion of illegally  buying land without notifying Kyoto Municipal authorities of the  intended use of the property.    Among other locations searched by investigators was the  Kyoto  Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon.    In April, police searched the Osaka headquarters of  Chongnyon, on suspicion of disturbing a citizens' meeting that  was held to urge North Korea to release political prisoners.    North Korea's official media has since published almost  daily  condemnations of the "hostile acts" of Japanese authorities,  charging that the police action has been timed to coincide with  the aggravation of the situation on the Korean peninsula.</p>

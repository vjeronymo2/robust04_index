			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AID CREW BALKS AT KABUL FLIGHT; ROCKET KILLS 7  </P> <P> Seven people died in a rocket attack on central Kabul on Wednesday as Muslim  rebels intensified their campaign to hamper the Soviet Union's hurried troop  withdrawal from beleaguered Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, U.N. officials found a replacement for an EgyptAir plane whose crew  refused to fly the first U.N. relief supplies to the embattled Afghan capital.  </P> <P> At the last minute, the EgyptAir crew refused to fly to the city, which is  preparing for the possibility of a long siege after Soviet troops complete  their pullout next week.  </P> <P> U.N. officials said an Ethiopian Airlines cargo plane arrived in Islamabad and  was loading the 32 tons of supplies the Egyptian plane should have flown to  Kabul on Tuesday to start a U.N. airlift of 390 tons of food and medicines.  </P> <P> The refusal brought an angry response from Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, who is  coordinating U.N. relief efforts for Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Flying into Kabul can be hair-raising because planes descend quickly and bank  sharply while Soviet planes circle, spewing out magnesium flares as decoys for  possible rebel missiles.  </P> <P> The rocket attack on Kabul was the first major barrage after a period of calm  in the capital. The fatalities were caused when a rocket exploded among a crowd  collecting flour and cooking oil from a distribution center.  </P> <P> The Soviet news agency Tass also reported that Muslim rebels attacked posts  along two roads out of Afghanistan. The roads are the main land departure  routes for an estimated 15,000 Soviet troops, the last of a force of more than  100,000 due to leave by Feb. 15 under U.N.-mediated accords.  </P></p>

			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Many offices 'do not meet needs' MANY OFFICES built during the late 1980s do not fully meet occupiers' needs, according to a report by Debenham Tewson Research, a property adviser. The report says companies seeking to relocate are often faced with an inadequate choice which forces them to make compromises. Mr Stephen Webster, a director of Debenham Tewson Research, says: 'Even in today's market, office oversupply turns out in many cases to be illusory.' The figures on overall supply mask gaps in the market in terms of size and quality of buildings, he says. 'Much of that which has been built by the development industry does not fully meet occupiers' requirements, either in terms of location or specification,' he adds. The researchers examined the property market in the north-western sector of the M25, where there is an apparent abundance of empty office space. It found that 30 companies which had decided to move to the area had difficulty in finding ideal premises. Although the companies were usually satisfied with the amount of space, the cost of the building and the quality of finish, they made compromises on factors including air conditioning, parking spaces and the architectural quality of the building. The report says developers carried out inadequate research into the needs of their tenants. Speculative developments are also handicapped by the need to cater for as wide a range of potential occupiers as possible. Office Demand: Choice and Compromise.

			<p><P> February 16, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PISTONS ACQUIRE AGUIRRE IN TRADE FOR DANTLEY, PICK  </P> <P> Mark Aguirre, the Dallas Mavericks all-star forward, was traded Wednesday to  the Detroit Pistons in exchange for all-star forward Adrian Dantley and a No. 1  draft pick in 1991.  </P> <P> The deal would also give the Pistons second-round draft picks in 1989 and 1991  if the Mavericks reach the Western Conference finals.  </P> <P> The trade reunites Piston guard Isiah Thomas and Aguirre, who grew up together  in Chicago.  </P> <P> "I'm excited, I'm gone to join Isiah," Aguirre told the Associated Press.  "We've dreamed of being on the same team since we were in grade school. Finally  it comes to pass.  </P> <P> "I'm going to get out of here as soon as I can. I'm gone."  </P> <P> The Pistons are hoping that with Thomas as a motivator, the moody Aguirre can  help them reach the National Basketball Assn. finals for the second straight  season.  </P> <P> Although he was the leading scorer in Maverick history, Aguirre had worn out  his welcome after eight stormy seasons at Dallas, where he alienated his  teammates and reporters.  </P> <P> "The fans in Dallas were great, but I was misunderstood by the press," Aguirre  said. "I had a great relationship with the fans."  </P> <P> But the same cannot be said for his relationship with his teammates.  </P> <P> When the trade was announced, the Mavericks expressed relief.  </P> <P> "Yesterday was Valentine's Day and today should be an all-day party," Sam  Perkins, Maverick forward, told reporters. The Mavericks will miss Aguirre's  offensive spark, but not his emotional outbursts.  </P> <P> Rolando Blackman, Maverick guard said: "It's a big shame. Mark can be such a  great player when he wants to be and he can make you so much better. But if he  doesn't want to be here, it takes away from us."  </P> <P> The Mavericks were rocked by dissension in January, during which they had a  4-11 record. Aguirre's attitude was generally blamed for the worst month in  team history. He clashed repeatedly with Coach John MacLeod.  </P> <P> "Mark's attitude made it difficult for the team," MacLeod said. " It was a big  problem. We think Adrian Dantley will be a great asset to this team. We're  going to get him the ball a lot, more than he got it in Detroit. He's the kind  of player who wants the ball when the game is close in the fourth period. He  has produced many times in those situations."  </P> <P> Can Detroit handle the explosive Aguirre? Aren't the Pistons worried about his  disrupting the team chemistry?  </P> <P> "I don't like to prejudge anybody," Detroit Coach Chuck Daly said. "I've heard  all these things about Mark, but we heard the same things about Dantley and  Adrian has been very professional.  </P> <P> "Aguirre is a major league offensive player. He can shoot the three-pointers  and run the floor and he's a pretty good passer, too. He's the same type of  player as Dantley, and he's four years younger. That's the bottom line."  </P> <P> Dantley, who reportedly clashed with Daly and Thomas, was not happy with the  trade, which had been widely anticipated.  </P> <P> "I can't talk right now, but I will later," Dantley told Detroit reporters. "I  told you (the trade) was just going to be a matter of time. It has nothing to  do with basketball."  </P> <P> Asked if the trade involved a personality conflict, Dantley said: "It's a  management decision. Players do not have any input."  </P> <P> Thomas refused to comment.  </P> <P> Economic considerations may also have been a factor. Dantley earns $1.2 million  and Aguirre earns a reported $700,000.  </P> <P> However, Maverick owner Donald Carter had agreed to renegotiate with Aguirre,  promising him $1.4 million, beginning next month.  </P> <P> Aguirre is expected to join the Pistons at Sacramento for a game against the  Kings tonight.  </P> <P> Dallas will start Terry Tyler in place of Aguirre for tonight's game against  Miami and work Dantley into the lineup slowly.  </P></p>

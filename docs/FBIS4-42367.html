			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Delphine Girard: "Unemployment Is Still </F> Increasing, But More Slowly"]    [Text] "I would not be surprized if unemployment reaches a  threshold in the coming months and I do not exclude the  possibility that it starts to decline before the end of the  year." April's unemployment figures, published yesterday, seem  to confirm the forecasts of Labor Minister Michel Giraud.    The number of job seekers is continuing to increase, up 0.1  percent last month, with 4,900 more people registered with the  ANPE [National Employment Agency] in one month. But the rate of  increase is far slower than last year. Over the first four  months of the year 23,500 more job seekers were registered  compared with 111,100 in the same period in 1993. "The average  monthly increase is about 6,000, whereas it was 30,000 a month  last year," the labor minister said, very pleased. "I will  never forget the first unemployment figure I had to discuss when  I took over my ministerial position last year," Giraud said.  "In a single month, 45,600 more unemployed people: That was  the figure for April 1993."    The government has no doubts in explaining the improvement.  "Companies are starting to anticipate the effect of growth," the  labor minister explained. The recovery in activity, shown by  the improvement in the main economic indicators, is pushing some  companies to again recruit new workers, as confirmed by the  large increase in job offers sent to the ANPE in recent months.  The job offers recorded by the Agency are up 46.3 percent from  a year ago. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who had said he  wished to see unemployment stabilized before the end of the  year, is in the process of winning his bet.    But no doubt one should be careful not to cry victory  prematurely. Certainly, given the importance of employment in  the presidential election debates, the government will make  considerable use of any improvement in unemployment figures in  the coming months. For example the announcement of a net  increase of 20,000 salaried jobs in the first quarter has been  commented in detail by the government.    The news was certainly important because, since 1990,  salaried employment had fallen continually. But it cannot paper  over the fact that France lost close to 500,000 jobs in 1992 and  1993. The slower rate of increase in unemployment must not hide  the large number of job seekers stagnating in the ANPE's files.  France had 3,325,800 job seekers at the end of April in figures  adjusted for seasonal variations. Unemployment currently  affects 12.3 percent of the working population. An analysis of  the statistics shows that the situation remains extremely  fragile.    Whereas the number of people coming on to the ANPE's books  due to economic redundancy had been dropping since summer 1993,  in April it suddenly increased by 9.3 percent to affect 43,600  people (seasonally corrected figures).    Experts are wondering about the real impact of the recovery  on unemployment. Past experience shows that it generally takes  between nine and 18 months before renewed growth translates into  new jobs. There is no doubt that the panoply of measures taken  by the Balladur government since summer 1993 to encourage youth  employment, including bonuses and social security charge  reductions, has pushed companies to anticipate the recovery.  Nor should the additional funding granted to increase the CES  (employment solidarity contracts) be forgotten.    But these policies have another side to them. By targeting  aid on young people, the government is discouraging the  employment of older people. In April job applications by young  people aged below 25 dropped by 0.7 percent whereas they  increased by 0.5 percent by people aged between 25 and 49. The  increase in long-term unemployment is just as worrying. The  number of job seekers who have been on the ANPE's books for more  than a year has increased to 1,142,500, in other words an  increase of 1.6 percent over a month and 23 percent over a year.  Long-term unemployed today represent 34.7 percent of all job  seekers and the average duration of unemployment is 379 days, or  28 days more than a year ago.    The government cannot ignore the gravity of the situation.  Even if renewed growth does bring some improvements on the  employment front in the coming months, the advent of a two-tier  population with an increasing number of the socially excluded  threatens the long-term cohesion of French society.</p>

The  removal of former Deputy Prime Ministers Gaydar and Fyodorov,  whom Ryabov sees as having been "marginal figures in the  cabinet," from the cabinet of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin in no  way means the end of the reforms: "Those are guaranteed by  Yeltsin and the Constitution."    However, Ryabov, who was vice president of the Supreme  Soviet  under putsch leader Khasbulatov last year, makes it perfectly  clear that radical reforms, especially those involving the  privatization of state plants, do not have much of a future. In  the future, social considerations must come first. The  privatization of state plants is also one of the main problems  for Ryabov. Thus, the property ownership issue also has not  been resolved: Which elements of a plant (the land, the  machinery) belong to whom (the local community, the province, or  the federation)?    The parliamentary elections in December did produce  surprising results, but the many votes for the radical  right-wing Liberal Democrats did not reflect political reality,  they do not, above all, permit a general conclusion to be drawn  that there is a radical nationalist trend in Russia. In his  opinion, too much importance is being attributed to LDP [Liberal  Democratic Party] leader Zhirinovskiy, especially abroad,  although Ryabov also concedes that "in view of their history,  Germans react with more sensitivity to political anomalies than  other Europeans." Whereas Zhirinvoskiy was not that well-known  among the Russians before the elections, "today, most Russians  are not that indifferent."    According to Ryabov -- whose function roughly corresponds to  that of the German federal election manager -- following the  elections, his authorities began to check how parties' and  groups' election campaigns were financed. He is familiar with  Western media reports about the LDP election campaign being  financed from abroad, and the LDP will also be questioned.  "Should the investigation reveal any irregularities, then that  will appear in a report to be given to parliament, and it is  then up to parliament to pass resolutions on measures to be  applied against the parties concerned." That will happen before  June of this year, because provincial and municipal elections  are to be held in June.    Ryabov defends unreservedly the foreign policy course being  pursued by the government and President Yeltsin, who in recent  months has pursued a massive campaign against admission to NATO  for the Baltic states as well as the Central and East European  states of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. The Partnership  for Peace formula that the Western side has now come up with is  also satisfactory for Russia, whereas admission to NATO for  those countries would constitute "a threat to Russia and its  interests." He termed the demands for NATO protection the  product of "a hysterical campaign against Russia in the Baltic  and East Europe countries."</p>

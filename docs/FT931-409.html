			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Linread returns to black with Pounds 1.32m LINREAD, the Birming-ham-based fasteners and precision components group, last year consolidated its financial position, with pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.32m, compared with losses of Pounds 2.2m. With earnings per share for the 12 months to December 31 of 7.26p, contrasting with losses of 13.84p, the group is resuming what it called 'a progressive dividend policy' and lifting its final to 2.25p. This brings the total for the year to 3.75p, against 3.5p which was paid from reserves. Selling primarily in the aerospace and automotive markets, the group saw turnover slip from Pounds 39.7m to Pounds 37.8m. Sales were slightly lower to aerospace customers, where margins were lower, but higher on the automotive side, where they showed a small increase. Under a new management team, Linread has over the last year driven towards greater productivity; the number of employees has been reduced 9 per cent to 755, but the average level of sales per employee has grown 20 per cent. Borrowings have been restructured on to a longer term basis and gearing has been reduced from 59 per cent to 29 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NASA PROTECTS TELESCOPE DURING DELAY  </P> <P> The $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope, NASA's most valuable payload, will be  exposed to minimal contamination inside Discovery while it awaits a second  launch attempt, the agency said Friday.  </P> <P> "We've kept this vehicle extremely clean," said Fred Wojtalik, a NASA project  manager.  </P> <P> Slightly more dust is expected to settle on the telescope's 94-inch mirror, the  finest ever made, Wojtalik said. But the additional debris still will be well  within contamination limits.  </P> <P> "We've done all the cautionary things that we can," he said. "We're going to  get some degradation. Some particles are going to come into the Hubble that we  just can't avoid."  </P> <P> Once the telescope reaches orbit, scientists want no more than 5% of the  surface of Hubble's 94-inch mirror covered with dust or other debris, Wojtalik  said.  </P> <P> A 2% rate of contamination was expected had Discovery been launched on time  Tuesday, Wojtalik said. That is expected to rise to 2.1% as a result of the  delay until the new launch date, April 25.  </P> <P> Clean air was being circulated inside Discovery's sealed payload bay Friday to  reduce contamination of the telescope. NASA planned to open the payload bay  Saturday so the telescope's nickel-hydrogen batteries can be removed and taken  to a Kennedy Space Center laboratory for recharging.  </P> <P> A protective cover will not be placed over the telescope's aperture door  because the procedure is difficult and might result in even more contamination  or damage, Wojtalik said.  </P> <P> Discovery's launch was postponed four minutes before liftoff Tuesday when one  of the shuttle's three auxiliary power units failed. Technicians will replace  the unit with a new one this weekend.  </P> <P> It will be the first time NASA has ever replaced an auxiliary power unit at the  launch pad. As a result, the space agency has told technicians to take their  time and that "there is no schedule pressure there."  </P> <P> Hubble is to orbit 380 miles high, studying stars and galaxies so distant that  their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years. Scientists  believe the universe was created about 15 billion years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Marco Tavasani: "Fiar Overcomes the Crisis in </F> the Sector with Increased Foreign Orders"]    [Text] The strong contraction in military aircraft sales  that is being felt all over the world has pushed Fiar (a  Milan-based company of the Finmeccania group) to explore the new  market of upgrading electronic equipment aboard fighter aircraft  in the sector. This is a decision that the Italian company made  about 10 years ago when the first signs of difficulties were  being felt in the defense industry. This field is characterized  by extremely long design schedules and full aircraft operations:  it may take up to 10 years from the date the program is  launched to the date of installation on a jet. And the  never-ending Eurofighter 2000 story is a wide confirmation of  this fact. Therefore Fiar, anticipating the current market  crisis, decided to invest in the avionic radar sector to upgrade  a vast family of jets thereby lengthening the operational life  of aircraft in an area (that of electronics) that characterizes  a fighter aircraft, allowing it to compete almost on a par with  more modern, but certainly more expensive machines. By pursuing  and achieving this objective, Fiar ranks as one of the very few  leading companies in this sector worldwide. Within the next 10  years these companies will share an international market  currently estimated to be worth 15 trillion lire. The most  recent Fiar success dates to a few weeks ago when Pakistan  assigned the Milan-based company a 90-billion-lire order to  upgrade the radars installed on its F7 fighter aircraft (the  Chinese version of the MIG-21) with another 50-billion-lire  option. And once again with Pakistan, Fiar is negotiating a new  order to upgrade the Mirage line. However the electronic  company marketing division is also negotiating interesting  contracts with other countries in South-East Asia for the sale  of a radar that derives from the Grifo model, also suitable for  the U.S. Northrop F-5 fighter aircraft. Last year 76 percent of  Fiar's orders came from overseas markets. This figure has  permitted the company to cover a large part of the gap that  comes from the national market whose budget is at survival  levels following the constant cuts made by the last government  budgets to the item on the upgrading of the Italian Air Force.  This is a painful area for Italian companies, which have seen  the third phase (of the six scheduled) of the order for the new  AMX fighter-bomber aircraft (Alenia, Aermacchi, Embraer)  stopped, without giving any go-ahead on the program to upgrade  the jet with the Grifo X Plus radar.    Fiar is currently developing the ECR90 radar for the  Eurofighter 2000 with the British company GEC Marconi Avionics,  DARA [German Aerospace Agency] of Germany, and Insiel of Spain,  with a 26 percent share. Moreover since June 1992 Fiar has  been the leading contractor in an order for the development of  the Pirate infrared system (once again for the new European  fighter). It is an extremely advanced piece of electro-optical  equipment which, thanks to a particular data and signal  processing capacity, can operate either as a fighter radar or in  an entirely passive way, that is, without emitting radiation  that can be detected by enemy sensors, in addition to allowing  pilots to fly in the most absolute obscurity without the aid of  any external reference points. And in the final stage of this  program Fiar will develop a system that will send the images  from the infrared system to a visor on the pilot's helmet and  present television-quality images of the scene scanned by Pirate  directly in front of his eyes. These programs, combined with  others such as those for space equipment and new sonars for the  navy, enabled Fiar to achieve 225.5 billion lire in revenues  last year with a 344.5-billion-lire portfolio of orders and 57  billion lire allocated for research and development. Even this  year, business should reach 1992 levels, but with a stronger  share of foreign orders.</p>

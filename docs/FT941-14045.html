			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Syrian president's son dies in car crash Bassel al-Assad, the eldest son of President Hafez al-Assad and widely assumed to be the Syrian leader's political heir, died yesterday in a car crash, according to an official statement from Damascus. The statement announced the death 'with deep grief and sadness' of the 33-year-old, the oldest of Mr Assad's four sons, in a 'tragic accident'. Bassel, who was being groomed for a leading political role in Syria, graduated from Damascus University with an engineering degree in 1985. He spoke several languages and was an accomplished horseman, winning a gold medal at the 1987 Mediterranean games held in Lattakia, northern Syria. He also served as an army officer, training as a parachutist and reaching the rank of major. However, despite his increasing appearances at the presidential palace from the mid-1980s, he is not thought to have held any central political responsibility within the Syrian regime. Many observers in Damascus believe that in the event of his succession to the presidency, real power would have resided elsewhere among senior military officers. His death is certain to raise the awkward question of Mr Assad's succession, however, with the 63-year-old president far from perfect health.</p>

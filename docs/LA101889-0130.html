			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI: FLAWED SECONDARY LEAVES RAMS LESS THAN PERFECT  </P> <P> Like giddy school children, they embraced, celebrating the most unlikely of Ram  comebacks, basking in its total improbability.  </P> <P> It was a sight to see: Ram executive vice president John Shaw -- a man not  given to these sorts of public outbursts -- and team counsel Jay Zygmunt  dancing an impromptu victory jig in the glass-encased visiting owners' box at  Rich Stadium in Orchard Park, N.Y., in the wee hours of Tuesday. They laughed.  They hugged. They let the joy of a 6-0 record wash over them.  </P> <P> Flipper Anderson had just plucked a wobbly Jim Everett pass out of the foggy  air, slipped through two would-be Buffalo Bill tacklers and then raced 78 yards  for a miracle touchdown and a seemingly insurmountable 20-16 lead with only  1:22 remaining in the game. Everett raised his arms in triumph. Ram teammates  began their 82-second countdown.  </P> <P> Eighty-two seconds. Is that all it took for Buffalo quarterback Frank Reich,  who had never started a National Football League game, to dissect the Ram  nickel defense like a science-class frog? Can it be that simple to complete  seven consecutive passes (nine, if you count two in a row from the previous  Buffalo scoring drive) and travel 64 yards against the league's only undefeated  team?  </P> <P> Ask Shaw and Zygmunt, who must have felt a little silly as they watched Reich  zip a pass to an open Andre Reed in the end zone as the clock clicked down to  16 seconds.  </P> <P> Ask cornerback LeRoy Irvin, who was reduced to offering gracious postgame  compliments of Reich, the same quarterback who had completed five of 15  first-half passes for a scant 33 yards and an interception.  </P> <P> And ask the Bills, who probably still can't believe their good fortune.  </P> <P> This was a Ram loss that could have been, should have been, a Ram victory.  Somehow, though, it slipped away and the Rams now find themselves, much like  everyone else, less than perfect. It is a sobering thought, what with the  apparently rejuvenated New Orleans Saints on their way, followed by Ram trips  to Chicago and Minnesota and then an Anaheim appointment with the New York  Giants.  </P> <P> Looking back, you wonder, as must Coach John Robinson, how it all happened. How  do you explain a defeat against a team that was missing one of its Pro Bowl  linebackers (Shane Conlan), its Pro Bowl quarterback (Jim Kelly) and one of its  starting cornerbacks (Derrick Burroughs)? And since when do championship teams,  such as the Rams aspire to be, blow leads in what amounted to 66 seconds?  </P> <P> It was simple, actually.  </P> <P> First, you ask Ram running back Greg Bell about his return to Buffalo, the  organization that happily included him in the Eric Dickerson deal two years  ago. Bell, as is his custom, offered his frank and unedited version of the  Bills. Kudos, they weren't.  </P> <P> The quotes, as they always do, somehow found their way to the Bills' locker  room. In the cloistered world that is pro football, mild words became insults,  insults became motivational tools. Thus, when the Bills' defense arrived at  Rich Stadium Monday evening, they did so with Bell in mind.  </P> <P> Result: 44 yards in 21 carries (zero yards in the second half). And no matter  how hard Bell tried to downplay his pregame remarks, they had an effect. He  might not have incited a riot, but he helped give the Bills a common purpose,  which was to shut Bell up and shut him out. They managed to do both.  </P> <P> "He helped a little bit," nose tackle Fred Smerlas said, trying to suppress a  grin. "We realized we weren't playing together."  </P> <P> Next, the Rams squandered at least three opportunities to take advantage of  wonderful field position, a valuable commodity in a game controlled partly by  the whims of the weather. The Rams began drives on the Buffalo 46- and 33-yard  lines, as well as their own 48 . . . and came away with nothing. In addition,  Ram defensive backs let several likely interceptions slip through their hands.  </P> <P> This was the kind of game Robinson feared the most: His famed Ram running  attack was rendered ineffective, as evidenced by the time of possession (13 of  their 16 offensive series lasted less than three minutes); the Ram passing  attack was hindered by a cold October rain, and the Ram pass defense, ranked  28th in the league, proved perhaps that statistics don't lie.  </P> <P> Ram followers will point to a pair of questionable non-pass interference calls  in the Bills' end zone late in the third quarter. Replays seemed to show that  receiver Henry Ellard had been tugged and turned by defenders on two successive  pass attempts by Everett. A penalty would have placed the ball on the one-yard  line and almost ensured a Ram touchdown.  </P> <P> And how fortunate, they might add, that two of Scott Norwood's three field  goals barely squeezed inside the uprights or edged over the crossbar.  </P> <P> None of this matters now, except that maybe a lesson has been learned by the  Rams. It is: Victory dances mean nothing without a win as a partner.  </P></p>

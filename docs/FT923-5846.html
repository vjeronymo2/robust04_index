			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / High activity forecast for N Sea THE UK North Sea will be an area of substantial production and activity for at least 25 years, although jobs will continue to be lost, according to a report released yesterday by Grampian Regional Council. The thirteenth Update of Oil and Gas Prospects, from the council's department of economic development and planning, says more than 90 new fields are likely to be developed in the next 20 years. This would support nearly 50,000 jobs in the Grampian region, which includes Aberdeen, throughout the 1990s. About 15 new fields will come on stream in the next two and a half years. A lower level of construction work and drilling in the next two years means, however, there could be more redundancies to add to the 1,500 jobs lost in Grampian in the past year. While 52,500 workers are employed in the oil and gas sector, this is likely to fall below 50,000 by 2001 and 46,000 by 2006. New fields will require less offshore labour, with increasing use of automated and subsea structures, but Aberdeen should continue to attract management functions onshore. This could lead to a higher quality of locally based employment, which would boost the rest of the economy. The positive outlook in the report contrasts with more gloomy forecasts after recent lay-offs at construction yards. Nearly 1,300 redundancies were announced at the McDermott Scotland yard in Ardersier, near Inverness, last month. North Sea output jumped more than 16 per cent in July as offshore maintenance activity ended, according to the Royal Bank of Scotland's monthly oil index. Update of Oil and Gas Prospects.

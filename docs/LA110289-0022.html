			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAGAZINES: ECOLOGY PROPHET FIGHTS FOR LAND  </P> <P> For centuries, Americans have treated our precious soil like dirt. A terrific  cover story in the November Atlantic Monthly warns that we had better clean up  our act fast.  </P> <P> Around the world, farmers and technologists and biologists are working to stop  soil erosion and water pollution and to advance the science of sustainable  agriculture -- a way of farming that doesn't deplete the Earth's scandalously  overused resources.  </P> <P> Wes Jackson, a geneticist who created the Land Institute in Kansas, is "the  most radical of America's agricultural prophets," according to Atlantic writer  Evan Eisenberg. In profiling Jackson, Eisenberg creates an intricate,  intriguing portrait of the awkward -- some say catastrophic -- way American  farming methods intersect the natural ecology.  </P> <P> The statistics on the damage inflicted on America's topsoil by tilling and  planting crops each year are staggering: "A third of our farmland topsoil,  accumulated over millennia, is gone. For every bushel of corn that Iowa grows,  it sheds at least two bushels of soil."  </P> <P> Because the soil that hasn't washed or blown away is of poorer quality, farmers  have resorted to chemical fertilizers and pesticides to improve productivity.  </P> <P> But this use of fossil fuels is an inefficient use of energy and just plain  ineffective.  </P> <P> "In 1948, at the dawn of the chemical age, American farmers used 15 million  pounds of insecticides and lost 7% of their crops to insects," the article  states. "Today they use 125 million pounds and lose 13%."  </P> <P> The prairie, on the other hand, with its naturally diverse mixture of plants  and root systems can defend itself against predators and disease. It is  superior in other ways, as well, which is why many modern agronomists believe  that, "Wilderness is the standard against which agriculture should be judged."  </P> <P> Jackson has a wild vision of how the two can be combined. As Eisenberg writes,  "From the point of view of the ecologist, the prairie is doing everything  right. From the point of view of the hungry ecologist, it has a serious flaw.  What Jackson has in mind is a prairie that can feed the world."  </P> <P> He and his students and colleagues at the land institute are working on what,  technically, would be termed a herbaceous seed-bearing perennial polyculture.  Jackson calls it "a domestic prairie."  </P> <P> While Jackson considers genetic engineering to be the Great Satan, he is  willing to make some compromises with biotechnology in his quest to achieve a  more natural way of farming. But he wants to move slowly.  </P> <P> Along the way, in this ambling Chautauqua of an article, Eisenberg describes a  lecture Jackson gave to a group, in which he carefully detailed nine categories  of ecological trouble that biotechnology might unleash. At the end of the talk,  Jackson said to the group: "Now look, you people worked very hard to follow me,  but you couldn't stay with me, could you?"  </P> <P> The answer was no. And that, Jackson told them, was his point precisely. This  is tough stuff, but stuff that laymen as well as scientists need to understand  fully. So far, they don't, yet we proceed like a drunken farmer driving a  tractor at full throttle. "This is a threat to democracy!" Jackson told his  audience.  </P> <P> "Heroic cleverness" in the way we deal with the natural world has got us into  many of our present environmental predicaments. Jackson says that it's time for  people to call for a moratorium on biotechnological brilliance, to pause and  catch their breath. He knows that's unthinkable in this culture. But still, he  believes it's imperative that we "Call time out and say, 'Let's think about  it.' "  </P> <P> Other noteworthy articles in this issue include James Fallows' discussion of  what we have to learn from Asian nations and an interesting analysis of modern  suburbia by Nicholas Lemann.  </P> <P> California Issues a Report Card for Judges  </P> <P> Judge not lest ye be judged, the saying goes. But if you pull down a paycheck  as a professional judge, it only seems fair that you be held up to judgment  yourself.  </P> <P> California magazine put this state's judges before a jury of their  justice-system peers -- other judges, lawyers, commissioners and cops. Backed  by evidence gathered from court records and the Commission on Judicial  Performance, the magazine's reporters found seven judges guilty of wrongs  ranging from simple arrogance to incompetence and malice.  </P> <P> Catalogued in the November issue, the "insider's brief on the state's wackiest  court jesters" includes Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Henry Patrick Nelson,  who allegedly told whispering spectators he would have them shot; Bruce William  Dodds, an apparently misogynic Santa Barbara County judge; and Ventura County  Municipal Court Judge John J. Hunter, who sentenced a man to 930 days in jail  for traffic violations without allowing him time to prove his assertion -- a  correct one, it turned out -- that the tickets weren't his.  </P> <P> In the same issue, California puts the state's water on trial, and finds that  in many places, including Los Angeles areas served by the Metropolitan Water  District, traces of aluminum sulfate, put into water to remove particles, may  be contributing to Alzheimer's disease in the population. Meanwhile, there is  no state requirement that bottled water be tested for this chemical.  </P> <P> Could Real Estate Be Nodding Off?  </P> <P> The sky may not be falling, but at least a few naysayers claim that  California's real estate may be on the verge of taking a dive, or at least a  long nap.  </P> <P> The Oct. 30 Forbes magazine gives voice to contrarian analysts such as Timothy  Hurckes, who speculates that by 1991, the market -- especially at the high end,  especially in certain areas -- will be in for a bit of trouble.  </P> <P> And that may also mean trouble for developers and speculators and the  institutions that gave them loans.  </P> <P> The idea of a price dip goes against the common wisdom of those who believe  California's diversified economy will continue to support rising real estate  values.  </P> <P> But those who see a downturn have their reasons, too. Pollution and traffic are  driving off a lot of folks, they say, and of those who stay, only 16% can  afford homes at today's prices.  </P></p>

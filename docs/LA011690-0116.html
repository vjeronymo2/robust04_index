			<p><P> January 16, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MONTOYA BLAMES AIDES FOR EVENTS THAT LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION AGAINST HIM  </P> <P> State Sen. Joseph Montoya, on trial on federal corruption charges, testified in  his own behalf today that aides either intentionally or by mistake are at fault  for his legal problems.  </P> <P> The 50-year-old Whittier Democrat, obviously nervous, was the first witness in  what his attorneys say is likely to be the last week of the trial.  </P> <P> Under questioning by his attorney, Montoya began his testimony by blaming one  of the eight incidents of alleged wrongdoing on a fired aide, Jerry Asher, now  a Tulare high school teacher.  </P> <P> Asher, testifying earlier as a prosecution witness, told the jury that a  lobbyist, Norbert Dall, approached him in 1983 in a Capitol hallway and asked  how much it would cost to get Montoya's vote on a bill.  </P> <P> Asher testified that he brought the request to Montoya, who told him his vote  would cost $2,500.  </P> <P> Asher said he told Dall that he should give Montoya $3,000, keeping $500 for  himself.  </P> <P> Later, Asher said, he was fired by Montoya after the senator discovered he was  accepting kitchen appliances as gifts from former state Republican Chairman  Mike Montgomery to spy on Montoya.  </P> <P> Montoya denied receiving money from Dall and said the first he learned about  the $500 that Asher admitted he kept was just before his trial began late last  year.  </P> <P> Montoya also blamed another episode on a former aide, Amiel Jaramillo, who was  indicted along with Montoya and is awaiting trial.  </P> <P> Jamie Hundt, a San Diego businesswoman testifying for the prosecution, had said  Jaramillo told her about a 1988 bill that would make her mail-order contact  lens business illegal.  </P> <P> She had earlier told the jury that Jaramillo steered her to lobbyist David Kim,  who demanded a $20,000 fee and said a $3,000 campaign contribution to Montoya  would ensure the bill's delay.  </P> <P> Montoya never received any money from Hundt but agreed to the delay at  Jaramillo's urging because opposition was developing to the bill.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Michael Sands produced a letter Montoya said he wrote to the  Senate Rules Committee requesting the delay because of "insufficient notice to  the public."  </P> <P> Later, Montoya testified, he delayed the whole contact-lens issue until a  hearing when the Legislature was not in session because "it seemed to need that  kind of attention."  </P> <P> He said a hearing was never held because the bill's author, Sen. Dan  McCorquodale (D-San Jose), "seemed to lose interest." A similar bill was  introduced in 1989 by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim).  </P> <P> Montoya conceded that another aide, Steve English, prepared a staff analysis of  Seymour's bill that noted there was no opposition, even though Hundt and her  husband engineered a letter-writing campaign against the bill among thousands  of their California customers.  </P> <P> "Well, there was a mistake on his (English's) part," Montoya testified.  </P> <P> English and Kim have refused to testify as defense witnesses, claiming their  Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  </P></p>

At the same time, the  parliament has rejected the government program for the  republic's socioeconomic development and monetary policy for the  current year, which were opposed by the "Dashnaktsutyun"  Armenian Revolutionary Union and the National Democratic Union  factions. In addition, the "Dashnaktsutyun" faction proposed  that the parliament's standing commission on legal matters draw  up a draft on reallocating the powers of the Supreme Soviet and  the president.    The opposition has accused the government of lacking a clear  model of the republic's economic development and the principles  of improving the government system, and also specific social  safety nets.    The parliamentary debate has shown that the opposition  itself  lacks a specific program to lift the republic out of the crisis.  For all the abundance of criticism, no viable alternative to  Bagratyan's policy has been proposed. In the view of some  observers, the opposition acts according to the principle "Let's  topple the government first, and then we will see." According  to a local independent newspaper, "in case events unfold this  way the people risk choosing between two evils." During the  discussion, some opposition deputies have made so radical  proposals (for instance, on concentrating all the state's  financial reserves in the hands of one institution) that the  prime minister accused them of calling for "economic fascism."    In Bagratyan's view, even in the current difficult  conditions, with the minimum resources available, the government  may improve macroeconomic indicators by 15-17 percent.</p>

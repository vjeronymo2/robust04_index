			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Steetley downgrades its French reserves STEETLEY, which is fighting a Pounds 600m takeover bid from Redland, its rival building materials group, yesterday published its final defence document in which it stressed the high earnings potential of its US and European businesses. The document, however, reveals that the group has been forced to cut Pounds 40m from the book value of its French operations following an independent revaluation. It says that a reappraisal of reserves owned by Gobitta, the French aggregates group for which it agreed to pay FFr850m in 1990, had revealed that there were 94m tonnes, including 79m tonnes of sand and gravel. At the time of the acquisition Steetley said the reserves of sand and gravel were nearer 150m tonnes. The revaluation of assets produced a net asset value per share of 375p, rising to 394p if the value to Redland of Steetley's Pounds 29m surplus advance corporation tax is included. This compares with a bid price worth 386p a share at last night's closing prices. Steetley said that French construction activity was forecast to grow by an average of 2.5 per cent a year between 1992 and 1996. It said cost savings as a result of rationalising the French operations and lower raw material costs would produce savings of Pounds 8m in 1993 and Pounds 16m in 1994. It argued that Redland's offer did not take into account the benefits of savings or the potential for earnings growth in the UK, US and Spain as construction markets moved out of recession. It said that a 15 per cent increase in sales volume in the UK would more than double this year's budgeted profits. Mr Richard Miles, Steetley chief executive, said his company's earnings growth had consistently outstripped that of Redland during the past decade. 'Redland's bid does not even start to value this company's future based on the ability of its management to produce an outperformance from its high quality assets.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 21 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The  Japanese minister of justice issued an "order" to keep a closer  watch on the movements of the General Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), saying "this is demanded by the  situation". And the general director of the public security  investigation agency cried that "it is necessary to take more  perfect measures for investigation into the movements of  Chongnyon than ever before".    In this connection, Paek Han-ki, vice-chairman of the  Central  Standing Committee of Chongnyon, issued a statement on June 21.    Pointing out that this revealed the undisguised intention of  the Japanese Government authorities to antagonize the DPRK and  suppress and control Chongnyon at any cost, under the pretext of  the fictitious "suspected nuclear development", Paek Han-ki said:    "Such anachronistic words rolled off their tongues freely at  a time when efforts are being made to solve the nuclear issue  and ease the tensions on the Korean peninsula through dialogue  between the DPRK and the USA. This is intended to aggravate the  tension, going against the situation, and is an intolerable  hostile act toward the Korean people and Chongnyon.    "The Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon sternly  protests  and denounces with bitter national indignation the hostile  policy of the Japanese Government authorities to suppress and  control Chongnyon at whatever cost.    "We strongly demand that the Japanese Government  authorities,  particularly the public security authorities, immediately  withdraw the "instructions" and stop the hostile policy toward  the DPRK and the suppressive policy against Chongnyon."</p>

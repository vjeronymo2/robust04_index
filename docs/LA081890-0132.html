			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;  </P> <P> BOXING GYM TO PUT ON 14 MATCHES  </P> <P> Mario Sanchez wants to help youngsters caught up in the tragic web of drug  abuse -- and he hopes the way out might be through the boxing ring.  </P> <P> On Sunday, the fight against drugs will unfold at Independence Park at 801 W.  Valencia Drive in Fullerton where a 14-bout amateur boxing show will be staged.  </P> <P> Presented by the Fullerton Community Boxing Gym and the Fullerton Police  Department, the event is billed as "Knock Out Drugs," and is expected to  attract boxers from outside the county and state.  </P> <P> Weigh-in is scheduled to begin at 12:30 p.m. and matches are set to begin at 3  p.m.  </P> <P> Sanchez, 30, a former boxer, operates the gym in addition to his full-time job  at the Miller Brewing Co. The gym is open Monday through Friday in the evening.  </P> <P> "Fullerton is a very mixed city," Sanchez said. "There is a lot of money here,  but there's also some poor areas. Nevertheless, drugs are a problem in all  segments of the city."  </P> <P> While in the gym, Sanchez said strict training is emphasized to the youngsters.  </P> <P> "Boxing is a very disciplined sport," Sanchez said, adding that anyone under 18  years old can use the facility for free. "We tell the kids there's no room for  drugs or alcohol."  </P> <P> About 34 people now use the gym, with ages ranging from 11 to 25. Mike  Rodrigues, 11 -- who along with Paul Colby, 23, of Anaheim Hills, will be  representing the Fullerton gym in the matches -- has been boxing since he was 8  years old. He makes it a point to get to the gym at least five days a week.  </P> <P> "I guess I'm a little nervous about the fight," said Rodrigues, who lives in  Anaheim. "I like to work out at the Fullerton gym. Mario is a good trainer, and  I think he really cares about the kids."  </P> <P> Weighing in at 83 pounds, Rodrigues said he would like to pursue boxing at a  professional level one day, and is thankful the gym is there.  </P> <P> "I don't know what I'd be doing if the gym wasn't there," Rodrigues said. "I  think it really helps me to stay away from things like drugs."  </P> <P> Mona Dean, spokeswoman for the Fullerton Police Department, said Sanchez has  really made a difference in how the gym relates to the youngsters.  </P> <P> "It seems Mario's objective of incorporating the kids is a good move," said  Dean, who noted that the Police Department had printed up the flyer for the  boxing matches. The department and Neighborhood Watch, a community group that  works with police, jointly gave $1,500 and the trophy for the boxing event.  </P> <P> Founded in 1974, the Fullerton Community Gym has enjoyed some success in  attracting the area's older boxers, Sanchez said. However, after taking over as  director nine months ago, Sanchez noticed the lack of boxers under 25.  </P> <P> "I thought the gym should put more emphasis on the young kids who need  something like this in their life," Sanchez said. "From my experience, boxing  is a great way to keep a kid occupied and teach self-discipline, teamwork and  self-esteem."  </P> <P> In addition to helping increase youth's role in the gym, Sanchez helped bail  the complex out of some financial problems by using $900 of his own money. He  also was able to lease the gym for free from the parks department.  </P> <P> "I eventually want to make the gym completely self-sufficient," Sanchez said.  "I want the gym to be an important part of some of these kids' lives. Someone  has to do it, so it might as well be me." ERIK HAMILTON  </P></p>

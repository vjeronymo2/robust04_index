			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Observer: Not so chummy At first sight the battle for Midland Bank seems to be getting ever so cosy. Lloyds Bank has hired GJW to do its political lobbying, while its rival, the Hongkong Bank, has now engaged Lowe Bell Communications to fight its corner. Once upon a time GJW and Lowe Bell were all part of the same Frank Lowe media empire. And although Sir Tim Bell, Mrs Thatcher's favourite spin doctor, has bought out Lowe Bell, Lowe Group still retains a 20 per cent stake and so benefits both ways. Nevertheless, one wonders what happened to that no- compete clause whereby GJW and Lowe Bell are supposed to work together rather than against each other. This is the first time that Sir Tim has challenged his old partners.</p>

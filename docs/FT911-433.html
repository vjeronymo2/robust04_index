			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / A fight for power in the generation game: The row over rules governing companies producing their own electricity A GARDENER who sold a few extra tomatoes to his local shop would be upset if the government set up an Office of Tomato Regulation which compelled him to register as a tomato producer, sell all his tomatoes to a central Tomato Pool, and buy back at a higher price any he wanted to eat. It sounds absurd. But, according to Mr David Green, director of the Combined Heat and Power Association, electricity generators might face just this situation by January. Mr Green's fears relate to the long dispute over the rules governing industrial companies which generate their own electricity on site. If some lobbyists, notably the 12 regional electricity companies in England and Wales, have their way, a chemical plant generating its own power and selling its surplus could be forced to sell all its electricity to the pool, or spot market. It would have to buy its own needs back at a higher price even though the electricity would never leave the site. The lobbyists argue that such sites receive all the benefits of being connected to the national grid, such as back-up if their own generators fail. These benefits are paid for by other electricity buyers, when they buy electricity from the pool, through 'uplift'. That is a margin on top of what is received by generators selling into the pool. The lobbyists say that industrialists wishing to sell their surplus should also pay uplift by putting all their power through the pool. Otherwise, they will ride on the backs of small consumers who ultimately pay for uplift through their electricity bills. The electricity industry representatives on the Pool Executive Committee (PEC), which runs the pool, must decide on a rule for on-site generators by July. If they cannot, the decision will pass to Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary. 'You can disconnect from the system,' says the representative of one regional company. 'But don't expect to stay connected and not pay.' He points out, however, that if everyone disconnected 'there would be a smaller number of people supporting the grid system, which could ultimately fall apart'. Mr Green replies that 'the regional companies want to discourage people from on-site generation because they lose out; they lose their wires business'. It is certainly true that on-site generation was one of the regional companies' anxieties at the time of privatisation. Industrialists considering on-site generation may admit that they should pay something for access to the grid - a flat charge is one possibility being discussed at the PEC. But their grievance runs deeper than the question of 'uplift'. Any company that generates power now for its own consumption, but buys or sells more than 10MW from the grid, counts as a generator under the new electricity regulations. It has to belong to the pool, and that does not just mean paying pool fees. 'We don't want a generation licence, and we don't want to be a generator - we don't want to be pool members,' says Mr Alan Belk, general energy systems manager at Air Products, which supplies on-site oxygen and other gases to companies such as British Steel. It would like to provide electricity, too, as part of an integrated process. But it would then count as a generator. It is not just a matter of costs, which could be around Pounds 1m extra on the Pounds 80m combined-heat-and-power (CHP) generator Air Products wants to build on-site at British Steel - a highly efficient system that would cut on-site energy costs considerably. If it generated enough electricity to count as a national generator 'we could be called on by the grid to stop generating if the national system was overloaded,' Mr Belk says. 'Or we could be called on to supply the grid.' Clearly, British Steel would be unhappy with on-site power with those risks attached. British Steel has produced a strongly worded submission to the PEC on the subject. It argues that regulations should not place at a disadvantage industrial users, who already bear the second-highest electrical energy costs in Europe. It seems unlikely that the regional electricity companies will win the debate over 'uplift', especially as Offer, the electricity watchdog, seems inclined to believe that their interpretation of the regulation is far-fetched, and is proposing a compromise fee for on-site generators. Even if the question of the fee is settled, other more vexing issues remain for companies such as Air Products. The CHP system Mr Belk plans could double generating efficiency at the British Steel site. In the Netherlands, where Air Products has a CHP scheme on a Rotterdam refinery site, it attracts a 25 per cent capital grant from the Dutch government. The UK government has also recognised CHP's environmental and energy efficiency benefits, and is committed to promoting its development at 120 identified industrial sites. But if on-site generators are forced to pay high charges and run high risks for their connection to the grid, the incentives for building such systems will be seriously diminished.</p>

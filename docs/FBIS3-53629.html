Four of the arrested were released after preliminary  interrogations, Colonel Reza Mohammadi, a law enforcement  officer based in central Tehran told IRNA.    Some ofthe detainees have confessed to having links with the  Iraq-based terrorist Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization (MKO), the  colonel said.    Shortly after the bomb blast at Ferdowsi Square an  unidentified caller who introduced herself as MKO spokesman in  Paris claimed responsibility for the bombing which injured three  passers-by, one critically.    The officer disclosed that some arms and ammunition have  also  been seized from those arrested.    He said because of the ongoing interrogation it was not  possible for him to identify the arrested people by name. But  he said they had acknowledged to have received instructions from  Baghdad and Paris to carry out sabotage activities throughout  Tehran.    MKO members, better known in Iran as monafeqin (hypocrites)  have launched a string of terrorist attacks since the fleeing to  Paris of Maryam Qajar Azadanlou, the third wife of MKO  ringleader Masoud Rajavi.    Among the terrorist attacks launched by MKO members were  hijacking of a passenger plane to Iraq, attacks on the French  Embassy and Air France office in Tehran, shooting at the British  Embassy and two bomb explosions in Tehran.    Commenting on the connection between the bomb blast at  Ferdowsi Square and the MKO, Mahmud Javadi, a political expert,  said:    "At present, MKO terrorists cannot leave Iraq without  getting  permission from the Baghdad regime and that Western countries  are reluctant to admit members of this criminal grouplet. So  the MKO seems to have decided to perpetrate such actions out of  helplessness."    Javadi said that the aim of the MKO in committing such  crimes was to convince the Baghdad regime that it was still able  to involve in sabotage actions inside Iran.</p>

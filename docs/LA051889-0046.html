			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: THE GOOD BOOK  </P> <P> "He who hath ears to hear, let him hear": The International Version of the  Bible will soon be available on compact disc. The 60-disc set will retail for  about $200 and is expected to be out by September. The set contains 75 hours of  narration and music and is being produced by LJ Productions in Newport Beach.  Producer Steve Johnson, who will also narrate, says the discs allow easy access  to passages. "If you'd like to listen to the fifth chapter of Matthew, you can  just queue it up." The Bible has previously appeared on record and tape and on  floppy disc and CD-ROM for home computers . . . not to mention the familiar  version where you turn the printed pages by hand.

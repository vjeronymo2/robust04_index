			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Siemens Given the opacity of Siemens' accounting, it is hard to say exactly what caused the worse-than-expected fall in pre-extraordinary profits in the year to end-September. But the figures undoubtedly reflect poor performance on its enormous investment portfolio, as well as continuing losses at Nixdorf and mounting price pressures in telecommunications. Greater segmental disclosure - due for the first time in December - will focus the spotlight on the group's structural and operating weaknesses. The details will highlight the fact that tough rationalisation is necessary if Siemens is to improve its lamentable earnings performance and restore its international competitiveness. So far, its approach to cost-cutting and restructuring looks kid-gloved compared with that of international competitors or even other large German industrial companies. The number of domestic employees fell a modest 7 per cent in the past financial year. The decision to sell the US pace-maker business earlier this year was a step towards defining core businesses, but full-scale restructuring looks as distant as ever. Siemens suffers from the sheer scale of its liquid resources. They cushion the group from the pressures felt by less well-padded groups. The unchanged dividend shows that Siemens is not contemplating giving the money to shareholders. Investors, for their part, should continue to avoid the stock until there are clearer signs that management is getting to grips with Siemens' notoriously stodgy culture.</p>

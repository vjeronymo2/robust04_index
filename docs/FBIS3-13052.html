			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hamdan al-Hajj] </F>   [Text] Brigadier General Mujahid Abu-Shawarib, Yemeni  deputy prime minister, has called on President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih and his deputy 'Ali Salim al-Bid to be rational and to  give utmost priority to the interests of the homeland and  nation. He urged them to stop making mistakes in order to save  Yemen from the bad consequences of letting things continue as  they are.    In a telephone interview with AL-DUSTUR, Abu-Shawarib said  that after all the efforts that have been made, he believes  there are people working for separation. Based on this belief,  he said that he had resigned from the dialogue committee because  he does not want to suffer the condemnation of history, because  all those who contribute to the foiling of unity will be  condemned by history. He said Yemen will endure, and the faith  of Yemenis in their unity will continue, and individuals will be  gone, sooner or later.    Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib expressed pessimism about  Yemen's foreseeable future, because the president and his  deputy, and the People's Congress Party and the Yemeni Socialist  party, continue making mistakes visible to local, regional, and  international public opinion. Each party is trying to show it  is eager to maintain unity, but this is not the real situation,  he and his colleagues in the dialogue committee have concluded.    Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib expected something to happen  in the near future unless reason prevails. He said it is a  matter of time. If recriminations continue, they will lead to a  military confrontation, and Yemeni unity will be the scapegoat.    He prayed to God to save Yemen from the plots of its enemies  inside and outside, especially since the situation has reached  the point in which reform is useless unless things are returned  to normalcy, and living consciences give priority to Yemen and  the Yemeni interest.    Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib highly valued the role played  by His Majesty King Husayn toward the signing of the document of  pledge and accord, and his eagerness to maintain the Yemeni's  unity and fraternal spirit, and his desire to do all he can to  preserve Yemeni unity. At the same time, he expressed  appreciation of the Omani role in this field, and hoped that  other Arab parties will play good roles that serve the interests  of Yemen and the Yemenis.    Brigadier General Abu-Shawarib hoped that the Yemeni  president and his deputy will return to the right path and do  what is for the good of Yemen in order to save their country  from dangers known only to God.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aharon Klein] </F>   [Text] Some 10 armed bodyguards have been recently  assigned to protect Fatah leaders in the Gaza Strip. The step  had been approved by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] and the  defense establishment. The bodyguards received personal  handguns, which had been purchased by Palestinians after  receiving special Israeli approval. The decision to approve the  employment of armed bodyguards was made in the wake of an  explicit Palestinian request. In discussions with senior IDF  officers, senior Fatah officials explained they had to protect  themselves against assassination attempts by peace-opposing  organizations.    The defense establishment's approval was granted on the  strict condition that the bodyguards should only fire for  protection and that they would not exhibit their weapons in  public. The bodyguards have been issued appropriate permits.  It should be noted that before the handguns were handed to the  bodyguards, they were registered and ballistically tested.</p>

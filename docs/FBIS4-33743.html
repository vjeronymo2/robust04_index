			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Oscar Raul Cardoso: "Will the United States </F> Invade Haiti?" -- copyrighted by CLARIN]    [Text] Long before the era of CNN, French author Victor  Hugo stated in the 19th century that one can prevent an invasion  by foreign armies but one cannot prevent an invasion of ideas.  Some 21 months after ousting the first legally elected  president in Haitian history, a group of military and civilians  who are accustomed to prospering at the expense of those who  endure misery and suffering is again jeopardizing the  hemispheric security system by trying to disprove Victor Hugo's  statement.    An eventual U.S. military invasion, supported by a  multinational force seeking to establish democracy, is a clear  possibility in the not-so-distant-future. Bill Clinton has  publicly admitted the viability of such a possibility. It has  the unmistakable smell of a prophecy about to come true.    The damage caused to the hemispheric system by similar  actions undertaken in previous decades -- like in Grenada and  Panama -- has yet to be assessed. Assessments were in many  cases postponed by the flood of innumerable fantasies that  drowned international relations at the end of the Cold War.    The main problem is that Clinton invariably contradicts  himself, particularly on foreign policy matters. At this stage  of his administration, his words have a hollow sound. The  Serbs, for example, have every reason to pay no attention when  the Clinton administration feels the need to impress them -- the  Serbs in particular, but even more so the rest of the World --  by hardening its military discourse.    An editorial published a few months ago in one of the  intellectual mouthpieces of that strange phenomenon that is  "Clintonism" -- THE NEW REPUBLIC magazine -- caused  understandable moral anguish. It stated that the United States  is willing to fight commercial wars but not genocidal wars.    Perhaps the Haitian dictatorship believes it might now avoid  a foreign military landing on the island with the same  uninterrupted success that successive generations of dominant  classes have enjoyed in tenaciously blocking such universal  ideals as human dignity, freedom, and social well-being since  the slave uprising in 1804 which resulted in Haitian  independence.    History does not reject the possibility of impunity. The  regime -- in which General Raoul Cedras is the master puppeteer  and the elderly lawyer Emile Jonassaint is the puppet wearing  the presidential sash that sways in compliance with Cedras'  wishes -- may succeed in its nefarious actions.    Ever since ousted President Jean Bertrand Aristide was  forced into exile, the international community has gone hoarse  demanding the reinstatement of the previous status quo. At the  expense of others, the Haitian regime has endured (and continues  to endure) successive embargoes; humanitarian organizations  state that two out of three Haitian children suffer  malnutrition. Moreover, it made a complete mockery of a  sensible agreement -- the Isla del Gobernador negotiated by  Argentina's Dante Caputo -- which was originally accepted and  which would have avoided global ridicule for Haiti.    Haiti poses a heavy load on the U.S. conscience. The drama  of Haitians drowning at sea trying to reach the U.S. coast and  the reality of the horror of another immigration wave -- with  its corresponding hunger, willingness to take low-wage jobs, and  empty stomachs -- is a controversial issue in U.S. public  opinion.    Clinton, who seems to have difficulty in distinguishing good  from bad, in this case has built around himself and his  administration a cobweb of contradictory positions.    Although the invasion would be the exclusive responsibility  of the "benefactor power," other countries of the Americas would  be compelled to contribute in the second stage of this exercise  of exporting democracy. With the almost notorious exception of  Argentina, no other Latin American country seems convinced of  the benefits of such an adventure, which is ultimately aimed  more at resolving Clinton's problem than at rescuing tormented  Haitians.    The Foreign Ministry says the Argentine Government has  established the prerequisite that at least one other Latin  American country must approve and cooperate in this exercise.  This, however, seems to be a mere formal position because the  Argentine Government is the only Latin American government that  has not objected to this idea. Official sources have asserted  that Caputo -- the official OAS negotiator of the Haitian crisis  -- is one of the channels through which they coordinate the  projects that may be implemented in no more than 30 days.  Another version states that the mediator believes only threats  will suffice, while Caputo has already notified Foreign Minister  Guido Di Tella that he will resign if the threat materializes.    Argentina has very little to give and even less to gain from  this operation. It would be absurd to analyze the situation  without considering Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989). Grenada,  occupied by Ronald Reagan's men, has few reasons to thank the  United States for the operation; while Panama -- without Manuel  Noriega -- continues to be a haven for the drug traffickers and  money launderers the invasion sought to eliminate.    In an effort to manage the numerous conflicts he inherited,  Clinton seems to have nothing better to do than to act like Bush  and resort to the same vision of the world he defeated in the  ballot boxes almost two years ago.    All this is quite shocking because he seems to be mounting  Bush's horse from the wrong side of the saddle. On 1 June THE  NEW YORK TIMES published an article by Brent Scowcroft, a  security adviser during the Bush administration, warning of the  obvious risks that such an invasion entails and issuing a  reminder that the United States occupied Haiti between 1914 and  1933. Scowcroft writes: "When we arrived there we found no  trace of democracy. When we left, we did not leave any trace of  it either."</p>

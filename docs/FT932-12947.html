			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Observer: Black biting Sixteen months after winning control of Australia's Fairfax newspaper group, Conrad Black is embroiled in a second public row with John Kerin, the country's former finance minister. After Kerin claimed the bid was against the national interest, Black labelled Australian politicians 'venal' and described the bidding process as a 'degrading, grotesque charade', but was later allowed to acquire 15 per cent of Fairfax, and management control. Now Black is saying he became angry because, during a meeting with then prime minister Bob Hawke, Kerin had assured him that foreign holdings of less than 35 per cent were 'piffle', implying that the bid would be allowed to go through. In reply, Kerin claims that no assurances were given, and insists he would never use such an un-Australian word as piffle. All good fun, but the back-biting may be a bit academic. Black admits that the government's 25 per cent ceiling on his Fairfax stake makes the group a sitting duck if Kerry Packer decides to add to his 10 per cent holding.</p>

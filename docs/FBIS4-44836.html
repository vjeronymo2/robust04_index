			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Max Planck Researchers in Heidelberg </F> Achieve Structural Widths of 80 Nanometers"]    [Text] Frankfurt. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute  (MPI) for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg are currently  investigating a gas-field ion source (GFIS) that can generate  particularly fine, highly intense ion beams. This device, called  the GFIS cannon, now makes it theoretically possible to produce  and investigate structures in the nanometer scale range, with an  eye to applications in materials science, environmental control,  and medical/biological research.    The ion beams are generated in a very high electrical field  to an extremely fine peak. A special peak geometry (superpeak)  makes the ion beam extremely narrow and the radiation about  1,000 times "brighter" than is the case in normal field emission  peaks. The life of the "superpeak" can now be extended to the  point where even industrial utilization is feasible.    Professor Siegfried Kalbitzer, director of the Nuclear Solid  State Physics and Materials Science Working Group at the Max  Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, notes in the MPI journal  SPIEGEL that this ion source has already been able to achieve an  image point diameter of about 80 nanometers and that it seems  possible eventually to reach a diameter of 10 nanometers.    "While classical semiconductor technology currently plans  structural elements having the finest structures at 100  nanometers, structures at 10 nanometers will open completely new  avenues," Kalbitzer predicts. One first simple application of  focussed ion beams, which has already been tested in Heidelberg,  is the generation of optical patterns in semiconductors (silicon  or silicon carbide). When a thin, transparent layer of such  crystals is irradiated with a sufficiently high dose of heavy  ions, the ions destroy the crystals in the irradiated areas. the  material in those areas becomes formless (amorphous).    Amorphous silicon has optical properties that are different  from crystalline. When the light wavelengths are right, a clear  "bright-dark" contrast, suitable for storing the patterns, is  observed. Crystals only reform in an amorphous spot at  temperatures of 600C. When the ambient temperatures are in  the normal range, information can be stored for a long time.    Kalbitzer calculates that a beam diameter of 100 nanometers  will permit up to 10 billion bits to be written in one square  centimeter of storage area. This is about a hundred times  greater capacity than the current storage densities. A 100  cm[.sup]2[/]-area disk is therefore able to record a billion  data points or a text volume of 100 million DIN-A4 pages. Should  it ever become possible to approach the structural realm of 10  nanometers, even far greater storage densities would of course  be possible.    Ion beam technology can also find applications in  micromechanics and microchemistry. The Heidelberg researchers  have shown that a neon ion beam can be used to etch fine  patterns in thin copper wires, for example. Because secondary  electrons, which can be captured on a screen, are released in  this process, it therefore becomes possible to observe and even  control the progress of microtechnical processing.    Moreover, this kind of system permits highly precise cutting  procedures to be performed, as, for example, preparative cuts on  organic molecular compounds, microorganisms, and all sorts of  specimens. In Kalbitzer's opinion, the exposure of photoresists  with ion beams would be a very interesting experiment, in that  the desired patterns could be written in substantially shorter  times through the use of ion beam lithography. This becomes even  more advantageous, the larger the wafer surfaces to be described  and the higher the structural densities become.</p>

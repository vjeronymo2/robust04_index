			<p><P> August 13, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTERPUNCH: THE FALLOUT OVER 'MISS SAIGON';  </P> <P> 'I'M ASHAMED OF MY UNION, ACTORS' EQUITY'  </P> <P> Actors may be the oldest minority group in the world. Thousands of years ago,  when blacks still roved innocent in the African rain forests and Jews reigned  remote in their desert redoubts, actors were wandering around Europe juggling  apples, telling stories and doing the three walnut shells and a pea scam. We  slept in stables before Christ was born, often with local company that got us  run out of town by dogs the next morning.  </P> <P> This has earned us an enduring reputation; to this day there are hotels actors  can't stay in, clubs we can't join. Oddly, we don't seem to care too much about  it. Remember Groucho Marx? "I wouldn't belong to a club that'd have me."  </P> <P> Early in my career (during the Civil War, I recall), I was hired as leading man  in a very successful stock company in Pennsylvania. The director explained to  me that there was a street in the town the actors weren't supposed to cross and  a part of the beach we couldn't swim from . . . did this bother me? "I didn't  come here to swim," I said. "What are the parts?"  </P> <P> I can't believe that the first union I joined, to which I'm proud to belong,  could endorse so blatantly racist a position as Actors' Equity has done in  denying Jonathan Pryce the right to play the role he created in "Miss Saigon."  </P> <P> As actor and director, I've always assumed the idea was to get the best actor  for the part, no matter what color he or she was. I've never spoken to a single  working actor who didn't endorse this. When I took "The Caine Mutiny  Court-Martial" to London four years ago, we forged an agreement with British  Equity that let me use an almost all-American cast, because they were right for  the parts! Where have we fallen from there?  </P> <P> Now, Morgan Freeman can contribute an extraordinary Petruchio to "Taming of the  Shrew," but Laurence Olivier would be prohibited from giving us his Othello,  widely regarded as the best performance by any actor in any part in this  century.  </P> <P> Now that Dustin Hoffman has given the theater a memorable Shylock, can only  Jewish actors be cast in the role? Because Sean Connery and I are Scots, are we  the only actors who get to play Macbeth? What obscene drivel are we talking  about here? Certainly not about acting.  </P> <P> I'm ashamed of my union. I beg our leaders to abandon this bare-faced racist  deception. Do you remember when you played checkers with your granddad, the  first time you figured out that he was letting you win? And how mad it made  you? That's what's happening here. We can't have this.  </P> <P> We also can't have any cosmetic compromise: "Ohh . . . all right, Pryce can  play the part . . . but only for 50 performances. OK!! A hundred, then . . .  but that's it!"  </P> <P> Equity has to get out of the casting business.  </P></p>

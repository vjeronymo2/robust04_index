			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Babangida's troubles grow NIGERIA'S military government seemed increasingly beleaguered at the weekend, as growing doubts about transition to civilian rule worsened the country's economic crisis. President Ibrahim Babangida's decision on Friday to nullify the results of presidential primaries and dissolve the leadership of the two permitted political parties makes the planned January 2, 1993, handover look unrealistic. The probable delay also means no early end to the drift in economic management creditors and donors hoped a new government would end. The drift has left Nigeria without an IMF agreement for the past year, a precondition to urgently-needed rescheduling of its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.4bn) external debt. 'Without it,' a western banker said last night, 'Nigeria's prospects are grim.' Nevertheless, many politicians have backed the move, in some cases because it gives defeated candidates a second chance. 'Babangida's decision is most welcome. What happened (in the primaries) was totally devoid of public morality,' Mr Lateef Jakande, a former civilian governor of Lagos and a candidate in the Social Democratic party (SDP), said. A spokesman for Mr Umaru Shinkafi, a front-runner in the National Republican Convention (NRC), was also in favour. Whether the politicians' reactions reflect the view of the electorate, increasingly cynical about the leadership qualities of both soldiers and civilians, is another matter. 'What option do we have but to go along with it?' one Lagos businessman asked last night. 'One thing is sure: the government remains unpopular.' But the resilience of Gen Babangida, who seized power in August 1985, should not be underestimated, his critics warn. By restructuring the armed forces and ensuring key units are within reach of the presidential HQ in Abuja, the federal capital, he has made himself a formidable adversary for would-be successors. The president's criticism of the politicians would carry more weight if he presided over a more honest administration. Corruption continues to permeate the government, undermining political and economic reform programmes. Gen Babangida has not spelt out the implications of Friday's announcement for the timetable of the handover, which envisages a presidential poll on December 5, although stressing he remained pledged to civilian rule. But in a comment some Nigerians have interpreted as a hint that the handover may be delayed, he stressed: 'Let me correct one thing. The National Electoral Commission does not determine the lifespan of this administration.' On the economic front, news is bleak. The IMF programme renewed in January 1991 had lapsed by the end of the year. The 1991 budget deficit was 35.5bn naira 12.4 per cent of GDP, against a target of N100m surplus. Continuing fiscal and monetary indiscipline has since prompted a warning from the central bank alarmed at inflation running at 27 per cent and rising. 'The mounting inflationary pressures were the result of undesirable macroeconomic trends characterised by excessive monetary expansion, large fiscal deficits and exchange rate depreciation,' the bank said last August. It may well be the president set himself impossible tasks. He took on a political elite which, as the recent presidential primaries showed, continues to buy votes and bribe electoral officers, and underestimated the economic challenge. But for many Nigerians, the man who promised to clean up Nigeria's political system, and launched a structural adjustment programme in 1986, has failed on both counts.</p>

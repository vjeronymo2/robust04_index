One of the flights departed Friday morning but did not  receive permission from the Chinese Government to land in  Shanghai en route and was forced to return to Nagasaki.    The flight's routing was changed to go via Taipei and both  flights departed around 7 P.M.    A total of 263 Vietnamese refugees had been scheduled to be  repatriated, but one withdrew a request to return to Hanoi prior  to Friday's departure.    The refugees had arrived in Japan by boat between November  1989 and October 1993 and were being held in the detention  center and a temporary reception center in Omura, Nagasaki  Prefecture.    The Geneva-based UNHCR returned about 200 Vietnamese from  Japan to their home country under a voluntary repatriation  scheme last year.</p>

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Media Futures: A guide to UK telecoms When the UK telecommunications industry offered little but POTS (plain old telephone services), choice was easy. There wasn't any. Now that privatisation and deregulation have brought in PANS (pretty awesome new stuff), it's easy to become confused. What operator to use? What tariff to pick? Which mobile phone service? The options seem endless, and the individual companies do little to help the poor consumer choose. Which is where The Deregulated Phone Book comes in handy. This simply produced, cheap and comprehensive guide to the UK telecoms scene is intended for domestic phone users and for businesses. Richard McBrien, the publisher, says: 'The average user still thinks a phone is just a phone, and that there is no real alternative to BT, except perhaps Mercury. One of the aims of the book is to change this culture'. The book is published by Running Heads, 82 East Dulwich Grove, London SE22 8TW, Tel 071 738 4096. Price Pounds 9.95.</p>

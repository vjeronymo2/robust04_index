			<p>BFN     [Text] Thailand is expected to double its share to about  1.8 percent of total world trade with exports worth 2.5 trillion  baht in the year 2000.    The forecast emerged yesterday from a meeting of a  subcommittee considering the country's competitiveness, chaired  by Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Phanitchaphak.    It is outlining plans to increase the country's exports  until  the year 2000.    An adviser to Dr Suphachai, Dr Thirana Phongmakaphat, said  Thai exports were likely to expand 13 percent-15.5 percent  annually in the period.    The estimates were also based on world economic growth of 5  percent a year but this figure would have to be readjusted in  line with trends.    The subcommittee outlined 15 measures to hoost exrports,  including promotions, increased efficiency and a greater role  for regional groups such as the Asia Pacific Economic  Cooperation organisation in technology development.    The subcommittee also suggested measures be adopted for  industries in which Thailand has an advantage over its rivals,  such as agriculture, textiles, gems and jewellery, electronics  and printing and packaging.</p>

This was the protest of the editorial staff of the newspaper  against the attempts of Labour Democrats to seize the  independent newspaper.    The editorial staff stated that "radical group of Labour  Democrats suggested to the Government stopping the activities of  our joint-stock company by seizing its property and shares and  throwing us out or making their servants".    On Tuesday Labour Democrats also publicized their comments  on  the action and stated that "the action of the newspaper is not  original. In 1991 four main Lithuanian dailies launched similar  action in protest against attempts of Landbergis and Vagnorius  Government to nationalize them. The journalists' protest was  not taken into consideration and the VALSTIECIU LAIKRASTIS was  made dependent on supporters of Landsbergis".    The statement also said that "Labour Democrats are not going  to repeat the methods used by Vagnorius and will try to  establish the justice in court."</p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Letter: Remarks are out of bounds With reference to Dominic Lawson's article, 'What the President did not say' (April 10/11), Mr Lawson is within the bounds of propriety in analysing President Clinton's letter and even in attributing ulterior motives to him. However, what I think is particularly distressing is the last paragraph of his letter in which he suggests that President Clinton and others would be 'stinking hypocrites' if they do not in the future send messages of sympathy on the occasion of the death of a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. Given the fact that neither President Clinton nor most other politicians are likely continually to send messages of condolence whenever an atrocity is perpetrated, Mr Lawson would in effect have us conclude, in advance, that President Clinton and other are 'stinking hypocrites'. Now really. . .] Eric Osterwell, Oppenheimer, Wolff &amp; Donnelly, Avenue Louise 250, Box 31, 1050 Brussels, Belgium</p>

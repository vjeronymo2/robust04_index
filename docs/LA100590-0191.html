			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COOL CHARM GIRL GOES FOR 3RD IN ROW AT LOS ALAMITOS  </P> <P> Cool Charm Girl will be gunning for her third straight win when she takes on  archrival Doodlin and three others in the $10,000 distaff pacing invitational  feature tonight at Los Alamitos.  </P> <P> Also on the 12-race program is the $8,000 second leg of the Rising Star Series  for fillies and mares.  </P> <P> Bonny Bo Scot, victorious in the opening leg of the series last week, will  tackle Viking Princess, Margarets Chance, The Princess, Vance on Ice, Miss  Surmo, Perede, Mexicali Lady and Black on Black as she goes for her ninth  career win.  </P> <P> Cool Charm Girl won in her initial Los Alamitos start on Aug. 24, and on Sept.  21 she beat Doodlin while posting a lifetime best 1:55. That mile was also the  fastest ever paced at Los Alamitos by a member of the distaff set.  </P> <P> Doodlin missed by only 2 1/4 lengths in that loss to Cool Charm Girl, while  pacing her own mile in 1:55 2/5. Rick Kuebler will once again handle the  driving chores tonight.  </P></p>

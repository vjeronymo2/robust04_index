			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Audrius Lingys: "Armed and Extremely Dangerous" </F> -- first paragraph is RESPUBLIKA introduction]    [Excerpts] The law "On Permit for Acquiring, Keeping, and  Carrying of Firearms" comes into effect on 1 April. Under this  law, Lithuanian citizens will be able to buy combat pistols or  revolvers in stores. Last week, the government approved the  rules for acquiring combat firearms.    Thus, you will be able to buy a combat firearm as of 1  April.  You will have to write an application to the interior minister  explaining your motive and take it to a police station. You  will have to attach a medical certification stating that your  health condition allows you to keep a firearm. [passage omitted]    Following an inspection, the police station will have to  pass  your file over to the Interior Ministry within 20 days. You  will not receive a permit if you were convicted for premeditated  or casual crimes committed by using firearms, gas arms, or  explosives, if you are on probation, or if you are undergoing a  punishment other than imprisonment.    Nor will permits be issued to people who experienced  administrative punishments for using or keeping drugs, for  violating hunting and fishing rules, for keeping firearms and  ammunition, and other offenses the nature of which suggests that  firearms can be the instrument of a crime.    The Interior Ministry will not issue permits to incapable  people, alcoholics and drug users, mentally affected persons,  those who tried to commit suicides, as well as people with  physical disabilities that could prevent the safe keeping and  using of firearms.    Permits will not be issued to people who are on the  preventive and operative register with the police, as well as to  those who will not pass a theoretical and practical examination  arranged by the police station.    If you have not violated the law, you will receive a permit  to ACQUIRE firearms. The permit will be valid for six months,  and you will have to buy a firearm within that time. If you  fail to do so, you will have to repeat the entire procedure  again.    This permit does not grant you the right to carry a firearm.  Therefore, you will have to apply to the Interior Ministry  within five days after the purchase of a firearm for a permit to  CARRY that firearm. The latter document, made of special paper,  will have your photo, name, personal code, and vital information  about the firearm. You will have to carry this permit together  with the firearm. [passage omitted]    There is only one store in Vilnius, subordinate to the Arms  Fund, that is selling combat firearms for now. The government  adopted such a decision because the police want to put tough  controls on all arms imported into Lithuania. All firearms on  sale will be tested by the police, and the information will be  stored in a special catalog. The law allows you to acquire  firearms of a caliber not exceeding 9 mm and with the weak  firing power. Such firearms are expected to cost no less than  $300. You will also be able to acquire 50 cartridges along with  the firearm.    Before you put the firearm in your pocket, the police will  visit your apartment and become convinced that you have a metal  safe that will make your gun inaccessible. Moreover, the police  will have the right to enter your apartment at any time and  repeatedly check on security conditions.    You will be able to use the firearm to defend yourself,  other  people, property, the inviolability of your place of residence,  other rights, the interests of society or the state, to prevent  a direct threat or the appropriation of the firearm without  overstepping the limits of necessary defense, to shoot an animal  attacking a human being or posing a threat to the environment,  or to call for help. In all these cases, you will be able to  fire only after firing a warning shot into the air.    The latter will be unnecessary if the attack is unexpected  or  if the aggressor is armed. Every such shot will have to be  reported to the police.    The law forbids firing at places of people's assemblies if  this can harm outsiders, as well as at women, minor children,  and handicapped people with distinct signs of disability, except  those cases when they themselves attack and threaten with  firearms.    Your firearms will undergo test firings at police stations  every three years. You will also have to undergo a repeated  medical examination to extend your permit.    You will be able to carry firearms only on the territory of  Lithuania. If you are detained at the border, your firearm will  be confiscated. If you need your firearm while travelling  abroad, you will have to apply to officials of that country and  receive their permission. You will have to show this permit to  the Lithuanian Interior Ministry and get another one allowing  you take the firearm abroad.    Incidentally, people who voluntarily return illegally kept  arms to the police by 1 April, will not only remain unpunished,  but will also receive compensation and be granted a chance to  acquire a legal firearm. No compensation will be paid after 1  April. [passage omitted]    Although the law was prepared by the Interior Ministry, it  seems that no one listened to its opinion on the expediency of  this document. Those deputies who had treaded many doorsteps at  the ministry when requesting personal arms for themselves showed  particular effort in "pushing the law through" the Seimas  [parliament]. Having received a negative answer, they must have  decided to arm everyone.</p>

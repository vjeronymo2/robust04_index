Nigerian Army units, which have been occupying parts of the  peninsula since December 21, launched a fresh attack against  Cameroon troops on Friday and Saturday, but it was beaten off,  it said in a statement.    The latest incident took place despite the fact that  Cameroon  had sent "several high-level missions" to Nigeria to resolve the  dispute peacefully and talks were still going on, said the  statement signed by Joseph Owona, secretary-general of the  presidency.    The government was appealing to the UN Security Council, the  International Court in The Hague and the Organisation of African  Unity, "to establish our rights against this illegal occupation  of our territory," it said, arguing that Cameroon's sovereignty  was supported by international treaties.    The country would continue to maintain talks with Nigeria  and  "seek a peaceful, just and durable settlement of the issue," the  statement continued.    The Pakazzi Peninsula (known as Bakassi by Nigeria), along  with the Apani and Diamant Islands occupied by Nigerian soldiers  since the beginning of the year, lies at the mouth of the Akpa  Yafe River which marks the boundary between the two countries.    The border was never precisely drawn through the peninsula,  an area of mangroves and swamps where most people make their  living from fishing, and Nigeria has maintained a claim to the  territory.    Nigeria says Cameroonian incursions have caused the deaths  and flight of thousands of Nigerians from the region, prompting  Lagos to deploy troops there.    During an earlier period of tension in 1981, France  threatened to intervene militarily to defend Cameroon against  Nigerian demands, under the terms of its defence agreement with  Yaounde.    The two countries began border demarcation negotiations  under  a joint commission in 1986 but it has never given a final ruling.    Over the last 10 days they have been exchanging government  delegations and on Friday Cameroon's deputy foreign minister,  Francis Nkwain, handed over a message from President Paul Biya  to his Nigerian counterpart, General Sani Abacha.</p>

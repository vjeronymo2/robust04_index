This is the firm stance adopted by Foreign Minister  Javier Solana, who today met his Portuguese counterpart Jose  Durao Barroso, who has emphasized his support for Spain in this  area.    Solana also referred to yesterday's attack on a Spanish  airplane while flying on a United Nations mission. The attack  took place over Krajina, an area controlled by the Serbs.  Solana described the attack as very serious, and said that it  is up to the international community to respond because this is  the first time that a UN plane has been attacked.</p>

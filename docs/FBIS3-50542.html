The  ceremony was presided over by FAR Minister Army General Raul  Castro.    Army Gen. Raul Castro and Commander of the Revolution Juan  Almeida, president of the Cuban Revolution Veterans Association  [ACRC], presented the promotions. Officer Rene Corredera Brito,  an internationalist pilot who has received the Antonio Maceo  Medal of Valor, spoke on behalf of the officers who were  promoted. He thanked everyone for the trust placed in them and  for the promotion they received, which is a sign of recognition  for their work. Brito reiterated the officers support for the  cause of the defense of the fatherland and their loyalty to the  commander in chief, whose example a FAR officer should follow,  always ready to confront the enemy and always filled with the  belief that our noble ideals of national independence and  socialism will triumph.    Division General Nestor Lopez Cuba, chief of the FAR  political directorate, closed the event with a dynamic speech.  Div. Gen. Lopez Cuba described 1993 as the most difficult year  since the triumph of the Revolution, and he described the  special period as a hard test that the patriots and  revolutionaries are confronting with courage, loyalty, and the  belief that it is possible to resist and win. Lopez Cuba told  the officers that: We have absolute trust in you because we  know you will be worthy bearers of the title of colonel of the  Armed Forces founded by our invincible commander in chief, Fidel  Castro, 37 years ago. He will continue to lead us, as always,  through the most difficult and glorious moments.</p>

Abbas Raza Kazmi told AFP that the embassy's military  attache  had visited the planes at the northern base of al-Qulay'at and  informed the authorities that Pakistan was interested in buying  them.    "We are now waiting for a response from the Lebanese  authorities. We need a price range and details because as you  know these are old planes which need maintenance," he said.    On Monday, the government decided to sell the 10 French-made  planes, which have been grounded since the early days of  Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war and for which there are no spare  parts.    Former prime minister 'Umar Karami, during a visit to France  in 1992, tried in vain to trade them in for spare parts to equip  the army or for military helicopters, officials here said.    Three Hawker Hunters make up Lebanon's current air force,  according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.</p>

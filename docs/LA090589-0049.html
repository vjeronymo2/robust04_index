			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NFL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> JOE MORRIS, ANDRE TIPPETT LOST FOR THE SEASON  </P> <P> Joe Morris, whose 1,516 rushing yards led the New York Giants' drive to the  National Football League championship in 1986, and all-pro linebacker Andre  Tippett of New England were lost for the season Monday, both victims of the  league's new injured reserve rules.  </P> <P> Morris, the Giants' all-time leading rusher with 5,296 yards, broke a foot in  Saturday night's exhibition loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers and was placed on  injured reserve before the team got down to its final 47-man roster.  </P> <P> Tippett, the mainstay of the Patriots' defense, was placed on injured reserve  after undergoing surgery to repair muscle damage in his right shoulder. Two  other New England starters, cornerback Ronnie Lippett and defensive end Garin  Veris, both of whom had knee surgery Saturday, also went on injured reserve.  </P> <P> Under the new rules, none of them can return this season.  </P> <P> Among the players waived Monday as teams cut down the the regular-season limit  were one-time all-pro wide receiver Cris Collinsworth of Cincinnati and the  Bengals' 10-year placekicker, Jim Breech, along with six Denver Broncos who  played key roles on their two Super Bowl teams. Included in that group were  wide receiver Steve Watson and running back Gerald Willhite.  </P> <P> Another player from those Denver teams, linebacker Ricky Hunley, was cut by the  Cardinals. Hunley was expected to be Phoenix's starting middle linebacker but  missed 12 days in a contract dispute and played poorly during the exhibition  season.  </P> <P> Kansas City, meanwhile, cut Paul Palmer, its No. 1 draft pick in 1987. Palmer  was the second-leading rusher and receiver for the Chiefs last year and led the  AFC in kickoff returns as a rookie.  </P> <P> Morris and Tippett may have been victims of the new injured reserve rules.  Brian Washington, who started 14 of 16 games at free safety for Cleveland last  year, also went on the list with a broken nose and elbow injury; Miami put  kicker Fuad Reveiz on the list, and Buffalo lost all-purpose running back Robb  Riddick the same way.  </P> <P> Unlike previous seasons, when players placed on injured reserve before the  final cuts could have been activated after six games if healthy, those now  inactivated before the 47-man limit is established can't be activated during  the season or practice with the team unless they go through waivers.  </P></p>

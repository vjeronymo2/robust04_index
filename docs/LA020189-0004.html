			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A federal judge encountered immediate problems as he began selecting jurors for  the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North. About 40 of the first 55  prospective jurors were tentatively dismissed after saying that they had  watched North's 1987 congressional testimony on television or had read about  it. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell noted that the government's case  against North must be based solely on evidence gathered independently of his  congressional testimony. By the end of the day Gesell had screened only seven  prospective jurors who said that they had paid little or no attention to  North's earlier testimony. North, who has pleaded innocent to 12 criminal  charges, sat at the defense table smiling at supporters.  </P></p>

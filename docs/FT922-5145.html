			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Carlsberg annual results expected to be unchanged CARLSBERG, the brewery group, reported a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from DKr623m to DKr670m (Dollars 108.4m), in the half-year to March 31. However, the interim statement said all but DKr10m of the increase was due to changes in accounting principles. Operating profits were, however, ahead by 27 per cent from DKr385m to DKr491. Factors in the improvement were continued rationalisation of Danish brewing operations and the disposal last summer of the loss-making Spanish brewery, Union Cervecera. Net interest income fell from DKr231m to DKr189m, taking profits before extraordinary items from DKr616m last year to DKr680m. Sales declined by DKr29m to DKr4.70bn. In the absence of unforeseen events, pre-tax profits for the year are expected to be on a level with last year's DKr1.23bn, said the statement. Accounting principles were changed to include shares of profits in associated companies. Earlier, only dividends from associated companies were included. The interim statement said it was taking longer than expected to obtain approval for the merger of the UK brewing interests of Allied-Lyons and Carlsberg, which was proposed last October. Although the delay was postponing the advantages from the merger, the two groups expected to secure the necessary approvals, it said. The UK Mergers and Monopolies Commission is due to hand its recommendations to the Department of Trade and Industry on June 12, said Mr Michael Iuul, a member of the group board of management. If the MMC does not not give unconditional clearance for the merger, he expected there to be negotiations with the DTI to make the necessary adjustments to the agreement between Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons.</p>

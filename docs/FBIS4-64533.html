			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said the  Cypriot Government believes that the procedure followed so far  by the United Nations to promote a Cyprus solution has failed  because of the lack of political will by the Turkish side. It  also believes that the time has come for the UN Security Council  to consider alternative ways to promote the problem.    The spokesman clarified that when he refers to the procedure  he means the one on the confidence-building measures [CBM's] and  all the others followed in the past to promote the sets of ideas  from former UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar and UN  Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali. Kasoulidhis added that  the president has some thoughts on ways to promote the Cyprus  issue and will submit them to the National Council after the UN  secretary general submits his report.    Answering a question, the spokesman said the government does  not believe that a silent deadline has been given to the entire  procedure but that it is merely a delay. He added that the  Cypriot Government has not asked for new meetings with Joe  Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative in  Cyprus, or Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate  special representative in Cyprus, during this period.  Kasoulidhis said: The government does understand what can be  said in such meetings, unless Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas changes his position and that side accepts the UN  document of 21 March. Our side has no margins for further  negotiations on this document.    Asked about information that Clark will resign, that a  replacement will be appointed, or that observers will be  appointed to the Cyprus issue the spokesman said the government  has no information.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> EX-PASTOR GIVEN WORK FURLOUGH FOR MOLESTING AN UNDERAGE GIRL  </P> <P> The former pastor of a Chula Vista Pentecostal church was sentenced Wednesday  to six months in a work-furlough program for molesting an underage girl.  </P> <P> With many church members and friends of the South Bay Pentecostal Church  attending the sentencing, Lyn Meche, 39, was also ordered to register as a sex  offender.  </P> <P> Meche was placed on three years' probation and ordered to pay for therapy for  the girl, now 18. The amount will be determined later.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Charles Patrick fined Meche $150 and ordered him to  report to the program May 30.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Caryn Rosen said Meche will be free to work days but will be  locked up at night and on weekends.  </P> <P> Meche pleaded no contest March 17 to two misdemeanor counts of molesting the  girl over a period of years. He could have been sentenced to one year in jail.  </P> <P> Under his probation, the former preacher was ordered not to associate with  minors unless he is in the presence of a responsible adult aware of his  conviction. Meche was also ordered not to frequent places where minors  congregate.  </P> <P> Misdemeanor charges are still pending against two other ministers from the same  church, Arthur Hodges III, 32, and George Nobbs, 32. They are accused of  failing to report the molestation to authorities after the girl told them about  it.  </P></p>

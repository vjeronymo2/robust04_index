The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry told  provincial authorities Friday that workers would have the right  to strike after all efforts at conciliation were exhausted, the  union weekly, NGUOI LAO DONG, said in its latest edition. But  it added that workers planning to strike would have to submit to  management a written warning 15 days prior to any action.    The ministry also called for the formation of conciliation  and arbitration councils in local companies, in conjunction with  regional state labor boards, to help resolve disputes between  workers and their bosses, the newspaper said. If disputes were  not resolved under the system, employees could strike two weeks  after submitting a written warning. Negotiations would continue  over the duration of a strike, the newspaper added.    In the absence of a labor code, which the National Assembly  is expected to be adopt in mid-June, the right to strike comes  as social conflicts have multiplied in recent months, especially  in the south.    The Vietnamese press reported on three strikes that took  place shortly before Tet -- the Lunar New Year -- at the  beginning of the month in three major companies, one in Hanoi.  The most drastic was at Ho Chi Minh City's Vitexco, where 500  workers stopped work, demanding a new year bonus increase and  social security guarantees. Some 140 Ho Chi Minh City street  sweepers also went on strike with the same demands. In the  capital, 200 factory workers struck for 48 hours over low and  inequitable salaries, the newspaper said.</p>

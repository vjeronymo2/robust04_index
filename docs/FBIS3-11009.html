			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Rafael Pardo by Sandra </F> Vergara in Santa Fe de Bogota on 15 January; from the "National  Newscast" -- recorded]    [Text] A short while ago I spoke with Defense Minister  Rafael Pardo. He reacted to a report that Amnesty  International has just released in which it directly accuses the  Colombian Armed Forces of committing most of the political  crimes and social cleansing homicides in Colombia.    [Begin recording] [Pardo] The statistics are being  manipulated. They cited a number of facts and events and  accused the military forces of committing crimes that have not  been tried and for which no sentencing has been handed down.  With ill intention they mentioned these cases. They claim that  the military forces are involved. This is evidently highly  ill-intentioned.    [Vergara] That report suggests that the Armed Forces are  working with paramilitary forces or that they are allied with  the death squads.    [Pardo] I repeat, I know nothing about that report. We will  react to it as soon as we know about it. The claim that there  is an alliance between military forces and paramilitary groups  is absolutely false. Paramilitary groups are not our allies. In  fact, the Colombian military forces pursue them. [end recording]</p>

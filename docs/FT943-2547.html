			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Gain and Fable: The greatest story never told - If the DTI report into alleged insider dealing by Lord Archer were published, it would probably become a best-seller to rival the success of the novelist himself. But the account is very unlikely to appear. Robert Peston sets out here what the investigators might have written The Department of Trade and Industry's report into alleged insider trading by Lord Archer in Anglia Television shares would be a best-seller if it were published, perhaps rivalling the sales of the best-selling novelist's own thrillers. But publication of the real thing seems very remote. So in the interests of honest competition with Lord Archer's highly profitable works of fiction, a version of what the DTI inspectors might have written is presented below. The intention is to shed light on how and why in mid-January Lord Archer placed orders to buy 50,000 Anglia shares, days before an agreed takeover bid for the company was announced. 1 A brief history of Anglia Television The company was incorporated in September 1958. Its main subsidiary, Anglia Television Limited, is licensed by the Independent Television Commission to hold the broadcasting franchise for the east of England. In January, its board estimated that in the year to December 31 1993, the company made profits before tax of at least Pounds 16m, including an exceptional credit of Pounds 5m, compared with Pounds 14.5m the previous year. 2 Lady Archer and the Anglia board of directors On January 29 1987, Anglia Television announced that Dr Mary Archer, for 10 years fellow and college lecturer in chemistry at Newnham College Cambridge, was joining its board. Her fellow directors describe her as 'punctilious' and 'very professional'. Dr Archer, as she prefers to be known, is also head of the Lloyd's hardship committee, which assesses whether penurious members of the London insurance market should receive financial support. 3 Lord Archer, fiction and the Conservative party Dr Archer is the wife of the best-selling novelist, Lord Archer, formerly Mr Jeffrey Archer, who was created a life peer in 1992 and was deputy chairman of the Conservative party from 1985 to 1986. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is a friend. Lord Archer has had a volatile career. He became Tory MP for Louth in 1969. However, he stood down in 1974 after a businessman, Mr Anthony Bamford, started bankruptcy proceedings against him to recover funds that Lord Archer had invested in Aquablast, a Canadian company which turned out to be fraudulent. Lord Archer was financially ruined, but rebuilt his fortune when he discovered a talent for writing popular fiction. 4 Lord Archer, Broosk Saib, Kurdistan and the PM In April 1991 Lord Archer became involved in fundraising for the Kurds of northern Iraq by organising the Simple Truth pop concert. Through his visits to Kurdistan, he became friendly with Mr Broosk Saib, a London-based Kurdish businessman. Mr Saib, who is 32, controlled two companies, Broosk Estate Agents and Broosk Interior Designs, which were wound up in 1991. When liquidated, Broosk Estate Agents was unable to repay creditors owed Pounds 71,673. From January 3 to January 9 of this year, Lord Archer travelled in Iraq to investigate the plight of the Kurds. On returning, he met the prime minister, Mr John Major, to give a report on their condition. 5 Anglia directors' share dealing code On September 23 1992, the Anglia board adopted new rules 'governing dealings by officers (which include all directors) of the group in the securities of the company'. These rules were 'applicable to any dealings by the officer's spouse or on behalf of any infant child or by any other person connected with him'. The rules also applied to other dealings in which the officer or any other person connected with him 'is or is to be treated as interested'. The rules prohibited dealings by officers and their spouses when the officers possessed information which was 'likely, upon publication, to affect the market price of those securities'. Information about a possible takeover of Anglia fell into this category. The rules also contained an explicit prohibition on dealings by any director or their spouse in Anglia shares during the 'close period', from the end of the company's financial year on December 31 to the publication of its annual results, normally in the middle of March. Each director was required to sign a copy of the rules, confirming that they had received them and that they would 'act in accordance therewith'. Directors informed their spouses and connected parties. 6 The outhouse in the Grantchester garden Lady Archer has told her fellow Anglia directors that she keeps all her confidential board papers in a converted Victorian folly in the garden of the main family home at Grantchester near Cambridge. She and Lord Archer have separate offices in the folly. 7 Lord Archer, fiction and stockbrokers Charles Stanley Since the early 1970s, Lord Archer had sporadically done business with Mr Simon Wharmby and Mr Frank Watts, two stockbrokers who have worked as a team for a variety of City of London firms. They both joined Charles Stanley in October 1993, having left Sheppards after it was merged with Carr Kitcat. Charles Stanley is a medium-size stockbroker that can trace its roots back 200 years. It is controlled by the Howard family, which is well-known in the City of London. Its typical clients are wealthy individuals, including 'senior members' of the Conservative Party, according to one of its executives. In the 1970s, Mr Watts and Mr Wharmby worked for Rowe Rudd, an aggressive stockbroking firm used by Lord Archer which no longer exists. Mr Watts has told friends that he had tried to deter Lord Archer from making his ruinous investments in Aquablast. Coincidentally, a character called 'Frank Watts', also employed by a 'Rowe Rudd', appears in Lord Archer's first novel, Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less, which launched him back on the road to fortune. The novel contains a scene in which Mr Watts receives an order to buy and sell a parcel of shares within a single dealing period or 'account' from an insider dealer. For the past few years, neither Mr Watts nor Mr Wharmby had had any business dealings with Lord Archer, according to a friend of theirs. However, Mr Wharmby telephoned Lord Archer twice shortly after joining Charles Stanley. He did this because he was contacting all wealthy former clients to inform them where he could be reached. Around Christmas, he then contacted Lord Archer again to ask him if he wanted to invest in an unusual scheme to salvage a ship sunk during the second world war. Lord Archer declined. 8 Regulatory changes which made Anglia a takeover target In May 1993, the then national heritage secretary, Mr Peter Brooke, launched a review of the rules preventing any company from holding more than one large broadcasting franchise. He announced on November 24 that each ITV company would be permitted to hold two regional franchises, subject to approval by both Houses of Parliament. The new rules came into effect on January 1. As a smaller television company, with a market value in December 1993 of Pounds 190m, Anglia was widely viewed after the rule change as vulnerable to a takeover by a bigger franchise holder or media company, such as MAI, which controls Meridian Broadcasting, the south of England ITV company. 9 Events leading to the takeover of Anglia by MAI In December 1993, MAI indicated to Anglia that it would be interested in making a bid for the company. Board papers which gave details of this tentative offer were sent to directors on December 31. MAI's interest in the company was discussed by the Anglia board for the first time at a meeting held in their Leicester Square office in the centre of London on January 5. The meeting, which was attended by Lady Archer, ran from 10.30am until lunch. Directors also discussed and rejected a complicated four-way partial merger involving London Weekend Television, Yorkshire and Tyne Tees. However directors kept open the options of combining with MAI or remaining independent. 10 MAI's bid proposal A firm bid proposal from MAI was discussed for the first time by the Anglia board at a meeting on January 12. The meeting, held again at Anglia's London offices lasted from 9am until lunch. MAI was offering around 610p a share. The board authorised Sir Peter Gibbings, Anglia's chairman, to negotiate a takeover at close to 650p a share. That afternoon, Sir Peter and his chief executive, David McCall, met Lord Hollick, MAI's managing director, and Sir James Mackinnon, MAI's chairman, to discuss takeover terms. Agreement on a takeover price of about 650p was reached. The following morning, Anglia directors were invited to attend a further board meeting, to be held on Sunday January 16. 11 Anglia's share price performance Because Anglia was widely viewed as a takeover target, its shares had performed strongly in the latter months of 1993 and early 1994. On January 4, its share price was 428p. By January 12, the day before Lord Archer placed his first order, it had risen to 482p, a rise of 13 per cent in just seven working days. Brokers say that if there had not been a takeover bid for the company, the price might well have fallen. 12 Lord Archer's first order to buy Anglia shares At around 10am on January 13 Lord Archer telephoned Mr Wharmby and asked him to check the 'price and size' - or availability - of Anglia shares. This was the day after the Anglia board meeting which first discussed MAI's detailed takeover proposals, including a 610p bid price which was subsequently revised upwards. It was also during the 'close period', during which any dealings by Anglia directors and their spouses were prohibited by the company's rules. Mr Wharmby called Charles Stanley's dealers, who told him that a parcel of 80,000 shares was available. He then telephoned Lord Archer to tell him this. However, Lord Archer said the cost was too great. Instead, he placed an order to purchase 25,000 shares at a price of 485p. Mr Wharmby then spoke again to Charles Stanley's dealers, who clinched a deal with a market maker (a wholesaler of shares). According to stock exchange records, the deal was executed at 10.25am. Mr Wharmby then called Lord Archer and told him the deal had been completed. Up until this moment, Mr Wharmby had assumed that the shares were being bought for Lord Archer himself. However, when Mr Wharmby asked Lord Archer how he wanted the deal to be recorded, Lord Archer said the shares should be booked in the name of Mr Broosk Saib, an individual for whom Charles Stanley had never dealt and who did not have an account at the firm. Stockbrokers say that it is unusual for an individual to place an order on someone else's behalf and not mention that the shares are being bought for this other person before the deal is transacted. 'It is even stranger if the acquaintance does not already have an account with the stockbroker,' said a leading broker. 13 Lord Archer's address as mailbox for Mr Saib To carry out the transaction, Charles Stanley had to set up an account in the name of Mr Saib and in order to do so it needed an address for the Kurdish businessman. Mr Saib has a London home, at 14 Heath Rise, Kersfield Road, Putney. However, this was not supplied by Lord Archer. Instead the novelist asked that the name and address on the account details should be: 'B Saib Esq, c/o J Archer, Alembic House, 93 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TY.' Alembic House is Lord Archer's London residence. 14 Mr Saib says he is a frequent dealer in shares Mr Saib had never before used Lord Archer's address as a mailbox when dealing in shares through any City of London stockbroker. This was ascertained by Charles Stanley when it checked Mr Saib's creditworthiness through the Stock Exchange Mutual Reference Society, a database containing the names and addresses of all exchange members' clients. Charles Stanley did not check whether Mr Saib had ever dealt in shares using his own address in account details supplied to a broking firm. Mr Saib has subsequently said: 'I have bought a lot of shares in my lifetime, and I continue to do so.' However, he has not said why he needed to use Lord Archer to place the orders on this occasion. 15 A second Anglia share order Having instructed Mr Wharmby to register the shares in the name of Mr Saib, Lord Archer said that he would be interested in buying more shares if they became available at the same price. As a result, the following afternoon Mr Wharmby telephoned him and offered him a second parcel of 25,000 shares, again at 485p, which Lord Archer agreed to buy. Once more he bought for Mr Saib's account. According to Stock Exchange records, the deal was executed with a market maker at 1.58pm. 16 Lord Archer as effective guarantor of the deal On the morning of January 14, a few hours before this second order was placed, Mr Peter Hurst, Charles Stanley's finance director, noticed on his copy of the firm's dealing sheet that a new client, Mr Saib, had bought 25,000 Anglia shares. Because he had never heard of Mr Saib, he wondered whether the firm should be giving him Pounds 121,250 of credit to pay for the shares. Under Stock Exchange settlement procedures, whenever anyone buys shares his or her broker provides credit to pay for them. This de facto loan lasts until 'account day', when the client has to deliver the funds. Mr Hurst therefore asked Mr Wharmby why he had dealt for Mr Saib. Mr Wharmby explained that the order had in fact been placed by Lord Archer. Mr Hurst therefore came to the reasonable conclusion that Lord Archer would be 'good for the payment' if Mr Saib could not come up with the funds. He therefore gave Mr Wharmby permission to buy the second parcel of shares for Mr Saib that afternoon. Mr David Howard, managing director of Charles Stanley and an expert on stockbroker contract law as author of a Law Society paper on the subject, was convinced that Lord Archer, the agent for the transaction, would have been found liable in the courts if Mr Saib had failed to pay for the shares. 17 No payment is made for the shares In fact, the question of who would pay for the shares turned out to be irrelevant. They were bought and sold within a single account period, under a Stock Exchange settlement system which has now been superseded. Because the purchase and sale fell within a single account, the buyer did not have to put up any money. Lord Archer had to make special arrangements to ensure that the purchase and sale fell within a single account in this way, because January 13 and January 14 were the last two days of a dealing account. He asked for the shares to be bought for 'new time' by paying a slight premium over the market price for the shares. As a result the transactions counted as falling into the next dealing account period. If the shares had not been bought in this way, payment for them would have been required on January 24. Instead, settlement day was deferred until February 7. 18 Anglia is reminded of the restrictions on dealings Meanwhile, Anglia's solicitors, Linklaters and Paines, wrote on January 14 to the Anglia company secretary, Mr Robin Stephenson, asking him to remind the board that neither they nor their spouses, dependents or connected parties should be dealing in Anglia shares, in view of the negotiations with MAI. 19 Anglia's board agrees to the takeover On Sunday January 16, Anglia's board met at the offices of the company's merchant bank, SG Warburg, in the City of London. The meeting lasted from 2pm until the late afternoon. The board gave approval for the merchant bankers to finalise the takeover terms with MAI. The merchant bankers - Warburg for Anglia and NM Rothschild for MAI - then worked through two nights so all remaining impediments to a deal could be removed. 20 The takeover is announced to the Stock Exchange At just after 8am on January 18, MAI's recommended offer for Anglia was announced. The terms in cash and new MAI convertible preference shares valued the company at approximately Pounds 292m and each Anglia share at 'not less than 637p', with the precise value dependent on how the stock market would eventually value the MAI preference shares. 21 Lord Archer's instructions to sell the Anglia shares Immediately after the bid was announced, Anglia's share price soared. At around 10am that morning Lord Archer telephoned Mr Wharmby and instructed him to sell all 50,000 shares. Stock Exchange records show the deal was transacted at about 10.15am, at a price per share of 646p, realising a gross sum of Pounds 323,000. The net profit on the deal, after deducting commissions and stamp duty reserve tax of 0.5 per cent, was Pounds 77,219.62. 22 The Stock Exchange's preliminary investigation On the same morning, Mr Hurst of Charles Stanley noticed the Stock Exchange announcement of MAI's bid for Anglia. He asked his firm's compliance officer, Mr Eric Hurrell, who is responsible for ensuring that it sticks to the rules of the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Futures Authority, to have a close look at Lord Archer's share orders. These deals were conspicuous. Although the firm had received several orders to buy Anglia shares in the preceding weeks, there had been only Lord Archer's on each of January 13 and January 14. At a meeting of Charles Stanley's directors the following day, Mr Hurrell pointed out quite how well-timed these had been. An executive of the firm, who happened to be in the room, then exclaimed that Lady Archer was an Anglia director. The managing director, Mr Howard, responded: 'My God, this is front page stuff.' He instructed Mr Hurrell to pass on the details to the Stock Exchange's insider dealing group, which has responsibility for the initial stages of insider dealing probes. However the exchange had already left a telephone message for Mr Hurrell. It wanted him to review all the firm's Anglia deals to see if any could have been transacted on the basis of inside information. Mr Hurrell told the exchange: 'I have been expecting your call.' He went on to say that Lord Archer's share orders should be scrutinised carefully. 23 The launch of a formal DTI investigation In the following three days, the Stock Exchange collected as much information as it could about Lord Archer's Anglia share orders. At the beginning of the following week, the exchange passed its dossier on the transactions to the Department of Trade and Industry. The prime minister was then informed of the dealings. On February 8, the DTI appointed Mr Hugh Aldous, an accountant from Robson Rhodes, and Mr Roger Kaye QC, to investigate 'possible insider dealing contraventions'. 24 Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less Charles Stanley was uncertain whether it should pay the cheque for the dealing profit to Mr Saib, in view of the inquiry being conducted into the transactions. It was advised by its solicitors that it should probably hang on to the money. There was a risk, according to the solicitors, that Charles Stanley could be embroiled in a court case if the market makers who sold the shares to Mr Saib via the broker sued on the basis that the purchaser might have benefited unfairly from inside information. However, the Stock Exchange gave the broker informal guidance that it would prefer that the cheque were paid as though nothing unusual had occurred. It did not want Mr Saib or Lord Archer alerted to the possibility that an inquiry was taking place. So on February 4, Charles Stanley sent a cheque for Pounds 77,219.62 to Lord Archer's home. It was an 'account payee only' cheque dated February 7 and drawn on the Bank of Scotland. 25 The cheque is banked and Pounds 10,000 in cash is withdrawn On February 10, the cheque was deposited in Mr Saib's account at the National Westminster Bank's branch in Cromwell Road, west London. Mr Saib already had a current account at the Cromwell Road branch. However, he opened a Premium Reserve interest-paying account, into which he transferred just over Pounds 50,000 of the proceeds. In February and March there were three significant withdrawals from Mr Saib's NatWest account: there were payments to external accounts of Pounds 10,000 and Pounds 12,000, plus a cash withdrawal of Pounds 10,000. The external accounts which received the payments belonged to 'individual organisations' unconnected to Lord Archer, according to an official with a close knowledge of the DTI investigation. 26 Lord Archer contacts Simon Wharmby again Towards the end of February, Lord Archer, having been approached for an interview by the DTI's inspectors, telephoned Mr Wharmby. He inquired what the investigation might concern and appeared surprised that anyone should believe there was anything peculiar about the Anglia share orders.</p>

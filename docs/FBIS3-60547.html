The  case is fundamental as it is the first time in this country that  an HIV-infected person has been sentenced for endangering  someone through just one sexual episode without a condom. In  August, Eastern Superior Court upheld a sentence handed down in  Copenhagen Municipal Court in which a 35-year-old HIV-infected  Haitian was sentenced to a year and a half in jail for having  unprotected intercourse with 23 different women. In both  convictions the HIV-infected person was sentenced for failing to  disclose their HIV status and thus violating Paragraph 252 of  the Penal Code concerning endangering the lives and health of  others through gross wantonness or inconsiderateness.    In determining the penalty in the three-month jail sentence,  consideration was given to the woman's situation and the fact  that the 32-year-old had not been infected with HIV.    The woman immediately appealed the sentence to superior  court.</p>

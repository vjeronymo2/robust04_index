			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECALLS;  </P> <P> PROBLEM WITH ANTIHISTAMINE  </P> <P> Two lots of a prescription antihistamine are being recalled because the  packages may contain a blood pressure medication, the Food and Drug  Administration said today.  </P> <P> The antihistamine is Bioline-brand hydroxyzine pamoate in 50 mg capsules.  </P> <P> The blood pressure medication, 0.2 mg clonidine hydrochloride, comes in scored,  peach-colored tablets, with a "dp" logo above the score-line and "02" below the  line.  </P> <P> If a consumer finds that a bottle that is supposed to contain the Bioline  capsules instead contains the tablets, they should return it to the pharmacy  where they got it, the FDA advised.  </P> <P> Someone who takes the blood pressure drug in the amounts directed for the  antihistamine could become dizzy and fall, the agency said.  </P> <P> Both drugs are made by Duramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cincinnati. Labels are  supplied by the distributor, Bioline Laboratories of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.  </P></p>

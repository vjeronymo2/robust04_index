			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / International Company News: Fiat pins hopes on new model FIAT, the Italian motor group, hopes foreign sales of its new Punto small car, to go on sale early in November, will open the way to an export-led recovery for its car activities. Mr Paolo Cantarella, managing director of the Fiat Auto subsidiary, compared the Punto's importance with the Fiat Uno, the award-winning small car which reversed Fiat's decline in the early 1980s. Mr Cantarella expected up to 50 per cent of Punto production to be sold abroad, against 40 per cent for the Uno. Fiat is releasing the new model, in which it has invested more than L5,600bn (Dollars 3.5bn), simultaneously in Italy, France and Germany. Mr Cantarella admitted the segment of the European car market into which the Punto fitted was by far the most competitive. Rivalry in the 'B' segment, which includes the VW Polo and Renault Clio, was set to stiffen as other manufacturers, which had previously concentrated on bigger cars, diversified into smaller models. Fiat is depending on the Punto to spearhead an improvement in sales, notably in the home market it once dominated. Fiat's share of the Italian market has plunged to around 44 per cent from about 60 per cent in the late 1980s. The group's position has been exacerbated by this year's 26 per cent fall in domestic car sales. 'We don't underestimate the difficulties the industry is facing. However there's no reason to suppose we can't return to development and recovery,' said Mr Cantarella. The Punto is expected to sell between 60,000 and 70,000 units this year  - too few to affect Fiat's 1993 results. However, sales should reach between 450,000 and 500,000 in 1994. Fiat will release first-half sales and earnings figures later this month.</p>

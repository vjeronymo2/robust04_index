			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up MIDDLE EAST Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets has launched the first regional Middle East closed-end fund on the New York stock exchange. In a global placing it has so far raised Dollars 42m. The fund, which is FCEM's first US listed fund, is investing 65 per cent in securities of Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan and Oman. Because of US legislation it will never invest in Iran, Iraq or Libya. SURVEY China remains the highest priority among international companies wishing to make an investment in an emerging economy, according to a survey of 100 companies conducted by Ernst &amp; Young. After China, India and Indonesia attract attention, while the most important factor in attracting inward investment was that of political stability. The survey sought to identify the investment intentions of 1,000 multinational companies and to explore the decision making process that accompanied such expansion. INDIA India's recently-launched National Stock Exchange (NSE) plans to start screen-based equities trading next month. The NSE will initially trade in 200 shares from November 3. But plans to expand to 500 shares in the next six months are expected to eat into the business of the Bombay stock exchange, which accounts for 75 per cent of turnover of all the stock exchanges. The BSE has a market capitalisation of Dollars 130bn from over 6,000 listed companies. The BSE is switching from open outcry trading to a screen-based system from January 1995. The BSE officials have also announced plans to introduce options and futures once the entire trading is screen-based and settlement procedures improved. The NSE was conceived in 1990, mainly out of frustration with brokers' refusal to accept any change in antiquated trading practices. RUSSIA The Moscow Commodity Exchange, one of the main dollar futures trading centres in Russia, is to launch a western-style stock market before the end of the year. Dozens of stock exchanges have been set up in Russia, but only a few trade securities, and their trading volumes are very small. The bulk of the market is in the hands of brokers trading over the counter. Several of these brokers have set up an electronic quote system and are working on developing a share trading system linked to a depositary. POLAND The Warsaw stock exchange has approved for listing shares in Remak, an engineering company, and Debica, the tyre maker, as well as four new issues of listed companies. Remak and Debica were floated earlier this year, while the four quoted companies - BIG, Elektrim, Mostostal Warszawa and Zywiec - won listing for new shares issued in February and March this year. BUDAPEST The Budapest stock exchange will introduce an official share index on January 1 1995. Since the opening of the bourse on June 21 1990, the index has been used as an unofficial weighted index, which currently reflects the price movements of 13 of the BSE's 39 shares.

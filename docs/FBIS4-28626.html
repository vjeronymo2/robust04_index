			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 13 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  said on Monday that South Korea would cope with the nuclear  question with flexibility depending on the attitude of North  Korea under the "grand principle that Pyongyang's nuclear  development should be checked by all means."    "The U.N. Security Council is expected to begin debate on  the  nuclear issue beginning this week," Kim said. "I am sure our  goal would be met satisfactorily step by step."    While meeting with the visiting Japanese members of the  Korea- Japan Parliament Union led by Kazuya Ishibashi, the  president said the existing cooperative system among South  Korea, the United States and Japan is essential to thwarting  North Korea's nuclear program.    Discussing his recent visit to Russia, Kim said Russian  President Boris Yeltsin promised him not to sell weapons to  North Korea.    "The Korean war-related documents Russia handed to us during  my visit contain so fresh information that some school text  books on the Korean war would have to be rewritten," the  president said.</p>

			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why Hercule Poirot is, of course, right - Serious Money 'POIROT,' I said, lowering my copy of the financial pages, 'I've been thinking of investing in shares. The stock market is close to its all time high at the moment and a fellow at my club gave me a few tips.' The great Belgian detective, who was busy arranging his change in order of coin size, looked up in irritation. 'Hastings,' he said, 'You are not using your little grey cells. Why do you want to buy shares when their price is high? Would you wait to buy one of your vintage cars until it is dear? Shares, like anything else, should be bought when they are cheap.' I had to put him right. Poirot thinks he is the authority on every subject but this was an area where I felt that, because of my friends in the City, I had the advantage. 'But my broker is very enthusiastic about the economic recovery in 1992 . . .' 'Of course he is, Hastings. The markets have anticipated the recovery already. All the good news is in the price.' 'So, I suppose you have all the answers,' I said, in an attempt at sarcasm. My friend, vain as ever, ignored me. 'Do you not remember, mon ami, that most of my great cases have involved nursery rhymes? Hickory Dickory Dock, One, Two, Buckle My Shoe, A Pocketful of Rye . . .' 'That was Miss Marple,' I rashly pointed out. 'Nom d'un nom d'un nom,' cried Poirot, 'Do not mention that woman. She is played by the remarkable Joan Hickson and who do I get? Someone with a surname like raw fish.' 'It's Suchet, not sushi,' I pointed out. 'Do not interrupt me, Hastings. I was saying that there is a lot of significance in nursery rhymes. In the stock market, the best known rhyme is 'Sell in May, and go away. Come back on St Leger day.' You should consider it carefully.' 'Sounds like mumbo-jumbo to me,' I said. 'But listen to this, Hastings,' he replied. 'I asked Miss Lemon, our efficient secretary, to run through the Datastream machine, the return on the All-Share Index between May 1 and September 14 . . .' 'The date of this year's St Leger,' I said, having recently read the Sporting Life. 'Exactly, Hastings. She produced the returns for every year back to 1965. In 20 of those 26 periods, the May-September period produced lower returns than did the remainder of the year. Over the whole period, if you had invested in the All-Share on May 1 and sold on September 14, you would have made a capital return, on average, of just 0.6 per cent a year. Investing on September 15 and selling on April 30 would have made you an average annual capital gain of 11.8 per cent.' 'But why on earth should this be?' I asked. Poirot took a reflective sip of his creme de menthe. 'I believe it relates to your English love of le sport. Summer comes and you attend Ascot, Henley, Wimbledon . . .' 'Lord's,' I added. 'I leave the details to you, Hastings. In any case, the men who buy the shares are away from their offices, studying the silly points and the backward short legs. The market drifts and prices fall. So you see, Hastings, you should not be so eager to invest. Like so many private investors, you jump in when prices rise. If they fall, you will be disillusioned and sell at the bottom, losing much of your money. Your broker is, as you say, leading you up the garden walk.' I was too confused to correct his simile. 'So you are not keen on shares at all?' 'You misrepresent me, mon ami,' said the detective, wandering over to the mirror to check that his moustache was neat and tidy. 'Even I, Hercule Poirot, cannot know for certain how shares will move in future. I was just correcting your unscientific reasoning.' He paused to straighten the angle of some papers on his desk. 'I have been a very successful stock market investor over the years, Hastings. How else do you think that I, who left the Belgian police force during the First World War, have lived in such style for so long? It was not by investing in vegetable marrow futures.' 'In 1945, I used the Pounds 1,000 fee from the Duke of Eboracum affair to buy shares in the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust. Had I reinvested the income, they would now be worth over half a million pounds. As it is, the dividends allow me to enjoy my few luxuries. Had I put the same amount into one of the building societies of which you English are so fond, the same amount, even with the income reinvested, would be worth only around Pounds 9,000.' Poirot pointed an accusing finger at me, as he had at so many murderers in the past. 'You must be patient, Hastings. Do not rush in to the stock market on a whim. It is a long term business. Even if you had just matched the BZW Equity Index over the last 46 years, your Pounds 1,000 would have turned into Pounds 127,000.' 'Enough,' I cried, 'I submit. I will wait a while before buying shares, and then I will take a long-term view.' I put down the financial pages and picked up another paper. 'Now there must be some other sensible way for me to invest. I wonder what's running in the 3.30 at Newmarket?' The next moment, a pair of Poirot's moustache curlers flew narrowly past my head.</p>

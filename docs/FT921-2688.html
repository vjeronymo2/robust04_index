			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Washington plays down use of force against Iraq THE US administration yesterday played down the likelihood of using force to make Iraq comply with the United Nations' requirement that it eliminate its weapons of mass destruction, but senior officials said they intended to maintain diplomatic pressure through the UN on Iraq. Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, said the US believed the Security Council was 'the appropriate forum in which the matter ought to be pursued'. 'We are hopeful that the Iraqis will recognise, as they have previously, that their only choice is to comply with the UN resolutions which they agreed to, and that the matter can be resolved by diplomatic means through the United Nations.' Mr Edward Djerejian, assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs, also told a congressional committee yesterday that the US wanted to concentrate on stiffening UN inspections of Iraqi missile and weapons plants. 'Our focal point right now is in the UN Security Council, to reinvigorate, to invigorate, to make more intrusive the inspection regime in Iraq.' US and UK ambassadors clashed angrily in the Security Council last week with Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister, over charges that Iraq was deliberately obstructing the efforts of UN inspectors to locate and destroy the country's missile equipment. Tension rose a notch with the announcement that a new US aircraft carrier group had entered the Gulf, although Pentagon officials described the movement as routine. Mr Djerejian said the crux of the conflict was President Saddam Hussein's determination not to implement the UN resolution which would allow Iraq to sell some oil, on condition that the proceeds were placed under UN supervision and used both to buy food and medical supplies for the Iraqi population and to defray the costs of the UN inspection teams. 'The reason he is doing that is that he does not want Iraqi oil proceeds to be funnelled through a UN mechanism. He simply wants a direct handle on all oil proceeds so that he can spend the money as he sees fit,' Mr Djerejian said. 'He has deliberately tried to weaken the will of the international community, but the will of the international community has not been weakened,' he added.</p>

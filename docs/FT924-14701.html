			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Buyers start to respond to wide yield spreads THE dramatic widening of Eurodollar bond spreads slowed yesterday as investors started to buy paper again. The differential between Eurodollar bond yields and US Treasury yields has widened by about 30 basis points since last month. Dealers said spreads were at their widest point since early 1990, having reached historically tight levels earlier this year. For example, Ontario's Dollars 2bn five-year issue launched last month at a spread of 48 basis points over the comparable Treasury yield is now trading at a spread of 77 basis points. However, deals in the secondary market appeared to have found some support yesterday, mainly provided by asset-swapping. At these wider spreads, bank investors can swap fixed-rate bonds for floating-rate assets at attractive margins above the London interbank offered rate. For example, Italy's 8 3/4 per cent bonds due 2001, currently yielding some 126 points over the US Treasury yield curve, can be swapped into floating-rate assets which pay around 85 basis points above Libor. The turmoil in the world's currency and other financial markets, which has encouraged investors to pull back, lies behind the deterioration in Eurobond spreads. But other factors are at work. In particular, last month's change in Italian tax rules - which means that Eurobonds issued by Italy, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank no longer command favourable terms in the repo market - loosed billions of dollars of bonds on an already soggy secondary bond market. The tax rules had caused such Eurobonds to trade at artificially tight spreads, which in turn had held in spreads of other sovereign and supranational paper. Further, the expectation of a surge in issuance by European sovereign borrowers needing to replenish foreign exchange reserves has also depressed sentiment. In the floating-rate sector, Asfinag, the Austrian railway, launched at Dollars 200m five-year issue of notes, via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Elsewhere, Chrysler Credit Canada launched the first Eurobond issue backed by Canadian assets. The CDollars 300m deal, backed by loans made by Chrysler to car dealers, was arranged by Morgan Stanley. The deal is privately placed and details are undisclosed.</p>

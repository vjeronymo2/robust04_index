The Commission has further determined to designate this investigation ``more complicated'' and to direct that the ALJ's ID on remand be issued by November 28, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Shara L. Aranoff, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3090. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  On November 24, 1993, the Commission instituted an investigation of a complaint filed by Pro-Cut International, Inc. (``Pro-Cut'') under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. The complaint alleged that two respondents imported, sold for importation, or sold in the United States after importation certain portable on-car disc brake lathes and components thereof that infringed the sole claim of U.S. Letters Patent 4,226,146 (``the '146 patent''). The Commission's notice of investigation named as respondents Hunter Engineering Company (``Hunter'') and Ludwig Hunger Maschinenfabrik GmbH (``Hunger''), each of which was alleged to have committed one or more unfair acts in the importation or sale of portable on-car disc brake lathes that infringe the asserted patent claim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ALJ conducted an evidentiary hearing on May 2&hyph;4, 1994, and issued his final ID on August 12, 1994. He found that: (1) Respondents' imported product does not infringe the asserted patent claim; (2) complainant satisfied the economic requirements for existence of a domestic industry; but that (3) there is no domestic industry because complainant is not practicing the '146 patent. Based upon his findings no infringement and no domestic industry, the ALJ concluded that there was no violation of section 337. Respondents have not challenged the validity of the '146 patent in this investigation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Complainant Pro-Cut filed a petition for review of the ALJ's findings on both infringement and the domestic industry's failure to practice the patent. Respondents filed a petition for review of the ALJ's findings on the economic requirements for a domestic industry. Complainant, respondents, and the Commission investigative attorneys filed responses to the petitions for review. No agency comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 28, 1994, the Commission determined, by a vote of four to two, to review the subject ID and to remand it to the ALJ for further explanation on two narrow issues. Specifically, the Commission was unable to discern from the ID the ALJ's reasoning underlying his findings of no infringement and no domestic industry under the doctrine of equivalents. Accordingly, the ALJ was instructed to address the following questions on remand: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Whether the accused device performs substantially the same function as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Whether the accused device operates in substantially the same way as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Whether the accused device achieves substantially the same result as disclosed in the ``means for attaching'' clause in claim 1 of the '146 patent? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. To what scope of equivalents is the '146 patent entitled? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Whether, in light of questions 1&hyph;4 raised above, the domestic industry is practicing the '146 patent under the doctrine of equivalents? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ALJ was further instructed to make specific factual findings with respect to each remanded question, to indicate what record evidence supports those findings, and to provide an analysis of his ultimate determination on each issue. The Commission determined to adopt the ID in all other respects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 28, 1994, the Commission also determined to declare this investigation ``more complicated'' in order to provide the parties, the presiding ALJ, and the Commission with adequate time to address the remanded issues and complete the investigation. The 18-month statutory deadline for completion of this investigation was therefore extended to June 1, 1995. However, the Commission expects to complete the investigation prior to the statutory deadline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1337), and &sect;&sect;210.53, 210.56, and 210.59 of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure (19 CFR 210.53, 210.56, and 210.59). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Copies of the Commission's order, the non-confidential version of the ID, and all other non-confidential documents filed in connection with this investigation are or will be available for inspection during official business hours (8:45 a.m. to 5:15 p.m.) in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, 500 E Street SW., Washington, DC 20436, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3000.

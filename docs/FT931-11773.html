			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Thomas Cook wants Airtours bid referred to MMC THOMAS COOK, the travel agency and financial services group, has added its weight to calls for the Office of Fair Trading to recommend a referral to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of Airtours' hostile bid for rival Owners Abroad. Mr Christopher Rodrigues, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said selective use of statistics was seriously under-estimating the degree of concentration that would occur in the holiday tour market if the merger went through. In December, Owners Abroad and Cook announced a tie-up which will give Owners increased access to the Cook retail chain and some of its products. In return, Cook will take a 10 per cent stake in Owners Abroad. Airtours has argued that the combined group's total market share would be 25 to 27 per cent. Owners Abroad says it would be about 30 per cent. In a submission to the OFT last week, Mr Rodrigues argued that some popular destinations would be dominated to a far greater extent by the enlarged Airtours and Thomson, the market leader. To the Balearics, for instance, the two companies would have 74 per cent of the market; to Florida, they would have 44 per cent; to Turkey 85 per cent; to the Canary Islands 76 per cent; and to Malta 61 per cent. 'My position is that the public position is sufficiently vulnerable that it (a referral) must be considered,' Mr Rodrigues said. 'The OFT has to say to itself there appears to be a serious possibility that this merger could change the basis of competition.' Last year Cook's share of the retail market fell from 11 per cent to 9 per cent, according to Mr Howard Klein, chairman of Owners Abroad. That position was being reversed after mistakes a year ago when 'pricing . . . was not communicated as well as it should have been', according to Mr Rodrigues. He denied Cook would be under pressure in travel retailing if Airtours takeover went ahead and said: 'Thomas Cook is not known for sitting on its hands.' The Consumers' Association and the Association of Independent Tour Operators are among those calling for a referral. Airtours argued there have been no significant structural changes in the industry since 1990 when the MMC cleared Thomson's bid for Horizon Holidays. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p><P> February 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE;  </P> <P> AIRFIELD TO GET MASTER PLAN  </P> <P> County supervisors Tuesday approved preparation of a $150,000 master plan for  new development at Brackett Field, a 208-acre county airport for small planes  in La Verne.  </P> <P> However, the plan may not be completed nor options for new construction  presented to the supervisors until 1991, said Jean Granucci, spokeswoman for  the county Aviation Division.  </P> <P> The county's first step will be to apply for a Federal Aviation Administration  Planning Grant, which would pay 90% of the cost of the master plan and an  environmental report on possible construction. Applicants often wait a year or  two for grant approval, Granucci said.  </P> <P> About 10 of the 25 undeveloped acres at the airfield will probably be reserved  for new airport-related businesses, she said. Other types of businesses would  occupy the other 15 acres, most of it near McKinley Avenue, at the airfield's  southeast entrance.  </P> <P> Brackett Field is next to a $100-million business park that Koll Co. of Los  Angeles is building on E Street.  </P> <P> The airfield, just north of Bonelli Regional County Park, is one of five small  airports run by the county. The others are in Compton, El Monte, Pacoima and  Lancaster.  </P></p>

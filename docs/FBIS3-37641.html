			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Feb 21, BNS -- Russia has issued an  official protest following an incident last night when five  armed men reportedly forced their way into a gatewatch lodge of  the Russian air base at Amari, northwest Estonia, searching for  weapons and later setting the lodge on fire.    The officer-on-duty at the headquarters of the Russian  garrison in Tallinn and local police in the nearby town of Keila  both confirm the incident took place at 2.45 a.m. Five men,  some of them wearing masks, had stopped their car near the gates  of the Russian base.    The assaulters had been carrying one rifle, one pistol and  one hunting rifle.    The Russian senior lieutenant in charge of the guard, who  opened the door of the guardhouse after hearing the noise of a  car engine, received a blow at the head. The men, who then  entered the guardhouse, asked the lieutenant and another Russian  military in the room, a sergeant, if they had any weapons.  After getting a negative answer, the gang ordered the two  military out of the building and to lay on the ground with faces  in the snow.    The five drove away in the same LADA-type car after pouring  gasoline on the guardhouse and setting it on fire. Nobody was  injured in the incident.    The Russian military say the men had first spoken Estonian,  and afterwards, Russian with an Estonian accent.    These reports have been confirmed by the commander of the  Russian base, Col. Mikhail Kovalyev, who declined to provide  any further information.    Estonian police officials in the town of Keila said they  will  start investigation into the incident by first meeting the  commander of the base.    Estonian Ambassador Juri Kahn was called in at the Russian  Foreign Ministry in Moscow today to receive Russia's official  protest.    Officials at the Central Staff of Estonia's armed forces  said  they had no information so far on possible participation of  Estonian military or the paramilitary Defense League members in  the assault.    The aide-de-camp of Estonia's commander in chief, however,  said it was surprising that Estonia was first informed of the  incident only through Moscow, since Russian military at the  Amari base until now had always contacted the Estonian central  staff if any problems emerged.    Estonian top officials have issued no comments so far.    The base at Amari is the last of former Soviet air force  bases in Estonia that remains under Russian control. Russia has  taken away all combat aircraft from Amari, but the landing field  there is frequently used by Russian military transport planes.</p>

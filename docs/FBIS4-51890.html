			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri yesterday urged  Cambodians to discuss their problems and called on outsiders to  refrain from interfering.    "As long as there is no reconciliation among Cambodians,  fighting will continue," Squadron Leader Prasong said.    "Other countries should not encourage division among them  (Cambodians) or extend military support for them to fight each  other," he added.    The minister reaffirmed support for a Round Table among the  Cambodians but stressed that Thailand would not be involved in  the peace talks.    "The Round Table has nothing to do with Thailand," he said.  "The whole affair is a matter for the Cambodians in which we do  not want to be involved," he added.    Thailand would extend economic, social or health assistance  to Cambodia but will not intervene in the country's political  affairs, he said.    As for fighting spilling over the border into Thailand, the  minister said military authorities had been able to compile  damage estimates so that the Foreign Ministry can file a report  to the Cambodian government.</p>

			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price hits 23-month high THE GOLD market frothed up again yesterday and in late trading the dollar price in London broke through another pychologically-important barrier to close at Dollars 370.25 a troy ounce, its highest for 23 months. Traders suggested the price was being driven up by the momentum of options activity which created extreme volatility at key price levels. 'The higher it goes, the higher it will go,' said one. More investment fund money poured in yesterday, dealers said. 'There are too many fund managers around the world with no gold in their portfolios and now gold looks like being the best-performing asset in the second quarter (of 1993) they must get some,' said one observer. Another comments: 'Gold is on the fringe of the financial markets and it is a market where serious money goes a long way'. Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst at Bain Securities, part of the Deutsche Bank group, said chart watchers believed that once gold's price broke through resistance at Dollars 371-Dollars 372 an ounce there was nothing much to stop it going to Dollars 380 and then Dollars 400. 'It is difficult to find anything that might stop it. We could see Dollars 425 much more quickly than some people expect.' He pointed out that two gold producers had announced they had unwound some forward sales and more might follow. He estimated that producers had sold forward 90 to 100 tonnes of gold at receivable prices below the present spot price. If spot prices rose to between Dollars 380 and Dollars 400 an ounce, forward sales totalling 300 to 400 tonnes would be in that situation.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BUSH STAGES SEND-OFF FOR CRIME BILLS;  </P> <P> LAWMEN APPLAUD PROMISE 'TO STAND UP FOR POLICE OFFICERS'  </P> <P> President Bush, promising "to stand up for the police officers," formally sent  Congress a $1.2-billion anti-crime package today proposing tougher sentences  for gun-related crimes and construction of more prisons.  </P> <P> Praising law officers as "domestic freedom fighters," Bush said, "Let's put the  handcuffs on the criminals, not on the criminal justice system."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Bush said a person suspected of a crime "should be treated  with respect and given his rights or her rights, even though the evidence looks  overwhelming."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unveiled a Month Ago  </P> <P> Bush unveiled his anti-crime program a month ago but decided to make a special  occasion out of the usually routine transmittal of the plan to Congress. He  flew nearly 1,000 miles to southeast Georgia to sign the draft legislation at  the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, where agents and police officers  from 60 agencies and every state are enrolled.  </P> <P> A crowd of several thousand people, mostly students, instructors and their  families, listened to Bush's speech under a baking sun.  </P> <P> Repeating a warning to criminals that he made earlier this year at the funeral  of murdered Drug Enforcement Administration Agent Everett Hatcher in New York,  Bush said, "Better that you had never been born than to attack one of America's  finest."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Central Planks of Program  </P> <P> He was applauded loudly as he outlined three of the central planks of his  anti-crime platform: doubling to 10 years the mandatory term for use of  semiautomatic weapons in crimes involving violence or drugs; eliminating  plea-bargaining for violent federal firearms offenses, and an expanded federal  death penalty for killers and terrorists.  </P> <P> The most costly part of Bush's plan calls for spending $1 billion for new  prison construction, in addition to $500 million already earmarked for that  purpose.  </P> <P> He also proposed hiring 825 new federal agents and staff and 1,600 new  prosecutors and staff.  </P></p>

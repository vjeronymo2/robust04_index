			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Survey of European Finance and Investment - Portugal (3): Target is to exceed EC growth - The Economy THE PORTUGUESE government may be perfecting a cure for a malady that makes life miserable for finance ministers - the need to set macroeconomic targets and the almost inevitable need to explain why they have not been met. So it is with convergence - the effort being made by member states of the European Community to raise the performance of their economies in order to be able to form a monetary union by the end of the decade. Portugal, like its neighbour, Spain, and a number of other EC members, has previously published a series of inflation, growth and debt targets to guide policy-making as monetary union approaches. Unfortunately, not many of these targets are being met as Europe falls into economic recession. In Lisbon, though, Mr Jorge Braga de Macedo, the finance minister, deals neatly with the problem. It does not matter, he argues, that official forecasts of the country's economic growth this year have fallen from, first, 3 to 2 per cent and, finally, to 1.75 per cent. In fact, the minister does not even blanch at suggestions that Portugal's GDP could grow at less than 0.5 per cent this year. What matters is that it grows faster than the EC average. That way, even zero growth would imply continued convergence if the rest of the Community were in recession. 'I don't want to harp on numbers,' he says. 'We believe we will continue to grow by more than the rest of the Community.' That confidence is crucial now. Portugal is being buffeted by some strong winds. Critically for an export-led economy, its two biggest trading partners, Germany and Spain, are either close to recession or in it. And while inflation is falling - it currently hovers at between 7 and 8 per cent - the government is committed to a stable exchange rate policy which forces it to keep interest rates frustratingly high. Economic growth may above the EC average but it is a far cry from the buoyant late 1980s. Unemployment, while extremely low at just over 4 per cent, is likely, economists say, to rise about 2 percentage points this year and wages are going up at an average 9 to 11 per cent if you listen to private sector analysts or, according to the finance minister, between 8 and 9 per cent. Perhaps most worrying to the authorities, though, has been a series of niggling problems with the escudo. This started during the currency turmoil in Europe last autumn. While the currency weathered the initial storm quite well, the Portuguese were forced into a 6 per cent devaluation last November when Spain devalued. Ironically, the escudo quickly recovered after that but was hit again in March by the resignation of the deputy governor of the Bank of Portugal. The affair was quickly and credibly explained away as so much political theatre but the markets were not listening and have been doggedly testing Lisbon's resolve. Intervention by the Bank of Portugal cost it 10 per cent of the country's non-gold reserves in March. The central bank also chivvied short-term interbank rates up from around 13 per cent to 25 per cent at the peak. Although Mr Miguel Beleza, governor of the Bank of Portugal, quite discards the possibility that Portugal would, as Spain did to its discredit last year, resort to capital controls to defend the escudo, he insists that 'we can and we will use the instruments at our disposal (interest rates and reserves)' to defend the escudo's parity. Despite this resolve to hold the escudo within its current parity band in the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, calming down the markets, he concedes, 'has taken longer than we would have liked'. Neither he nor independent economists believe the attacks will continue much longer. Short-term rates have already fallen back to around 18 per cent and the bank believes it has ample reserves - some Dollars 17bn - to fend off attackers and to hold the escudo above Es93 to the D-mark. Typically, both the Bank and the finance ministry rule out a Lisbon-inspired realignment in the ERM, in which the escudo could gain a little competitiveness. 'We believe exchange rate stability is crucial,' Mr Beleza says. Fortunately for Portugal, non-residents do not actually own many escudos but the nature of the attack on the currency is changing and, believes Mr Rui Martins Dos Santos, chief economist with Banco Portugues de Investimento, perhaps becoming more dangerous. Last autumn, the assault consisted of foreign institutions selling their long positions in escudo securities. The volume of shares, bonds and money market instruments in foreign hands has fallen from Es800bn last September to Es350bn now. At almost the same time, worried Portuguese companies began paying back foreign loans in order to borrow in escudos. First, though, they had to borrow foreign currency to pay the original loans back, thus further weakening the escudo. Mr Beleza now sees the short positions that foreign institutions have taken in the escudo as being much more problematic, potentially, for the central bank. These positions are modest but he believes the Bank was wrong to resort to an interest rate defence of the currency after the resignation of his deputy. The fact that rates moved so quickly caught the market's attention, he says. 'It was counterproductive. Predators can see the fear in the eyes of their victims,' he says. 'It's better to have one or two sharks nibbling away than to have a whole lot of blood in the water. That just attracts more.' The sharks, if they care, will also have noticed recent pledges by the government to pump about Es1,000bn into housing, agriculture and exporting programmes over the next few years despite many proclamations in the past of its fiscal discipline. Is the government's political nerve failing? Its political programme will have an impact on the budget from next year - though much of the total will come from EC transfers and includes the value of land the government plans to give away. That may slow progress towards convergence, but Mr Braga de Macedo is quick to point out that Lisbon's convergence programme commits it to meeting only EC averages and not the strict monetary union targets established in the Maastricht treaty. Economists like Mr Dos Santos like what they see. 'Policy is becoming more flexible,' he says. 'The government needs to pay much more attention to the economy and forget a little about nominal convergence.' How quickly these programmes put money into the pockets of construction companies, farmers and exporters remains to be seen but both the finance minister and independent analysts believe the current slump is different and that Portugal is poised to make an important break with its economic past. Mr Dos Santos argues that even if Portugal does slip into recession, it will be this year and it will be short and shallow. Typically, Portugal would go into recession much later than its main trading partners but the hope in Lisbon is that, this time, it will recover along with the rest. But the speed with which recession has overtaken Spain has clearly alarmed the Portuguese and it may be that the 'last in, first out' conjecture is just wishful thinking. 'Our great concern is to avoid the impression that there is nothing we can do in the crisis,' says the finance minister. 'This time we have a medium-term strategy in place and the economy continues to show a resilience which the government hopes will enable it to pick up with the rest of Europe. Our cycle is always late and we need to hold on until recovery occurs.'</p>

			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Letter: Secession in India Sir, With reference to Joe Rogaly's article on India ('Passage to India', April 23) and the subsequent letter from Mr Pritam Singh (May 3), while there may well be a good case for decentralisation in India, by giving more powers to the states, this should not be confused with the aims of those demanding secession. Less centralisation could be good for India, but allowing secession of any part of the country should not be encouraged. It would weaken India and damage regional stability.

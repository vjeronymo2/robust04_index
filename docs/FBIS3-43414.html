Shots, volleys, and explosions  continued almost uninterruptedly at 1900 GMT. No information  has so far been obtained from any official source on the cause  or exact location of the shooting. For security reasons, it has  not been possible to go to the area. A soldier contacted by  telephone at the RIT camp refused to comment and hung up  immediately, shouting: "There is no one around."    According to an informed source, there had been reports that  Head of State General Gnassingbe Eyadema was at 1900 in the  company of Prime Minister Joseph Koffigoh at his private Lome II  residence, a few kilometers from the camp. His official  residence where he normally spends the night is located within  the RIT barracks. As soon as the first shots were heard, panic  gripped inhabitants of the capital and the streets got deserted  within a matter of minutes as the night began to fall. In March  last year, Gen. Eyadema narrowly escaped an attack launched by a  group of armed men against his RIT camp residence. The  government then blamed that operation on the opposition in exile.</p>

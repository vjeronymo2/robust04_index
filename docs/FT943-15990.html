			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Easier yen and consumer spending hopes lift Nikkei The retreat in the yen lifted sentiment, and hopes of strong consumer spending due to the hot summer weather focused hopes on consumer electronic stocks as the Nikkei 225 average rose on buying by financial institutions, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index put on 202.44 at 20,834.37 after opening at the day's low of 20,650.03 and peaking at 20,907.58 in the afternoon. Arbitrage selling late in the session eroded some of the afternoon gains. Volume totalled 393m shares, against Monday's 248m. Foreign investors were absent ahead of the US Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting, the German Bundesbank council meeting and the Group of Seven meetings in Naples later in the week. Some domestic investors remained cautious over currency fluctuations and the waning prospect of a co-ordinated move on interest rates by the US, Japan and Germany. However, brokers said investor confidence seemed to be returning slowly, following reports of rising sales of clothing and air conditioners thanks to the hot weather, and of spending prompted by the cut in income tax. The Topix index of all first section stocks added 10.76 at 1,683.49 and the Nikkei 300 was up 2.28 at 306.28, while advances outscored declines by 686 to 338, with 164 issues unchanged. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged forward 2.37 to 1,371.83. High-technology shares rose on the yen's decline to the Y99 level to the dollar. Oki Electric climbed Y22 to Y817, Toshiba Y18 to Y830, Sharp Y30 to a year's high of Y1,890 and Matsushita Electric Industrial Y30 to Y1,850. Brokers bought prospective beneficiaries of the country's heat wave. The air conditioner retailer Hitachi Sales advanced Y35 to Y748 and Best Denki Y50 to Y1,920. Brewers were also stronger, Kirin Brewery rising Y40 to Y1,220 and Sapporo Lion, a beer hall operator, Y40 to Y1,530. Hopes of a sales increase supported department stores and supermarkets, Marui appreciating Y60 to Y1,960 and Daiei Y20 to Y1,780. Terumo, a medical equipment maker, rose by its daily limit of Y103 to Y1,020 on reports of its development of a three dimensional television. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which had gained on the telecommunication theme, dipped Y1,000 to Y871,000 on profit-taking. East Japan Railway lost Y1,000 at Y509,000.

Posco and Samsung Electronics went limit up for a second day, adding Won2,000 and Won2,500 at Won71,000 and Won92,000 respectively. HONG KONG was unable to make progress after another day of thin, narrow trade. The Hang Seng index ended 5.09 easier at 8,623.19, near the bottom of the day's 45-point range. Turnover edged up to a preliminary HKDollars 1.56bn from Monday's adjusted HKDollars 1.31bn, which was an 18-month low. Hong Kong Ferry provided the day's sole spark, jumping HKDollars 1.55 to HKDollars 14.55 after the government announced the start of final negotiations on the company's pier and commercial development plans. TAIPEI reversed early gains after late profit-taking in fin-ancials. The weighted index, which moved in a 79-point range, ended 2.68 off at 6,064.95. Turnover came to TDollars 63.98bn.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chen Baojiu (7115 1405 3773): "Can China's </F> Foreign Trade Catch the World's Express Train in the 1990's?"]    [Text] Looking at the world today, we cannot deny this  fact: The question of economy has gradually replaced political  and military confrontation as the main theme of the times, while  competition in science and technology is playing the role of the  commanding point in trials of comprehensive strengths among  nations. Ever since the beginning of the 1990's, economic  regional collectivization has developed by leaps and bounds  across the world, and trade wars have become increasingly  white-hot between regions and nations. Vigorous development of  multinational companies has given a powerful impetus to economic  globalization. Accelerated progress of a new technological  revolution has prompted the industrialization of high technology  in developed countries, which is expected to become a new trend  in the world. All these are fostering a tremendous change in the  world's industrial structure.    This is the international environment China has to face in  developing its foreign trade in the 1990's. Both opportunities  and challenges exist. The key question is how to draw up an  economic development strategy in line with our national  conditions so as to guide our foreign trade and the reform and  opening-up drive and to quicken our process of modernization.    In the 1990's, we should carry out a grand economic and  trade strategy--that is, opening widely to the outside world on  all sides, in diverse areas, and through multiple channels;  integrating economic and trade cooperation among domestic  industries and such cooperation with countries in the world; and  giving full play to foreign trade's guiding role and  comprehensive services for our economic development.    We may say that if our country is to take a foothold in  the world's trade, we must blaze between brambles a new trail  for foreign trade development in line with our national  conditions. A "grand economic and trade strategy" will no doubt  assist us macroeconomically in opening such a trail.    The "grand economic trade strategy" should be taken as  China's overall economic and trade strategy for the 1990's. It  means "great opening, wide-scale integration, and a big change  in functions."    Great opening. We should increase the depth and breadth of  our foreign economic and trade activities so as to create a  situation of opening on all sides, in diverse areas, and through  multiple channels.    Great integration. This means the integration of different  foreign economic and trade operations, the integration of  multilateral, regional, and bilateral economic and trade  cooperation, and the integration of trade, industry,  agriculture, technology, banking, and commerce.    A big change in functions. While increasing its  contributions, foreign trade should serve the purpose of  readjusting our industrial structure and speeding up the  development of technology-intensive industries. It should also  play a guiding role and provide comprehensive and multifacet  services for our economic development.    Now, let us make a forecast. This overall strategy will  bring our foreign trade to the following state in the 1990's:    --Our foreign trade will change from its self-devised  system to an open form of development. In the 1990's, under the  overall situation of opening widely at home and toward the  outside world, our foreign trade must also develop in an open  way. Barriers between different trades should be removed, and  their activities should be allowed to diffuse into each other's  areas. We should combine trade, industry, agriculture,  technology, commerce, and banking into an organic whole and give  a fuller play to foreign trade's overall guidance role and  comprehensive service function in developing the economy.    --Our foreign trade operations will change from extensive  to intensive operations. The export volume will be expanded  mainly through the improvement of the quality of export  products, increase in their varieties and designs, and creation  of famous brands. Returns from both export and import businesses  will be boosted to a fairly big extent.    --The principal exports will change from primarily  processed products with a low added value to intensively  processed products and manufactured goods with a high added  value. The makeup of imports will also be changed--an increase  will be noted in proportion of advanced technology and equipment  in the total amount of import.    --Readjustment and reorganization of foreign trade  enterprises will be put in high gear through the formation of  Chinese-type business companies. It is expected that a  "pyramidic" foreign trade enterprise structure headed by about  10 large transnational companies will come into being by the end  of this century. The objective is to raise our competitiveness  in world trade.    --In the 1990's, division of labor among foreign trade  enterprises will develop toward this goal: diversified  businesses for a few big enterprises; specialized operations for  most small and medium-sized enterprises.    --Rational disparity will exist between different  localities in developing export-oriented industries. Foreign  trade operations will tend to concentrate in cities on sea  coasts, along rivers, and on the border with convenient  transportation and information facilities, abundant foreign  trade manpower, and well-developed infrastructures. Particular  efforts will be made to better utilize the all-round favorable  conditions of traditional trade ports such as Guangzhou, Dalian,  Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin.    In the 1990's, technology imports should aim at directly  participating in international division of labor instead of  achieving 100 percent domestic production. Emphasis should be  placed on import of technologies for the machinery, electronics,  petrochemical, and certain new- and high-tech industries as well  as related upstream and downstream industries, including  materials and equipment industries.    Technological progress is a key factor for improving a  country's industrial structure and the international  competitiveness of its products, thus changing its own  conditions for promoting foreign economic relations and trade.  For a developing country like ours, technology imports are a  main avenue leading to technological progress .    In view of the drastic changes that will take place in  China's internal and external environments during the mid- and  late-1990's, experts and academics deem it imperative to study  and formulate a technology import program for the new situation  based on the requirements of the grand economic and trade  strategy. In this regard, they say, we must draw on the  successful experience of Japan and Korea. That is, while beefing  up technology imports, we must energetically readjust the  methods and the makeup of such imports. The strategy to be  applied should be gearing our technology imports to strategic  industries (meaning technology-intensive industries). We should  devote great efforts to promoting the technological progress of  strategic industries and shortening as much as possible the time  of transit from import substitution to export promotion so as to  achieve the goal of making strategic industries the leading  export industries by the end of this century.    Based on the above mindset, the following changes should  be made in our technology imports in the mid- and late-1990's:    First, it is imperative to expand the scale of technology  imports. Every effort should be made to raise to an appropriate  extent the percentage of advanced technology and equipment in  the total import from the previous levels of 30.8 percent and 33  percent registered in 1989 and 1990 respectively.    Secondly, we should speed up the implementation of the  technology import strategy that emphasizes strategic industries.  In the post-war period, Japan has carried out a strategy of  gearing its technology imports to three categories of big  leading industries (the first category is the thermal power  industry; the second category includes petroleum refining,  petrochemicals, iron and steel, and shipbuilding; and the third  category covers automobiles, household electrical appliances,  and so on). Efforts have also been made to integrate technology  imports closely with its own research and development program.  As a result, it has not only digested, assimilated, and improved  the imported technologies, but also created new technologies of  its own. This has enabled the country to achieve great success  in quickly raising its labor productivity and international  competitiveness and bringing its leading industries from the  state of import substitution to the road of export-oriented  development. In the mid- and late-1990's, China should increase  its technology imports and boost its research and development  efforts in the fields of the machinery, electronics,  petrochemical, and certain new- and high-tech industries as well  as related upstream and downstream industries, including  materials and equipment industries. The purpose is to speed up  the pace toward the promotion of exports instead of relying on  imports.    In view of the fact that China will face an open  environment internally and externally in the mid- and  late-1990's, China's technology imports should be changed from a  simple import model to a multifacet model. This means that  advanced technologies should be introduced into our country in  diversified ways, including technological cooperation, science  and technology exchanges, utilization of foreign capital,  overseas investment, and technology and equipment imports. In  addition, all-inclusive imports should be replaced by selective  imports. That is, we should decide on the basis of our own  backgrounds and conditions whether it is appropriate to import  the whole package of machinery, equipment, and technology or  part of the technology or just certain parts and elements of the  machinery or equipment and the related technology. Our basic  goal should be direct participation in international division of  labor rather than 100 percent domestic production.    We arrived at the above conclusion after paying a high  price. Taking our computer industry as an example, our country  has, since the 1980's, imported some production lines for the  most popular computer models of the times. Nonetheless, while we  are still digesting and assimilating the technologies related to  these models and trying to increase the percentage of  domestically made parts and elements for our computer  industry--which is essentially the assembly of imported  parts--new breakthroughs in computer technology have been made  by foreign countries. All of a sudden, our imported computer  production lines have been pushed to the brink of obsolescence.    From this, we have come to understand that we should,  first of all, have a high starting point and aim at the advanced  international level as our target in planning technology  imports. Secondly, we should stress the importance of various  forms of international technological cooperation and make  China's technology-intensive industries a major link in the  world's industrial technology chain. In no way should we require  everything to be produced domestically. Otherwise, our  technology imports will always lag behind the advanced world  level, the gap will remain forever, and we will fall into an  absurd cycle of "technology imports--domestic  production--lagging behind--technology imports again."    In the 1990's, we should put emphasis on bolstering and  developing the export of products of heavy industries, including  the machinery, electronics, chemical, and metallurgical  industries. We should expand the export of automobiles, complete  sets of equipment, ships, civil airplanes, machines, and  electronic products. And we should assist new-and high-tech  industries, including computer and software, microelectronics,  optoelectronics, biotechnology, and materials technology  industries, in expanding their exports.    Presently, our country's export products consist mainly of  light industrial products, including textiles. A principal  characteristic of these products is that they are of a  low-technology nature and belong to the so-called low-grade  category with a low added value. To develop export under such  circumstances, our effort will be inevitably hindered by a host  of domestic and international factors. The best way to change  this situation is to carry out the strategy of upgrading our  export industries. This means putting more emphasis on  developing technology-intensive industries, primarily heavy  industries and certain new- and high-tech industries. We should  see to it that these industries will become our leading export  industries by the end of the 1990's.    Specific targets are as follows: Stress should be laid on  bolstering and developing the export of products of heavy  industries, including the machinery, electronics, chemical, and  metallurgical industries. We should see to it that these  industries will become our leading industries in the future and  our prime export industries by the end of this century. Of the  products of technology-intensive industries, machinery and  electronic products should account for a big share. We should  boost in a selective manner the export of the following items:  motor vehicles (including motorcycles) and their parts and  accessories, whole sets of equipment, electronic products,  communications devices, ships, civil airplanes, textile  machinery, clocks and watch, general machinery, power plant  machinery, machine tools, bicycles, and cameras. We should make  these items the main exports of our country. In addition, we  should make all-out efforts to develop the export of  high-value-added products turned out by petrochemical, precision  chemical, metallurgical, and building materials industries.  Among these industries, whichever has matured should be put on  the track of export-oriented development as early as possible.    Also, we should assist certain new- and high-tech  industries in boosting their exports, primarily in the fields of  computers and software, communications products, life science,  aviation and space science, microelectronics, optoelectronics,  integration of machinery and electronic devices, nuclear  technology, biotechnology, and materials technology. We should  make them the major exports of our country by the end of 1990's.    Currently, of the nearly $100 billion worth of products  that China exports each year, a sizable part are the products  made by backbone enterprises, which are mostly labor-intensive  enterprises. So the readjustment, upgrading, and updating of the  products of these enterprises are of crucial importance to  China's exports in the 1990's.    To cope with the trend of developing "intellectual type"  and high-grade products for international trade and to meet the  growing demands for high-grade, precision, and advanced products  on the world market, we should shift the stress of our future  efforts to developing intensively and finely processed products.  We should try to create a higher added value from every unit of  material we consume. In the adjustment of our garment industry,  for example, material improvement, development of new fabrics,  intensive processing, and production of high-grade garments may  be taken as our major tasks. In developing intensive food  processing, upgrading and updating household electrical  appliances, and improving the quality of footgear and toys, more  efforts should be devoted to creating brand-name products so as  to boost competitiveness and increase returns. With respect to  primary products, export of raw materials and fuels should be  put under proper control.    The above ideas are based on the views held by experts and  academics as well as the opinions of the government departments  concerned. Some have been or are going to be put into practice.  The "grand economic and trade strategy" is China's overall  strategy for its foreign trade development in the 1990's. The  implementation and realization of this strategy will enable  China's foreign trade to catch the world's fast-running economic  express.    And we have good reason to believe that we will see its  realization by the end of the 1990's.</p>

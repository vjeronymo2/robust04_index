			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Gota Bank sell-off hit as bidder drops out The Swedish government's plans to sell Gota Bank were dealt an unexpected blow yesterday when Svenska Handelsbanken, one of the country's leading commercial banks, pulled out of the bidding. The move means that Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken and Nordbanken are the only bidders for Gota which collapsed into state hands last year under large losses. The only foreign bidder, General Electric, has pulled out. Mr Arne Martensson, Handelsbanken chief executive, said information had emerged 'which made us increasingly hesitant about buying Gota Bank'. His main criticism was that the government's price expectations were far too high. 'A privately-owned international bank like Handelsbanken cannot pay a price for Gota Bank which would risk our rating and our international competitiveness,' he stated. Mr Martensson declined to specify what had emerged during the valuation process to cool the bank's enthusiasm for Gota. A total of SKr43bn (Dollars 5.3bn) of Gota's problem loans have been hived off into a separate entity called Retriva and will not form part of the purchase. Gota Bank has SKr60bn worth of healthy assets which analysts say could attract more than SKr2bn. Observers suggested that SE Banken's credit rating might suffer if it bought Gota Bank, tipping the odds in favour of a purchase by Nordbanken, which was bailed out by the state last year. 'Nordbanken is the front runner now which means that taxpayers' money just shifts from one pocket to the another,' said Mr Peter Mansson, financial analyst with ABB Aros Securities. Some commentators believe that the synergy benefits of a Nordbanken/Gota Bank merger will be considerable, enabling the state to get a better price for the combined entity than two components.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Coastal concerns over oil sought The government yesterday announced a co-operative effort to identify the main environmental concerns in coastal areas likely to be opened up to oil exploration. Mr Tim Eggar, energy minister, said oil companies, environmental groups and local authorities would be involved in preparing reports on the coastal and marine environments of areas which could be included in the forthcoming 16th licensing round, details of which will be announced in the autumn. The UK Offshore Operators Association, an oil industry group representing companies active in the North Sea, will pay for the studies.</p>

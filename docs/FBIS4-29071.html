			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Romain Franklin report: "Pyongyang Confirms Withdrawal </F> From IAEA"]    [Text] Pak Tong-chun, the representative of the general  delegation of North Korea in France, confirmed yesterday to  LIBERATION that his country had withdrawn from the International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and that the United States, which is  the depositary for the ratification instruments of the signatory  states, had been officially notified of this on Monday, 13 June,  in accordance with the required procedure. Nevertheless, North  Korea is still a member of the Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).  On the other hand, "if sanctions are decided by the United  Nations," Mr. Pak said, North Korea "would no longer have any  reason to stay in the NPT" and "will declare war on all those  who seek to align themselves with the American strategy aimed at  strangling our Republic," which, he continued, "can no longer  tolerate attacks on its sovereignty."    The North Korean representative also asserted that the  United  States accepted the principle of a withdrawal of its military  forces from South Korea (37,000 men) within the framework of a  "secret" bilateral agreement concluded between the two countries  in New York in December 1993 and signed in February. Pak did  not provide any evidence of this, however. "The United States  asked us not to divulge this, but since then it has reneged on  all its promises," he continued.    A State Department spokesman responsible for Korean affairs  contacted in Washington refused to comment on these allegations.  He did confirm, however, that a "broad, comprehensive approach"  was the "goal of the talks held between North Korea and the  United States." According to him, Washington agreed, among other  things, to provide "a guarantee of the non-use of nuclear arms  on the Korean peninsula and diplomatic recognition" of the  Pyongyang regime. In exchange, Pak said, Pyongyang "will return  to the NPT and will once again authorize ad hoc IAEA  inspections."    "If the negotiations between North Korea and Washington had  carried on as we requested, the whole problem would have been  resolved," Pak said. However, the United States repeated on  Monday that direct negotiations with Pyongyang would only be  possible if North Korea "regularized its situation with the  IAEA."    The United States is preparing to submit a preliminary draft  resolution to the United Nations aimed at imposing "phased"  sanctions. This process will require "a certain amount of  time," Washington said. It might take even longer since Russian  President Boris Yeltsin said Tuesday that he wanted to make any  "phased" sanctions "dependent" on the holding of a international  conference on Korea. President Clinton does not want this  proposed conference to become an "obstacle" to the imposing of  sanctions.</p>

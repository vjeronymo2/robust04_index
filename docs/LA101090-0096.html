			<p><P> October 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET FACTORY PUTS THE BRAKES ON ARMORED LIMOS FOR YELTSIN  </P> <P> A state-owned auto plant rejected an order from the Russian Federation for  armored limousines for Boris N. Yeltsin and Russian Premier Ivan S. Silayev, an  official said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Ruslan Khasbulatov, vice president of the republic, told the parliament that  the order for four limousines was rejected by the Gorky automotive works and  the Soviet automobile industry minister because permission of the KGB security  agency had not been granted for building the cars.  </P> <P> Yeltsin, the populist who is the effective president of the Russian republic as  chairman of its parliament, previously rejected the idea of riding in a special  limousine. However, the republic ordered the cars for him and Silayev after  Yeltsin was injured in a traffic accident last month.  </P></p>

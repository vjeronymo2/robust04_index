			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Fall in goods orders blights recovery hopes ORDERS for US durable goods fell by 5 per cent last month, casting doubt on the Bush administration's upbeat budget projection of an early economic recovery. The fall in orders was the largest for more than a year, and much greater than Wall Street analysts had expected. Excluding defence, new orders fell by nearly 9 per cent. Much of the weakness was concentrated in the volatile civilian aircraft sector. However, excluding transportation, orders fell 1.6 per cent to register their fifth successive monthly decline. For 1991 as a whole, total orders were down 4.6 per cent - the biggest drop in almost a decade. In the budget, presented on Wednesday, the administration projected an economic recovery from the spring. Most analysts are hoping that lower interest rates and a budgetary fiscal stimulus of perhaps 0.5 per cent of gross domestic product will stimulate growth in the second half of this year. But many remain pessimistic about the immediate outlook. 'Nothing in the recent numbers suggests the economy is about to pick up in a big way,' said Mr William Brown, chief economist at JP Morgan, the New York bank. He expects GDP to contract at an annual rate of 2 per cent in the current quarter, after zero growth in the fourth quarter of last year. Mr Richard Berner, economist at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street brokerage, said the durable goods figures indicated 'continued stagnation in manufacturing'. A fall in the volume of goods shipped also suggested slower growth of US exports, until now one of the bright spots of the economy. Other figures yesterday were little more encouraging. Personal income rose 1 per cent in December, in cash terms. After allowing for inflation and distortions such as higher farm subsidies the real increase was a meagre 0.2 per cent. Personal consumption spending was flat in real terms for the second month running. Labour markets were weak. Initial claims for unemployment insurance rose 24,000 to 468,000 in the week to January 18. Such a level has signalled recession in past business cycles.</p>

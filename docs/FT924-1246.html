			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Merrydown shares rise 10% on listing news SHARES IN Merrydown Wine jumped 10 per cent to 248p as the USM-quoted cider company announced plans for a full listing and the purchase of the Schloer and PLJ brand names for a minimum of Pounds 8.2m. The group said it intended to move to the official list on January 19 under the new name of Merrydown. Mr Richard Purdey, chairman, said the transition had been inevitable, given the likely closure of the Unlisted Securities Market next year. The acquisition of Schloer would give the group 29 per cent of the bottled fruit drink market, complementing its Piermont and Sorrelle products. Merrydown will pay SmithKline Beecham an initial cash consideration of Pounds 4.35m for the brand names, to be funded by the issue of 2.73m shares. At 205p each, the share issue will raise Pounds 5.1m after expenses. A further Pounds 3.4m will be paid over three years. The share capital will increase by 34 per cent as a result of the deal. Mr Purdey said the group would 'work hard to ensure that shareholders' faith is repaid by a very considerable increase in earnings.' The brands are expected to make a marginal contribution in the year to end-March. Mr Purdey said Merrydown would concentrate on expanding the ranges and increasing marketing. Sales of Schloer in 1991 were about Pounds 6.6m, and Pounds 817,000 for PLJ.</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'FAD' ARCHITECTURE  </P> <P> Thank you for a provoking article ("Is Architecture Becoming the Latest  Merchandising Fad?" by Sam Hall Kaplan, Aug. 6). As a graduate of SCI-ARC, I  know well the elitist view noted by Michael Ross.  </P> <P> It is refreshing and encouraging to see an alternative view of the "funky,  punky structures" in such a widely read publication as The Times. Please know  that there are many in the profession who agree with (architect John) Lautner.  </P> <P> To question the validity of the trendy work so prevalent in the media these  days is somewhat akin to the emperor himself pointing out that he has no  clothes.  </P> <P> GREGORY CASTLE  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

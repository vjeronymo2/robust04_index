			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON GERMANY;  </P> <P> SOW THE FERTILE GROUND OF THE EAST;  </P> <P> THE SKILLS, RESOURCES AND MARKETS EXIST FOR A ROBUST TURNAROUND IN THE EAST, IF  NURTURED AND USED WISELY.  </P> <P> As the unification of Germany progresses, the economic transformation of the  old East is proving more complex than the early enthusiasts imagined. The  industrial conglomerates, or kombinates, are particularly resistant to being  turned around in the Western mold; indeed, many are unsalvageable, since they  are committed by design to self-sufficiency, even at the price of efficiency.  As we now can see, it is questionable whether Germany needs another steel plant  east of Berlin, or a car designed and built entirely in the former eastern  territory.  </P> <P> It would be tragic, however, if the skills of the workers employed in those  sectors were no longer utilized. Attractive options exist, such as the  production of automotive parts and components, whether under German, European,  American or Japanese management. It is not car plants in the traditional sense  (which often are nothing more than assembly facilities) but the manufacturing  of parts and components that overwhelmingly accounts for the output of the  entire industry.  </P> <P> We also need to put more stock in the strong suits of the already  well-established economy. Small- and medium-sized companies may be a far better  indicator of economic progress. They are a key ingredient of West Germany's  economic success and many of them export on a global scale. In the East German  case, they provide an important source of new employment: Middle-of-the-road  estimates predict the creation of 1.5 million jobs from this source alone over  the next five years.  </P> <P> What about the services sector? What about our own experiences in the banking  field? Deutsche Bank made a half-billion-dollar investment in about 150 bank  branches in East Germany on July 1 and expects to reach the break-even point  around the turn of the year. Even in the absence of an acceptable level of  telecommunications and data-processing facilities, we have opened as many as  6,000 to 7,000 accounts a day.  </P> <P> And yet, skeptics are quick to cite a number of insurmountable problems.  Accordingly, many misperceptions linger.  </P> <P> One comment often made is that the economy remains in trouble because banks  cannot make loans in the absence of meaningful balance sheets, or at least a  solid business plan. In fact, the situation is much like the early to mid-1950s  when banks could also not go "by the book." Under such circumstances, one  simply has to develop an eye for the entrepreneurial talents of the loan  applicant sitting across the table to determine whether he or she can actually  carry a loan of 50,000 deutschemarks to buy two cabs, or considerably more to  set up a small trucking company.  </P> <P> Another oft-cited issue is employee motivation. East Germans are supposedly  reacting with indifference to the changed circumstances in the work place. In  our business, however, we have found a very high degree of motivation among our  8,500 new employees, although most of them are former employees of the once  sleepy state bank. Younger people especially are very willing to adapt to the  free market. And virtually everybody responds favorably to the end of uniform  pay. With pay based on performance rather than mere presence, there is a reason  to work hard.  </P> <P> The salaries and wages we pay to our employees in the former East German  territory average 50% of those in West Germany. Since the cost of living in the  former has actually declined since the introduction of the deutschemark, that  pay level is quite attractive. This should be good news to those who consider  investing in Germany but worry about its high labor costs. The availability of  locations for industrial sites and the skills of the work force also weigh in  favorably. In addition, anybody willing to invest there can count on various  tax incentives from Brussels or Bonn.  </P> <P> Other observers worry about the excessive costs of such a venture -- which in  light of the long-term benefits should more appropriately be termed an  investment. While the outlays for a new infrastructure are certainly very  large, they also need to be kept in proper perspective. East Germany, unlike  all other East European countries, had little public debt. Therefore, even if  one assumes the "real price tag" of German economic unification to reach a  volume of 250 billion deutschemarks over the next three years, the country's  level of per-capita indebtedness would not rise above what it is today. So the  message for the capital markets is this: While there may be more debt in  absolute terms, the structure of public finance in Germany is going to stay the  same. And there will be 16 million more taxpayers to meet that bill.  </P> <P> But the former East Germany needs more than money. Perhaps no task before us is  more important than the transfer of know-how. For example, East Germany does  not have a viable system of tax collection. Rather than officials from the  finance ministry, what is truly needed are managers of local tax offices who  have the experience to get basic day-to-day operations up and running. Advice  has to be offered not so much from the top down but from the bottom up.  </P> <P> I know of a number of owners of carpenter shops or small construction companies  who are engaged in joint venture in the East or render advice informally on  issues such as where to buy materials, at what prices, and on which terms. In a  place where marketing and purchasing skills are completely underdeveloped,  their expertise falls on fertile ground.  </P> <P> Of course, one has to be very much aware of a delicate psychological balance in  this effort of turning things around. Here again, we Germans face a challenge.  We will have to watch the fine line that lies between offering advice and  teaching with the proverbial index finger raised up high.  </P></p>

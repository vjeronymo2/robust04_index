			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Letters to the Editor: Independent bank is right for democracy Sir, In reading Mr Gerald Holtham's article, 'No case for independent central bank' (September 3), I could not help but ask myself some elementary questions about fiscal versus monetary policy. Specifically, how democratically responsible would it be for a new government to reverse all of the fiscal policies of a prior government, without a check on the monetary side of the equation? If there existed a constitutional guarantee that all elected representatives would pursue anti-inflationary policies, then a non-independent central bank would be tenable. Otherwise, a government which controls both fiscal and monetary levers will always be susceptible to mismanagement. The economic performance of a country is too important to be completely manipulated by the government of the day. Allan Leonard, 133 Amory Street, Cambridge MA 02139, US</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Baiba Melnace] </F>   [Excerpts] Riga, 3 Jun -- [passage omitted] Finance  Minister Uldis Osis emphasized at a press conference that  consultations have been held with representatives of several  international financial organizations in Latvia who expressed a  universally negative opinion on any possible increase in import  tariffs. If tariffs are raised, Latvia will not receive, over  the next two years, approximately $250 million worth of foreign  credits. In addition, the granting of a G- 24 credit would be  canceled. A $90 million credit earmarked by the IMF would be  tied up, and two credit lines at the World Bank would be  suspended -- a $50 million credit for agriculture, and $35  million earmarked for the development of the Latvian Universal  Credit Bank. [passage omitted]    Summarizing the possibilities, an increase in customs  tariffs  would mean a complete change in Latvian economic policy, stated  Osis. Consequently, a move toward protectionism would take  place and any decent competition would be destroyed by  supporting ineffective production.    The finance minister accused the Latvian delegation to the  talks with the European Union, concerning a free trade  agreement, of presenting -- during the course of negotiations --  new, higher customs tariffs instead of the present effective  ones, and deemed it an illegal and wrongful action. "These  tariffs have not been accepted, either by the government or by  the parliament's Budget and Finance Committee, therefore the  delegation had no right to propose such tariffs," stated Osis.    The Latvian Finance Ministry, however, does not at all  intend  to utterly resign from import customs duties, emphasized Osis.  The following compromise is being considered -- for  approximately six agricultural products, tariffs would be raised  by 50-70 percent over the present amount. The types of products  would be determined on the bases of the Latvian agricultural  development program, which has not yet been worked out. After  choosing these five or six products, which will be decided to be  beneficial for Latvia, their production will be supported by  establishing respectively high customs tariffs.</p>

			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> ZIMMER'S LATEST MOVE HELPS CUBS WIN, 4-1  </P> <P> The Chicago Cubs insist that Manager Don Zimmer's unorthodox moves have kept  them loose and have helped make this an exciting season.  </P> <P> The surprise move Zimmer made Sunday at Chicago before the Cubs played the St.  Louis Cardinals may prove to be the key maneuver in the hot race in the  National League East.  </P> <P> Greg Maddux, the Cubs' most dependable pitcher, was scheduled to start the  important game against the Cardinals in the battle for first place. Zimmer, in  a last-minute decision, decided to give Maddux an extra day of rest and start  left-hander Steve Wilson, who had pitched in relief Saturday.  </P> <P> Wilson wasn't the winner in the 4-1 victory that increased the Cubs' lead over  the Cardinals to 2 1/2 games, but he struck out 10 batters in five innings.  </P> <P> Dwight Smith's two-run home run in the sixth inning was the decisive blow that  gave Scott Sanderson the win.  </P> <P> The Cardinals are mostly contact hitters and went into the game with only 713  strikeouts, fewest in the majors. But four Cub pitchers struck out 18  Cardinals. Even hot-hitting Pedro Guerrero struck out three times.  </P> <P> The Cubs, meanwhile, had only three hits off rookie Ken Hill (7-12) in six  innings, but Ryne Sandberg's single preceded Smith's ninth home run.  </P> <P> Zimmer said he decided to hold Maddux back a day for two reasons. First, the  16-game winner had been hit hard in his previous start. And, he is usually more  effective against the predominantly right-hand hitting Montreal Expos, who play  in Chicago today.  </P> <P> "It was the low point of the season Friday when we blew a 7-1 lead," Zimmer  said. "You wonder if you'll ever win again when this happens. That's why the  two victories were so sweet."  </P> <P> Cardinal Manager Whitey Herzog, although unaccustomed to watching his hitters  swing and miss so often, was not downhearted.  </P> <P> "We were 2 1/2 games out last Sunday and faced seven games with the three top  contenders on the road," he said. "So, we're still 2 1/2 back."  </P> <P> Wilson said he had no idea he would be the starter. "When I arrived at the  park, pitching coach Dick Pole told me, Wilson said. "It almost knocked me  over."  </P> <P> San Francisco 5, Houston 3 -- It was a good day for division leaders, as all  four in both leagues increased their leads.  </P> <P> The Giants improved their lead in the West to six games at Houston and they did  it by adding insult to injury.  </P> <P> Bob Knepper, so ineffective most of the season that the Astros released him,  gave up just five hits and two runs in six innings to get the victory that put  a dent in the Astros' pennant hopes. With just 19 games remaining, the Astros  must play 14 on the road where they are under .500.  </P> <P> "There was no special delight in beating the Astros," Knepper said. "It was a  business decision on their part. I really wasn't much help to them."  </P> <P> The hit that helped beat the Astros was Pat Sheridan's three-run double in the  first inning.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 4, New York 1 -- When it's his turn to face the Mets, left-hander  John Smiley's elbow suddenly stops hurting.  </P> <P> After missing three turns with a sore elbow, Smiley held the Mets to four hits  in 8 1/3 innings at New York and the Pirates dropped the Mets 4 1/2 games  behind the Cubs.  </P> <P> Smiley is 7-1 lifetime against the Mets, and the Pirates are 9-5 against them  this season.  </P> <P> Gary Redus homered off Sid Fernandez (11-4) in the seventh inning to put the  Pirates ahead, and the Mets lost all hope in the eighth when center fielder  Juan Samuel played Andy Van Slyke's long fly into a two-run triple.  </P> <P> "I don't know why I've been so successful against the Mets," Smiley (11-7)  said. "I was just glad to pitch without pain."  </P> <P> Philadelphia 4, Montreal 2 -- Rookie Pat Combs struck out eight Expos in seven  innings at Montreal and won his first major league game. The Expos, who have  lost eight of their last 13, are four games behind in the East.  </P> <P> Roger McDowell gave up four hits in two innings of relief, but managed to get  his 18th save.  </P> <P> An angry Pascual Perez (8-13) blamed Manager Bob Rodgers for the loss because  he ordered Von Hayes intentionally walked in the fifth and Tommy Barrett  followed with the go-ahead single.  </P> <P> "It was a stupid decision," Perez said. "I can belong to a team that doesn't  hit, but let me make my own decisions on the mound."  </P> <P> Cincinnati 5, Atlanta 4 -- Pinch-hitter Ken Griffey singled in Paul O'Neill  with one out in the ninth inning at Cincinnati to give the Reds the victory.  </P> <P> Griffey's hit gave the win to bullpen ace John Franco (4-7), who failed to hold  a two-run lead in the top of the ninth.

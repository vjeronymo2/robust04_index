			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Drink: Getting the whisky mix right - Giles MacDonogh gets some advice from a Scotch blender COGNAC distillers often tell you to their great chagrin that they cannot inspire brand-loyalty in the British market: after dinner the drinker calls for 'brandy' which, as far as they are concerned might as well have been made in Timbuktu. With whisky it is just the opposite: 'He's a Bell's man,' 'she's a Cutty Sark drinker,' 'let's give them a bottle of Johnny Walker - they always have that on their drinks tray.' Although Glenfiddich brought malt whisky south of the border nearly 30 years ago, it has yet to seize the public imagination in the same way. Indeed, the Italians drink twice as much malt as the British. Blended whisky accounts for the overwhelming bulk of British sales. There is nothing contemptible, however, about a good blend. Blending, after all is the process which not only rounds off commercial wines, it also shows the skill of the port, champagne or cognac maker. The essential knack is to make each batch resemble the last so that the loyal drinker sees no change between the present bottle and the one he has just finished. J &amp; B Rare is blended by Jim Milne. Jim normally operates from a large series of warehouses near Glasgow Airport. Some - doubtless unpleasant  - business dragged him down to London earlier this yearand I was able to nose through a range of whiskies with him which were earmarked for the J &amp; B blend. One thing I had always wanted to ask a blender was how much the whisky responded to the blender's personal tastes? 'The blender's signature has to be on the blend; if the blender changes then it must change the style to some degree,' says Milne. He said his mightmare was 'character drift' : minute changes in the nature of the raw ingredients. Both grain and malt can be sweet or dry, so no one distillate is the same. The answer to this is to keep back bottles from each batch in order to maintain a hold on the blend. The blender has to be pragmatic. In some years certain component malts are hard to find. When this happens then he needs to find another which will give a similar taste profile. This was the advantage of a large portfolio: 'If I had just one grain whisky and five malts it would be far harder. J &amp; B is a six to six-and-a-half year-old blended whisky made pale by using a minimum of caramel, the chief colouring element in whisky, rum or brandy. The pallor of the spirit clearly recommended itself to the late Graham Greene. In The Human Factor his inept spy drinks J &amp; B because its lack of colour allowed him to pass it off as a heavily watered-down dram. We 'nosed' all the whiskies with added water at a strength of 23 per cent. Milne knew of one blender who tasted whisky at full cask strength (65 per cent) 'and it's reflected in the blend.' I pressed him to tell me who it was, but he refused. Like most blends, J &amp; B is 60 per cent grain whisky, made from unmalted cereals. The rest of the blend is made up of six Highland malts, 11 Speysides, five Lowland malts and four malts from Islay. Ten per cent of the whisky comes from Grand Met's own malt distillery at Knockando on Speyside. At the tasting we tried one of each type. As predicted, the grain whiskies were less exciting than the others. With time, however, they develop a light, almost floral character which is not disagreeable. They remain a foundation for a blend. Recent attempts to market a 100 per cent grain whisky have not met with success. Most malt whisky is blended at eight years. The eight year-old Knockando had an appealing honey-and-porridge smell which set it aside from the others. The unnamed Highland malt was more leathery. The Lowland seemed almost marmalade-like while the Campbelltown malt was reminiscent of a cross between an Islay malt and one from the Highlands. Jim Milne admitted that he did not much like the taste of Islay malts, and that given the choice he would rather drink gin. I suggested that an Islay whisky such as Laphroaig or Talisker was the perfect standby for a long yomp across the heather: 'Only when you can't get your hands on anything else,' he replied. Personal tastes notwithstanding, a small amount of Islay whisky does go into J &amp; B, although its TCP and chestnut character had been completely assimilated in the final blend; which is a little too polished to accept that slightly jarring, barbaric note which comes in from the Hebrides.</p>

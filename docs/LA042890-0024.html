			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARTH DAY FOCUSES ATTENTION ON DETERIORATION OF ENVIRONMENT  </P> <P> William Schneider's Earth Day column stated that President Bush is proclaiming  the environmental cause as his own (Opinion, April 22). There is,  unfortunately, a sizeable gap between the proclamation and performance.  </P> <P> The present Administration has insisted upon weakening the Clean Air Act in  spite of the overwhelming support of the American people for environmental  protection. It was reported in The Times that the President is now expected to  approve oil drilling off the California coast (Part A, April 23). In a speech  last week he asked for more study as his response to the global warming threat.  These are hardly the bold, decisive actions one might expect from an  environmentalist leader.  </P> <P> Wishing will not make President Bush an environmentalist nor will talking. Only  action will make it so.  </P> <P> JOYCE COLEMAN-MAGINN  </P> <P> Conservation Chair  </P> <P> Sierra Club-Angeles Chapter  </P></p>

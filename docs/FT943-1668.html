			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Telecom laggards to demand more help World telecommunications ministers ended a meeting of the International Telecommunication Union yesterday dominated by developing countries' complaints that they were being left behind on the information superhighway, Reuter reports from Kyoto. The meeting of 49 ministers issued a vague communique that said they were committed to developing global telecommunications but it left unresolved how to cope with competition and how to bridge the gap between nations such as the US and developing countries. The meeting appeared to signal that developing nations believed the time had come to raise their voices and demand more help to improve just their basic domestic services. It was in stark contrast to a satellite speech many delegates heard only hours earlier from US Vice President Al Gore, who called for governments to redefine their role in telecommunications. 'We believe that sound market principles can foster the efficient and free flow of communications worldwide,' Mr Gore said in his speech from Washington to the meeting in Kyoto. The so-called Kyoto Declaration said: 'We will commit ourselves to work toward advancing the world's telecommunications structure, enabling all our citizens to share its benefits as we progress towards the 21st century.' But speaker after speaker from the third world said they were struggling just to provide a telephone call to a village, let alone drive on the Global Information Superhighway. 'In view of the severe imbalance of global telecommunications development, we believe that the construction of the telecommunications networks for the 21st century should start from the actual situations of various countries and progress in a planned and step-by-step way,' Mr Wu Jichuan, China's minister of telecommunications, said.</p>

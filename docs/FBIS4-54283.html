			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kazuteru Yoshikawa of Science and Technology </F> Department]    [Text] The news caused an uproar that no less than 70 kg of  plutonium was found in the production lines of a plutonium fuel  production facility (Tokai-mura, Ibaragi Prefecture) of the  Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation [PNC],  which had accumulated over approximately six years since the  plant went into operation. This may lower the reliability of  the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, which  prevents diversion of nuclear materials to military use, and the  image of Japan, which takes pride in being "IAEA's model  student," is greatly damaged. It is whispered that the incident  may stimulate world opinion, including the United States, which  is critical of Japan's use of plutonium.  <H5>  Enough Plutonium To Make More Than Eight Atomic Bombs </H5>   The news came to light after Paul Leventhal, president of  the  Nuclear Control Institute, a U.S. organization critical of  Japan's nuclear power policy, obtained information that a huge  amount of plutonium was stuck to the equipment of the fuel  plant, and asked the U.S. State Department to seek the  facility's shutdown.    At the end of April, immediately before the incident was  brought to light, the IAEA had directed Japan to reduce the  amount of plutonium adhering to the equipment during an annual  meeting with the Japanese Government. Using a neutron measuring  instrument called "Holdup Measuring Equipment" at the plant, the  IAEA had checked whether the amount of plutonium sticking to the  equipment agrees with the amount reported by the PNC, which runs  the facility.    However, since the measuring equipment has a margin of error  of 10-15 percent, 8 kilograms -- which is a "significant  quantity" for the production of a nuclear bomb -- falls within  the range of error when the amount of holdup is 70 kg. This  means that 8 kg of plutonium could escape detection even when  the amount is cooked up with evil intentions, and the PNC had  already been working on full- scale measures to improve the  situation when the news was brought to light.  <H5>  "Aim at Reducing Plutonium by Half for the Moment" </H5>   Since the beginning of the factory's operation,  approximately  3 tons of plutonium have been brought in the production lines,  and about 2.3 percent of the amount has been left inside the  equipment. It is difficult to judge whether this percentage of  holdup is large or small because there are only a small number  of plutonium fuel production facilities in the world. The  process of making plutonium fuel is similar to that of medicine,  in which tablets are made by compressing powder. "In the  process of manufacturing tablets, about 2 percent of the powder  material is lost," according to Sankyo Co., Ltd., a drug  manufacturer.    The fuel factory produces cylindrical fuel pellets (diameter  5 mm, height 8 mm) for the fast breeder reactor "Monju." The  mixture of plutonium and uranium powder is processed in the  following way: granulation, casting, sintering, grinding, and  inspection. To avoid exposure to radioactivity, the production  lines are sealed in containers called glove boxes, and operators  work behind safety glass with gloves.    Of the 30 glove boxes in total, plutonium holdup was  confirmed in 17. In particular, a large amount of plutonium  sludge was found in the casting lines (two), where the powder is  shaped into pellets, and the grinding line, where the surface of  a sintered pellet is smoothed. The combined total holdup in  those three lines was 40 kg.    In the casting process, the powder scatters when the source  material in a mold is pressed vertically from both directions.  In the grinding process, shaved powder was not collected  completely. The powder that accumulated where the workers could  not reach, such as the back of the equipment, had to be left as  it was.    To collect the plutonium residue completely, the production  lines have to be stopped. But, especially for the last one or  two years, priority was reportedly given to the production of  fuel to meet the critical state of "Monju," and there was no  time for cleaning.    For the moment, the PNC has to reduce the amount of  plutonium holdup so that the amount that falls within the range  of measurement error becomes much lower than the significant  quantity of 8 kg. "To reduce 70 kg by half is our goal for the  time being," according to the PNC Nuclear Fuel Facility Planning  Department.    Casting and grinding equipment, where plutonium was stuck  intensely, have already been replaced with the new ones, which  are designed to allow less scattering of plutonium powder.  "Increase in the amount of residue must be smaller than  before," the PNC said. The old equipment will be dismantled and  cleaned, and the plutonium will be collected.  <H5>  The United States Attempts To Undermine Japan? </H5>   Overseas reaction to the news, such as that of the U.S.  Government which is sensitive to Japan's use of plutonium,  weighs on our minds. The Japan-U.S. Nuclear Agreement  stipulates that the United States, which supplies enriched  uranium, a source for plutonium, can seek a facility's shutdown,  if Japan commits a serious violation of safeguards. Leventhal's  advice to the State Department had this in mind.    However, Japan's Science and Technology Agency does not seem  to worry about this point: "It is certainly a problem that the  amount of plutonium adhering to the equipment was large, but it  is not a serious violation because the plutonium is not missing"  (Atomic Energy Bureau). Rather, the agency's Atomic Energy  Bureau is interested in "why a private U.S. organization got the  information at this time."    Regarding plutonium, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has  recently complained, which is unusual, about the content of the  PNC's video for public relations. That the United States is  irritated by the fact that Japan has begun to use plutonium  seriously is well known. About how the information of plutonium  holdup came to light this time, not a few people concerned think  of it as "a U.S. attempt to undermine Japan in an indirect way."</p>

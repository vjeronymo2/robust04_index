			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> LATTIMORE SAVES GRANADA HILLS ON A COLD NIGHT  </P> <P> Step right up, Aaron Lattimore, and try your luck. This is a cast-off carnival  and it's your turn to throw the dart. Nobody else on the Granada Hills High  team can hit a darn thing, so why not give it a shot?  </P> <P> Off-guard Osiris Nalls? Off night. Point guard Jermoine Brantley? Pointedly  cold.  </P> <P> "When those guys aren't on, somebody has to step in," Lattimore said with a  shrug. "I happened to be the one tonight."  </P> <P> Lattimore was the one for the Valley's top-ranked Highlanders, scoring a  career-high 29 points as Granada Hills rallied from a 10-point third-quarter  deficit to defeat Taft, 73-69, in a North Valley League game Wednesday at Taft.  </P> <P> Lattimore was inside. He was outside. He was everywhere. "He killed us," Taft  Coach Jim Woodard said.  </P> <P> Brantley, who had 19 points, made four of 18 shots from the field. Nalls was  equally iced, making four of 12. Lattimore saved the day -- not to mention  Granada Hills' share of first place in the league standings -- by connecting on  12 of 17.  </P> <P> "That's the way it's been all year," said Granada Hills Coach Bob Johnson,  whose team improved to 17-7, 8-1 in league play. "It seems like we have five or  six guys who can step forward if someone else has trouble."  </P> <P> Taft (13-10, 3-6) was trouble aplenty. James Yoakum -- who had 20 points, 10  rebounds and eight assists -- made a three-point shot to give Taft a 51-41 lead  with 5 minutes 35 seconds left in the third quarter. However, Granada Hills  outscored Taft, 18-3, the rest of the quarter to take a 59-57 lead.  </P> <P> But the Highlanders went cold as quickly as they had heated up. Brantley missed  his first five shots of the fourth quarter -- in all, Granada Hills missed its  first eight from the field -- before Lattimore knocked down a jump shot with  5:30 left to tie the score, 61-61.  </P> <P> With Granada Hills leading, 66-65, Lattimore stole the ball at halfcourt and  converted the layup. Taft answered when Jason Deyoe (18 points) made a pair of  free throws with 2:06 left to again trim the lead to one.  </P> <P> With the Highlanders in a spread offense, Lattimore hooked up with Nalls on a  give-and-go for a 70-67 lead with 1:40 remaining. Casey Sheahan's three-point  attempt on Taft's next trip down the floor was blocked and Brantley made both  ends of a one-and-one with 52 seconds left to clinch it.  </P></p>

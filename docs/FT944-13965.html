			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): A season of mists and mellow fruitfulness - Autumn conditions across Europe have been ideal for ploughing and planting What a difference a month makes] Four weeks ago the planting of autumn wheat and barley on our Norfolk farm had only just begun. Activity was somewhat feverish because we had no way of knowing when wet weather would force us off the land. Delays would be costly and erode prospects for useful yields next harvest. During the previous three weeks there had been close to eight inches of rain. The land was saturated and the season had all the makings of another 1993, when autumn sowings were not completed until near Christmas in almost impossible conditions. But it did not rain. Fine weather continued day after day. Those foggy mornings that disrupted road travel were just what farmers needed and very soon we settled into a regular routine of ploughing and planting every day into soil that had dried to an ideal moisture content for making good seed beds. Even very heavy clay land pulled down into a tilth better than it had for years. Wild mushrooms could be cut by the capful from the farms' horse meadows  - a sure sign of a benign autumn. Green shoots sprang from the brown earth as the newly planted seeds germinated and emerged. The leaves on the trees and in the hedgerows turned variously to yellow and gold, brown and red; a profusion of pastel shades to delight the eye of even the most unappreciative countryman. By the time the clocks changed the planting on most of the winter cereals scheduled for this autumn had been completed. Only a few fields remain to be done, mainly after growing crops of sugar beet and potatoes have been lifted and cleared - work which has also progressed well in the fine weather. It has not been an entirely trouble-free season, of course. In farming that is not expected. Emergence of some cereal crops has been slower than usual, probably because of the long absence of rain. Slug damage has been severe enough in some areas to cause a few fields, or parts of fields, to be replanted. There have been several reports of sightings of cereal aphids on newly-planted crops, vectors of a debilitating disease called barley yellow dwarf virus, which may cause loss of yield and quality next harvest. In some areas in the south-east of England that did not get the September storms farmers were last week complaining their land was so hard and dry that they were having to delay the completion of their plantings. The weekend rain will have pleased them greatly. Indeed it pleased me too; for it will ensure the germination of seeds in the fields we planted last week. So, in dramatic contrast to last year at this time, a feelgood factor is abroad in the British countryside. It is being enhanced by the memory of a harvest that was better than expected in many parts of the UK; and it is being reinforced by prices for grain that are several pounds a tonne higher than most farmers budgeted. Moreover a substantial portion of the grain harvested just a few weeks ago has already been sold - although not necessarily moved from farms. Much is the subject of forward contracts for movement some time during the winter or spring at locked-in prices that also reflect the cost of storage. Furthermore, the most forward-looking farmers are now considering the possibility of locking in some sales during autumn and winter of 1995-96 for the crops they have just planted. Forward prices, which are currently riding on the back of the brisk current demand, are significantly above anticipated nominal support levels for that time. Given the ideal soil conditions into which most of this year's autumn cereals have been planted - which, incidentally, have been repeated across northern Europe - some farmers and traders are beginning to think yields and the area sown in the EU may both rise and that this combination will lead to a fall in values. Added to that is speculation that, because of the present shortening in supplies, the European Commission may cut Set-Aside for harvest 1995 by 2 to 3 per cent - again increasing potential production. It is probable, therefore, that a small proportion, at least, of the 1995 harvest has already been sold at fixed prices. It would be misleading if I did not mention the fact that the prosperity and good times I have described as affecting arable farmers is far from universal. The growers of apples and some vegetables and the producers of pigs, in particular, are experiencing severe and in some cases possibly terminal problems. Returns in those sectors are well below costs and none of them benefit from area payments and the like from Brussels. Indeed it may be salutary that the produce of such holdings receives little or no aid from Brussels. Further, it is intended that market forces shall rule for all commodities in due course. Arable farmers should, perhaps, enjoy their unexpected good fortune while they may.</p>

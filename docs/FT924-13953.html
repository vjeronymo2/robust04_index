			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Pik Botha joins efforts to save Angola peace process MR PIK BOTHA, South Africa's foreign minister, arrived in Angola yesterday to join efforts to try to save the war-shattered country's fragile peace process. Mr Botha's arrival came amid signs that the international community, led by the United Nations, is increasingly unable to keep a lid on tension between the government and Unita, the former South African and US-backed rebel movement. Western observers hope that Pretoria, which backed Unita's guerrilla war with South African troops and weapons between 1975 and 1990, may be able to exert some influence on Mr Jonas Savimbi, the hard-line, egotistical rebel chief. They say that the key to Angola's future depends on what Mr Savimbi really wants - a question no one seems able to answer. Unita has alleged fraud in the country's first democratic elections last month and has made veiled threats to return the country to civil war. The elections were won by the MPLA government and President Jose Eduardo dos Santos. Yesterday Mr Elias Salupeto Pena, one of the most senior Unita officials, warned that if the government published official election results, expected today, it would amount to a declaration of war. He demanded that the elections be annulled. An investigation of Unita's allegations of fraud is nearing completion but officials say they have found evidence only of incompetence. Many observers believe Mr Savimbi is using the fraud allegations either as a bargaining position to get a transitional government of national unity in his favour or as a pretext to buy time and to prepare a military strategy. Mr Botha said yesterday he had come to listen to both sides to try to find common ground between them. He will meet both President dos Santos and Mr Savimbi today. He arrived 24 hours after heavy shooting erupted in Luanda which left at least four people dead.</p>

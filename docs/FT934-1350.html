			<p>931220 FT  20 DEC 93 / Italian MPs back budget: Two decrees agreed to complete reform of electoral law Italy's chamber of deputies has approved the 1994 austerity budget and the Senate is now almost certain to give the go-ahead this week, opening the way for general elections early next year. At the same time the government at the weekend agreed two decrees to reform the country's existing electoral constituencies - the final piece of electoral law reform. With the 1994 budget approved and the electoral law complete, Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, has fulfilled the two fundamental tasks he undertook when he was persuaded to leave the governorship of the Bank of Italy and become prime minister in May. This now leaves the way open for President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro to dissolve the parliament, in which one member in six is under investigation for corruption-related offences. He is likely to do this in his year-end address to the nation. March 20 has been suggested as a possible date for general elections for Italy to experiment with new laws that introduce the principle of a first-past-the-post majority voting system. The 1994 budget has been a tough test for Mr Ciampi, the first non-elected prime minister this century. His parliamentary majority was thrown in doubt by the collapse of his main backers, the Christian Democrats and Socialists. These traditional ruling parties were also asked to endorse tough measures that hit hard at their clientele with cuts in early retirement pensions and enforced job flexibility in the civil service. On several occasions Christian Democrats and Socialists threatened to sabotage the budget. In contrast, the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS) took the unusual step of publicly committing itself last month to vote for the budget - even though its framework is based entirely on market principles. The budget was approved by 276 with 49 abstentions and 35 against. The budget envisages syphoning L32,000bn (Pounds 12.8bn) out of the economy, two-thirds through spending cuts and the rest through new taxes. The 1994 budget deficit will be cut from the 10.5 per cent of GDP to 8.7 per cent.</p>

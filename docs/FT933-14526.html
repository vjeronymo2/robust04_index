			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sunday bill sparks job fears CONCERN ABOUT protection for shop workers' rights was the common element in reaction yesterday to the government's White Paper and draft bill on Sunday trading. The various lobby groups disagreed sharply about how the law should be reformed but were united in calling for reform to be accompanied by guaranteed employment rights. Home Secretary Mr Michael Howard would only support protecting those employed as shopworkers at the time that any changes to the law came into effect. Mrs Joan Ruddock, Labour's home affairs spokesman, said she would press hard for protection for future, as well as existing, employees who have to work on Sundays. She said the party's MPs supported changing the 1950 Shops Act but added: 'We can say with confidence that complete de-regulation is not something that Labour MPs will vote for.' Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, also backed reform but said he would judge the legislation according to whether it protected employees, preserved to some extent the special nature of Sundays, and gave some flexibility to local authorities in deciding what shops could open and when. The shop workers' union Usdaw said it was totally opposed to plans for deregulating Sunday trading. Mr Garfield Davies, the union's general secretary, said any new law should enshrine voluntary working so that workers who did not want to work on Sundays would not be discriminated against. Usdaw also demanded legal entitlement to double-time pay for Sunday working. Mr Michael Schluter, director of the Keep Sunday Special Campaign, said: 'KSSC will not accept any government bill, however many the options, unless shop workers are adequately protected from being compelled to work on a Sunday and properly remunerated if they choose to do so.' The John Lewis Partnership gave its support to KSSC, saying it represented the best balance for society as a whole. The Retailers for Shops Act Reform, which represents some of the UK's largest retailers including Marks and Spencer, would allow Sunday opening for small convenience and leisure shops of not more than 3,000 sq ft and all garden centres and DIY shops. Mr Geoffrey Maitland Smith, chairman of Sears, another RSAR member, said Sunday trading was not financially attractive except at Christmas. He said that outside big cities it could present problems with stock delivery and staffing. The group closest to the government's preference is the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which would allow shops below 3,000 sq ft unrestricted opening, but larger shops could open for not more than six hours between 10am and 6pm. This option is supported by the big supermarket chains and the retail group Kingfisher. SHRC chairman Baroness Jay said their option was popular, practical and permanent, adding that it would solve the problem of Sunday trading once and for all. But SHRC parts company with the government in wanting statutory employee protection. The Association of District Councils, which represents many local authorities that enforce the current Shops Act, said its main concern was that whatever reform was made should be legally enforceable.</p>

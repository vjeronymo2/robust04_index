			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Fears of potential Campari bid allayed Fears that a potential bidder might be moving in on Campari International, the company which designs and markets leisurewear and sportswear, were allayed yesterday. The buyer of an 11 per cent stake was revealed as a private investor. It was announced on Wednesday that a company called Blueridge had acquired 1.12m shares, representing 10.73 per cent of Campari. Campari was unaware of what Blueridge was and what its intention might be. The textiles group appeared vulnerable because its share price had fallen by a third to 24p at the end of October following the announcement of Pounds 3.7m rationalisation costs to combat difficult trading conditions. It transpires that Blueridge is the private investment vehicle of Mr Paul Thompson, the chairman of Sanderson Electronics, a Sheffield-based computer support company. In October, Sanderson was on the acquisition trail, taking a controlling interest in SGA Pac-ific from General Automation. However, Mr Thompson said yesterday that Blueridge was his personal investment vehicle, there was no synergy between his company and Campari and he had no predatory intentions. 'I just thought the shares were cheap despite the fact that the company is not enjoying the best of times at the moment.' Mr Rob Wilkinson, Campari's company secretary, said: 'Obviously we were keen to find out what Mr Thompson's intentions were. We have spoken to him and he has indicated that the stake is purely for investment purposes.' The shares gained 2p to close at 27p yesterday.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANADIAN CONSTITUTION TALKS NEAR BREAKDOWN  </P> <P> Key talks on reshaping the Canadian constitution were on the brink of collapse  at the end of a marathon session Thursday, as Quebec's provincial Premier  Robert Bourassa announced that he would no longer participate in any discussion  of Quebec's "distinct" role within the nation.  </P> <P> The so-called distinct-society constitutional clause has been a central element  of this week's talks, and it is hard to see how the other negotiators can  proceed without Bourassa.  </P> <P> The question has been settled, as far as Quebec is concerned, Bourassa said.  But the premiers of Manitoba and Newfoundland are objecting to the "distinct  society" provision for Quebec.  </P> <P> "We're getting pretty close to having to fish or cut bait," said Prime Minister  Brian Mulroney, who is chairing the negotiations, as he emerged at the end of a  12-hour session. "What is at stake here is the well-being of Canada."  </P> <P> Debate over the national constitution has dragged on for months,confusing the  public, dividing the country into federalist and separatists camps and  radicalizing public opinion in the French-speaking province of Quebec. Analysts  now say that, no matter what comes out of this week's negotiations, the wounds  inflicted by the debate have been so deep that relations between French and  English Canada cannot go back to normal.  </P> <P> This week's problem has arisen because Quebec has never signed the Canadian  constitution, citing a number of objections. The current round of talks was  just the latest in a three-year series of negotiations aimed at bringing the  province into the constitutional fold.  </P> <P> In 1987, Canada's 10 all-powerful provincial premiers had crafted a package of  amendments meant to solve Quebec's objections to the constitution. The package  is called the Meech Lake accord, named for the lakeside resort where it was  negotiated.  </P> <P> A crucial passage of the Meech Lake accord labels Quebec as a "distinct  society" within Canada. Quebec says the clause must be inserted before it will  sign the constitution. But Manitoba and Newfoundland argue that if Quebec  leaders might use the special powers to enact provincial laws trampling on the  rights of Quebec's minority English speakers.  </P> <P> Their fears are not unfounded. Quebec has already enacted laws banning street  signs in any language other than French, and the Montreal school board is  considering regulations forbidding Anglophone children to speak English at  school -- even while playing.  </P> <P> As Prime Minister Mulroney and the 10 provincial premiers walked out of  Thursday's session, they vowed that they would return to the table this morning  and try to patch up their differences. But it was difficult to see what they  could do to bridge the gap. To make matters worse, the law says the Meech Lake  accord must be ratified by June 23, or else it will become void and  constitutional negotiations will have to start over.  </P></p>

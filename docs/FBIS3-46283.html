			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] High-ranking officials from the Mainland Affairs  Council [MAC] stated on Monday [24 January] that regarding the  meeting between T'ang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei] of the mainland's  Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait [ARATS], and  Taiwan's Chiao Jen-ho of the Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF]  scheduled for the end of this month, MAC's feeling is that it  will be pleased to talk about as much as can be fitted into  several days of talks. MAC said that even if the talks do not  result in any agreement, they will not be considered a failure.  Under the circumstances, MAC officials said they found no  reasons for Chiao to meet with high-ranking Communist Chinese  officials. MAC noted that there are varied opinions whether  Chiao should meet with the head of the mainland's Office of  Taiwan Affairs. However, many opinions on Taiwan indicate that  Chiao could face a backlash from the opposition party on Taiwan  if such a meeting were held.</p>

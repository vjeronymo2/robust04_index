			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Researchers seek a cure for underfunding - The Issues, Science SIMMERING dissatisfaction in Britain's laboratories with Conservative science policy boiled over yesterday when 20 leading researchers called for a change of government to reverse a 'dramatic deterioration in the quality and depth of British science'. In a letter to The Times, they said 'progressive erosion in public support for research' since 1979 had demoralised the scientific community - a development they described as 'one of the principal disasters in Britain in the past 12 years'. The group includes several of Britain's best-known researchers, including the two Nobel laureates Dr Max Perutz and Professor Maurice Wilkins. Although they emphasised that the letter represented their personal opinions, most academic scientists would agree with their challenge to the Tory view that public funding of basic research has increased by 24 per cent in real terms since 1979. University researchers say that growth in the official 'science budget'  - the money spent by the five research councils - has been offset by a steep fall in the government's contribution to research through the Universities Funding Council. At the same time the cost of working at the frontiers of research is rising faster than general inflation. While the Tories maintain that British science remains in good health, Labour and the Liberal Democrats echo the opinion of Save British Science. The lobby group says that, measured by purchasing power, government support for academic science has fallen 20 per cent since 1979. One result of the reduced university funding is that laboratories are staffed increasingly by researchers on low-paid, short-term contracts whose career prospects are often bleak. Another is that scientists spend more time on paperwork, chasing grants, and less on experiments. 'The last 10 years have put an enormous bureaucratic load on us and that needs to be stripped away,' says Dr John Sulston, a senior researcher at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. 'And I recognise that I'm working in a privileged community here, which has been relatively well-treated.' The Liberal Democrats promise an immediate injection of Pounds 400m a year into the science base. Labour is more circumspect and avoids making a financial commitment. Even so, laboratory conversations suggest that Labour is generally regarded as the party most friendly to science. Mr Jeremy Bray, a mathematician who is Labour's long-serving science and technology spokesman, has toured academic and industrial research centres listening to gripes and explaining Labour policies. Labour is the only party promising a cabinet-level minister for science  - a job that would almost certainly go to Mr Bray. No senior Conservative politician has an equivalent long-term interest in science, responsibility for which has passed between a series of junior ministers in the Department of Education and Science. Although industrial research and development has increased since 1979, all three parties agree that British industry should be encouraged to spend more on R&amp;D. The most distinctive proposal is Labour's 25 per cent tax credit for additional R&amp;D investment. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say this would encourage accountants to reclassify existing spending as R&amp;D, and even for the high-tech companies on Cambridge Science Park the tax credit seems to have relatively little appeal. Mr Robin Smith-Saville, managing director of satellite communications company Signal Processors, says its priority is an increase in Department of Trade and Industry grants for innovative product development - support that almost disappeared during the 1980s in the enthusiasm for collaborative 'pre-competitive' research. 'The extension of DTI support for innovation is most likely to be forthcoming in a hung parliament because the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties are more receptive to the need for this type of support than the Conservatives,' Mr Smith-Saville says. The three parties have similar German-inspired policies for bridging the gap between academic science and industry. All promise to set up technology development centres similar to Germany's Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, a network of 46 industrial research institutes. For Dr Eric Howells, director of Cambridge University's Wolfson Industrial Unit, this unanimity is 'almost too good to believe'. He and others in the business of exploiting academic research are enthusiastic about Fraunhofer-style institutes, whether they are called Faraday Centres (as the Tories propose) or Newton Institutes (Labour). But many university researchers are irritated by the way politicians see science primarily as a tool for strengthening industry, and are angry about the way 'scientists got the blame for Britain's industrial failure', as Professor Michael Pepper, a Cambridge University physicist, puts it. Prof Pepper insists - contrary to current political wisdom - that in his field of solid-state physics 'links between universities and industry are very good'. For university scientists like him the overriding issue is not improving links with industry, but correcting what they see as underfunding of basic research.</p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: GEC There are echoes of the 1980s about GEC. Recovery, when it arrives, will once again challenge GEC's cash holdings, while the company faces new management issues. Lord Weinstock has devolved responsibility for many of the best hopes to joint ventures. Running the defence operations is the management of long-term decline. Striking out in a radically new strategic direction hardly fits with the company's careful culture. That caution has done the company no harm with the market recently, despite the fall in interest rates. In part that is because some of the company's cash is held in French francs within GEC-Alsthom, and so has been insulated from the fall in UK rates. But the yield premium on the shares has also fallen as fund managers have revalued the company's financial strength and ability to grow its dividends ahead of the market average. GEC now yields only slightly more than the FT-A All-Share index but is still generating cash and has a dividend cover of 1.9 times. Operations, however, look less rosy. Defence is fighting for profits in a declining market. The gradual run-down of the BT System X business also puts the telecoms operations on the defensive. Only the GEC-Alsthom power systems and transport joint venture offers the prospect of significant growth, but that division contributed only 22 per cent of last year's profits. Perhaps the company is holding its cash to force good terms from the government for GEC investment in public projects, but that may come to nothing. And however good the dividend record in the 1980s, Lord Weinstock's reluctance to spend may be extended to shareholders if he believes lower dividend cover would cramp his room for manoeuvre.</p>

Some 94.7 percent and 75.4 percent of WBCs from the  patients' blood of vivax malaria and the mice blood  infected with P. berghei respectively were removed  with no alteration of the parasite density and the malaria stage  ratio after the cellulose filtration.    The densities of the uninfected and the infected  erythrocytes  with different stages of three species of malaria parasites were  determined by isopycnic centrifugation on multi-continuous  gradients of Percoll. The mean densities (kg/L) of schizonts,  trophozoites, ring form and uninfected cells were approximately  1.059, 1.072, 1.096 and 1.099 in P. vivax; 1.070,  1.079, 1.10 and 1.10, gametocytes 1.085 in P.  falciparum; 1.059, 1.062, 1.103 and 1.104 in P.  berghei, respectively. Based on these values, three  different density gradients of Percoll were devised to separate  erythrocytes infected with the more mature stages (trophozoites  and schizonts) from ring forms and uninfected cells. By these  methods, it is possible to obtain high purified parasites of  93.5 percent from blood with starting parasitaemias of 0.8  percent in P. vivax, 100 percent from 2.3 percent in  P. falciparum and 93.0 percent from 30.6 percent in  P. berghei, being raised by 113.8, 43.4 and 2.0 times  respectively.    Key words: P. vivax, P. falciparum,  P. berghei, purification &amp; isolation, CF-11 cellulose  column, Percoll density gradient centrifugation</p>

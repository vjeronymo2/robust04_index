			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUN AND USEFUL ACCESSORIES FOR BARBECUE  </P> <P> The center of the barbecue cannot hold. Fish fall apart, small things slip  through the grating. Then the Gourmet Grid ($28.95) places wide, flat channels  on top of the wire grid and we don't even need the center, because the  porcelain-coated steel carries heat to the edges of the barbecue as well.  </P> <P> Branding cattle is a tiresome business that involves wrestling down doggies in  a stench of burning cowhide. Branding steaks is a lot more fun. To put your own  initials on your lunch you need a branding iron, like the kind hand-made on an  Texas ranch by Texart (P.O. 33187, Corpus Christi, Tex. 78463); three initials,  $18.50.  </P> <P> Odorless, non-explosive: high virtues indeed. Weber has come out with a  charcoal starter in the form of compact, nontoxic cubes that light even when  wet and burn for about 15 minutes. Twenty cubes to a $3.99 tray; available at K  Mart and other Weber outlets.  </P> <P> Like a remora fish attaching itself to a shark, the Ash Catcher (from Charcoal  Companion; $13.50) attaches to the legs of a kettle barbecue and positions its  mouth to pick up the leavings. At last the ashes dribbling from the kettle have  a safe place to rest until the family ash monitor gets around to emptying it  into a garbage bag. At the Broadway and Robinson's.  </P> <P> How do you handle something soft and flaky on a grill? A grilling basket with a  nice long handle, of course, and Charcoal Companion has developed the Ultimate  Grilling Basket System ($39.95) with a removable handle so the grill can be  closed for a smokier flavor. At the Broadway and Robinson's.  </P> <P> You can customize a wimpy grill by adding aromatic wood chips. Charcoal  Companion's Smoking Woods Sample Pack ($14.99) includes apple for traditional  American barbecue, mesquite, and the grape vine trimmings traditional with fish  in France, along with a metal box to hold the woods in the barbecue. At the  Broadway and Robinson's.  </P></p>

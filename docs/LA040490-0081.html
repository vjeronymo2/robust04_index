			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MOSHER HIT BREAKS UP PITCHERS' DUEL  </P> <P> Jose Gallegos vs. Robert Cardenas was not exactly the pitching duel many  expected to see when Hilltop High and Castle Park got together for a Metro  Conference baseball game Tuesday afternoon.  </P> <P> But it did nicely.  </P> <P> Hilltop's Chad Mosher was not exactly the masher fans expected to see win the  game either. But he did nicely, too.  </P> <P> Mosher's game-winning hit -- a lined single to left-center field that drove in  Johnny Garibay from third -- came with two strikes and two outs in the bottom  of the seventh inning to give Hilltop a 2-1 victory at home.  </P> <P> To add spice, Mosher had been in an 0 for 13 slump since another game-winning  seventh-inning hit against Granite Hills earlier this year.  </P> <P> "I was hitting the ball, just at everybody," Mosher said. "I knew something was  going to fall in sooner or later."  </P> <P> Hilltop (8-3, 3-0) and Castle Park (7-4, 2-1) came in tied for first with  Montgomery High (9-3, 3-0), a 2-0 winner over Sweetwater (8-4, 1-2).  </P> <P> Many thought the pitchers for this important league game would be junior  fireballers Jose Silva (Hilltop) and Benji Gil (Castle Park). Both coaches --  Hilltop's John Baumgarten and Castle Park's Bob Korzep -- decided otherwise,  but neither was disappointed.  </P> <P> Gallegos, a junior right-hander, used a curve ball, a drop and a straight ball  ("You can't call it a fastball," he said) to limit Castle Park to four hits and  keep the Trojans off balance for six innings.

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Rules on lottery spending eased Sports, arts and heritage groups will be able to apply for revenue grants to help run capital projects funded by the proceeds of the National Lottery, Mr Peter Brooke, the National Heritage secretary, said yesterday, Raymond Snoddy writes. The announcement marks a new flexibility on how the money raised by the National Lottery can be spent. Critics were worried that hundreds of millions of pounds might be spent on new capital projects but that the money would not be available to run the new projects successfully. Mr Brooke made clear yesterday that while the proceeds, which could be Pounds 9bn over seven years, will be mainly for capital projects it will be possible to apply for revenue grants. He said: 'After consultation with the distributing bodies, I have agreed to allow them greater flexibility in the awarding of endowments and revenue grants to help cover, in some instances, the revenue costs of lottery-funded capital projects.' The distribution bodies which will allocate the money raised by Camelot, the consortium chosen to operate the lottery, are the Arts Council, Sports Council, the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Millennium Commission and the National Lottery Charities Board.</p>

			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Debt repayments to be deferred RUSSIA, displaying a tough new attitude to creditors and neighbouring states, said yesterday it would not pay back debts built up by the former Soviet Union until creditors had agreed a big rescheduling deal, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian prime minister told a news conference that Russia was paying back loans offered to Moscow after the Soviet Union fell apart in December 1991, but would not repay former Soviet debt until the Paris Club of creditor states agreed to allow more time to pay. A Paris Club deal has stalled amid bickering between Russia and Ukraine over who should pay what. Arrears are mounting while Russia and its creditors talk about what to do. A press statement, amplifying Mr Shokhin's comments, said high debt payments would force Russia to switch energy exports from CIS countries to western states prepared to pay hard currency for oil and gas.</p>

			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BIDS SOLICITED FOR LANCASTER PRISON DESPITE PENDING SUITS  </P> <P> State corrections officials will begin accepting bids Monday for construction  of the $50-million housing unit of a planned state prison in Lancaster.  Construction is scheduled to begin by January, officials said Friday.  </P> <P> Prison opponents criticized the decision to proceed with bidding on the west  Lancaster site, saying the state is risking taxpayer money because the prison  still faces legal challenges.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court hearing is set for Nov. 14 on lawsuits by the city  and Los Angeles County challenging the constitutionality of prison-siting  legislation. The city and county also plan to appeal a judge's decision last  month rejecting lawsuits that challenged the environmental review of the site.  </P> <P> But corrections officials said the prison has already been delayed by the legal  fight and said the judge's decision made it clear that they can move forward.  Bids for the $50-million contract will be opened Dec. 6, officials said. The  2,200-bed, maximum- and medium-security prison is scheduled to open in 1992.  </P></p>

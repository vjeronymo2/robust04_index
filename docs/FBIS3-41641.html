			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Environment/Competitiveness: </F> Eco-Taxes Championed as Growth Promoters''; as released by  Brussels Euroscope EIS Database]    [Text] The idea that exo-taxes might well be a way of  reinvigorating growth is one that Ioannis Paleokrassas, the  European Commissioner for the Environment, is hoping will figure  quite prominently in the [EC] Commission's White Paper on the  theme of an overall strategy for growth, competitiveness and  employment. In his contribution to the document, he will be  handing in to EC Government leaders at the end of the year, he  champions a radically new resource-based system. This idea is  favoured by a team of Commission experts, who have been  considering these issues with an eye towards the White Paper:  wage costs are twice as high as the net income of workers,  whereas energy and investment taxes do not match the size of the  increase. Present compulsory taxation systems are making it so  much harder for European businesses to compete with their rivals  and are having a serious affect on job prospects, so they need  to be given a complete overhaul, claim the experts in their  report.    Competitiveness, employment and the environment are three  types of policies that ``might be neutral towards one another,  they might be mutually reinforcing, and they may indeed be  contradictory.'' For the likes of the Commission and the  Presidency of the EC Council of Ministers, they stand a good  chance of strengthening each other, but others only spot the  potential conflicts. This issue already cropped up for  discussion, albeit from a narrow point of view, in a  Communication the Commission produced roughly a year ago on the  theme of industrial competitiveness and the environment .    A working group made up of members of various Commission  services, and orchestrated by the ``Forward studies unit''  (created by Jacques Delors), has been giving these matters some  thought in the runup to a conference being organised by the  Commission and the Presidency of the Council of Ministers on the  theme of Forward towards a European model of sustainable  development, on 9-10 November (at the Centre Borschette in  Brussels) and the environment chapter in the White Paper, which  has to be ready in time for the EC Summit on 10/11 December. The  mid-term report drawn up by the group throws the spotlight on  areas where EC action is vital to ensure  employment/competitiveness and environmental protection  stimulate each other.  <H5>  Root-and-Branch Reform of Tax Systems </H5>   The Commissioner wants to see environmental costs and  benefits meshed in with macro- and micro-economic planning  systems. Our labour and profit-based taxation systems ought to  be changed to use resources and pollution as starting points,  including soil utilisation taxes, the Commissioner believes, as  ``green taxes'' are the best means of integrating environmental  factors into the economy.    He gives a few examples for guidance purposes: a landfill  site eco-tax collected by the local authorities would make the  comparative cost of incineration, recycling or re-use more  realistic. Taxes on industrial output or profits could make way  for charges on soil utilisation, emissions into the air or  water. The present vehicle taxes stand back for emission-related  road charges. Different eco-taxes on packaging could  automatically lead to a reduction in the level of waste and  boost the efficiency of waste processing.  <H5>  Employment Overly Penalised </H5>   Our present system ``penalises work and production,''  reckons  the Commissioner, who feels that ``our social insurance systems  are mostly obsolete, over-generous (...) and very expensive,''  while ``our tax system, and notably VAT, encourages the use of  capital rather than labour.'' What is needed is a new  development model based on the integration of the environment  into our economic thinking. The Commissioner is persuaded that  this new approach will make ``the environment our new locomotive  for healthy growth.''  <H3>  Energy Saving in the Construction Industry: More Than 30  Million Job-Years </H3>   The Commissioner stresses the two separate roles of the  environment strategy:    -- protective role: an effort to save or restore our  environment, mainly through legislating, which may create  additional jobs but can add to the costs of operating the  economies.    -- active role: when action for the environment directly  increases the competitiveness of our economies and products. The  action may also create jobs in certain circumstances (but not  always). Accordingly, the introduction of a a carbon energy tax  does not especially create jobs in the short run, but an energy  saving programme in the building industry can generate between  24 and 34 million job-years over the next few years, underscores  the EC Commissioner.  <H5>  Energy/CO2 Tax Could Maximise Employment Potential </H5>   Although the Commissioner does not believe that the  introduction of a CO2/energy tax will create jobs in the short  term, the ``inter-services group'' of the Commission emphasises,  in its report, the economic benefits of the energy/CO2 tax,  revenues from which, since it is ``neutral'' from an  macro-economic point of view, could help to lower certain taxes  which create large distortions (such as wage costs). The report  stresses that, in calculating the effects of the tax, only the  general reductions of other taxes (neutrality) were considered,  and not a ``custom-made'' reduction aimed specifically at job  creation.    Simulations have shown that application of the energy/CO2  tax  would have no effect, or a slightly positive effect, on  employment. However, if the effects of the energy/CO2 tax were  calculated with a concomitant basis of taxes affecting  employment directly and specifically, the results could be much  more positive. The key is the reduction in taxes which create  large distortions in employment and competitivity in relation to  the EC's rivals, the report notes. To create jobs in the short  term, the report recommends using revenues from the tax to help  industry to invest.  <H5>  New Model of Development: Four Focuses </H5>   The new model of development favoured by the Commission is  based on four high-priority measures:    -- a rapid start to a programme of research into the  economic  implications of environmental measures, in order to assess the  costs and benefits in terms of growth, employment and  technological development, over both the short and longer term;    -- a re-orientation of tax systems (see above);    -- with the conclusion of a GATT agreement, the initiation  of  a new ``green'' round of negotiations on environmental and  cultural dumping;    -- extensive research into and implementation of an action  programme for radical change to the urban environment.  <H5>  Community Action Essential </H5>   In the opinion of the inter-services group, the key to  increasing employment and improving competitivity within the  framework of sustainable development lies first in a total  reform of the structure and operation of social security  systems. The group identified five areas for which Community  action is necessary and would be effective:    -- as a top priority, the group chose eco-taxes, which would  facilitate sharp reductions in taxes that create distortions and  have a negative effect on employment and competitivity. Using  environmental taxes has the advantage of influencing millions of  consumers and firms without entailing costly administrative  charges.    -- provision of information to increase Europeans' awareness  of the issue of ``sustainability.'' The Community is well placed  to promote debate, inform and encourage cooperation.    -- restoration of sites suffering environmental damage, to  rectify the errors of the past and prevent future pollution,  with the help of new technologies (creation of jobs).    -- The Community must orient its research and sectorial  policies towards sustainable development.    -- The Community should encourage a basic debate on  lifestyles in Europe and ways of changing them (in terms of  flexibility of working hours, time management and use of  transport). Such societal changes could have positive  consequences for sustainable models of socio- economic  development (which could in turn increase employment).</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yuriy Rogozhin report: "Prospect of Closed Cities"] </F>   [Text] The State Duma council has decided to hold  hearings, before the parliament recess, on the problem of closed  cities -- there are more than 100 of them in Russia and their  population is several million. All the nuclear-and  defense-related cities face the same problems -- falling  production, unemployment, environmental pollution. The  committee for industry, energy, and transport is planning, as  part of preparations for the hearing, to hold a conference in  Tomsk-7 at the end of June with representatives of the other  closed cities and interested departments.</p>

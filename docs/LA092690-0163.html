			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> WEST SAYS MAGIC TOOK PAY CUT SO LAKERS COULD ACQUIRE TEAGLE  </P> <P> Magic Johnson voluntarily surrendered part of his salary so the Lakers could  acquire Terry Teagle from the Golden State Warriors, General Manager Jerry West  said today.  </P> <P> "Knowing we needed another first-rate player, Magic came to me several weeks  ago and offered to give up part of his salary if we needed room under the  salary cap to get a player we wanted," West said in a statement released today.  </P> <P> West said the Lakers couldn't have made the trade without Johnson's help.  </P> <P> "We didn't have enough money under the cap to pick up Terry's contract without  Magic giving up a substantial amount of his own salary," West said.  </P> <P> "You read so much these days about renegotiations and holdouts, it is important  that fans know of Magic's unselfishness. In my mind, it is further proof that  he is the ultimate team player."  </P> <P> The amount of money Johnson relinquished was not disclosed.  </P> <P> Johnson, who won his third NBA Most Valuable Player award last season, said he  was willing to give up a substantial sum of his salary because winning is more  important.  </P> <P> "It's about winning," Johnson said. "Of course money is great, but I play to  win and that's why I did it."  </P></p>

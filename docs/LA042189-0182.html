			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THESE JOKERS WILL TAKE A FALL FOR SOME LAUGHS  </P> <P> In its six years of existence, Vaudeville Nouveau has been doing its level, and  frequently off-level, best to raise the much-maligned art form of  rubber-chicken juggling to new heights -- 12, 13 feet to be precise. Wacka  wacka wacka.  </P> <P> There are wheelbarrows full of loopy humor in the threesome's retro-hip  theatrical act. But there is an equal amount of mind-boggling, eye-popping,  gravity-defying physical dexterity. The wildly kinetic show comes to Saddleback  College in Mission Viejo tonight.  </P> <P> In a world of entertainment that largely has abandoned the pie-in-the-face as  the preferred method of comeuppance, it may seem hard to figure the relevance  of showmen whose humor depends on old-fashioned pratfalls, baggy pants,  fast-paced repartee, stunningly hideous eye wear and plaids so loud that  neighboring airports are liable to complain.  </P> <P> Actually, along with such theatrical-musical-comedy brethren as the Flying  Karamazov Brothers, Vaudeville Nouveau has revived the manic energy of old-time  variety shows and combined it with a performance art-like sense of humor.  </P> <P> "In live theater, you can acknowledge the audience," Mark Sackett, 34, said by  phone this week from his home in San Francisco. "You're right there with the  audience and you can talk to them. And we do -- we talk directly to the people  and improvise parts of the show. When someone coughs or yells back at us,  that's not bad at all. We have fun with it. . . .  </P> <P> "For us, that's the point of live theater -- it's that real sense of walking on  a tightrope, which I can say because I used to walk a tightrope." (Indeed,  Sackett met his Vaudeville Nouveau partners Danny Mankin and Jeff Raz while all  were working their respective ways through college as circus performers).  </P> <P> "Part of the reason the Marx Brothers (performed in front of live audiences  before filming), and the reason their movies work, is that when you play to an  audience, you find out one-on-one what works," Sackett continued.  </P> <P> "Normally when you are doing comedy on film, there's no feedback. You can work  on a bit and work it out till you think it's perfect, but if it's not funny to  the average viewer, it's not funny. The Marx Brothers did their material time  after time after time until it was perfect, which is why they were exciting and  as fresh as they were."  </P> <P> These comedic descendants of the Marx Brothers, the Mack Sennett stable of  funnymen and, further back, Italy's commedia dell'arte, play an average of 250  dates a year at colleges, fairs, schools and senior centers.  </P> <P> The act can be as short as a 20-minute variety show stint, or a full-evening  production such as "Aesthetic Peril," slated for Saddleback, and "Savage  Chicken," to be revived this fall.  </P> <P> "We got the name of the current show from a critic in San Francisco who was  writing about something else, and at the end of the review he said, 'Miss this  at your own aesthetic peril.' We thought that was a riot, so we took it,"  Sackett said.  </P> <P> The group's shows evolve constantly, so this will be a slightly different  version of "Aesthetic Peril" than the one Vaudeville Nouveau shared last year  with a Leisure World audience that seemed alternately bewitched, bothered and  bewildered.  </P> <P> "There are things in the show that go right over kids' heads. There are some  things that go right over (adults') heads. There are even some things that go  right over our heads," said Sackett, and he wasn't just referring to the steady  stream of jugglers' clubs, rings, butchers' knives and the obligatory rubber  chickens kept airborne.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Vaudeville Nouveau has proven popular. Youngsters like the troupe  even though it lacks the multimillion- dollar special effects and high-tech  gadgetry that seem indispensable to most entertainment directed at children  these days. Success with the small fry doesn't surprise Sackett: It was a  theatrical production for children that convinced him that something like  Vaudeville Nouveau would succeed.  </P> <P> "Right before we started Vaudeville Nouveau, Raz and I did a production of 'The  Taming of the Shrew' in Oakland," he recalled. "It was a program of Shakespeare  for inner-city kids. We had this assistant director who kept telling us that it  wouldn't work, that the kids wouldn't understand.  </P> <P> "But after the performance, three kids about 8 years old walked up to me -- I  was playing Petruchio -- and one of the kids looked at me and said, 'Are you  and that lady (Katharina) really married or is it just pretend?'  </P> <P> "I explained that it was just part of the story, and then the kid asked, 'If  you were just pretending to be married, did you marry her really for the money  or did you really like her?' That choked me up because they got it. The  physical action kept their interest, and helped the story make sense so it sunk  in. At that point I knew the physical end of theater was on track, and shortly  after that we decided to put Vaudeville Nouveau together.  </P> <P> "Those kids will go see theater again. They will go see at least one play later  in their lives."  </P> <P>  Vaudeville Nouveau performs at 8 tonight in Saddleback College's McKinney  Theatre, 28000 Marguerite Parkway, Mission Viejo. Tickets: $11, general; $9,  seniors. Information: (714) 582-4656.  </P> <P> </P></p>

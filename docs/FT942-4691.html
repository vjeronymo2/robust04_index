			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / International Capital Markets: Hellenic Republic loan to pay Libor plus 80 The Hellenic Republic disclosed yesterday that the annual interest rate on its forthcoming five-year Dollars 500m syndicated loan will be 80 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). The average life of the loan, Greece's first in four years and the first under its new sovereign name, is about 4 1/4 years since it will have to start repaying the loan in equal semi-annual instalments after three years. Thirteen banks have underwritten the loan on an equal basis: The Bank of Tokyo, Chase Investment Bank, Citibank International, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Fuji Bank, Hill Samuel Bank, Lloyds Bank Capital Markets, Mitsubishi Bank, JP Morgan Securities, NatWest Capital Markets, Sanwa Bank, Sumitomo Bank and Union Bank of Switzerland. Greece will not be paying a commitment fee on the loan since it is expected to draw down the whole amount within one month of the signing. Syndication started on Monday and is expected to close on or before June 24. Participation fees are: senior lead managers (Dollars 20m and above) 1.35 per cent; lead managers (Dollars 15m to Dollars 19.5m) 1.25 per cent; managers (Dollars 10m to Dollars 14.5m) 1.2 per cent; co-managers (Dollars 5m to Dollars 9.5m) 1.10 per cent; participants (Dollars 1m to Dollars 4.5m) 1 per cent.</p>

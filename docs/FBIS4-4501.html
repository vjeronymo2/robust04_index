Last year, twenty officials and working people in the county  visited People's Army units on several occasions to elevate the  militancy and morale of soldiers and consolidate Army-civilian  bonds of kinship. Among them were Chi Chang-nam, chief  secretary of the Yongyon County Party Committee and concurrently  chairman of the Yongyon County People's Committee, Kim  Sung-chon, chairman of the Management Committee of the County  Integrated Farm, Kim Myong-son, a worker of the Kokjong branch,  An Myong-kil, a worker of the Namchang branch, and Kong  Yong-chun, a worker of the sawon branch of the same farm.    Comrade Kim Chong-il also sent thanks to Yi Yong-tok, a  political worker of the Choe Tae-yong unit of the Korean  People's Army, and Pak Yong-hui, his wife, who had displayed  beautiful communist traits by taking care of a disabled soldier  like their own flesh and blood.</p>

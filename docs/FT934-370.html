			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Council will fight bank on rate swaps Hammersmith and Fulham council in London said yesterday it would 'vigorously contest' a legal action brought against it by Credit Commercial de France, one of France's biggest banks, which is trying to recover losses it suffered from interest-rate swap agreements. The bank said the council had made 'fraudulent mis-representations' about its power to undertake swap transactions in which two parties agree to exchange fixed and floating-rate interest payments. Hammersmith and Fulham was one of the most active players in the swaps market which it entered 10 years ago, along with other councils, in an effort to find ways around increasing government restrictions on raising finance. Councils generally swapped their fixed-rate liabilities for floating-rate ones - in effect gambling on interest rates staying low - and were left facing substantial losses when interest rates rose at the end of the 1980s. The council denied misrepresentation. It said the legal action appeared to be 'an attempt to enforce swap agreements which the House of Lords declared to be beyond our legal powers'. The French bank said the decision to sue followed a ruling this month by the Court of Appeal, which upheld a High Court order that Islington council must pay Pounds 1.14m to Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German bank. The bank declined to specify the amount it was claiming, but said it sought 'to recover both sums it paid to Hammersmith and Fulham and losses it incurred on matching trans-actions'. It said the 1991 ruling by the House of Lords that local authorities did not have the power to enter into interest rate swaps caused 'enormous losses to the banking community as a whole'. The Lords' decision left 80 banks facing losses of Pounds 560m, some of which they have sought to recover through restitution - reclaiming interest paid to councils under the invalid swap agreements. Hammersmith and Fulham said it had already settled several restitution claims. The council said it was premature to speculate on the position of council-tax payers if the legal action went against the council. So far, its taxpayers have not faced extra bills as a result of the swaps as restitution claims have been met from a special reserve. The action by the French bank is the latest move in a long legal battle between the banks and councils in which Hammersmith and Fulham Council has played a prominent part. It was a participant in several test case actions which have been settled out of court on undisclosed terms. The council took part in a total of 550 transactions in the money markets, mostly in the mid-1980s when it became involved in swap options and other complex transactions. An independent inquiry in 1991 found that Hammersmith and Fulham did not understand the market it had entered and had no way of monitoring or assessing the risks involved.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / UK Company News: CE Heath decides to axe six reinsurance jobs CE Heath, the insurance broker, yesterday made six of the staff in its reinsurance division redundant, including the joint managing director of its LMX operations. The surprise notification of compulsory redundancies yesterday at the company follows restructuring over several years of similar excess insurance divisions at many other brokers. Mr Tim Broadhurst, managing director of Heath Fielding, confirmed that Mr Paul McCarthy, joint managing director, one junior director and four staff had been made redundant. He said that there were no plans to replace these staff and that Mr Dennis King, the other joint managing director, would take charge. He stressed that the functions provided would continue for the foreseeable future and that he anticipated no reduction in the volume of business. He said that division remained 'extremely profitable.' 'There are no problems, no further redundancies and the numbers will reveal all in due course,' he said. 'LMX is a word disappearing from our vocabulary but we will still have a retro division.'</p>

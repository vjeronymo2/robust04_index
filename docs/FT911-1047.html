			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Decrees to change Peruvian agriculture PRESIDENT Alberto Fujimori has given Peruvian agriculture its biggest shake-up in more than 20 years. Two supreme decrees are to change land tenure legislation for the first time since the Velasco military government's land reform law in 1969. The new provisions allow for agricultural land to be transferred and sold without restrictions and permits those who are not themselves farmers to own land. Workers in the cooperatives formed after the expropriation of vast sugar, rice and cotton haciendas in the 1970s will now be able to elect to form a limited liability company and to become shareholders, with the consequent right to dispose of those shares. Limited liability companies had been prohibited from land ownership. In another departure from current law, land may now be used as collateral against agricultural loans. The maximum area permitted has been raised to 1,000 hectares from the previous 150 top limit if the owner has installed irrigation. Federico Uranga, former Minster of Agriculture in the 1980-85 Belaunde administration, praised the 'courage' of President Fujimori. 'He is doing what the democratic governments which followed the military regime could not or would not do,' he said. The changes incorporate many of the demands of Peru's embryonic, but potentially vast, agro-industrial sector. Principal peasant and small farmers'organisations are opposing at least some of the measures. They argue that land-owning by limited liability companies runs counter to the 1979 Constitution. Some agricultural experts also fear that changes in the law may force impoverished small farmers to sell out to agro-industrial businesses. Few, however, disagree about the need to reform Peruvian agriculture. Production of cotton, rice and sugar, once important exports, has slumped by about half during the past two decades. Peru now imports hundreds of millions of dollars a year in foodstuffs. This year, the sector is in more acute crisis than ever. The 1990 harvest was disastrously affected by the most severe drought on record. Farmers were left with virtually no resources; seed potatoes were eaten up by the half-starved, while livestock was slaughtered wholesale for lack of grazing. The already decapitalised sector was harmed further by the arrival of the Fujimori administration last July. Fiscal austerity measures meant that indiscriminate monetary emission to finance cheap loans to farmers via the state Agrarian Bank disappeared overnight. The vast majority of small farmers, especially in the Andes and in the jungle, did not have the collateral to obtain commercial credit. This shows up in this season's figures. The Ministry of Agriculture says that throughout Peru 91,000 hectares (225,000 acres) fewer had been planted by March than at the same time last year. Almost all of this is accounted for by diminished sowings of yellow corn, cotton and rice. There were also more than 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) fewer for wheat and barley than last year. The only crop to register an increase in area planted was sorghum  -almost 10,000 hectares more than 1990. Ministry figures show that the coast has been worst affected, because of water shortages. Crops in the jungle have been less affected. It is not known, however, how much of the 'missing' 91,000 hectares has been planted with short-term crops which ministry statistics do not measure. Increased competition from imports is another threat. In March, the government slashed import tariffs as part of general trade liberalisation policy. Surcharges have since been placed on five key products - corn, wheat, powdered milk, rice and sugar - to give local producers some protection from dumping and 'unfair' competition from cheap imports. The main problem, however, lies in the exchange rate. Peru's currency, the inti, is overvalued, economists calculate, by between two and three times. Local costs are disproportionately high. Producers calculate the farm-gate price of yellow corn in Peru's jungle department of San Martin at Dollars 392 (with a 30 per cent profit margin). The imported equivalent costs Dollars 186. Of Peru's 7.6mn hectares of potential agricultural land, only about 2.7mn are cultivated at present, according to estimates from Onern, the Peruvian natural resources organisation. The main hope for agricultural expansion is the coast and the jungle - the Andes are already over-farmed. Peru's 52 coastal valleys, where the agro-industrial take-off will come, provide the country's best agricultural land. The desert soil needs irrigation to make it flower and that may cost between Dollars 800 and Dollars 6,000 per hectare.</p>

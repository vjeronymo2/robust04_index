			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / International Company News: Dickson Concepts advances 7% DICKSON Concepts, the Hong Kong retailer and wholesaler which owns Harvey Nichols, the London department store, reported a 7 per cent increase in earnings for the year to March. Net profit improved to HKDollars 300.5m (USDollars 38.5m) from HKDollars 281.9m a year earlier. The results were a marked contrast to chairman Mr Dickson Poon's enthusiastic predictions a year earlier, and reflected weak trading conditions in Japan and Europe. Turnover rose 8 per cent to HKDollars 2.57bn, primarily as a result of improved sales from its distribution operations in south-east Asia. Harvey Nichols, purchased from the UK Burton Group in 1991, made its first meaningful contribution to group earnings during the year. Analysts estimate the store made an operating profit of around HKDollars 14m, thanks to tighter financial controls and an expansion of its sales area. The recent focus of the group has been on China. Four outlets have been opened in Beijing, selling Charles Jourdan, Guy Laroche and S. T. Dupont products. During the current fiscal year, an additional 30 boutiques are expected to be established. The group already distributes 11 brands of luxury watches in China. It will start marketing a new Harvey Nichols range this year.</p>

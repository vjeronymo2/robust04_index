			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Lvov under the rubric "The Press": </F> "Foundation for Protection of Glasnost Protests Violations of  Media Rights in Petersburg"]    [Text] Aleksey Simonov, chairman of the board of the  Foundation for the Protection of Glasnost, sent a protest to  Deputy Mayor Valeriy Malyshev regarding the violation of radio  broadcasting companies' rights in Petersburg contained in the  "Directives" sent by Malyshev to heads of rayon administrations  and in the proposed contract between the GTRK [State Television  and Radio Company] Petersburg--Channel 5 and rayon  administrations.    A broadcaster called "Administration" is not envisaged in  any  law, and granting this subject--mythical from the standpoint of  the "Law on the Mass Media"--the right to enter a contract with  a GTRK is not only illegal but simply unnatural. There are rayon  desks registered as mass media entities (dependent or  independent of rayon administrations), and only they may be the  subject of contracts involving broadcasting, says the protest.    In addition, Simonov draws Malyshev's attention to the fact  that the GTRK Petersburg--Channel 5 itself does not have a  license to conduct broadcasting over the wire, and therefore its  claim to exclusivity in wire broadcasting is extremely  questionable.    And finally, the unit that has been set up in the GTRK for  the purpose of monitoring the content of radio programs  broadcast by rayons is an act of local censorship, which in  principle is contrary to the current law.    As to election materials and their broadcasting through  rayon  "desks," the executive branch does not have the prerogative to  sanction or ban this, even less so the "mother" television and  radio company.    "The fund is ready to support a court action by any of the  rayon desks, whose legitimate rights are infringed on either by  the `Directives' or the `Contract,' of which we hereby inform  you simultaneously with this letter," Aleksey Simonov continued.</p>

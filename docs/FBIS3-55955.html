The heads of state and government of  the 16 member countries of the alliance are participating in its  work.    Three questions are chiefly being discussed at this  conference, the first to be organized since the equivalent  meeting in Rome two years ago. The most important of these, as  already reported in PRAVDA, concerns relations with countries  located in the east of the continent. Having encountered  insistent demands for NATO membership from a number of these  countries, particularly Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic,  and at the same time not wishing to "complicate President  Yeltsin's positions in the face of the Russian conservatives,  who are opposed to NATO's zone of responsibility coming any  closer to the borders of the former USSR," the North Atlantic  alliance has drawn up a "new formula" for partnership with East  European, Baltic, and CIS countries, including Russia. It is  this formula, which bears the name of "Partnership for Peace,"  that the conference is to adopt officially.    Specifically it is a question of the following. It will be  proposed that all the East European partners without exception  sign bilateral cooperation agreements with NATO. It is not  proposed to grant any security guarantees to these countries.  Some conditions are being advanced, associated, for example,  with a pledge not to use force and openness in the planning of  military budgets, and at the same time it is proposed that the  "new partners" will be able to hold joint maneuvers with NATO,  to participate in peacekeeping operations, etc. In other words,  it is planned to expand the scale of the present ties with these  partners without applying to them Article 5 of the North  Atlantic Treaty, which provides for alliance commitments in the  sphere of collective defense.    It is already known from the information materials  disseminated at the conference press center that the "NATO  aspirants" are responding adversely to this formula. In  particular, they accuse the North Atlantic alliance of  "irresponsibly giving in under pressure from Russia."    Another item on the agenda is approval of the West European  countries' independent defense role within the NATO framework.  The United States is expected officially to give its consent to  this. In which case a special command will be created, which  will be able to provide the Western European Union (a defense  organization embracing 11 West European countries -- V.P.) with  armed forces "separate from the alliance's military structures"  and earmarked, in particular, for conducting "peacekeeping  operations" outside NATO's zone of responsibility.    Finally, the situation in Bosnia will be examined, notably  with regard to the plan for making air strikes for "the purpose  of ending hostilities there" -- as has already been discussed  repeatedly before.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Technology: Flexible workhorse that went to war - How the modern lathe can produce shell casings as easily as chess pieces By selling equipment to Iraq, Matrix Churchill triggered off a political storm which has also focused sharp attention on the versatility of modern machine tools. They are often called 'mother machines' because of their role in making equipment for use throughout the manufacturing industry, but few such mothers are as flexible as the computer-controlled lathe. In manufacturing, however, this raises few eyebrows. Flexibility is what lathes are all about. At the Hanover machine tool fair in September, 1989, shortly after UK-based Matrix Churchill first publicly admitted it had sold machine tools to Iraq, the company had one on show programmed to make chess pieces from brass to illustrate its lathes' versatility. If they can produce chess pieces, why shouldn't any computer numerical control (CNC) lathes be able to make shell casings, say experts on CNC machine tools? After all, almost the whole range of machine tools such as milling machines, machining centres, boring machines and CNC presses are used in arms production. The basic process in a lathe is 'turning' - applying a tool to a rapidly spinning billet of steel to produce a cylindrical component with multi-diameters, tapers and other features. Even manual lathes can produce huge varieties of cylindrical components. With CNC, which expresses every action and movement of the machine tool as a number which can be controlled by computer, productivity is transformed, accuracy is controlled by computer down to a few microns, and reprogramming to switch tasks can be done in half a day. It is not surprising, therefore, that the CNC unit is the most sensitive part of a modern machine tool for governments worried about possible end-use. While the machine tools exported to Iraq were British, the CNC units directing them were foreign - the market is dominated by Fanuc of Japan. CNC producers are also interested in flexibility. The Fanuc controllers used typically on a Churchill lathe are much the same as those used on other lathes, although the software varies. Much of the machine tool builder's expertise goes into marrying a flexible user-friendly control system to a versatile metal-cutting workhorse. So how does the owner of a CNC lathe set it up to produce, say, shell casings, or switch production from harmless widgets or tractor axles to armament components? The simplest approach, particularly for a manufacturer lacking a modern computer-aided design (Cad) system, would be to produce an engineering drawing of the casing. This would be taken to the machine tool, and an operator would punch in the basic dimensions of the part and the sequence of machining operations. This is called 'manual data input'. Several different rough and final finishing operations would be needed to produce a shell casing, but the operator would have a basic knowledge of machining. The CNC unit works out the details of the tool path and, in many cases, produces a graphic of the finished part. The programmer will also input the speed of cutting and the 'feed rate' at which the cutting tool is pushed towards the component. Often, the CNC unit's own internal library will calculate, for example, how quickly the workpiece will have to be turned to cut a certain depth. Western manufacturers of shell casings would almost certainly not follow this route, preferring to produce the design on a Cad system. A standard piece of computer-aided manufacturing (Cam) software attached to the Cad system converts the design into data that can be used in manufacturing. The programmer sits in an office inputting the machining, tooling and other instructions in a process known as 'off-line' programming. If the program has been produced off-line, it has to be transferred to the CNC. This is done by storing it in a floppy disk and taking it to the CNC, or installing a direct numerical control (DNC) cabling link between the Cam and the CNC. Once the program is installed in the unit, and the tooling sorted out, the first component can be produced. The operator can edit the program to adjust dimensions, making final corrections that could take only a few minutes for the part to be made to very fine tolerances. Then full-scale production can begin. Once programmed, the CNC unit will store all the information it needs and can be switched from widgets to shell casings in an hour or two, allowing time for changing some of the tools and the workholders. And if the bottom falls out of the armaments market, it can be switched back to widgets again.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / UK Company News: Cementone rises 22% to Pounds 1.21m Cementone, the specialist paints and building chemicals manufacturer which came to the market earlier this year through a reverse takeover of Multitrust, has announced a 22 per cent increase in profits. Strong demand for the group's admixtures and bulk chemicals helped lift pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 995,046) in the year to December 31. Operating profits rose by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 1.45m (Pounds 1.36m), but the group benefited from reduced interest payments and increased investment income. A decline in paint sales, however, contributed to flat turnover of Pounds 17.4m (Pounds 17.2m). Mr Alfred Baxendale, the chief executive, said the group was proceeding with plans to dispose of the asset portfolio inherited from Multitrust, the property investment company. Earnings per share rose to 4.05p (3.44p), and Mr Baxendale said the group would announce its first interim dividend in September this year.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / International Company News: New Line hopes to break out of old mould - The film group is moving into the big-budget movie business This Friday's premiere of Dumb and Dumber, starring Jim Carrey, the cult comedian, will mark the end of an extraordinary year for New Line Cinema, one of Hollywood's most talked about movie studios. New Line started 1994 by finalising its Dollars 550m acquisition by Mr Ted Turner, the buccaneering media mogul. It went on to score its biggest hit in Carrey's The Mask, which has earned almost Dollars 120m in the US. It then joined the ranks of Hollywood's big spenders by offering Julia Roberts Dollars 12m and Meg Ryan Dollars 8m to star in a remake of The Women and bidding Dollars 4m for The Long Kiss Goodnight, an unfinished script by Shane Black. As New Line is aware, 1995 will be a critical year in which it must prove it can break away from its old independent status by producing big-budget movies as a direct competitor of leading studios such as Warner Brothers, Sony and Paramount. The Hollywood cynics are already predicting it has gone too far and risks becoming yet another ambitious Hollywood independent that aimed too high and lost. Mr Robert Shaye, chairman, disagrees. 'We've been in this business for 27 years. We've proved ourselves by making successful films for niche audiences. Now we're ready to move on,' he says. Mr Shaye is a Columbia law school graduate who became a film archivist at New York's Museum of Modern Art. He founded New Line in 1967 by selling underground movies to college film clubs from his apartment in Manhattan. New Line made its name in the movie world with a string of cult successes aimed mainly at a young audience  - from the Nightmare on Elm Street series, which has grossed Dollars 500m worldwide, to art-house projects such as Mr Gus Van Sant's My Private Idaho and Mr Robert Altman's Short Cuts. It soon won a reputation for tight cost control. Mr Shaye became infamous for memos urging staff to save paper and recycle paper clips. He also practised what he preached by driving a 1972 Oldsmobile convertible. New Line swiftly distinguished itself from fellow independents by diversifying into distribution. Most concentrate on the less profitable area of production, thereby remaining reliant on distribution deals with the big studios. Mr Shaye and Mr Michael Lynne, a lawyer friend from Columbia who became president of New Line in 1990, expanded their production interests by launching Fine Line Features to handle art-house projects, including the Altman and Van Sant films. The New Line group was making 14 films a year by the early 1990s. However, there were limitations attached to its independent status. The main problem was that its banks would not allow it to make films for more than Dollars 25m. This not only excluded New Line from larger projects, but impeded its expansion outside the US. New Line's films were so small it could only sell them to foreign distributors on a packaged basis, rather than negotiating special international deals for promising projects, such as The Mask. The Turner acquisition, which coincided with Mr Turner's purchase of Castle Rock, the independent behind When Harry Met Sally, addressed this problem by enabling New Line to raise capital for more ambitious projects. New Line still looks and feels like the same, free-wheeling independent. Its baseball-capped staff are younger than the Hollywood norm. Mr Michael de Luca, head of production, is in his late 20s. Behind the scenes New Line has been making the most of its new status as a subsidiary of the Turner group. As well as the deals with Roberts, Ryan and Black, it has paid Dollars 7m to Carrey for Dumb and Dumber and signed Renny Harlin to direct The Long Kiss Goodnight with his wife, Geena Davis, in the lead. Mr Lynne has formed a joint venture with Havas, the French media group, to invest Dollars 30m in interactive entertainment over the next few years. The company will then be able to develop its own computer game and CD-Rom formats, rather than licensing them to other companies as it has done previously. If New Line's projects pay off, the rewards will be far higher than in the past  - but so will the risks. As the chairman of a rival studio said: 'New Line is hot right now. But they've taken on a lot. Let's hope Ted Turner has deep pockets. He might need them.'</p>

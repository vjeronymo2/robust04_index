			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MICROWAVE . . .: HERE'S MOUSSE THAT'S SIMPLY GREAT  </P> <P> If you really want to wow friends with your microwave prowess, try this  drop-dead chocolate mousse.  </P> <P> It looks -- and tastes -- as if you'd slaved over a hot stove all day. And yet  it needs only minutes in the microwave.  </P> <P> But first, a few pointers.  </P> <P>  -- Never double this recipe as it may curdle or boil over. Whenever you need a  double amount, prepare two batches.  </P> <P>  -- Never try to hurry cooking of egg-thickened desserts by upping the power  level to HIGH (100% power). In ovens of 700 watts or more, egg mixtures may  cook more evenly on 10% to 20% power. Whenever the mixture seems in danger of  curdling, reduce the power level at once.  </P> <P>  -- Always watch egg mixtures carefully as they microwave and check for  doneness after minimum cooking time (microwave times will vary according to the  oven's power). When it comes to delicate egg-thickened mixtures, seconds, not  minutes, can spell the difference between success and failure.  </P> <P>  -- Remember that egg-thickened mixtures continue to cook as they stand, so  remove from the microwave the instant they test done.  </P> <P>  -- To stop cooking of egg mixtures cold, quick-chill in an ice bath or whisk  briskly for several seconds.  </P> <P> CHOCOLATE MOUSSE  </P> <P> 4 ounces semisweet chocolate  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons water  </P> <P> 3 eggs, separated  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon vanilla  </P> <P> 1 cup whipping cream  </P> <P> 2 tablespoons powdered sugar  </P> <P> Chocolate curls and/or toasted blanched almonds, optional  </P> <P> Melt chocolate with water in uncovered 1-quart bowl by microwaving on MEDIUM  (50% power) 2 1/2 to 3 minutes. Beat until smooth. Whisk small amount of  chocolate into egg yolks, mix back into bowl and microwave, uncovered, on  MEDIUM-LOW (30% power) 1 to 2 minutes.  </P> <P> Whisk again and transfer to cold 2-quart bowl. Stir in vanilla and cool to  lukewarm.  </P> <P> Beat cream with powdered sugar until soft mounds form. Fold into chocolate  mixture.  </P> <P> In separate bowl, beat egg whites to soft peaks and fold in, small amount at  time, until no white streaks show.  </P> <P> Spoon into serving dish, cover and chill 6 to 8 hours or overnight. Decorate  with chocolate curls and/or toasted blanched almonds. Makes 6 servings.  </P> <P> Variation: For Frozen Chocolate Mousse, prepare mousse as directed and chill.  Spoon into parfait glasses. Cover and freeze until firm. Let stand 10 to 15  minutes at room temperature before serving.  </P> <P> How to Make Chocolate Curls: Unwrap 1-ounce square chocolate (any type). Place  on plate and microwave, uncovered, on MEDIUM (50% power) 15 to 20 seconds until  just warm. Using swivel-bladed vegetable peeler, shave off curls. If chocolate  hardens, simply rewarm.  </P> <P> How to Toast Almonds: Spread 1/2 to 2 cups blanched, slivered almonds on 9- to  11-inch pie plate, depending on amount. Microwave, uncovered, on HIGH (100%  power), allowing 3 to 4 minutes for 1/2 cup and 4 to 6 minutes for 1 to 2 cups,  stirring once or twice, until lightly browned. Let stand, uncovered, 2 to 3  minutes. Nuts will continue browning as they stand, so don't overcook.  </P> <P> Note: In ovens of less than 600 watts, increase cooking times about 15%.  </P></p>

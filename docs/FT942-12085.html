			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Bouygues wins Hungary deal: World News Digest A consortium led by Bouygues, the French construction group, has won eastern Europe's largest toll motorway concession. The Hungarian government, which has been advised by Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, yesterday awarded Bouygues the Dollars 350m project to finance, upgrade, extend and operate Hungary's M5 motorway. The Hungarian Motorway International Consortium, which teams Bouygues and German bank Commerzbank, defeated a group led by Transroute International and GTM International, two French toll-road operators. Bau Holding, the Austrian construction company and another partner in the winning consortium, said earlier that the consortium would have to raise Ft7bn (Pounds 45.7m) in equity capital of which Bau would provide about 40 per cent. The M5 concession is the largest project yet in Hungary's Dollars 3bn programme to bring in private investors and developers, extend four motorways from the capital to the country's borders and build two bridges across the Danube. The M5 leads toward Serbia and uncertainty over traffic projections has complicated financing and delayed its extension to the frontier.</p>

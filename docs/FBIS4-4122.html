			<p>BFN     [Text] The provincial party committee held a forum in  Nanhai City from 18 to 19 April on rural joint-stock cooperative  system reform in the Zhu Jiang delta. Xie Fei, member of the  Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of  the Guangdong provincial party committee, presided over the  forum and delivered the concluding speech.    The forum mainly discussed the issue of using the  joint-stock  cooperative system for land development that is evolving in  relatively rich rural areas of the Zhu Jiang delta. The  participants conscientiously discussed the important  significance, basic requirements, guiding ideas, working  principles, and policies of the reform.    Participants held that reforms related to the joint-stock  cooperative system for land development which have been  initiated in the developed areas of the Zhu Jiang delta are  worth being introduced into other localities in the delta with a  relatively developed economy and where there is a large,  redundant rural labor force available, where secondary and  tertiary industries, especially township and town enterprises,  account for a great portion of the economy, and where the system  is readily accepted by the peasants. It is necessary to  gradually implement this system under strong leadership on the  basis of pilot projects and in accordance with the principle  that reform should give full play to the peasants' initiative  and help to stabilize and promote agricultural production,  promote economic returns, and increase peasants' incomes.</p>

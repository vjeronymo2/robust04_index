			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Study group sees market remaining in broad balance THE WORLD copper market is likely to remain in broad balance this year as a modest rise in consumption is matched by increased supplies, according to industry experts attending this week's inaugural meeting of the International Copper Study Group in Geneva. The group, set up last January, brings together government and industry representatives from 18 producing and consuming countries representing over 60 per cent of world copper trade. Zambia, the third biggest copper exporter, has stated its intention to join the group and Japan, the biggest importer, says it will join if the terms of reference can be amended. This would increase the proportion of copper trade covered by the group to 78 per cent. Russia, once one of the top three copper producers, has also expressed an interest in joining. Mr Alexei Shevtsov, a senior Russian official, said Moscow was ready to provide data on production and consumption and was interested in information on technology, environment and investment. The group is designed to improve copper market information and undertake regular assessments of the market situation and outlook. However, this first meeting, which ends tomorrow, attended by over 100 delegates from about 30 countries, has been dominated by procedural and administrative issues. These include the location of the group's headquarters, appointment of a secretary-general and the initial work programme and budget. Lisbon, Santiago and Montreal have all offered to host the organisation. Commentaries on the market situation presented to the meeting indicate that while there are already signs of a pick-up in demand for copper in the US market, this may be offset by stagnant consumption in the recession-hit Japanese and European markets. An unpublished Canadian government assessment suggests that continued overall growth of world copper output could put some downward pressure on prices this year, assuming no major supply disruptions. 'While copper consumption is expected to experience significant growth beginning in 1993, prices to 1995 are likely to be adversely affected by further increases in copper mine capacity,' the assessment says. However, it predicts that prices will subsequently strengthen with strong demand and a slowdown in the growth of world copper supply. The Canadian view appears to be generally shared by copper consumers, though some producer countries are more optimistic. Mr Ernesto Tironi, Chile's representative at this week's meeting, said rising demand coupled with production problems in Peru, Zaire, Zambia and the former eastern bloc countries could lead to demand outstripping supply by end-1992 or early 1993. Chile is by far the world's biggest exporter.</p>

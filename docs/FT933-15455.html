			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report COPPER prices burst higher at the London Metal Exchange yesterday afternoon after a bear raid linked to July traded options declarations had pushed values lower in earlier trading. The three months position, which had been as low as Dollars 1,920 a tonne, closed at Dollars 1,956.50 a tonne, up Dollars 10 on balance, and moved on to Dollars 1,974 a tonne in after-hours trading. Dealers attributed the late surge to the weight of investment fund and speculative buying. ALUMINIUM's weaker trend continued, with three months metal closing Dollars 13.75 down at Dollars 1,240.75 a tonne. Dealers said upside momentum had run out in the absence of follow-up production decisions after Aluminum Company of America's announcement of cuts last week. The NICKEL market ended steadier after becoming oversold in the morning's fall to six-year lows. Technically-inspired buying saw the three months delivery price rally to Dollars 5,252.50 at the close, up Dollars 37.50 on the day. COCOA and COFFEE prices recouped early losses at the London Commodities Exchange to end little changed on the day. Fears of a July cocoa squeeze had evaporated, traders said.

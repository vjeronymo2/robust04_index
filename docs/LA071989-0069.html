			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE STUDIES CINCO DISCLOSURE BID;  </P> <P> RULING ON MAKING COST OF MURDER DEFENSE PUBLIC IS DELAYED  </P> <P> Describing the case as unique, a San Diego County judge Tuesday said he needed  more time to rule on a prosecutor's request to make public the cost of  defending a former auto mechanic convicted of murdering two San Diego police  officers.  </P> <P> At a hearing in Superior Court, Judge Charles R. Hayes was asked to choose  between the public's right to learn how it spends money defending people  accused of murder and the time-honored rule protecting lawyers' secrets.  </P> <P> Hayes apparently will be the first California judge to interpret a provision in  state law that keeps confidential the amount of public money spent for legal  defense in death-penalty cases. That 1977 law sets up a process in capital  cases by which a defense lawyer asks a judge for public funds to pay for  "investigators, experts and others" that the lawyer feels would be helpful.  </P> <P> The law itself does not say whether the secrecy should end when the case ends.  Convicted murderer Joselito Cinco, 29, committed suicide in December in his  cell at San Quentin, making his case one of the first to become final since the  Legislature restored the death penalty in 1977.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Case 'More Final'  </P> <P> "No case will ever be more final," Deputy Dist. Atty Howard H. Shore, who made  the request to unseal the records, told Hayes. "If the records are not made  available to the public in this case, it's safe to assume they never will be."  </P> <P> Defense attorneys, including John G. Cotsirilos, the San Diego lawyer who  defended Cinco, complained to Hayes that what prosecutors are really trying to  do with their request was score a political and tactical bonanza.  </P> <P> Cotsirilos said he did not object to making public the lump sum expended on a  case, reportedly nearing $1 million in Cinco's case.  </P> <P> But he said the primary difference between a death-penalty case and other cases  is the "emotion and semi-hysteria" unique to capital cases. Combining that  emotion with an explicit description of the high cost of defense could fuel a  drive to persuade the Legislature to change the law to give prosecutors a voice  in how the defense of capital cases is funded, he said.  </P> <P> The tactical problem, Cotsirilos said, is that releasing the breakdown on even  one case would enable prosecutors to learn how defense attorneys prepare in  general for murder trials.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Applications, Hearings Secret  </P> <P> The law in question keeps secret not only the lawyer's application for funds  but also any hearings the judge and lawyer may hold on the request. To divulge  those conversations would mean revealing legal theories and strategy, and the  law traditionally has protected that information, Cotsirilos said in legal  papers he filed before the hearing.  </P> <P> At Tuesday's hearing, Hayes asked Cotsirilos whether he would object to the  disclosure of names and fees of experts and investigators who testified at  trial but keep private the names of those he consulted but didn't call at  trial. Cotsirilos said that would be redundant, since prosecutors already know  who testified in the trial.  </P> <P> Shore urged Hayes to make everything -- the figures, the documentation and  transcripts of any hearings -- public, citing the rule that court records are  usually public records. "We feel the public should be able to scrutinize this  process," he said.  </P> <P> Shore said it is nonsense to say prosecutors sought defense lawyers' tactical  secrets.  </P> <P> "I can't imagine why they think we think there's some dark, mysterious secret  they have that will make our lives easier," he said. "That's preposterous."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Public Accountability  </P> <P> Supporting Shore was Marilyn L. Huff, a San Diego lawyer who filed a  friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the San Diego Union and Tribune  newspapers asking for release of the records. She also relied on the rule  making most court records public.  </P> <P> "This is a case about public accountability," she said.  </P> <P> But Lewis A. Wenzell, a San Diego defense lawyer who wrote a  friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the Criminal Defense Lawyers Club of San  Diego and the Criminal Defense Bar Assn., groups of about 70 and 200 attorneys,  respectively, said the papers had a different interest.  </P> <P> "What the (two newspapers) want is a public uproar about what it costs to kill  people in this state," Wenzell said. "They have no interest in the cost to the  court or the prosecution of these cases."  </P> <P> Huff denied that, saying the papers would be interested in the cost of  prosecution as well.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Written Opinion  </P> <P> Hayes, a former San Diego County deputy district attorney who moved to the  Municipal Court bench in February, 1986, and the Superior Court in December,  1987, gave no indication when he would rule. He said he will write an opinion  announcing his decision, a somewhat uncommon step for a Superior Court judge.  </P> <P> Any decision Hayes might announce in the near future would not take effect  until Cotsirilos completes a "complete accounting" of the money, the only  reference in the state law to the end of a case. That accounting is under  review, Cotsirilos said.  </P> <P> Cinco was convicted and sentenced to die in June, 1988, for killing two police  officers in Balboa Park on Sept. 14, 1984.  </P> <P> Because of extensive publicity, Cinco's trial was moved to Orange County, where  a jury found him guilty of the murders, which occurred when Cinco and another  man were trying to avoid misdemeanor citations for providing liquor to two  teen-age girls.  </P></p>

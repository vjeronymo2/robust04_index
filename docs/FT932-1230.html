			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / International Company News: Cash-rich Minorco still in the hunt for assets - The departure of Sir Michael Edwardes is the end of an era SIR MICHAEL Edwardes. former chairman of British Leyland and Chloride, was in his element that day in September 1988, as he sipped mineral water and munched smoked salmon sandwiches in a cramped office discussing his latest venture - the small matter of a Pounds 3bn (Dollars 4.5bn) bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. His appearance, as the new deputy chairman and chief executive of Minorco, to lead the charge against Gold Fields took everyone by surprise. He promised Minorco, up to then the 60 per cent owned, sleepy offshore investment arm of the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa, would become one of the world's biggest natural resources group, and a dynamic, 'hands-on' operator of its assets. The first step was to be the takeover of Gold Fields, which seemed a foregone conclusion because Minorco already owned 29.9 per cent of the UK mining and industrial combine. Sir Michael looked forward to three or four years of the kind of hectic activity he relished - sorting out and making more efficient a large group and then building on strengthened foundations. But it was not to be. Gold Fields executives fought the hostile bid like demons. Eventually, Minorco had enough acceptances to take its holding to more than 50 per cent. But the takeover was blocked by a New York judge who cited Minorco's South African parentage and Anglo's liking for cartels. Minorco gave up the battle, clearing the way for Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, to snap up Gold Fields. This left Minorco with Dollars 1.6bn cash for its Gold Fields stake, but it was obvious it would take much longer than Sir Michael had anticipated to reach its strategic objectives. He stepped down as chief executive but still played an active role on the Minorco board, providing a link with Charter Consolidated, the industrial group where he is chairman and where a former British Leyland colleague, Mr Jeff Herbert, is managing director. Yesterday came the news that those links between Minorco and Charter are to be severed. Minorco is to sell its 36 per cent shareholding in Charter back to that company. At the same time, Sir Michael said he would resign from the Minorco board, on which he had served since 1984. 'We will miss him. He made a major contribution - he helped to get us started,' said Mr Hank Slack, the new Minorco chief executive. There has already been a wide management shake-up at Minorco, which effectively had three managing directors: the original trio that Sir Michael dubbed his 'Young Turks,' who persuaded Anglo that Minorco should change its style and mount the offensive against Gold Fields. Now Mr Tony Lea is being recalled to Anglo's Johannesburg headquarters and Mr Roger Phillimore resigned because he lost the contest to Mr Slack for the chief executive's role. Since the Gold Fields debacle, Minorco's progress has been steady, but too slow for analysts looking for drama of the sort that bid created. Minorco started promisingly, paying Dollars 705m for the US gold operations of Freeport McMoRan but since then there has been nothing earth-shattering. Things might have been different if Minorco had been permitted to buy 49 per cent of the Olympic Dam copper-uranium mine in Australia from British Petroleum, or if its offer for Gold Fields Mining Corporation, Hanson's gold subsidiary in the US, had come off. Together these would have cost Dollars 1bn and catapulted Minorco towards its strategic goal of becoming one of the world's biggest mining groups. But Western Mining, the Australian group which owned the other half of Olympic Dam decided to exercise its pre-emptive rights to the BP stake and Hanson swapped its gold for the coal and aggregates business of Santa Fe Pacific. Nevertheless, Minorco has not been entirely unsuccessful in its search for new assets. In the past nine months it has spent about Dollars 337 on four deals: jointly with Anglo it paid Dollars 190m for one-third of the Collahuasi copper project in Chile; on its own account it paid Dollars 66m for a half-share in the Lisheen zinc deposit in Ireland; paid Pounds 55m to buy Steetley Iberia from Redland and Dollars 90.6m to swap an indirect interest in Johnson Matthey, the UK platinum marketing group, for a 10 per cent direct stake. Mr Slack said Minorco had three 'legs' of strategic interest: precious metals, with the emphasis on gold; base metals with the emphasis on copper; and industrial minerals. 'A number of significant investment opportunities' were under consideration. Minorco has spent well over Dollars 1bn since the sale of its Gold Fields shares but, once the Charter deal is completed, it will still have Dollars 1.1bn, net of borrowings in Luxembourg where it is based. Mr Slack said that this gave Minorco more flexibility to do a bigger deal in the natural resources sector or to make more deals. Mr Euan Worthington, head of the mining team at SG Warburg, agreed the Charter deal made sense from Minorco's point of view and that Minorco negotiated a good price. 'The question is: can Minorco spend the money wisely?'</p>

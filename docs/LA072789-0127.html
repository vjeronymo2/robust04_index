			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CITY ATTORNEY URGED TO WRAP UP BRADLEY PROBE  </P> <P> Los Angeles City Council President John Ferraro urged the city attorney  Wednesday to rapidly conclude his investigation of Mayor Tom Bradley's  financial affairs to stem the growing distrust in government created by the  lingering probe.  </P> <P> "It is vital to all parties concerned, including Mayor Bradley, that the facts  are determined and the issues resolved as soon as possible," Ferraro said in a  letter to City Atty. James K. Hahn.  </P> <P> "The delay in the completion of your investigation and report is a matter of  increasing concern to me, the public and to many other members of the council,"  Ferraro wrote.  </P> <P> "However," he continued later in the letter, "we cannot ignore the growing  unrest and demands for an expeditious and conclusive resolution of these  matters. Until this occurs, there will be further erosion in the public's  confidence in government and in the ability of its elected officials to conduct  the business of the city."  </P> <P> Ferraro offered Hahn any help needed, including additional investigators, to  reach a "speedy and thorough" conclusion of the probe.  </P> <P> Hahn was expected to issue a comment later in the day, his spokesman said.  </P> <P> Bradley, appearing at a council meeting on an unrelated topic, told reporters  that he also hoped the inquiry would reach an end soon, but was concerned that  the council might interfere with Hahn's probe.  </P> <P> "The city attorney has been conducting his inquiry for four months. I am  anxious that there be a full inquiry, that it be expeditious, and I would hope  that nothing that the council does will delay that expeditious process."  </P> <P> In related developments, the furor over Bradley's alleged use of his office to  help Far East National Bank, which paid him $18,000 in 1988 as its only paid  adviser, sparked a conflict Wednesday over swearing in witnesses testifying at  committee hearings about the charges.  </P> <P> "People are lying and they've got to be placed under oath so they can be  punished," Councilman Nate Holden said. "If they're not put under oath, then we  should discontinue this whole dog and pony show."  </P> <P> Ferraro introduced a motion during a council meeting giving the chairmen of the  two committees investigating the mayor's role in a $2-million deposit of city  funds at Far East the power to "require" their witnesses to testify under oath.  </P> <P> Ferraro said all council members now have the power under the City Charter to  administer the oaths, but they cannot as individuals or committees compel sworn  testimony.  </P> <P> His motion, which will be considered Tuesday, gives them that ability.  </P> <P> "I would hope that the committee would put people under oath, so if they do  make a statement that's perjury, then there's a penalty involved," Ferraro  said. "We want the truth, and I think the public is demanding it, and all we're  doing is representing the public in this case."  </P> <P> Bradley said he would not object to requiring oaths, but he refused to answer a  reporter's question whether he would honor Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores'  request that he make a full account of his actions involving Far East to the  council.  </P> <P> "I have no objection to it, so far," he said. "I don't think there's been any  indication of a need for it, but certainly if it's appropriate, I would have no  objection to it. I hope that the actions of the council will serve not to delay  this process."  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is chairman of the Finance and Revenue  Committee, acknowledged "somebody is lying" in accounts to his committee, but  he said he had no immediate plans to compel sworn testimony. He also declined  to say specifically who was not telling the truth.  </P> <P> Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg appeared Monday and Tuesday before Yaroslavsky's  committee to answer charges in an audit by the City Administrative Office that  he violated city policy in depositing $2 million in Far East without taking  competitive bids.  </P> <P> Ed Corser, the city's chief administrative analyst, told the committee on  Monday that a reference next to the Far East bid sheet that the deposits were  made "per the mayor" was whited out with correction fluid and a black felt  marker was used to draw a line across the back of the page in an apparent  attempt to cover up the reference.  </P> <P> Rittenberg told the committee that he has not gotten a straight answer from his  staff over who deleted the reference, and the two most likely involved point to  each other as the culprit.  </P> <P> The two individuals, William Hoss, a cash management officer, and George  Sehlmeyer, an investment officer, were to appear before Yaroslavksy's committee  Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning.  </P></p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / New bond offerings reach record high NEW bond offerings reached a record and helped to boost the volume of borrowing in the international capital markets by 38 per cent to Dollars 256.3bn (Pounds 170bn) in the period January-April 1993, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development*. 'The acceleration in borrowing activity was entirely due to a record volume of bond offerings, which accounted for two thirds of the total, and a significant advance in programmes for the issuance of euro-commercial paper and medium-term euro-notes' said the OECD report. A total of Dollars 170.3bn was raised in bond issues in the period January-April this year, out of a total of Dollars 256.3bn and against Dollars 114.2bn in bond issuance in the comparable period in 1992. More recent figures supplied by Euromoney show eurobond issues in the first six months of 1993 amounted to Dollars 200.78bn, against Dollars 152.87bn in the first half of 1992. The OECD predicts that the high level of activity in the international bond market will continue, even if the growth in securities business is 'less spectacular'. In addition, the organisation expects to see more non-OECD borrowers (for example those from Latin America) stepping up the flow of offerings, especially as they approach investment grade ratings. * Financial Market Trends No 55, June 1993.

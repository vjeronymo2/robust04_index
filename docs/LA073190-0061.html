			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAMS' HENLEY COLLAPSES IN LOCKER ROOM  </P> <P> Ram cornerback Darryl Henley collapsed in the team's locker room at UC Irvine  Monday evening and was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for what the  Rams described as "exhaustion and dehydration."  </P> <P> A spokesman for Tustin Health Care Medical Center would say only that Henley's  condition was stable.  </P> <P> The second-year cornerback from UCLA collapsed on the trainer's table at 6:20  p.m., about 90 minutes after Monday's afternoon practice ended. He was treated  at the scene by paramedics.  </P> <P> "He was cramping up in the locker room," said linebacker Paul Butcher, an  eyewitness. "He was hyperventilating a little bit."  </P> <P> The Rams later released a statement, which read, in part: "Henley's condition  has been stabilized and he is currently undergoing additional precautionary  tests. He will be released later this evening and return to the Rams training  facility at UC Irvine."  </P></p>

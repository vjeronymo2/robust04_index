			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTION ISSUES: S&amp;LS, ABORTION  </P> <P> In response to Pete Wilson's savings and loan contributions:  </P> <P> Your editorial ("A Good Issue, but the Wrong Man," Aug. 7) supporting Wilson in  accepting contributions from the S&amp;L industry is premature.  </P> <P> With painful knowledge of how this particular segment of our business community  has operated in the past, it is hardly likely this immense amount of money was  granted to Wilson because he's just a nice kid. Maybe he is a nice kid, but the  S&amp;Ls don't give unless they can get. This is a situation which bears close  scrutiny, and your editorial is premature.  </P> <P> JACQUELINE KERR  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

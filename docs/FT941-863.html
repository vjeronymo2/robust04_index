			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / International Company News: Italtel and Siemens unit form telecoms partnership Italtel, the manufacturing subsidiary of Italy's state-owned telecommunications group, has concluded its long search for a foreign partner by announcing a tie-up with Siemens of Germany. The accord, which is a further sign of cross-border moves in European telecommunications, combines the operations of Italtel and the Italian telecoms affiliate of Siemens in a new company expected to have a turnover of about L3,400bn (Dollars 2bn) in 1994 and show strong medium-term growth. Italtel's sales totalled L2,632bn in 1993. Siemens and Italtel's holding company, the telecoms utility Stet, will each control 50 per cent but, as the capital of Italtel is more than four times the size of its new partner, the German group is to pay an adjustment fee. Although the value of this has yet to be established, it is likely to be in the range of L1,200bn to L1,700bn. Stet is expected to buy back a 20 per cent stake in Italtel held by AT&amp;T. The US group, Alcatel of France and Ericsson of Sweden were all considered as potential partners for Italtel. The agreement with Siemens is seen as essential to the growth of the Milan-based Italtel, which has been restricted by a limited domestic market and saw its net profits fall to L40.2bn in 1993 from L133.2bn. The joint company aims to build up exports to 40 per cent of turnover by 1996 to 1997, and to concentrate on development of Italtel's core business - production of its Linea UT digital telephone exchanges, which are in service in 18 countries. Emphasis has also been placed on the research role of Siemens in developing strategic products. The decision on a new partner, which has been approved by Italian unions, helps to secure jobs at Italtel, which has employs more than 15,000. It comes amid wide restructuring within the country's telecoms industry The government, through the IRI holding group, plans to sell its 52 per cent stake in Stet by the end of this year.</p>

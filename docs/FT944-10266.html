			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Observer: Safety in numbers Not bad going: two new central bank governors in one day. The announcement of Yasuo Matsushita at the Bank of Japan and Bodil Nyboe Andersen at the Danish central bank adds to the impression that the exchange rate in central bank governors is becoming increasingly volatile. They used to be such a stable bunch. Erik Hoffmeyer, who has been running the Danish central bank for 30 years, is a local hero in Denmark and a permanent fixture on the international monetary circuit. And he was not the longest serving central banker. Iceland's Johannes Nordal who retired a year or so ago had run his central bank even longer. Leaving aside Luxembourg's Pierre Jaans, Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands now becomes the grand old man of European central banking and he has only been doing his job since 1981, according to the Morgan Stanley Central Banking Directory. Nine of the European Union's central bank governorships have changed hands over the last couple of years - which must be some sort of record. Then there are all the new faces popping up in eastern Europe. How else will Moscow's Tatyana recognise Tokyo's Yasuo if they don't start wearing big lapel badges at international gatherings? Pretty soon there won't be a central bank governor left who can remember the third world debt crisis or the last time there was a run on a big US money centre bank.</p>

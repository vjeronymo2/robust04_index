			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Boeing wins Dollars 1.2bn order from Dallas airline BOEING of the US yesterday won a Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 620m) order for 34 twin-engine 737-300 airliners from Southwest Airlines, the Dallas-based carrier. Boeing is also understood to have taken the edge over the European Airbus consortium in competition to sell widebody jets to China Southern Airlines, the Cantonese-based carrier. The Chinese airline, which operates Boeing 737 and 757 airliners, is believed to have signed a memorandum of understanding to buy six Boeing 777 widebody jets. The 777, Boeing's latest aircraft, has been in competition with the Airbus A330 widebody airliner for the Chinese order. If the deal is confirmed, Rolls-Royce, the UK aero- engine maker, appears to be in a good position to win the engine order to power the Chinese 777s. Rolls-Royce is providing the engines for China Southern's fleet of 757s. It would be Boeing's first sale of 777s to China. Boeing would not comment on the Chinese deal yesterday, but confirmed Southwest Airlines' intention to order 34 Boeing 737-300s. This would bring total orders for 737s to 3,019 (more than 3,000 being a milestone in the commercial jet airliner market). Boeing said yesterday that Southwest intended to convert 30 options it holds on 737 airliners to firm orders. It would also place four new orders, all for delivery between 1995 and 1997.</p>

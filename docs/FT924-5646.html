			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pressure over environment audit INCLUDING local authorities in EC requirements for environmental auditing would dilute the proposed regulations and should be resisted, the Lords environment committee heard yesterday. Mr David Wheeler, environment health and safety manager at Body Shop, the retailer, argued in a written submission that eco-audits should be mandatory for British companies but not extended to local authorities. The EC's eco-audit proposals have already been diluted, and would offer voluntary guidelines which companies could use to govern scrutiny of the environmental impact of individual sites. Mr Wheeler said the British government was attempting to extend the requirement to local authorities, a move which risked turning it into 'a completely nebulous directive'.</p>

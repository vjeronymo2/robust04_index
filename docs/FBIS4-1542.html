			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 31 (XINHUA) -- China will this year  implement a new policy in some key universities to make no  differences between state-subsidized students and students  enrolled at their own expense.    The reform plan to be introduced in dozens of universities  directly under the State Education Commission, will require  every student to pay an annual tuition fees of 1,000 to 1,500  yuan, according to a senior education official today.    The payment is believed to be equal to about 25 percent of  the annual income of an ordinary family in China but account for  less than 20 percent of the total education cost at universities.    The government will also set a unified score for all  students  taking the national college entrance examination, replacing a  dual standard that allows some students to gain easier access to  universities if they pay more money.    Wang Zhichang, director of university students department of  the state commission described the plan as "an important step"  in reforming the country's education system. "The previous  practice is violating the principle of fair education," he said.    For the past few years, most college students have been  subsidized by the state, with about 13 percent of the total  enrolled at their own expense or supported by social entities.    However, the proportion increased last year to more than 50  percent in some universities as more wealthy families became  eager to send their children to college.    To help those having funding problems continue their studies  at universities, the Education Commission is to introduce both  the scholarship and education loan systems, the director said.  Under the loan system, a student can apply for loans on campus  and pay it back after graduation.    China this year will recruit 895,000 new students for its  more than 1,000 universities and colleges, 25,000 less than last  year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Representatives attending  public hearings held by the government's Tax Commission on  Tuesday [7 June] were divided on a proposed consumption tax hike  to cope with the rapid aging of the population.    The commission's chairman, Kan Kato, however, expressed  optimism that public support would be obtained for the tax raise.    Representatives of business, consumer and other groups  expressed their opinions on tax reforms at the hearings held in  Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, Fukuoka and Kumamoto.    They generally called for income tax cuts on a continuous  basis in and after fiscal 1995 but were split over a raise in  the 3 percent consumption tax.    Even the proponents of the hike demanded administrative  reforms and curbs on government expenditures as prerequisites  for the raise.    They expressed hope that a hike would be held to the minimum  level if it is unavoidable.    Kato, who attended a hearing in Osaka, told a news  conference  most representatives were "cooperative" on the proposed tax  raise.    He said the commission would like to come up with a concrete  plan, including the rate and timing of the tax hike, by the end  of June.    The commission is planning similar hearings in Tokyo and  four  other cities Friday.</p>

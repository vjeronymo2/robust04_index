			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / The cost of using price to choose a computer / Examining the benefits and pitfalls to customers of greater competition among PC manufacturers More than a decade after the first personal computers were soldered together in garages, it is still possible to build your own. A video cassette available through the pages of personal computer magazines explains how to build a professional-quality personal computer from readily available parts. The do-it-yourself approach is symptomatic of a broader trend among customers from all sizes of company to choose a personal computer (PC) on price alone rather than brand name or maker's reputation. Take, for example, Mr Tom Nelson, president of Control Manufacturing of Napa, California, a supplier of industrial control and monitoring systems. He uses personal computers extensively in his business and buys six to eight a month for his customers. 'We have switched over the past six months from buying exclusively IBM and Compaq (the high-price aristocrats of the PC business) to clone makers like Dell, Compuadd and AST.' Clones make PCs functionally identical to IBM ones but they sell more cheaply by shaving profit margins and holding overheads to a minimum. 'It used to be that for a big job, the difference between an IBM or Compaq and a clone did not matter. It was a few hundred dollars in a Dollars 100,000 contract. When the price differential got to 25 per cent, it made a big difference and our customers started asking for clones,' said Mr Nelson. His comments are graphic evidence of the unprecedented decline in the cost of personal computers. In the past 12 months alone, the selling price of PCs has fallen by between 25 per cent and 45 per cent. The trend is being driven by companies such as Dell Computer, the pioneer in selling 'off-the-page' (mail order), and a myriad of computer assemblers operating in the Far East. Now, IBM and Compaq are being forced to follow suit. A Compaq computer which sold for Pounds 2,495 in the UK a year ago now sells for Pounds 1,395. The company had never sold a machine costing less than Pounds 1,500 a year ago; now, its cheapest computer costs Pounds 550. US prices are even lower. The specification of mach-ines on offer at cheaper than Pounds 1,000 is extraordinary. The basic offering from the UK maker Elonex includes a high-performance microprocessor (33MHz 386SX), vast storage capacity (50MB hard disk and 2MB of random access memory), colour monitor, together with mouse, windows and disc operating system (Dos). All of this was state of the art a year ago; now it can be had for a mere Pounds 795 plus VAT. In spite of prices falling for two years, they still have some way to drop. Manufacturers trying desperately to match overheads to declining sales revenue, and dealers struggling with the narrowest of margins, are despondent: 'It is getting worse by the week,' said Mr David Southworth, managing director of P&amp;P, one of the UK's largest distributors. 'The volume is not there.' Customers should benefit from the new low prices, but the equation is more sophisticated than that, makers and dealers insist. Computers may command commodity prices but they are not yet commodity items. Selection and installation of the right software can be complex. Operation is rarely straightforward. Setting up even the simplest network of interlinked computers requires expert skills. The price of PCs conventionally contains an element to help pay for all this technological support. Customers paying the bare minimum for a clone of an IBM system will have none of these benefits and may have to pay through the nose to get the best out of their systems, the argument goes. Confirmed Compaq customer, Mr Glen Sandusky, of Miller, Mason and Dickenson, a US corporate benefits consultancy, agrees: 'Price is not the main issue. We want something that works and we do not want to buy from a company that will not be around in a year or so. 'Price declines are great for corporate customers but everybody cannot compete on these terms and there is going to be a shake-out.' The more sophisticated customers fear that if prices continue to fall, the big manufacturers will be forced to cut spending on research and dev-elopment, so prejudicing the development of the next generation of PCs. But lower prices are promoting significant changes in buying policies. Large organisations with in-house computing departments feel comfortable taking on responsibility for developing and maintaining their systems and are increasingly buying on price alone. Mr Roger Wells, administration manager for the UK engineering group Brown, Root, for example, believes his company is one whose new buying policies have helped persuade IBM and Compaq to take the low-cost route. As prices have fallen, so the company has moved from rental to purchase. 'We now see PCs entirely as commodities,' Mr Wells said. 'We are even thinking of abandoning third-party maintenance. If a machine fails we will repair it with parts cannibalised from another.' A former IBM and Compaq user, the company would be happy to buy clones, he said. Barclays Bank, one of Europe's largest PC buyers, has also changed purchasing policy as prices have fallen. Mr Toby Broome, head of purchasing, says it is no longer prepared to buy at discounted rates only for volume purchases. 'We want the same price whether we are buying one PC or 1,000. And we are not prepared to pay more than in a high-street retailer.' Smaller companies are tempted by a combination of price and support. Ms Pauline Willett, systems manager for Hacker Young, a medium-sized British accountancy firm, says the company, formerly a Compaq user, switched to Elonex last year. It was tempted by price savings of 50 per cent and significantly better service, especially in networking. For tiny companies, computer purchase has become more confusing as buyers must choose between a plethora of machines, all apparently similar in cost and function. Ms Elizabeth Bryant is setting up a seminar business. A computer would make administration easier, but Pounds 3,000, the cost of an adequate system a few years ago, would have been beyond her budget. Prices now start well below the Pounds 1,500 she is prepared to spend. Unimpressed by brand names, her chief concern is to get immediate benefit from her purchase and she understands the need for support from her supplier. Mr Martin Nielsen, managing director of The Business Superstore, the UK's latest low-cost business equipment marketing venture, believes Ms Bryant represents a substantial, unsatisfied demand for PCs among small businesses and serious home users. He argues that lower prices broaden the market and make buying decisions easier. He also believes that if all else is equal, established brand names count - at least in Europe. His sales approach is modular; customers can buy a bare machine, adding on maintenance and other services at a price, so combining the benefits of low-cost hardware with customer support. Yet he may be overestimating the market power of established brand names. One customer this week, looking at the array of computer power on offer at Mr Nielsen's north-west London store, agreed price falls had accelerated his decision to buy his own machine: 'It will be a clone, though. A Dell or something like that.'  ---------------------------------------------- R &amp; D SPENDING        1991      As percent of                    (Dollars m)    revenue  ---------------------------------------------- Compaq Computer     197.3          6.0 Dell Computer        33.1          3.7 AST Research         26.6          3.9  ---------------------------------------------- Source: Annual reports  ----------------------------------------------</p>

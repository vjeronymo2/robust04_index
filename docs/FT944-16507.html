			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Chancellor urged not to cut taxes in Budget Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will be able to cut public spending plans for the coming 1995-96 financial year by Pounds 5bn without having to make real inroads into the government's spending programme, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies reported yesterday. In its 'Green Budget', prepared with Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, the independent tax policy research group says the chancellor should stay firm and not cut taxes in next month's Budget. The study says the public sector borrowing requirement looked set to undershoot previous forecasts. For this financial year to the end of March 1995, the institute and Goldman Sachs expect a PSBR of Pounds 32bn compared with the Pounds 36bn predicted in the Treasury's summer forecast. They expect a 1995-96 deficit of Pounds 24bn, although it could be as low as Pounds 21bn, or 3 per cent of gross domestic product, if the government maintains its existing spending plans in real terms in the run-up to the next general election. The report says lower-than-expected inflation means the chancellor can keep to his previous plans for real, inflation-adjusted public spending while announcing a nominal Pounds 5bn cut in spending for next year. Without such a reduction in the existing Pounds 263bn public expenditure control total, policy would be loosened next year and taxes might have to rise in the medium term. The authors say improved public finances should not be used as an excuse to cut taxes because the drop in the PSBR will be entirely the result of higher than anticipated economic growth. 'The tax increases announced last year remain essential to bring the public finances under control,' they add. The Green Budget, so-called because it is modelled on a government consultative document, or green paper, suggests that Mr Clarke will choose neither to tighten nor ease fiscal policy next month. With the next general election up to two and a half years away, dramatic initiatives are not expected. But the chancellor could still decide to change individual tax and spending programmes within the existing framework. Mr Andrew Dilnot, institute director, suggested that the chancellor may act to reform family credit and the in-work benefit system to create more incentives for the low-paid to seek work. An eye-catching but cheap move would be to boost tax allowances for small companies. With inflation low, Mr Clarke might be tempted to freeze income tax allowances, saving some Pounds 750m, and use the proceeds to widen the 20 per cent reduced rate income tax band to Pounds 4,000 from Pounds 3,000. Mr Dilnot said Mr Clarke might also seek to tidy up the tax treatment of savings. But the authors do not anticipate any radical change in the tax treatment of dividends. The authors expect further increases in interest rates. Mr David Walton, Goldman's senior international economist, yesterday forecast UK bank base rates of 7 per cent by mid-1995 compared with 5.75 per cent at present. Options for 1995: the Green Budget.

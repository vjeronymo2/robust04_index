			<p>BFN     [Text] Hizballah representatives in the Lebanese Chamber of  Deputies today accused U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley of  interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs and insulting the  sentiments of the Lebanese people. The deputies issued a  statement pointing to the American ambassador's illogical  movements and his threats to political trends in Lebanon. The  statement says the American ambassador's moves violate  diplomatic norms and aim to stand against the Lebanese Islamic  and popular resistance against the Zionist occupier. The  statement also stresses that recent military movements by the  Zionist entity in south Lebanon are aimed at clearing that  region of its inhabitants.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Business and the Law: Court rejects tractor appeals - European Court The Court of First Instance has dismissed the appeals of three tractor manufacturers against a 1992 European Commission decision condemning the UK Agricultural Tractor Registration Exchange agreement. The Commission said exchange of information on tractor registrations infringed Treaty of Rome competition rules, because it resulted in an exchange of information identifying sales of individual competitors, dealer sales and imports. The agreement concerned an information system based on UK Department of Transport tractor registration data. In the UK, all vehicles must be registered for use on public roads. Systematics International (SIL), a data processing company responsible for processing and handling registration application forms for the department, was permitted to send certain information to the parties to the agreement. The Commission said the information sent to members of the agreement could be divided into three categories: Aggregate industry information, including aggregate industry sales broken down by year, quarter, month or week; Information on each member's sales, including number of units sold by each manufacturer and market share for various geographical areas; and Information concerning sales made by dealers in each member's distribution network, in particular imports and exports in their respective territories. Until September 1988, parties to the agreement received part of the registration application forms filed by independent importers from SIL. Thereafter, the Commission said they continued to receive sufficient information to enable parallel imports from other member countries to be identified, mainly through the use of tractor serial numbers. Dealer territories could be identified because the registration procedure required customer postcodes to be given and the manufacturers defined territories by postcode. The eight agreement companies had about 87-88 per cent of the UK tractor market, the Commission said. It refused exemption from the competition rules largely because the information exchange system did not benefit consumers but exclusively suppliers. The Commission claimed it had never accepted either that exchanges of recent and detailed information were indispensable to achieve the commercial objectives of the members of the agreement or that such exchanges offer advantages, in particular for third parties, which would compensate for their restrictive effects on competition. The CFI rejected the tractor manufacturers' arguments that the agreement did not restrict competition or affect trade between member countries and, if it did, it should have been exempted. The Court said the provision of the information to all suppliers joining the system presupposed an agreement, or a tacit agreement, between the parties to define the boundaries of dealer sales territories by reference to the UK postcode system, as well as an institutional framework enabling information to be exchanged between the parties through their trade association (Agricultural Engineers Association). The Court said the frequency and systematic nature of the information also enabled a trader to forecast more precisely the conduct of its competitors. The Commission's decision was the first time it had prohibited an information exchange system concerning a single-product market in the absence of directly related anti-competitive conduct, such as price fixing. However, the CFI confirmed the Commission had applied the same criteria it always applied. The CFI agreed with the Commission that in a narrow oligopolistic market, where four companies had a dominant market share, the exchange of confidential information restricted the hidden competition which would otherwise exist in such a market and formed a barrier to new market entrants.

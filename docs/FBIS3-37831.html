Ames, 52, a CIA employee for more than 31 years, and his  wife, Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, 41, a Colombian-born  naturalised U.S. citizen, were arrested on Monday during an  operation carried out jointly by CIA and FBI agents.    According to the Department of Justice, the Ames couple have  been spying against the U.S. since 1985 and received more than  1.5 million U.S. dollars in payoff money and deposited the money  on accounts in U.S. and foreign banks.    "It is a very serious case," President Bill Clinton told  journalists in the White House on Tuesday. When asked whether  the cold war is over or not, Mr Clinton declined comment,  pointing out that the matter would be tackled in the coming days.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers said at a briefing on  the same day that an Ames case probe had been launched ten  months before and that the president had been kept informed of  it from the very outset.    Ms Myers said the president instructed the Department of  State to lodge an official protest with the government of  Russia. Secretary of State Warren Christopher summoned charge  d'affaires ad interim of Russia while U.S. Ambassador in Russia  Thomas Pickering had a meeting with senior Russian officials.    The White House press secretary said National Security  Adviser Anthony Lake and CIA Director James Woolsey had been  ordered to lead a "coordinated examination of the national  security implications of this case".    "We take this very seriously. We do not like it one bit,"  Myers told reporters.    "We are having very serious, very forthright discussions  with  the Russians, both in Washington and Moscow, about this  incident... I think in terms of future relationship, we are  having those conversations now and we shall just let those take  place and see what goes", Ms Myers said.</p>

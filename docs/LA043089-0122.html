			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOKED FOR TRAVEL  </P> <P> "Mona Winks," by Rick Steves and Gene Openshaw, surveys art in 20 of Europe's  top museums. It explains how to avoid miles of twisting hallways and boring  exhibits, and details a collection of self-guided tours in text, room maps and  where-to-start diagrams. Descriptions and reproductions of the treasures won't  turn you into an art historian but should enhance your knowledge.  </P> <P> The guide will serve as a quick introduction to the art, including supplemental  information on the artists and their styles. The humor and opinions in the text  will leave you enlightened but not overwhelmed. Museums and cultural areas in  London, Paris, Amsterdam, Munich, Rome and Madrid are described. Other details  include hours, admission costs, services and food (John Muir: $14.95).  </P> <P>  -- -- --  </P> <P> The "Travel Survival Kit" guides offer information to many destinations. Most  recent editions are "Colombia" by Krzystof Dydynski ($11.95), "Bolivia" by  Deanna Swaney ($10.95), "Papua" by Tony Wheeler ($11.95), "Solomon Islands" by  David Harcombe ($9.95) and "West Africa" by Alex Newton ($12.95).  </P> <P> The guides offer a concise text with a mixture of color photos and maps. The  introduction and facts chapters preface the vignettes for cities or towns while  introducing the history, culture and people of the area.  </P> <P> The where-to-stay, eating and getting-around information is good for starters,  especially in some countries where dramatic contrast and surprise often prevail  (Lonely Planet).  </P></p>

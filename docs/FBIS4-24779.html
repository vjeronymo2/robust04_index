			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 1 (XINHUA) -- It has been a lively  day for the World Park in southern Beijing as Jiang Zemin,  general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), toured  the park amidst the festive trappings of the International  Children's Day.    Boasting miniatures of over 100 scences from 40 countries,  the park has already been visited by nearly three million  tourists since it opened to the public last October.    Accompanied by Chen Xitong, secretary of CPC's Beijing  municipal committee, and Mayor Li Qiyan as well as other central  and local government officials, Jiang said, "it's a great park  as it can help enrich people's knowledge of the world, its  geography and history."    Some Chinese and foreign tourists pressed forward to greet  the Chinese president. A small boy of six or seven years old  squeezed through the crowd to greet "Grandpa Jiang." His mother  said the boy came to Beijing "with a wish to see party and state  leaders, and this is really a pleasant surprise."    Jiang greeted a 76-year-old Canadian tourist, saying "wish  you good health and a long life." The tourist's grandson  invited Jiang to visit his Canadian home someday.</p>

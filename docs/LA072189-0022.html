			<p><P> July 21, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ORCHESTRA LURCHES WITH UNLICENSED DRIVER AT WHEEL  </P> <P> Just when it appeared the San Diego Symphony SummerPops had its act together,  it regressed into its bad old habits. The opening four weeks of the current  season have kept the orchestra center stage, performing generally well-chosen  and tightly organized programs. But Wednesday night's haphazard tribute to the  Broadway musical stage gave the orchestra too little to do -- at times the  players just sat on stage staring into space -- and over-indulged the meager  keyboard talent of guest conductor Bob Lappin.  </P> <P> In truth, to honor Lappin with the title "conductor" is to insult every real  conductor, from the late Herbert von Karajan down to the local high school  bandmaster. Lappin's program biography describes him as a former nightclub band  leader who (wisely) went into the soft-drink distributing business in  Connecticut.  </P> <P> On the podium, Lappin was more of a follower than a leader, and his conducting  motions looked like a comedian's frenetic imitation of a music director. And  what did that set of Lionel Richie tunes have to do with the program's Broadway  theme?  </P> <P> Lappin bounded out onto the Hospitality Point stage in an electric yellow  dinner jacket, looking like a refugee nightclub entertainer. His piano playing  was loud and heavy-handed, full of predictable, gratuitous flourishes: that  generic cocktail lounge style over which patrons rightly converse and cement  business deals. Fortunately, he was less inclined to push his singing, which  ranked several notches below his piano playing.  </P> <P> The orchestra coped as best as it could. In the opening Gershwin medley, it  sounded fresh and buoyant. Second trumpet John Wilds turned a delicious solo in  "The Man I Love," and the percussion section made "I Got Rhythm" sparkle.  </P> <P> During a lengthy Irving Berlin medley, the orchestra marked time while Lappin  accompanied guest vocalists Jan Horvath and David Chaney. Although Chaney's  pleasantly relaxed baritone proved adequate, soprano Horvath foolishly  attempted to make singing flat some sort of stylish trademark.  </P> <P> The two soloists fared better in the lavishly orchestrated "Salute to Andrew  Lloyd Webber" that made up the program's second half.  </P> <P> At times, Horvath was able to compensate for her singing under pitch by  shouting into the microphone, a less than satisfactory solution to the problem,  but she did nothing to dislodge Patti LuPone's "Evita" songs from their icon  status. Chaney pulled out his best stentorian notes for a grandiloquent  "Memory," although he ducked the highest notes in the final upward modulation.  His notion of tempo was either slow or slower, and with an unlicensed driver at  the wheel of the orchestra, singer and accompaniment were seldom together.  </P> <P> The show repeats tonight and Saturday at 7:30.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] POSCO Huls has realized mass-production of 8-inch  silicon wafers, a core material for M-DRAM (mega dynamic random  access memory) chips, which have been entirely imported.  Established as a high tech silicon wafer maker in December,  1990, the company is a three-party joint venture among Pohang  Iron &amp; Steel Co. (POSCO), Samsung Electronics and MEMC of the  United States.    Its plant, set up at a cost of $200 million and located in  Chonan, Chungchongnam-to, has been turning out 6-inch and 8-inch  silicon wafers since last March.    On Dec. 27, POSCO Huls, headed by Sin In-po, won quality  recognition for its products, especially its 8-inch silicon  wafers, from Samsung Electronics, the world's largest memory  chip maker. As the recognition was tantamount to that by the  world's semiconductor markets, POSCO Huls began to mass-produce  8-inch silicon wafers from the onset of this year, according to  a company spokesman.    Operating the plant 24 hours a day, the company is supplying  its products to domestic and foreign chip makers.    Thanks to POSCO Huls' achievements, Korea has become the  fourth country in the world to be able to manufacture 8-inch  silicon wafers following the United States, Japan and Germany.    The spokesman said that 8-inch silicon wafers enables their  customers to sharply increase the added value of their products,  while minimizing the defect ratio of their goods.    At present, POSCO Huls can roll off 40,000 8-inch silicon  wafers per month but plans to increase the volume to 100,000  from next year following the expansion of the plant.    Monthly local demand for 8-inch silicon wafers now amounts  to  15,000-20,000, most of which are used by Samsung Electronics.    Domestic demand will increase to 40,000 by the end of the  first half of this year and to 100,000-110,000 early next year,  the spokesman predicted. The spokesman said that the  manufacture of 8-inch silicon wafers by POSCO Huls will  translate into an import substitution of $100 million at least  for this year.    Of the three joint partners, POSCO and MEMC specializing in  semiconductor materials hold a 43.6 percent share of POSCO Huls  each and Samsung Electronics the remaining 12.8 percent stake.</p>

			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR  </P> <P> The Blue Beet Cafe, 107 21st St., Newport Beach. Open daily, 11:30 to 2 a.m.  (714) 675-2338. Tucked into an alley between storefronts facing the Newport  Pier, this bar isn't the easiest to find. But its friendly, good cheer makes it  worth the search. Patrons are mainly young and single, and there's usually a  guy in the back room playing the guitar.  </P> <P> Dillman's, 801 E. Balboa Blvd., Newport Beach. Open daily 9 a.m. to 2 a.m.  (714) 673-7726. A noble place, resolutely unfashionable, Dillman's satisfies  the most important requirements of the serious bar-goer: Keep it dark, keep it  quiet and keep 'em coming.  </P> <P> The Harp Inn, 130 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-8855. A bar without pretense  for people who'd rather get poked in the eye than take a drink in some place  like Irvine. They have OK Irish music here on the weekends; occasionally an  exuberant patron takes the stage about closing time to work out on a Celtic  folk song or two. Plus which, they put out a happy hour spread of Ritz crackers  and tuna fish.  </P> <P> Newport Landing, 503 E. Edgewater Ave., Newport Beach. Open daily till 2 a.m.,  Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m., Saturdays from 8 a.m., Sundays from 9  a.m. (714) 675-2373. It's on the glitzy side, it tends to be crowded, the  waitresses are a trifle slow and the drinks ain't cheap. But there's a great  view of the harbor and the ferries that makes it all worthwhile. A fine place  to park yourself on a Sunday afternoon. The Village Inn, 127 Marine Ave.,  Balboa Island. Open Monday through Friday from 6:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturday  and Sunday from 7 a.m. (714) 675-8300. People here tend to be a little older  than the kids you find thronging many beachside bars. The atmosphere's  informal, friendly and real. And the fireplace and couches in the corner make  it just perfect for winter nights. Live music nightly.MIKE FLAGG  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK;  </P> <P> ROAD TO BE WIDENED FROM 2 TO 6 LANES  </P> <P> Commuters who sit in traffic every day on Villa Park Road soon may find the  trip is easier. Villa Park officials plan to award a contract in November for a  $1.2-million widening of the road into four and eventually six lanes, City  Engineer Jeanette Peck said.  </P> <P> Construction is expected to begin in January.  </P> <P> The project will also include a median and permanent lights to replace blinking  red lights where Villa Park intersects Center Drive and Lemon Street.  </P> <P> An environmental report said noise on the road will increase only slightly, but  traffic will be 12 feet closer to homes lining the route. Parking along the  road will be eliminated when it becomes six lanes.  </P> <P> Villa Park will receive about $50,000 from the state and $1 million in federal  funds for the project.  </P></p>

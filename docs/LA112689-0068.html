			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A CODE OF ETHICS FOR L.A.: CAN IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE?  </P> <P> The proposals for a Los Angeles city ethics code presented last week are being  called the toughest in the nation. The commission that drafted the  recommendations also calls them the "fairest, clearest and most effective  code," but that is a matter of perception. There is going to be plenty of  discussion in the coming weeks and months as to whose perception is correct and  what impact such a code would actually have in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> As director of the staff that drafted the recommendations, let me state that  what makes this code tough is not its parts; none are more stringent than  anything else in U.S. government. But it is more comprehensive: Every  recommendation is based on procedures in the private sector or the current  practice in some city, state or federal branch of government; or it is proposed  law. Nothing came out of whole cloth. Nothing was drawn from our imaginations  -- creative as they might be.  </P> <P> Putting aside the question of how tough is tough, perhaps there is a more  appropriate question: What difference will this code make in the way business  is conducted in Los Angeles?  </P> <P> The 30 recommendations include creation of a city ethics commission; specific  and detailed requirements about financial disclosure; prohibitions on earning  outside income and on investments that could cause a conflict of interest,  lobbying for those who leave city government, and campaign finance. The  commission called for oversight of ethics regulation, the power to investigate  and prosecute violations and an extensive training program to educate everyone  involved.  </P> <P> So what will change? We start with the assumption that most of the people who  work for the City of Los Angeles are honest, dedicated public servants. Those  in elected and top policy-making positions will be required to be more complete  when they fill out disclosure forms, but we believe the new forms will be  easier to fill in because respondents will know what is required of them  (partly because they have been trained and partly because the questions will be  so specific.) "Eliminate the gray" has become our motto in the past several  months.  </P> <P> For the small group of individuals who move back and forth between the private  and the public sector, there will be guidelines: They will not be able to leave  city government one day and become lobbyists trying to influence the decisions  of those they left behind the next. They will be "permanently barred" from  being involved in "particular matters" in which they had a personal and  substantial involvement while in office; that condition could last a few weeks  or even a few years. A staff aide who worked on developing regulations for a  specific development could not become a lobbyist for someone bidding on it. A  staff member will be barred for one year from lobbying the department the  staffer left, but will be able to use knowledge of city government to lobby  others. Elected officials and those decision-makers who have citywide  responsibilities would be banned from lobbying anyone in the city for a year.  </P> <P> These prohibitions will make it more difficult for individuals to leave City  Hall and immediately build a career on inside knowledge. On the other side of  the issue, these regulations will assure everyone else in the city that Los  Angeles is not run by insiders bent on protecting their own. For the many  individuals we met who pride themselves on integrity and honesty, these  prohibitions will be an enhancement; no one will be able to taint their success  because of whom they knew or what strings they could pull.  </P> <P> The biggest change is likely to come in two areas: enforcement and campaign  finance. The proposed city ethics commission is modeled after the state's Fair  Political Practices Commission. It puts teeth in the entire package.  </P> <P> Campaign finance reform will require a change in the way business is conducted  at City Hall. One proposal calls for a ban on fund-raising until nine months  before election for that office. A similar plan, Proposition 68, was approved  by California voters in June, 1988. Most incumbents raise most of their money  in the years between elections.  </P> <P> Our proposals would also eliminate most non-campaign fund-raising committees.  Such "friends of" committees are currently able to circumvent the intent of  recent city campaign finance laws, because contributions to them are not  limited to $500.  </P> <P> Partial public financing -- which provides a floor -- also makes it possible to  impose a ceiling, in the form of expenditure limitations. Incumbents will have  no need to spend their days and nights raising money, once they reach the  spending limit. Challengers will have a chance to catch up in the spending and  make their case to voters.  </P> <P> Will this make a difference to Los Angeles? Yes. It will not mean the wholesale  dumping of elected city officials, because many incumbents have the opportunity  and the desire to maintain close relationships with their constituents. But it  will make a difference to those officials who forget the people who put them  there.  </P> <P> Will it make a difference in the ethical measure of the city? We think it will.  The proposals for campaign finance -- and, in fact, in the entire ethics  package -- seek to draw sharp lines between what is acceptable and what is not,  to establish a process for addressing conflicts of interests and to keep a  tight a watch on the flow of money.  </P> <P> When I came here six months ago, a long-time friend said, "Make sure you don't  get taken over by those good-government weenies." He was afraid that if our  recommendations were too tough, no one would want to serve. But is that the  reason anyone questions a public career? Would you want your son or daughter to  go to work for the city?  </P> <P> If you have any reservations at all, it is not really because the city does not  pay well (although we think there should be salary increases). It is not  because they will have to disclose the cost of their house and the mortgage  rate they pay on it. It is because you think it is a sleazy place to be.  </P> <P> An ethical code requires a broad sweep -- unlike law, which must be narrow. The  problem, of course, is that ethical behavior, unlike legal behavior, is not  measured in narrow terms. It is reflected in a standard that is cumulative and  general. One has a sense of integrity, or one does not.  </P> <P> We think a tough code -- and only a tough code -- will make all the people who  do public work -- or have public business -- look on city government as a place  of honor.  </P></p>

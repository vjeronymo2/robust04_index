			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RASPY, FEVERISH, WILL CLARK SKIPS BATTING PRACTICE  </P> <P> Giants slugger Will Clark, raspy-voiced and feverish with tonsillitis, missed  practice today as his team used an off-day to work out and try to regroup for  Game 3 of the World Series.  </P> <P> Clark, who remained in the clubhouse dressed in street clothes while his  teammates took batting practice, said he definitely will play in Game 3 Tuesday  at Candlestick Park.  </P> <P> Asked if he might miss the game, Clark replied there were only two things that  would keep him out: "I've either gotta be in the hospital or be dead."  </P> <P> Clark, who went 0-for-4 in Sunday's 5-1 loss that gave Oakland a 2-0 lead in  the Series, said he has been feeling bad for a couple of days.  </P> <P> "It's a little of everything," he said of the illness. "It started out as  tonsillitis, and it's gotten worse."  </P> <P> Clark, a hero of the Giants' National League playoff victory over the Chicago  Cubs, had a double and single in the opening game, a 5-0 loss to the A's.  </P></p>

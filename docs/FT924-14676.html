			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Survey on Denmark (6): Worldwide help for water authorities  -Flood Control Research 'AEROSPACE technology is spectacular, but water is important,' says Professor Michael Abbott, who has been closely associated with the Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHT) for almost 30 years. During this time he has helped it become one of the foremost hydraulics research institutes in the world. DHT is an autonomous self-supporting research body, associated with the Danish Academy of Technical Sciences. Since its foundation in 1964 it has been headed by Mr Torben Sorensen. It is today carrying out the world's three biggest aquatic environment research programmes: the mathematical model of the Venice Lagoon (Mr Sorensen leads an international committee designing a system to protect Venice from the sea); the Danish Great Belt Bridge environmental monitoring system; and work for the Bangladesh river system and flood control management project. Danish pre-eminence in water science owes much to Professor Abbott, British-born professor at the International Institute for Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering at Delft, the Netherlands, and adviser to the Danish institute. He has been responsible for developing the computer modelling systems and programmes used by the institute and by water authorities throughout the world. Until recently, hydraulic modelling was carried out with the aid of hand-built miniature models such as a planned port area, which would be subjected to wave pressure and storms in the laboratory. Physical models have now been largely replaced by mathematical models, reducing a typical cost from DKr5m for a physical model to DKr500,000 for a computer model. For large and complex environments, such as the Bangladesh river system, there is no alternative to mathematical models. In his work, Professor Abbott has turned what began as 'computational hydraulics' into a new science of hydroinformatics, the word he used as the title of a book which he published last year. He uses it as broad term covering the method by which various disciplines within water resource engineering can use computer data more efficiently. 'We build systems in which a large variety of people, without knowing each other, input knowledge, and enable a large number of people, also unknown to each other, to access that knowledge and make use of it,' he explained. For example, a computer model of an urban sewage management system enables staff to know exactly what is happening anywhere in the system and the effect of opening or closing a particular sluice or weir. The DHI has a total staff of 160, of whom half have PhDs or MSc degrees. It has 18 subsidiaries or agencies around the world, a turnover of about DKr100m, and it has always made a small profit, said Mr Sorensen. The work of the Danish institutes is attracting a lot of attention from big companies, which after the end of the cold war are redeploying scientists into new fields, including environmental control. By far the biggest of the DHI's projects is the water control system for Bangladesh, part of a programme initiated after the devastating floods in 1986. Altogether 26 projects are being carried out with the World Bank as main co-ordinator and many countries contributing aid and expertise. The DHI initially provided a system to establish computer-based models which can simulate the pattern of floods arising from the three great rivers, the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna, which flow through Bangladesh. The first programme was supplemented by setting up a permanent Surface Water Modelling Centre in Bangladesh, which collects extensive data on such items as rainfall and water levels. The information gathered is used for flood management, flood forecasting and to provide the basis for the lay-out and design for engineering works.</p>

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / UK Company News: Speyhawk Pounds 90m in red after write-downs SPEYHAWK, the technically insolvent property developer which has been in talks with its banks since August 1991, yesterday announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 89.8m for the year to September 30 1992. The deficit, which followed a Pounds 216.8m loss in the previous year, mainly resulted from further write-downs of Pounds 67.3m against investment and development properties. 'There has been little improvement in market conditions. Property values have continued to fall, particularly in the City of London,' said Mr Trevor Osborne, chairman. Mr Osborne said he expected the refinancing of the group's Pounds 360m of debt to be completed in a couple of months. Speyhawk 'has entered into a financial documentation phase of its debt restructuring which it is hoped will be concluded soon,' he said. Speyhawk's liabilities now exceed its assets by about Pounds 160m. The group's 46 banks, led by Barclays and Citibank, reached agreement in principle on Christmas Eve for the restructuring, which involves the subordination of debt. Nearly half of the provisions were related to Speyhawk's City projects, notably its scheme at Cannon Bridge. Last year, more than half the company's provisions of Pounds 204.9m resulted from Cannon Bridge and Exchequer Court, another City building. Interest charges increased from Pounds 16.3m to Pounds 22.7m, partly as a result of provisions for interest charges on project loans. Speyhawk said the basis of the business plan that underpinned the debt restructuring proposals was 'to achieve lettings and sales of completed developments and investment properties in a phased and orderly manner.' Turnover fell from Pounds 76.4m to Pounds 69.7m. Losses per share were 352.1p (829.7p). No dividend will be paid or should be expected 'for the foreseeable future.' The company's shares closed 4p down at 8p.</p>

(``Amex''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the Company, in addition to being listed on the Amex, its Shares of Beneficial Interest are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE''). The Company's Shares of Beneficial Interest commenced trading on the NYSE at the opening of business on May 3, 1994, and concurrently therewith such securities were suspended from trading on the Amex. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In making the decision to withdraw its Share of Beneficial Interest from listing on the Amex, the Company considered the direct and indirect costs and expenses attendant on maintaining the dual listing of its Shares of Beneficial Interest on the NYSE and on the Amex. The Company does not see any particular advantage in the dual trading of its Shares of Beneficial Interest and believes that dual listing would fragment the market for its Shares of Beneficial Interest. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any interested person may, on or before July 1, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

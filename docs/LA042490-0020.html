			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEALING WITH GRAFFITI  </P> <P> I am sorry that these children feel compelled to leave their mark on the world  by destroying property that belongs to others, but truthfully, I neither asked  for nor wanted their "autographs."  </P> <P> Perhaps, as the article notes, attempts to stem the tide of graffiti are  inadequate.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is time to increase the fines attached to the crime to an amount  that will cover the court and repainting costs. Or the violation should become  a felony. Others have suggested adding a tax to marking pens and spray paint to  be used for painting over the graffiti. Finally, the workers usually working  off court-ordered community service could repaint the defaced freeway walls.  </P> <P> All of these suggestions simply treat the symptoms and are Band-Aid measures at  best, but in lieu of measures to treat the problem and in view of the immediate  need for action, they seem reasonable.  </P> <P> JENNIE PEISOH  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

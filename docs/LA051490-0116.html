			<p><P> May 14, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> COMEDIAN DICE ADDS SPICE TO 'SNL' RATINGS  </P> <P> Raunchy comedian Andrew Dice Clay's controversial appearance on "Saturday Night  Live" drew substantially higher ratings to go with the hecklers and protests it  generated, NBC said.  </P> <P> Dice's presence on Saturday's late-night broadcast had sparked protests from  homosexual and women's groups and led cast member Nora Dunn and singer Sinead  O'Connor to refuse to appear.  </P> <P> Preliminary ratings figures gave the show a market share of 31%, 6 percentage  points higher than SNL's usual 25 share, said Rosemary Keenan, an NBC  spokeswoman.  </P> <P> NBC logged 234 negative phone calls during the broadcast, with only 13 calls  supporting the appearance by the acid-tongued comic, known for his derogatory  and graphic put-downs of women and minorities and explicit descriptions of  violent sexual encounters.  </P></p>

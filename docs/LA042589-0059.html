			<p><P> April 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : SIMPLY RED CONCERT CAN'T DO HUCKNALL VOICE JUSTICE  </P> <P> Simply Red's Mick Hucknall was buried Sunday night.  </P> <P> The English singer has a fairly delicate, soulful tenor that's elegantly  showcased on the band's albums, particularly on songs like the Harold Melvin  oldie "If You Don't Know Me by Now" and Simply Red's biggest hit, the ballad  "Holding Back the Years."  </P> <P> But if you went to the Roxy to savor the subtleties of Hucknall's voice, you  were out of luck. The six instrumentalists of the English white-soul band,  concluding a sold-out, four-night run, simply overwhelmed lead singer Hucknall.  The musicians were so intent on showing off their slick, James Brown-influenced  soul-revue style that Hucknall's vocals often were lost in their clamorous  funk. In concert, Hucknall needs softer, less flashy accompaniment. He had to  push his voice beyond its limits Sunday, forcing himself to shriek -- which he  doesn't do well. DENNIS HUNT  </P></p>

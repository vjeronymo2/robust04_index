We must get back to the  negotiations table as soon as possible: because I am convinced  that this time we will succeed in resolving all the issues that  still remain open." Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin  is certain of this. The hopes of peace in the Middle East have  not faded.    [De Giovannangeli] In your opinion do the margins for a  resumption in negotiations between Israel and the PLO exist for  the immediate future as well as for an acceleration in the  withdrawal of the Israeli Army from Gaza and Jericho?    [Beilin] In the last sessions of negotiations with the PLO  we  dealt with practically all the fundamental issues relating to  the implementation of the declaration of principles signed in  Washington. We were on the point of closing this phase of  talks. Then the Hebron massacre took place. Nevertheless, I am  convinced that if we return to negotiate quickly, which I think  is possible, we will succeed in speeding up the implementation  of autonomy in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.    [De Giovannangeli] At what point are diplomatic discussions  on the possible deployment of international observers or a  multinational military contingent in the occupied territories?    [Beilin] The problem has already been raised in Oslo and an  accord with the PLO has been reached on an international  presence in Gaza and Jericho during the transitory phase of  autonomy. The Palestinians should understand the novelty and  the importance of this "yes" by Israel, a fact that is without  precedent in our history.    [De Giovannangeli] A civilian presence or even a military  presence?    [Beilin] Civilian, only civilian.    [De Giovannangeli] The position of Syria is crucial in  achieving overall peace in the Middle East. Can you tell us if  something is moving in negotiations with Damascus, even if  officially interrupted.    [Beilin] There is no doubt that Syria today still maintains  a  central role in the Middle East scenario: Peace with President  al-Asad would mean really turning over a new leaf in this  tormented region. But peace as defined by Syria is still a  limited "armored" peace that is dictated more by necessity than  by conviction.    [De Giovannangeli] Instead what kind of peace does Israel  propose?    [Beilin] Total peace, without any restrictions on the  economic, political, and diplomatic relations front. If Syria  is willing to talk about peace in these terms, on our side we  could easily open discussions on the schedule and the extent of  our withdrawal from the Golan Heights.    [De Giovannangeli] In these days, the usual proclamations of  war seem to be accompanied by some signs of flexibility from the  Palestinian refusal front, and even from the Hamas integralists.  Do you think that these signs are credible?    [Beilin] Absolutely not. Hamas has gained consensus not  because of the strength of his ideas but because of the poverty  and the profound hardship that marks the life of Palestinians  today, particularly in the Gaza Strip. For this I consider it  crucial to accelerate the process of autonomy. I am convinced  that when the economy of the territories becomes buoyant and  when the Palestinian police force is formed, many will pass over  to the side of the PLO. I believe that the effort of 'Arafat,  also in view of the elections in Gaza and Jericho, will be to  form a coalition among the moderate elements. At least this is  what I hope.    [De Giovannangeli] Are you optimistic, pessimistic, or  "uncertain" over the likelihood of a resumption in peace  negotiations?    [Beilin] Despite everything, I am confident about the future  of the negotiations. For a very simple reason: because I do  not see any other path to follow. There is no alternative to  dialogue. The choice of peaceful cohabitation, which lies at  the basis of the Washington accords and which unites the  majority of the Israelis and Palestinians remains irreversible,  and no terrorist act can place this under discussion again.    [De Giovannangeli] The Jewish settlements in the  territories,  which the Palestinians are asking to be dismantled even in light  of the Hebron massacre, are an obstacle on the road to peace  today.    [Beilin] The Oslo accords postponed discussions on the  settlements to the final phase of negotiations. And for us this  still remains valid. It does not mean, however, that we will  not act to stop the colonization and above all to suppress the  terrorist acts of extremist groups.    [De Giovannangeli] But disarming the colonists and  dismantling, even if this is gradual, the settlements are  requests that have also been advanced by the Meretz ministers,  to whom Rabin seems to want to respond by opening to the Tsomet  of the right.    [Beilin] Personally, I hope that the Tsomet will not enter  the government. However, even if this were to happen, the peace  process will not be interrupted and neither will the decision to  negotiate with the PLO under the terms sanctioned by the accord  on Gaza and Jericho be questioned again.</p>

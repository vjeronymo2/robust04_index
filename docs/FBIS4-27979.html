			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 7 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa said Tuesday [7 Jun] he will make diplomatic efforts in  Seoul and Beijing to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue  peacefully.    Kakizawa, who plans to leave for South Korea and China on  Saturday to consult with his counterparts on the issue, said at  a news conference, "it is Japan's policy to solve the issue  peacefully and I will speak so that North Korea accepts  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and  returns completely to the agency."    The foreign minister said he will ask China to try to  persuade North Korea to accept inspections and he will also urge  Beijing to cooperate with the joint action of the international  community.    Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata vowed Monday night that Japan  would make every effort within the limits of its constitution to  cooperate in the event the UN Security Council imposes sanctions  on North Korea over its alleged nuclear arms development program.    Hata made the remarks at an emergency meeting which was  convened following weekend consultations among Japan, the United  States and South Korea in Washington to discuss the North Korean  nuclear issue.    In a joint statement issued after the talks, the three  nations called on the United Nations to take prompt action  against Pyongyang, including the consideration of sanctions.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Arafat confident of Israel-Jordan accord Mr Yassir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, said yesterday Jordan and Israel would sign a 'friendly agreement' within the next few days, Our Foreign Staff writes. Mr Arafat, on a visit to Brussels, told a news conference: 'Jordan is going to sign, within a few days, a friendly agreement with Israel.' He gave no further details. Jordan's prime minister Abdul Salam al-Majali said in Amman, however: 'We already have our agenda with Israel and a full agreement is a long way off.' Jordan has consistently denied secret meetings with Israeli officials since it signed its peace agenda with the Jewish state on 14 September in Washington.</p>

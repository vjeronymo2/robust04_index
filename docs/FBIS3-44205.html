The decision was reached during a one-day meeting attended by  presidents Sir Ketumile Masire, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, F.W.  de Klerk of South Africa, ANC leader Nelson Mandela, and  Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Selometsi Boholo, at the  president's office today.    Addressing a news conference after the meeting, President  Mugabe, who is the chairman of the Frontline States, said the  task force will meet in South Africa tomorrow to discuss the  modalities of their work. Mr. Mugabe explained that the task  force, consisting of representatives of Governments of Botswana,  South Africa, and Zimbabwe will work out the possibility of a  program of action to be taken by the three countries. He  declined to discuss the composition of the task force but  stressed that it was to assess the situation in Lesotho, which  may mean the task force could visit Lesotho as it will be based  in South Africa.    Lesotho's deputy prime minister, Mr. Boholo, briefed the  three heads of state and Mr. Mandela about the situation in  Lesotho. President Mugabe described the situation in Lesotho as  a disturbance that threatened the democratic process in that  country. President Mugabe said Lesotho's prime minister, Dr.  Ntsu Mokhehle, had asked the secretary general of the  Commonwealth, Chief Emeka Anyaoku, to approach the Frontline  States to assist in resolving the crisis. He said Chief Anyaoku  approached him as the chairman of the Frontline States about the  matter, and he in turn approached President Masire as SADC  [Southern African Development Community] chairman, and the two  invited the two South African leaders.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Smyk: "Even Metal Cannot Withstand It"] </F>   [Text] The team of monetarists pushed us into a  financial and economic crisis and then left. We shall seek to  resolve it, "that was the way Vladimir Zimovetsk, director of  the Volga Tube-Rolling Plant, explained the goal of the field  session of the collegium of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian  Federation Committee on Metallurgy] which gathered executives of  the branch, directors of the largest metallurgy enterprises in  Russia at Staryy Oskol.    Today it is more difficult for tube-rolling production  workers than for others. In five months the sub-branch cut its  production in half. In ferrous metallurgy the decline continues  for almost all types of production, while in the case of the  producers of tungsten concentrate it is particularly significant  amounting to 74.3 percent.    The loss of the domestic market is taking place primarily  due  to the lack of an effective demand. But not only because of  that. The speech by Serafim Afonin, chairman of  Roskommetallurgiya, for instance, contained the following fact:  ZIL [Moscow Automobile I. A. Likhachev Plant] and AZLK [Moscow  Leninist Komsomol Automobile Plant] are in a disastrous  situation, but the metal-cutting tool containing tungsten and  molybdenum, however is acquired by them not from the Moscow Hard  Alloy Combine, but from abroad, and they pay for it with foreign  currency. Production capacities of tube-rolling plants, built on  a latch-key basis by foreign firms, stand idle while Russia  acquires many hundreds of millions of dollars in credit and  purchases pipes abroad for trunk pipelines. The Tyrnyauz  Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine has been idled together with the  Lysvenskiy Metallurgical Plant.    Here is a typical example. Import duties were reduced or  completely eliminated last year on the initiative of  Roskommetallurgiya. These and other preferential terms gave the  branch enterprises 500 billion rubles [R]. It was proposed to  use that for investments. The enterprises, however, invested not  130 billion as planned but a total of only R15 billion. As a  result the building of the Yakovlev Mine for the mining of ore  with a 70 percent iron content and other projects of interest to  all ferrous metallurgy enterprises was disrupted.    Metallurgists understand that if they confine themselves  within the framework of their branch, they will be unable to  resolve their problems. They are in the same group with power  engineers and transportation workers, and it is necessary to  balance the interests of each link. That can be accomplished if  one includes another link: the government.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA recently wrote that German railways suffer  annual losses of seven billion marks. This with distances that  are insignificant compared to those in Russia and the higher  level of equipment. The government covers this loss,  understanding that without such a measure the country would  simply be losing export income. Russia in particular cannot  neglect such a measure if we do not want our railroads and ports  to die out. Already at the present time metallurgical  enterprises are changing the routes for their freight since for  many of them Baltic and Ukrainian ports are more advantageous  than Russian ones.    The collegium stressed that the government must at least  finance investments in power engineering and transportation.  That measure, first of all, would permit a significant lowering  of tariffs without freezing, and secondly, funds necessary to  modernize and lower the cost of these branches would not create  a burden on the entire economy.    A hospital, built for the city by the Staryy Oskol  Electrometallurgical Plant, was opened on the eve of the  collegium session at Staryy Oskol. It is a magnificent building  with modern medical equipment. The city cannot take it over at  the present time which means the combine will have to operate  it. With what funds? The metallurgists believe one of the  solutions to be a lowering of taxes by an amount equivalent to  expenditures on the maintenance of such facilities. At any rate  they do not intend shouldering that burden indefinitely. After  all the metallurgists must include the maintenance of the social  sphere in the cost of all production and these expenditures  equal those on wages.    Executives in metallurgy worked out a number of concrete  measures designed to resolve the economic crisis. They are being  summarized and will be proposed to the government. The decree  adopted at Staryy Oskol begins with the words: "Having studied  the economic state of branch enterprises, the Collegium of the  Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy views it as highly  critical one."</p>

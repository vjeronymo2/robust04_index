			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Watchdog warns on handling of complaints THE PARLIAMENTARY ombudsman has warned government departments and agencies to maintain adequate complaints procedures for the public when contracting out Civil Service work. In his annual report published yesterday, Mr William Reid said complaints against government departments and bodies rose 18 per cent to 945 last year, the highest level since 1980. More than half the 190 complaints investigated were fully justified, he said. Altogether, 93 per cent had been partly or fully justified. Mr Reid said the government's contracting-out programme could have a significant impact on the quality of those services that were of great importance to the public. 'Whatever the merits of any system, those charged with running it are human and will make mistakes,' Mr Reid said. 'There should be an effective way of delivering redress for justified grievances.' Departments and agencies should not pass responsibility for maintaining standards of service to the contractor who is providing them, the ombudsman said. The department of social security remained the biggest source of complaints, providing 30 per cent of cases referred. The next largest workload came from the Inland Revenue (19 pee cent), environment department (7 per cent) and transport department (5 per cent). The Home Office, Scottish Office and department of health recorded significant falls in complaints. The biggest single subject of complaint was the new disability living allowance, introduced in April 1992. More than 80 complaints had been received about extreme delay and the mishandling of claims.

			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Telekom turnover rises 14.3% DEUTSCHE TELEKOM, the German state-owned telecommunications monopoly, recorded a 14.3 per cent rise in turnover to DM54bn (Dollars 33.8bn) for the year to December 31 1992. The rise was mostly due to its increased activities in former east Germany, where turnover rose to DM3.5bn from less than DM1bn the year before. The sales increase was also attributable to a rise in phone calls to foreign countries, the company said. After-tax results fell by DM250m in 1992 to DM6.45bn, mostly due to the cost of servicing the company's DM100bn debt burden. Interest rates on its outstanding loans in 1992 amounted to DM7bn. The company will transfer about DM5bn of its after-tax revenues to the federal government and DM1.5bn to the postal services and the post bank. Deutsche Telekom has committed DM60bn until 1997 to modernising the basic voice services in the east and installing a mobile telephone network. In 1992, investments in the east reached DM11bn, out of a total investment of DM31bn for the whole country. Last year, the company installed 760,000 lines in eastern Germany and modernised 170,000 lines. Deutsche Telekom intends to reach 7.2m clients in the east with basic voice services by 1997, install 5m cable outlets for television and 400,000 lines for fax machines. An additional 70,000 public phones are planned as well as 50,000 lines for data transmission. The company is building its mobile phone network both in the east and the west, where its is competing with Mannesmann, the German engineering and telecoms group. Mr Rolf-Dieter Leister, chairman, called on politicians to push through the privatisation of the company to allow managerial improvement and access to the capital market.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guido Nule Amin, Colombian minister of mines and  energy, reiterated on 1 March that the sale of oil to Cuba is in  good standing. Colombia is studying the best options to sell oil  to Cuba under international and commercial terms.    This statement was made in light of the fact that Cuban  exiles in the United States are discussing the possibility of  boycotting Colombian products, which, according to Nule Amin,  can only hurt small Colombian businessmen in cities in Florida.  Nule Amin added that Colombia views with interest the  possibility of trade with Cuba and sees no reason that Colombia  cannot sell oil directly to Cuba.    A review process of all the terms of the operation is under  way, particularly issues regarding forms of payment. Nule Amin  stressed that Cuba exports such products as sugar, fruit,  tobacco, rum, and nickel. He added that with these exports, Cuba  can guarantee payment for the fuel.</p>

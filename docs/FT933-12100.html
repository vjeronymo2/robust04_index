			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: Kellogg to go ahead with Dollars 200m debt issue KELLOGG, the US cereals group which posted a profits warning earlier this year, has turned in second-quarter earnings in line with its predictions and said it would go ahead with a debt issue of Dollars 200m. The company also increased its stock dividend to 34 cents a share from 32 cents. Net income for the three months ended June fell 14 per cent to Dollars 142.7m, on sales which slid nearly 3 per cent to Dollars 1.54bn. Earnings per share were 9 per cent lower at 62 cents from 68 cents. In May, Kellogg warned that its second-quarter earnings would be hit by unfavourable exchange rates, trade inventory adjustments and unexpectedly slow economic recoveries in its key markets, including Europe, Mexico and Australia. Mr Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's chief executive, said the company still expects to post record results for the full year, 'and we remain committed to delivering low double-digit growth in earnings per share over time'. For the first six months, Kellogg had net income of Dollars 321.9m, or Dollars 1.38, on sales of Dollars 3.06bn compared with profits of Dollars 103.6m, or 43 cents on sales of Dollars 3.1bn a year ago.</p>

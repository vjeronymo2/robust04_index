			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF: U.S. AMATEUR;  </P> <P> MICKELSON, ZERMAN RENEW RIVALRY IN TODAY'S FINAL  </P> <P> Phil Mickelson and Manny Zerman played nearly bogey-free golf to win semifinal  matches Saturday and set up an all-Arizona final in the U.S. Amateur  championships. Mickelson, 20, of Arizona State, and Zerman, 20, of the  University of Arizona, will battle in a 36-hole match for the title today at  Cherry Hills Country Club.  </P> <P> Recording three birdies and just one bogey -- on the opening hole -- Mickelson  defeated David Eger of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., 5 and 3.  </P> <P> Zerman, who was born in South Africa and adopted by a family in San Diego, had  three birdies and no bogeys in eliminating Tom Scherrer of Skaneateles, N.Y., 4  and 2.  </P> <P> Mickelson and Zerman have played countless times before, as teammates in high  school in San Diego their senior years and as members of the same golf club, as  well as in college matches.  </P> <P> The two-time NCAA champion and the qualifying medalist in the championship,  Mickelson remains the favorite. The long-hitting left-hander consistently  reached the par-five holes in two shots and seemed to have recovered from some  erratic putting that hampered him early in the tournament.  </P> <P> For the second consecutive day, two rounds were scheduled Saturday.  </P> <P> In the morning quarterfinals, Mickelson birdied the 17th hole to edge Bob May  of La Habra, 1-up. Mickelson hit a three-wood second shot 269 yards that rolled  just over the island green and then chipped close. May's second shot went into  the water.  </P> <P> In other quarterfinals, Eger got past Mike Brannan of Trumbull, Conn., 2 and 1,  in a battle of former touring pros who have been reinstated as amateurs.  </P> <P> Scherrer beat Hans Albertsson of Manchester, Vt., 3 and 2, and Zerman defeated  Mike Sposa of Dillard, Ga., 3 and 2.  </P></p>

			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Vauxhall beats Ford in company car league VAUXHALL has overtaken Ford for the first time as the most popular make of company car in an annual survey of nearly 600 businesses. The survey by Company Secretary's Review, one of the industry's best-known market monitoring organisations, covered companies operating a combined fleet of 35,000 cars. It found that Vauxhalls accounted for 31 per cent of the total, while Ford's share had slipped to 25 per cent from 42 per cent. The share of third-placed Rover Group, at 10 per cent, represents a fall from 14 per cent last year. The study says that Rover's drop is probably accounted for by its refusal to offer the same level of discounts as its larger rivals, in spite of the fierce price war raging in the deeply depressed market for new cars. The study examines in detail the size of discounts obtained by the surveyed companies. It finds discounting highest among the volume producers, and appears to dispel the widespread notion that some prestige cars, such as Mercedes-Benz, are not discounted by their dealers. For example, an average discount of 7.9 per cent was reported as having been obtained on the Mercedes 190, higher than either the 7.5 per cent achieved on Jaguar's saloon range or the 6.1 per cent obtained on BMW's 3-series cars. Among the volume car manufacturers, the survey says, Ford discounts are 'consistently higher than those of Vauxhall or Rover, with around 15.5 per cent obtained on every model'. A mean discount of 14.9 per cent is found on the Vauxhall Cavalier, now the single most popular car with 19 per cent of all sales. However, the survey concludes that 'this figure drops on other Vauxhall models'. Ford's Sierra is the second-most popular car, but it trails well behind the Cavalier in accounting for only 12 per cent of the surveyed fleet and is being replaced next year by a new model, the Mondeo. Although the survey finds that discounts of 15 per cent are available on Rover's aging Montego and Maestro models, those available on the mainstream Rover 200, 400 and 800 ranges are between 11.2 per cent and 12.2 per cent - more than 3 percentage points below Ford. The biggest discounts were to be found among Peugeot and Citroen models. The French group has more than doubled its share in the surveyed fleet, and with a combined 11 per cent is ahead of Rover. However, 'they continue to boost their presence in the fleet market by selective heavy discounting of over 16 per cent in some cases'. Among other findings, the survey says: Companies are keeping cars longer and running them to higher mileages. Some 35 per cent now run cars for more than 65,000 miles, up from 28 per cent a year previously. There is strong evidence of 'down-sizing' of cars made available to employees, with the trend most notable among senior managers. In spite of the recession, only half the companies surveyed make a concerted effort to monitor company car costs. Survey of Company Car Schemes.

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chetniks today fired on a food convoy on Mount  Igman with a machine gun. The aggressor has been intensively  violating the cease-fire with all type of small arms around  Sarajevo all day today. The chetniks were particularly  frequently firing on Brijesce from [the Sarajevo suburb of]  Nedzarici and Bozica [word indistinct].    A similar situation was in [word indistinct], where (?two)  grenades fired from the direction of Pergoj exploded, and in the  Vrace area and Srpsko Brdo, where one civilian was wounded.  This afternoon, a sniper was active at the junction of Tito  Street and Djuro Djakovic Street. Citizens are warned to  exercise maximum caution.    On the Vares-Olovo front, the aggressor is still attacking  the defense lines with all types of weapons. Attacks were  carried out on populated places in the Breza municipality from  within the exclusion zone, from the areas of Tisovik, Brezovaca,  Solakovici, Brdo, (?Halga), and Kostraca, as well as from  Nabozici. No one was killed or wounded.    The Visoko front was today marked by chetnik attacks with  anti-aircraft guns and machine guns and snipers on the  Visoko-Busje road and Visoko's suburbs and center. All these  attacks represent desperate moves by the aggressors since the  lines of defense in the theater of operations of the 1st Army  Corps remain stable and the morale and resolve of the defenders  to persevere in the struggle until final victory remains high.    This was reported by the Information Service of the 1st Army  Corps.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Charter wins over Esab dissidents: Bid raised to Pounds 286m in effort to clinch full control Charter, the UK industrial group, yesterday broke the deadlock in its stalled bid for Esab, the world's leading welding equipment supplier, raising its bid by Pounds 26m to Pounds 286m and winning the immediate acceptance of the key Swedish institutional shareholders that had rejected the original offer. The move brought to 84 per cent the share of Esab's capital and voting rights pledged to Charter and is almost certain to ensure the UK company wins the 90 per cent acceptances it needs to achieve a complete takeover. Charter made the new bid of SKr380 per A and B share, up from the original bid of SKr345, unconditional. The first offer, made at the end of June, was recommended by the Esab board and accepted by Incentive, the Wallenberg family industrial group that is Esab's controlling shareholder. But it was blocked when five institutions holding some 20 per cent of the voting capital rejected it as underpriced following a sharp rise in Esab's shares, to as much as SKr365, and a jump in the company's profits forecast. Charter, with 54 per cent of Esab secured, initially baulked at raising an offer which had initially represented a 20 per cent premium to the market price. But Mr Jeffrey Herbert, Charter's chief executive, said yesterday it was not satisfied with a simple majority shareholding. 'At the end of the day we are far happier with 100 per cent ownership. That is why I have increased the offer - and the performance of the business has fully justified the offer we have now made.' The new deal was worked out last week between Charter and the 4th Fund, a state pension fund which was the biggest shareholder after Incentive. Five other leading institutions also accepted the new terms. Charter, which is also assuming Pounds 130m in debt, will part-fund the deal through a Pounds 93m one-for-four rights issue at 560p per Charter share. All Esab shareholders will benefit from the new offer, adding SKr150m to the SKr1.3bn Incentive will receive for its 48 per cent stake. The acquisition of Esab, which had a turnover in 1993 of SKr7bn, will more than double Charter's size and add a fourth leg to its interests in building materials, coal and rail track equipment. Trade unions at Esab campaigned against Charter, portraying it as a foreign predator that would run down Esab's operations in Sweden. But Mr Herbert said yesterday Charter intended to keep the present management in place. 'Esab is becoming part of a group that is used to running international businesses and which in the last four years has invested Pounds 150m in growing businesses,' he said.</p>

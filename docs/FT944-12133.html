			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Croatian Serbs mass for fight Bosnian Serbs facing a joint Moslem-Croat assault have enlisted the help of rebel Serb guns in neighbouring Croatia to fight a offensive by the Bosnian government army, United Nations officers said yesterday. Croatian Serbs were reported to have mobilised 2,000 troops and to have massed men and weaponry along the border, although there was no evidence that they had crossed it. Intense fighting was reported in the suburbs of Serb-held Bosanska Krupa in northwest Bosnia, but Serb fighters were holding off the attack. The Bosnian government troops' advance out of the Bihac northwestern enclave has slowed after a week-long offensive that pushed Serb soldiers from almost 100 square miles of conquered territory. UN observers were barred from most of the battle zone, and each side was claiming the upper hand. According to a UN officer, Bosnian Serbs also faced fresh attacks near Sarajevo and Bosnian Croat forces joined the Moslem offensive in central Bosnia in a joint action on the Serb-held town of Kupres. Significant Croat troop movements were reported in the area.</p>

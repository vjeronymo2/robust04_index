			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Change to wills after divorce urged THE LAW Commission, the government's law reform advisory body, called yesterday for a change in the law governing the effect of divorce on wills. When a couple marries, any previous will made by either of them is automatically revoked. If they get divorced, however, this does not happen. The law tries to cut former spouses out of wills by providing that any gift to them should 'lapse'. The commission says that if testators die without altering their wills or do not re-marry, problems can arise which defeat the testator's intentions. If the husband's intention was for a gift to go to his former wife, or their children if she died before him, divorce would deprive the children of that gift. A number of respondents to a consultation paper told the commission that the time had come to change the law so that a will was automat-ically revoked on divorce. But the commission believes the problem can be solved by changing the law so that the will would take effect as if the former spouse died on the date of the divorce.

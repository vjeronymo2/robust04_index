			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 11 January, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata  rejected U.S. demands in the framework trade talks that Japan  try to increase the share of foreign products and foreign firms  in its domestic market to the level of that in other major  industrialized (G-7) nations. At a news conference following a  regular cabinet meeting the same day, Hata said: "It is  senseless to say that it is unfair that certain products are not  selling well in a certain country although they are selling well  in other countries. It is not proper to look at one figure and  insist that things ought to be a certain way."</p>

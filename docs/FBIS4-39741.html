			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Articles by Stas Stremidlovskiy and Sergey Mashtakov under </F> the rubric "Rumors" and the general heading: "Can There Be  Smoke Without Fire, Or What Will Come of the Talk About  Chernomyrdin's Resignation?"]    [Text] [Stremidlovskiy] Informed sources in the Russian  Federation Government reported this week that it has been  decided in principle by those close to Russian Federation  President Boris Yeltsin that Viktor Chernomyrdin should resign  as prime minister on health grounds and Yuriy Skokov should be  appointed to the post.    Analysts note that this is really a natural step for Yuriy  Skokov. Back in 1991 he occupied the post of chairman of the  Supreme Economic Council, and then he was secretary of the  Russian Federation Security Council. In his book Notes of  a President Boris Yeltsin said that "Skokov is really a  prime minister in waiting [`tenevoy' premyer-ministr]" and noted  the great contribution he made during the August events of 1991.    According to the experts, the price Yuriy Vladimirovich  would  have to pay for the appointment as government head would be the  guaranteed passage of the president's draft laws through the  State Duma. When you recall that the other day Skokov signed an  agreement in cooperation with the major deputies' group "New  Regional Policy," which comprises 65 deputies, this would  present no big problem.    [Mashtakov] The rumors that are rife about Viktor  Chernomyrdin's possible resignation as prime minister are  improbable for two reasons.    In the first place, Viktor Stepanovich has not yet had a  major quarrel with anyone. Moreover, if you look at what his  immediate subordinates (for example, Andrey Illarionov, head of  the premier's analysis group, who resigned in February) have  said, Viktor Stepanovich is held in high esteem by Boris  Nikolayevich.    Second, Chernomyrdin has real political forces behind him.  Above all, you have the military-induistrial complex, the fuel  and energy complex, and the agro-industrial complex, whose  leaders are linked to the premier not only by similar views but  also by personal friendship.    Yuriy Skokov, who, according to the rumors, is to succeed  Chernomyrdin as premier, is a less significant figure on the  Russian Olympus. At best what he might have behind him is the  support of the "New Regional Policy" parliamentary faction.</p>

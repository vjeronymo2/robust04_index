			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: prepared by </F> Andrey Pershin, Andrey Petrovsky, and Vladimir Shishlin, edited  by Boris Grishchenko]    [Text] The fact that the Belarusian parliament has a new  leader does not mean that the political and economic policy in  the republic will be changed. This was stated by the Supreme  Soviet's Chairman Myecheslaw Hryb at a press conference in Minsk.    On a question put by an Interfax correspondent he answered  that he highly appraised the merits of his predecessor.  However, he pointed out that Stanislav Shushkevich had lacked  "persistence in organization of coordinated activities of  different deputies' groups and factions. This is why the new  speaker must take this into consideration and correct this."    He emphasized that the peace-loving, friendly relations with  neighbors, aspiration to neutrality and recognition of the  established borders remained Belarusia's political priorities.    Hryb called a more dynamic transition to the market,  rebuilding of the economy's structure and privatization the main  domestic task. He recommended that a "serious economist" take  the post of the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet's Chairman.    Hryb proposed that 43-year old Ivan Bambiza be nominated his  deputy at the parliament's session on Wednesday. His candidacy  will be discussed in the parliamentary committees and  commissions.    According to the information received by deputies, Bambiza  was born in the Gomel Region. He graduated from the Belarusian  Institute of Agricultural machinery and received the diploma of  a mechanical engineer in 1975. Recently, he has been the head  of a regional administration and occupied the post of the  Secretary of the Supreme Soviet's Planning and Budget Financial  Commission.</p>

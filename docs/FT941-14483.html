			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Arts: Unfinished Business - Theatre No-one can accuse the Royal Shakespeare Company of not being broad-minded. The extraordinary new play at the Pit is overtly sympathetic to fascism, or at least to fascists. Nor are the characters poor Italians taken for a ride by Mussolini without knowing any better. They are English fascists, in a stately home, and their heroes are not Il Duce but the real thing: if not quite Hitler, certainly Goering. Michael Hastings's Unfinished Business is not about appeasement and the Cliveden set, whose motives might have been more understandable. It is 1940; the war has started and these are German supporters, not appeasers. Lord Sheffield and family stand in their stately grounds to cheer the Luftwaffe over England. The Bishop of Devon has arrived with his hand grenades and a sub-machine gun to help the German forces they are confident are about to arrive. Lady Sheffield says firmly before dinner: 'Whatever happens, you can rest assured that villains like Churchill and Beaverbrook will hang from Whitehall.' The aim is to establish two empires, one German, one British, to stand up to communism and semitism and preserve the Saxon race. Moreover, the Sheffields, so far as the family survives, remain unrepentant. For apart from 1940 Unfinished Business is also set in the present day. The new Lord Sheffield, a tennis-playing schoolboy when the play began, is now impoverished in an old people's home which happens to be the original stately mansion. 'I lost the war,' he says, but 'I am a fascist. I haven't gone away.' All this is presented without satire or criticism. The Sheffield family is played with sympathy, even dignity, with the old Lord Sheffield defending 'the Englishman's right to be ridiculous in his own country'. Nobody laughs. When one recovers from the mild surprise of seeing a piece like this at the RSC, or indeed anywhere, what is Unfinished Business like as a play? It is certainly interesting. There are some elements of a plot, sometimes several. There is a butler Douglas (Jasper Britton) whom Lord Sheffield claims to believe is working for British intelligence. The suspicion drives the butler mad, but when he produces a gun to threaten the entire Sheffield household, it is the butler who is shot. Lord Sheffield hangs himself, abetted by his son, who inherits the title. The young Lord Sheffield dismisses the maid with whom we have seen him romping in the attic. She is pregnant with his child. Such sudden dastardy at least facilitates the move to the present day. In the old people's home, Sheffield's nurse is the maid's daughter and the mother turns up to visit. The last 20 minutes or so struck me as almost intolerably sentimental as the old man seeks a reconciliation, though there is a final twist when one of the old hand grenades is discovered and there is the possibility of a mutual suicide pact. Some of the performances are excellent. Philip Voss is always admirable. As the old Lord Sheffield, he has a streak of bullying snobbery, but also fierce pride and independence. When the butler pulls out the gun, the senior Sheffield is the single member of the family to stand up to him. The only really unpleasant figure in the play is the simpering Bishop played by Ian Taylor. That seems a bit unfair, since they are nearly all in it together, but Taylor can certainly drivel. Gemma Jones is an impressive looking Lady Sheffield, yet has very little to do. The part of the new Lord Sheffield is split between Toby Stephens playing the 17-year-old and Geoffrey Bayldon as the septuagenarian. The part that stands out above all is Britton's butler. All butlers, he says, tread a narrow path between sanity and madness and in one scene he treads it perfectly. The same scene shows that Hastings can certainly write, even if he has produced a strange play. Direction is by Steven Pimlott. In repertory at The Pit. (071) 638 8891</p>

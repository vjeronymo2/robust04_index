			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Observer: Slotted out Some 67 per cent of Americans approve of legalised gambling, according to a survey published yesterday. Unfortunately, however, they do not live in Missouri, where ornery southerners have voted down a constitutional amendment to legalise all sorts of riverboat gambling. Riverboat casinos are big business on the Mississippi. States encourage them because of the money and jobs they bring; but paradoxically, opposition to gambling is stronger in the traditional south than almost anywhere else in the US. Yesterday's referendum result will leave riverboat casino operators free to offer games of skill, like poker and blackjack, but not slot machines where the real money is made. No doubt the riverboats will be slipping their moorings and floating over to the opposite bank of the river - in the state of Illinois.</p>

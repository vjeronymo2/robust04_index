			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by defense affairs correspondent Sharon Sade] </F>   [Excerpts] The Justice Ministry rejects the possibility of  extraditing Rami Dotan or Attorney Harold Katz to the United  States if they are convicted by a U.S. court on the basis of the  charges submitted against them in Ohio at the end of last week.    Justice Ministry spokesman Eti Asher explained yesterday  that  "Israeli law does not permit the extradition of Israeli citizens  to foreign countries, even for extraditable offenses. That is  the reason the United States has not submitted any request for  the extradition of Rami Dotan and Attorney Harold Katz."  [passage omitted]    Asher added that the United States could request Israel's  permission to initiate Israeli court proceedings against the men  named in the charge sheets, if they are indeed convicted by the  U.S. courts, but it has yet to do so. The United States can  also demand their extradition from any third country they may  visit or in which they may reside. [passage omitted]</p>

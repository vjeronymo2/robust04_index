			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Emilio Vasquez Perez and Hilario Monroy A.] </F>   [Text] The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has  "adamantly" voiced its opposition to a proposal forwarded by  U.S. legislators, who intend to act as censors and observers in  the 21 August presidential elections, it was stated yesterday by  Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, chairman of the PRI National Executive  Council [CEN]. He said that, according to Mexico's legal  framework, the task of observing the elections only involves  Mexican citizens.    In his offices at PRI National Headquarters, the recently  appointed PRI leader nevertheless explained that his party has  no objections if national observer groups monitor the federal  electoral process, or if foreign visitors learn about the  development and results of the electoral process.    Pichardo Pagaza also said that, according to the Mexican  legal framework, national observers are permitted. Therefore,  the PRI endorses a decision adopted by the government of the  Republic to invite the OAS to issue a technical opinion on the  national electoral process' progress and to state its views to  Mexican observers.    The chairman of the PRI CEN said: "We have nothing to hide;  quite the contrary, we want the national and international  public to know why we will win. We have no objection if private  visitors come from every part of the world to learn about the  developments in this electoral process."    In his statements, Pichardo Pagaza noted the way in which  the  PRI is taking part in the electoral race for the presidency:  "We are waging a clean and honest campaign and election."    Nevertheless, the national leader of the tricolor party said  he rejects the proposal presented by two U.S. legislators, which  would enable them to be the ones who would examine and observe  the Mexican elections. "Consequently, we reject the proposal  presented by the two U.S. congressmen who illegally want to  issue opinions on the Mexican federal elections results and  process," the PRI leader emphasized.</p>

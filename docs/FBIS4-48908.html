			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent Chao Yang (6392 3363): </F> "Jiang Zemin Makes Inspection Tour of Shanghai at a Sensitive  Moment and Stresses Stability"]    [Text] A reliable source has said that Jiang Zemin, CPC  general secretary and state president, arrived in Shanghai on an  inspection tour last Tuesday [26 April] and later paid a special  visit to the Pudong new zone. A Shanghai official source  believed that Jiang Zemin's return to Shanghai, where he had  risen to power, has strong symbolic significance on the eve of  the fifth anniversary of the 4 June incident and the fourth  anniversary of the launch of the Pudong full development project.    The source said that Jiang Zemin arrived in Shanghai on 26  April (Tuesday) by special plane in the company of the CPC  Central Committee General Office director Zeng Qinghong  (formerly deputy secretary of the Shanghai Municipality CPC  Committee, and, as such, one of Jiang Zemin's henchmen). On the  previous day (Monday) he received the visiting Canadian Governor  Ramon John Hnatyshyn in Beijing, the last foreign guest that he  was scheduled to entertain in April. On the afternoon of the  same day -- when Jiang left Beijing -- the Central Military  Commission called a forum to study the Selected Works of  Deng Xiaoping, in which the officers in charge of the six  major military regions were present. Jiang Zemin, as the  chairman of the military commission, did not attend the forum,  which was instead presided over by Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of  the military commission.    A Shanghai source revealed that Jiang Zemin stayed in Xijiao  Guest House in Shanghai (the guesthouse where Deng Xiaoping used  to stay when he came to Shanghai to pass the Chinese New Year).  Most of the time he stayed in the guest house, except for the  visit he paid the other day to the Pudong new zone. Over the  past few days, he held meetings in the guest house with Shanghai  leaders, including Wu Bangguo, a member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Shanghai  Municipality CPC Committee, and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju. It is  said that they touched on such topics as the solution to  problems that have arisen from the Pudong development project,  the way to stabilize the commodity prices in the Shanghai  market, and those issues facing state-owned large and medium  enterprises in reform, for example, the shortage of funds,  unemployment, and decrease in income.  <H5>  Turmoil Is Intolerable, and Large Companies Are Being Asked </H5> To Prop Up the Market    The source disclosed that Jiang Zemin had specifically  stressed the issue of stability during this tour of Shanghai.  As Shanghai is one of China's industrial hubs, the country's  primary financial source, and a metropolis which is home to many  state-owned large and medium enterprises, Jiang Zemin held that  maintaining stability in Shanghai is a task "no less important  than maintaining stability in Beijing." Because Shanghai  managed to remain stable in 1989, the city played a crucial role  in the rapid return to stability throughout the country at that  time. The Shanghai authorities tacitly knew about this idea --  "stability overrides everything." So, back in March, after the  people's congress session, they raised the amount of living  expense allowance for retired workers. Recently the department  concerned in Shanghai has been trying to convince major  companies on the stock market to join forces in "propping up the  market" and keep the Shanghai Stock Index above 600 points. The  argument is that any turmoil which may burst out among stock  investors is absolutely intolerable on the eve of the  anniversary of the 4 June incident. In spite of this, the  Shanghai stock market still failed to keep the index above the  600 point level yesterday, when it dropped to 592.    The Shanghai informed source said that Shanghai is the place  where Jiang Zemin rose to power. He was promoted to the central  leadership to replace Zhao Ziyang as CPC general secretary in  the middle of his term of office as secretary of the Shanghai  municipality party committee. Next month will mark the fifth  anniversary of Jiang Zemin's Beijing posting (he was summoned to  Beijing on 16 May 1989). Now, at this sensitive moment -- the  anniversary of the 4 June incident is drawing ever nearer,  China's economy is facing a lot of trouble, and political  development is entering a post-Deng period -- Jiang Zemin's  return to Shanghai could mean to support his henchmen and to  consolidate his backyard, and this can be viewed as an event of  strong symbolic significance.    It is said that, since both State Council Premier Li Peng  and  Hu Jintao, member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee in  charge of party affairs, are now on missions abroad, all the  major operations of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council have been taken over by Zhu Rongji, acting premier and  concurrently member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee,  and Liu Huaqing, vice chairman of the Central Military  Commission, while Jiang Zemin is away from Beijing. Two other  senior members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee, Qiao  Shi, who also is the chairman of the National People's Congress  Standing Committee, and Li Ruihuan, who is the chairman of the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National  Committee, seldom attend to these matters.    Since Jiang Zemin is to receive Kenyan President Daniel T.  Arap Moi, who will arrive in Beijing on 3 May (next Tuesday), he  is expected to return to Beijing in the next few days.</p>

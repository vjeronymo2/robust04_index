			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MELVIN KONNER, M.D.: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> MEDICAL SCHOOL MALADY: SYSTEMATIC ABUSE OF STUDENTS  </P> <P> "Can I abuse you?"  </P> <P> These were the first words spoken to me by my house officer -- the intern  supervising my hospital training during a key part of my third year of medical  school. (I was a few years older, and she was quite attractive, but here there  was no hint of sexual innuendo.) The "abuse" that day was typical  medical-student "scut-work": drawing blood, replacing intravenous lines,  chasing around the hospital with various samples and fluids.  </P> <P> So far, so good. All this was part of my education -- it's what medical  students do to earn their stripes, a quid pro quo for knowledge gained, a  honing of skills, a way of feeling not quite so useless -- or worse, burdensome  -- in the dramatic and fast-moving hospital setting. I accepted it. I even felt  happy that she could joke over the word abuse, thinking that this meant that no  real abuse would occur.  </P> <P> How wrong I was. For some reason she had it in for me. She routinely kept me up  after all my work was completed -- at 3 or 4 in the morning, on call nights --  just to make irrelevant comments on my hospital notes, which for eight months  other house officers had found excellent. She humiliated me one morning because  I had respectfully asked a senior physician to help me understand better why  one of the patients had unexpectedly died; claiming that my question implied a  criticism of the doctor's competence (untrue), she read me the riot act in the  middle of a busy nursing station.  </P> <P> In the worst episode, she ordered me to administer intravenous Adriamycin -- a  powerful and toxic anti-cancer drug -- to a man with lung cancer, claiming that  we had "talked about" the procedure. Even if true (it wasn't), I -- a  third-year medical student -- had no business doing the injection on the basis  of a talk; fortunately an alert nurse stopped me from making a bad mistake. My  intern yelled at me on the phone, then came down herself, yelled at me some  more, and did the injection herself; incompletely, it turned out, since the man  suffered serious damage to his arm from leakage of the drug.  </P> <P> She was not unique. I once saw a new intern subjected to such relentless verbal  abuse, during a gallbladder operation by a senior house officer, that the  intern cut an artery and endangered the patient's life. Since the same intern  was perfectly calm and competent with other teachers in the operating room, it  was clear to me that the abuser was to blame, not the hapless underling  anxiously holding the knife.  </P> <P> Fortunately, right around the same time I was having these dismal experiences,  the first serious studies of verbal and other abuse of medical students were  getting under way. Two more recent studies published in the Journal of the  American Medical Assn. provide evidence that what I experienced is more the  rule than the exception, and its consequences may affect everyone who ever sees  a doctor.  </P> <P> One study surveyed a third-year medical school class (the first year of  hospital training). Of the 75 students responding to the questionnaire, 85%  reported widespread verbal abuse, 47% psychological mistreatment such as unfair  threats, 44% exposure to unnecessary medical risk and 16% physical abuse.  Sixty-seven percent felt that these experiences had adversely affected their  emotional health, and 37% had considered dropping out of medicine as a result.  Sexual harassment of women was extremely common (sexist slurs, 81%, sexual  advances, 55%) but harassment in general cut across lines of sex, age and race.  One male student stated that he had been kicked in the groin by an attending  physician and required medical attention for this injury.  </P> <P> The second study, led by Henry Silver, a University of Colorado physician who  pioneered such research in the early '80s, surveyed students at all four  year-levels of a different medical school. The findings of this independent  study were remarkably similar to the first, conducted under the auspices of the  American Medical Assn. By the senior year, 80% of students reported having been  abused in one way or another, and of those two-thirds found the episode of  "major importance and very upsetting." One-sixth felt the episode would always  affect them.  </P> <P> Silver has also contributed an interesting analogy: Just as abused children  often grow up to abuse their own children -- and other people generally -- so  medical students become house officers who abuse up-and-coming medical students  -- and, frequently, patients.  </P> <P> Medical students are not children, and they are not especially vulnerable --  they have been through tough premedical training. Nevertheless they can be  damaged.  </P> <P> I personally place more emphasis on the structure of training programs for  house officers.  </P> <P> People like my intern are under so much stress -- sleeplessness, too many  patients, information overload, humiliation by their superiors -- that they  become hard and bitter and pass on the stress. Current reforms in the  scheduling of house officer training will, I predict, do more to reduce abuse  of medical students than any change within medical school itself.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Uganda's visiting Trade and Industry Minister  Richard Kaijuka has urged Thai investors to help develop his  country's untapped natural resources, saying the African state  has enjoyed nearly a decade of political and economic stability.    He said the country is economically attractive and full of  economic opportunities and that the government has introduced a  number of incentives including investment codes and certain  tax-free periods to promote foreign investment.    Despite its plentiful resources and steady economic growth,  the landlocked nation of 17 million people still lags behind for  lack of expertise and experience. He specified the agriculture  and food processing, textile and garment, hotel and tourism  industries, telecommunications, stones and gems, leather  industry, mining and hydro energy as the main sectors which are  open to Thai businessmen.    "Uganda's (economic) performance is outstanding but we could  do better with Thai experience and expertise. We would like to  invite serious Thai businessmen and manufacturers to invest in  our country because of your experience and expertise... The sky  is the limit," he said.    Uganda was one of the fastest growing African states after  its independence from Britain in October 1962. But 10 years  later the country plunged into political turmoil with a  dictatorial regime and civil war ravaging the country's economy.    After the national resistance movement under Yoweri Museveni  toppled the dictatorship in 1986, the country embarked on a  market-oriented policy. Financial reform, a free-market economy  and privatization have helped revive the sagging economy. Since  1991, the average annual growth has stood at 5 per cent and  inflation has gone down from 360 per cent to around 3 per cent.  About 80 per cent of workers are engaged in agriculture and 96  per cent of the national income comes from coffee production.    Kaijuka said Uganda is blessed with a moderate climate and  its geographic location in the heart of Africa makes it a good  springboard for manufactured goods into other central, eastern  and southern African nations. The country, he said, is a member  of the 250-million-people Common Market for Eastern, Central and  Southern African States (COMESA), which was established last  year and includes countries from Ethiopia down to Swaziland.  With the expected new membership of South Africa, the COMESA  will expand to 300 million people.    The trade minister, who stopped in Thailand on his way to  Singapore, said his country has adopted a number of incentives  including tax-free import of equipment and a tax-free grace  period of five years. He said other privileges will be added.  The country's currency is also fully convertible and can be  exchanged without limit at any time, he said.    Kaijuka made a courtesy call on Deputy Foreign Minister  Surin  Phitsuwan on Tuesday and introduced James Mulwana, who was  appointed honorary consul-general of Thailand in Uganda, to the  Thai minister.    According to Dr Suraphon Siwithe, director of the Foreign  Ministry's African Division, two Thai candidates are being  proposed by the Industry Association as honorary consul-general  of Uganda in Thailand. The names are being submitted to Uganda  for final approval and selection.    The two countries established diplomatic ties in 1985 and  Thailand has assigned its ambassador to Nairobi, Kenya, as envoy  to Uganda, while the latter has assigned its high commissioner  to New Delhi, India, as ambassador to Thailand.</p>

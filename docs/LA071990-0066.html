			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> New Jersey Fines Trump Plaza: Financially strapped casino king Donald J. Trump  got some more bad news when his Trump Plaza Hotel &amp; Casino was fined  $40,000 for violating state gaming regulations. The New Jersey Casino Control  Commission said between May, 1987, and January, 1990, Financial Director  Michael Hlavsa and Financial Controller Rodney Ferguson hired six accountants  who did not have the proper licenses. Acting commission Chairwoman Valerie  Armstrong said the financial officers falsified paper work that was later  forwarded to the commission to make it appear the accountants were doing jobs  that did not require casino licenses.  </P></p>

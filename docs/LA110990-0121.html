			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOPPERS CURTAIL BUYING; CHRISTMAS SALES MAY FIZZLE;  </P> <P> RETAILING: GAS IS HIGHER, AND CONSUMERS ARE WORRIED. ANALYSTS FEAR AN OFF YEAR.  </P> <P> In the latest sign of a weak U.S. economy, shoppers are cutting back purchases  at department stores, some of the nation's best-known retailers reported  Thursday. The trend provides further evidence that this year's Christmas  shopping season could be a dud.  </P> <P> "This will probably be the worst Christmas for retailers since 1982," said  Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the Merrill Lynch investment firm in New  York.  </P> <P> On Thursday, such retail firms as Sears Roebuck, J. C. Penney, Limited Inc. and  Carter Hawley Hale, owner of the Broadway, reported sales declines from last  October in stores that had been open at least a year.  </P> <P> Separately, consumer credit rose at a modest 4.9% annual rate in September, the  Federal Reserve Board announced. The $3-billion increase appeared to reflect  the higher cost of gasoline as well as decisions by hard-pressed Americans to  pay off their debts more slowly, analysts said.  </P> <P> Although the overall sales picture was marginally better than last year by some  estimates, few analysts found much to cheer about. "The theme here is that  consumers are being very cautious and their rate of spending is slowing down,"  Steinberg said.  </P> <P> The consumer slowdown comes amid growing anxiety about the economy, as labor  markets weaken and Mideast uncertainty persists. Gauges of consumer confidence  have fallen to their lowest levels since the early 1980s, the time of the last  official recession.  </P> <P> The news from major retailers "says to me very clearly that indeed we are in a  recession, and it's most directly being caused by consumers," said Cynthia  Latta, a financial economist with DRI/McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass.  </P> <P> Consumer spending is closely watched because it amounts to two-thirds of U.S.  economic activity. Thursday's report is limited to activity at major retail  stores. Next week, the government will release a broader measure of consumer  purchases, which also includes autos, gasoline and many other items.  </P> <P> The news of weak retail sales follows a recent stream of negative data on  employment, income and other important features of the U.S. economy.  </P> <P> "Every factor that has influence on consumer spending is negative," said Sandra  Shaber, an economist with the Futures Group, a private economic research firm  in Washington. "We're talking about the job market. We're talking about income  gains, inflation and home prices. It's difficult to see how there could be any  more strength in consumer spending than there is."  </P> <P> The gloomy picture has led to predictions that the coming Christmas shopping  season will be disappointing for retailers, many of whom rely on the holidays  for up to half their annual sales. Faced with paltry consumer demand, stores  tend to slash prices -- and profits -- to keep inventories from piling up.  </P> <P> Christmas could turn out "pitiful" for stores, said James E. Newton, president  of Economic Perspectives, a retail consulting firm in Delaware, Ohio.  "Retailers are not going to enjoy it at all."  </P> <P> A separate key to consumer behavior is the amount of credit sought by the  public. In September it rose at a 4.9% annual rate. While hardly minuscule, the  level suggests a retrenchment in spending and is somewhat smaller than the  credit increases of past months, analysts said.  </P> <P> Revolving credit, for example -- reflecting credit-card use -- grew in  September by $1.9 billion, smaller than August's $2.35-billion increase.  </P> <P> "Consumers are trying to buy a little time and maintain their living standards  by not paying off their credit so rapidly," said DRI's Latta. Also, people in  September may have put more costly gasoline purchases on their Master Cards and  Visas, pushing up the credit figures, she said.  </P> <P> October sales reports of selected retailers, compared with a year ago:  </P> <P> * Sears Roebuck same-store sales down 0.4%; overall sales down 1.2%.  </P> <P> * J. C. Penney same-store sales down 6.3%; overall sales down 4.9%.  </P> <P> * Carter Hawley Hale same-store sales down 0.1%; overall sales up 1.7%.  </P> <P> * May Department Stores Co. (May and Robinson's stores in Southern California,  Lord &amp; Taylor, Hecht's, Filene's and Foley's) same-store sales down 4.4%;  overall sales up 1.1%.  </P> <P> * Limited Inc. same-store sales down 1%; overall up 13%.  </P> <P> * Kmart Corp. same-store sales up 1.3%; overall sales up 11.2%.  </P> <P> * Wal-Mart, same-store sales up 10%; overall sales up 25%  </P> <P> </P> <P> CONSUMER CREDIT  </P> <P> Sept., '90: $735.4  </P> <P> Aug., '90: $732.4  </P> <P> Sept., '89: $705.7  </P></p>

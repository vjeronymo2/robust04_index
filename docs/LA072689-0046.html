			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMBODIAN TALKS COLLAPSE, JUST DAYS BEFORE 20-NATION CONFERENCE IN PARIS  </P> <P> Preliminary talks between resistance leaders and the Vietnamese-backed  Cambodian government broke down Tuesday, only a few days before a scheduled  20-nation Paris peace conference aimed at ending the Cambodian civil war.  </P> <P> A meeting of the four parties scheduled for today was canceled. However, French  diplomats insisted that the international conference, which is to include U.S.  Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze among others, will begin Sunday as planned.  </P> <P> Representatives of the three main resistance groups and the government of  Premier Hun Sen said they failed to reach agreement even on the simplest  matters of protocol in several hours of talks at the French Foreign Ministry  chateau in this Paris suburb.  </P> <P> For example, one delegate said, the leaders -- Hun Sen, Prince Norodom  Sihanouk, Khmer Rouge representative Khieu Samphan and the Khmer People's  National Liberation Front leader, Son Sann -- failed to agree even on name  cards to be used at the peace conference.  </P> <P> "Hun Sen said we could not even use the word Cambodia in our name," said the  delegate, who is affiliated with Son Sann's anti-Communist group.  </P> <P> As Sihanouk left the meeting site, he said: "It is not worth the trouble to  meet again. The disagreement is total."  </P> <P> He said he is "very, very pessimistic" about the prospects for a political  settlement at the international conference. He said the preliminary meetings,  which were to set the stage for the larger conference, broke down on several  key points, including:  </P> <P>  -- Sihanouk and the other resistance leaders favor a U.N. peacekeeping force  to monitor the promised withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. The Hun  Sen government opposes such a move.  </P> <P>  -- Hun Sen has proposed an immediate cease-fire. Resistance leaders say this  would favor the Hanoi-backed regime and the Vietnamese troops still in place.  </P> <P>  -- Resistance leaders contend that Hun Sen's government should be part of the  Vietnamese delegation to the international conference because it is supported  by Vietnamese troops. Hun Sen considers his government the valid Cambodian  representative.  </P> <P>  -- In a compromise move, resistence leaders have agreed to join with Hun Sen  in a united Cambodian delegation to the international conference. However, Hun  Sen favors two separate Cambodian delegations and refuses to join any  delegation that includes the Khmer Rouge.  </P> <P> "We will not accept being placed in a single Cambodian delegation," Hun Sen  said.  </P> <P> Sihanouk said: "To recognize two Cambodias would be fatal to our country."  </P> <P> Despite the differences, Hun Sen was slightly more optimistic than Sihanouk  about the international peace conference. He conceded that the talks Monday and  Tuesday had "taken a step backward." But he said "the international conference  should take place independent of the negotiations between Cambodians."  </P> <P> To show his good faith, the government leader repeated his offer for a  cease-fire and for the first time offered a specific timetable for the  withdrawal of the 60,000 to 70,000 Vietnamese troops.  </P> <P> "The final total withdrawal will take place Sept. 21-26 by land, river and  sea," Hun Sen said. "From Sept. 27, all Vietnamese volunteers will have been  completely withdrawn from Cambodia."  </P></p>

			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Building societies' inflow triples - At a glance Building societies enjoyed a net inflow of Pounds 363m last month, the highest monthly figure for 15 months and more than three times December's inflow of Pounds 117m. However, mortgage lending was depressed with net new commitments down to Pounds 1.55bn in January from a revised figure of Pounds 1.89bn the previous month.

			<p>920422 FT  22 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Holiday mood lingers on continental bourses BOURSES re-opened for business after the Easter break but trading was uneventful, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT had a quiet day, as the DAX index closed down 2.73 at 1,746.50, while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, gained 0.32 to 711.48. Turnover fell to DM3.8bn from DM5.1bn last Thursday. The market is waiting for the March money supply figures this week and commentators are hoping for signs of a slowing in monetary growth. However, the expectations are that the Bundesbank will be unable to cut interest rates until the fourth quarter. The result of strike ballots among public service workers is also expected before the weekend. Lufthansa was unchanged at DM153.50 in spite of a statement by Mr Jurgen Weber, the chairman, at the weekend in which he said that first quarter results were likely to be poor. The airline refused to comment on a report in a German magazine which said that the airline had lost DM400m in the first three months. Mr Weber said that the 3 per cent reduction in costs should be seen as the first step in a cost-cutting programme, but that further cuts would not affect services. Veba moved ahead DM1.90 to DM392.50 after reporting on Saturday that its petrochemical division had shown a 29 per cent improvement in 1991 group net profit. Hoesch was DM4 weaker at DM248 on last week's news that the cartel office had approved its merger with Krupp, while the latter gained DM2.40 to DM137.90. PARIS was lifted late in the day by a rumour of an interest rate cut which started in the options market. The CAC-40 index closed 2.15 higher at 1,980.36, having reached a low of 1,963.67 in the morning. Volume was thin at FFr1.8bn. Euro Disney was the day's most active share, falling FFr1.10 to FFr130.90 with 751,700 shares traded. The stock continues to suffer from bad press in the UK. Eurotunnel rose 65 centimes to FFr38.20 after the company denied reports that it would announce a rights issue with its 1991 results on Friday. Printemps rose FFr12 to FFr815 in relatively heavy volume of 78,000 shares. MILAN closed lower in thin trading as operators had little desire to do business. The Comit index fell 1.21 to 506.33 in turnover estimated at around L50bn after Friday's L55.9bn. A slight gain by Generali at its official close failed to boost the market. The stock closed L65 higher at L29,595 but then lost nearly L150 after hours. Among Friday's block trades, disclosed yesterday, were 1.2m shares in Sirti and 388,000 shares in the publisher, Mondadori. Its ordinary shares rose L130 or 1.5 per cent to L8,650 on speculation of a public offer by Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest for the outstanding shares. Mondadori's free float is estimated at less than 10 per cent. AMSTERDAM had a slow day, with the CBS Tendency index losing 0.3 to 126.2. Turnover was modest at Fl 483.1m. Daf was active on reports that it had won an order from the Dutch government to supply military vehicles and that the British truck market was improving. The shares closed 80 cents firmer at Fl 23.70, lifted by UK and US interest. Nedlloyd improved 30 cents to Fl 55.20 ahead of today's 1991 results. Analysts expect the group to return to profit. DSM gained Fl 1.30 to Fl 107.80 with some switching out of Akzo being noted. The latter was down 60 cents at Fl149.70. BRUSSELS closed mixed in thin trading, as the Bel-20 Index eased just 0.74 to 1,195.43. Petrofina closed unchanged at BFr10,650 on volume of 10,360 shares. The steel maker Arbed closed down BFr130 or 3.3 per cent at BFr3,840 after losing 5 per cent in early trade. Dealers said they expected Arbed's 1991 net profit - due next week - to fall 75 per cent. ZURICH fell in low volume as many investors remained on holiday. The SMI index closed down 10.8 to 1,860.5. Nestle bearers lost SFr70 to SFr9,570 while Ciba-Geigy bearers declined SFr20 to SFr3,460. MADRID lost ground, as the general index eased 0.59 to 252.84. Telefonica lost Pta20 to Pta1,090 while Tabacalera fell Pta70 to Pta6,260. ISTANBUL partially reversed Monday's losses thanks to strong first quarter results of two companies, Kepez and Otosan, The index rose 43.3 to 3,939.87. STOCKHOLM drifted lower in extremely thin trading. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 6.6 to 982.6 in turnover of just SKr239m. OSLO's all-share index rose 3.34 to 423.52 in trading worth NKr155.16m.

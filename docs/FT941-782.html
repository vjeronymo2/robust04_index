			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / Singapore PM eases Burma's isolation Mr Goh Chok Tong, prime minister of Singapore, arrived in Burma yesterday for a rare visit to the country by the head of a foreign government. It will bolster the fortunes of the military junta while antagonising Burmese opposition groups and western human rights activists. Mr Goh, accompanied by two dozen businessmen, is the first head of government - apart from the prime minister of Laos - to visit Burma since the armed forces crushed a pro-democracy uprising and killed hundreds of demonstrators in 1988. Singapore is one of the main foreign investors in Burma. It sells weapons to the junta and has taken the lead in seeking improved contacts between Burma and the rest of south-east Asia. Burma, also known as Myanmar, is expected to be invited by Thailand to attend July's meeting of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean) in Bangkok. The Singapore prime minister's visit is 'to promote Myanmar-Singapore relations in the context of Asean's policy of constructive engagement with Myanmar,' Mr Goh's office said. The US administration wants to put pressure on Burma's generals to begin negotiations with Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, the detained opposition leader, and is planning to ask arms exporters to stop supplying weapons to Burma. Singapore would be unwilling to comply with the request. As well as selling weapons, Singaporean companies give advice on small arms manufacturing and use Burmese territory to test their military products, according to residents of Rangoon. Asian governments say that investment in Burma and dialogue with the junta will help the Burmese people, whereas isolation would only harden the attitudes of the regime: after years of stagnation, the economy is now growing by about 5 per cent annually. Opposition leaders, however, resent the close ties between the Burmese, Singaporean, Thai and other governments. 'Constructive engagement is not constructive,' said one politician from Ms Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party in Rangoon recently. 'It's destructive opportunism. We are in a time of trouble, and when the government is oppressing its own people, they shouldn't do it.'</p>

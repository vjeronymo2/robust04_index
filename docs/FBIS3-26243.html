It decided to flexibly reduce tariffs on 73 industrial products  and the average reduction rate is 30 percent. In addition, it  revised the Rules on Import Duties, reducing tariffs on 402  agricultural and industrial products including 252 industrial  items and 150 agricultural items. The tariffs are lowered by  17.5 percent and 12.5 percent respectively.    Chiang Ping-kun, minister of Economic Affairs, said the rate  of reduction and the number of items covered in this tariff  reduction plan should meet U.S. demands. The Republic of China  [ROC] and the United States should be able to hold bilateral  talks on our entry into the General Agreement on Tariff and  Trade [GATT] by the end of this month.    Both Chiang Ping-kun and Hsu Ke-sheng, vice minister of  Economic Affairs, said that they would inform the United States  of our tariff reduction plan as soon as possible. The Board of  Foreign Trade under the Ministry of Economic Affairs will fax  this plan to the Economic Division of the Coordination Council  for North American Affairs today, to inform the United States of  our tariff reduction plan and ask it to hold bilateral talks on  our country's accession to GATT at the end of this month. The  Office of the U.S. Trade Representative will send officials to  Taiwan at the end of this month to hold talks on protecting  intellectual property rights and rhinoceros horns. Therefore,  it is possible for the ROC and United States to hold bilateral  talks in Taipei on the ROC's accession to the GATT at the end of  this month.</p>

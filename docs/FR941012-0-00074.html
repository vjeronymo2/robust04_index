			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]he use of low-kickback guide bars results in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tradeoff of some reduction in utility for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement in safety. Industry sources have suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that this may be an acceptable tradeoff for the less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> powerful saws which are probably purchased by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumers. Since the tradeoff involves a marginal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improvement in safety, however, manufacturers are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probably less willing to equip the more powerful, more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance oriented saws with the low-kickback guide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bars (Ex. 5&hyph;13).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the potential for kickback can be reduced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> low- or reduced-kickback chain.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This chain is commonly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to as new generation chain. Low kickback chain can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be identified by an idler or spacer link between each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutting links. In other words, the chain has a left hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cutter link on the right side of the chain, followed by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spacer link, followed by a right hand cutter link on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left side of the chain followed by another spacer link  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> before the sequence begins again.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the low-kickback chain can reduce kickback  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy by 40 to 90 percent, there are drawbacks to its use,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> according to the CPSC report. These drawbacks include: (1)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New technology chains generally exhibit some loss in cutting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency (speed and ease of cutting), (2) these chains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make cutting more tiring for the operator thereby causing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more operator fatigue, and (3) the loss of cutting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> efficiency may adversely affect the life of the chain. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loss of cutting efficiency has been estimated to be anywhere  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from a 10 to 25 percent. OSHA has no estimates of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in operator fatigue and the degradation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service life of the chain.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Of the four protective devices, most commenters said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA should require chain saws to be equipped with a chain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> brake because it is the most used and most effective for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> professional logging operations (Ex. 4&hyph;175, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;21, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;34, 5&hyph;42, 5&hyph;46, 9&hyph;3, 9&hyph;4, 9&hyph;13, 9&hyph;15, 9&hyph;18, 9&hyph;20; Tr. OR 536&hyph;37). Several of these commenters said that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all chain saws used at their establishments are equipped  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with chain brakes. These commenters also said that almost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all manufacturers now produce chain saws with some kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain brake and that almost all chain saws manufactured for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial logging operations now have chain brakes (Ex. 5&hyph;19; Tr. OR 185&hyph;87, 536). In addition, one commenter said  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that manufacturers have improved earlier mechanical problems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with chain brakes so that they are reliable in preventing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> kickback (Ex. 9&hyph;4). With regard to the effectiveness of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain brakes, one commenter said:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The chain brake is, I'd say, one of the most important  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chain saw protective devices developed in modern  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history. In Montana all of our current professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> saws are equipped with chain brakes. Most of our saws  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are in the four to six cubic inch range, primarily,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Stihl and Husqvarna with a few other minor brands and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> seldom on job visitations do I find anyone who has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disconnected the chain brake. It's so uncommon that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it's startling when I find that any more.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

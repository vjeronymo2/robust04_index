			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Letter: Role in private sector projects essential for success of the EBRD Sir, While I might agree with your assertion that the ideal candidate for the presidency of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) should combine the qualities of Messrs Balcerowicz, de Larosiere, Stern and Lady Thatcher with 'knowledge of the economic task ahead, impeccable integrity and political weight' (Leading article: 'New leader for EBRD', July 22), I must disagree with some of your other conclusions. That Europe may have 'no shortage of private merchant bankers' may be true. But how many are operating in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union? And, indeed, how many can really afford to, given the opportunity costs? Does anyone seriously believe that most governments or companies in the region can pay for the advisory services of Morgan Stanley or Warburgs? Or need the services in which they truly excel, such as bond and equity issues, derivatives and M&amp;A? A public sector merchant bank could, on the other hand, provide those services that are needed in the region, such as restructuring and privatisation advice, plus fresh cash to local privatised firms and to those few foreign investors willing to risk some of their own money in projects in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. More fundamentally, however - and in contrast to what you say - lending to private projects is not only a necessary and a sufficient condition for the development of healthy economies based on the private sector. It is the only viable way for an institution of the size and scope of the EBRD. (When fully disbursed, EBRD assets will total about USDollars 12bn. The World Bank total is nearly Dollars 140bn, while Dai-Ichi-Kangyo, the largest bank in the world, holds more than Dollars 450bn]) Only through structuring and investing in private sector projects can the EBRD simultaneously help to attract more foreign investors, finance infrastructure, formulate policy, and develop institutions and a viable legal framework. Such issues as policy formulation, in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, can be dealt with only through concrete examples of live projects that will lead to Bank financing. And unless such issues are resolved as part of a concrete project, they simply result in theoretical discussions. To question this approach, and suggest that the EBRD be organised by countries, with a country or sector strategy determining what the Bank does, seems reasonable. But it is not. The private sector and the market work in their own way to allocate resources and reward risk and entrepreneurship. Communist countries allocated resources through a central plan based on country and sector strategies. This didn't work for them, so why should it work for the EBRD?

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Galina Gridneva and Aleksandr </F> Kharchenko]    [Text] Dushanbe March 9 TASS -- Viktor Repin, a serviceman  of the collective peacekeeping force stationed in Tajikistan,  fell victim to unidentified gunmen.    Private Repin was on duty at a checkpoint of the 191st  Motorised Rifle Regiment of the 201st Motorised Rifle Division  stationed in Kurgan-Tyube when he was killed at 19.30 on Tuesday  by gunmen from a passing car which fled to an unknown  destination. An investigation was launched, Colonel-General  Boris Pyankov, commander of the collective peacekeeping force in  Tajikistan, told ITAR-TASS on Wednesday.    Commenting on the tragic incident, the general said the  crime  was committed by forces that seek to set the peacekeeping force  and the people of Tajikistan at loggerheads, to destabilise the  situation in the republic and provoke an armed conflict.    Way back in autumn and winter, military experts had  predicted  an increased activity of various terrorist sabotage groups on  the republic's territory, pointing out that those groups would  srping into still greater activity both inside Tajikistan and on  the Tajik-Afghan border as the warm season arrives, Pyankov  said. The commander made it clear unambiguously that most  resolute measures would be taken to ensure the safety of  peacekeepers.    Touching upon the operational situation in the border areas  of Tajikistan and on the Tajik-Afghan border, Pyankov said it  remains complex. Unidentified gunners killed a local resident  in Panj district in southern Tajikistan on March 8. The  Navrangan post and the 13th picket of the Moskovskiy  border-guarding detachment were fired upon on Tuesday afternoon  from a mortar and recoilless rifles on afghan territory. The  foe's weapon emplacements were later neutralised. There were no  losses among Russian border guards.</p>

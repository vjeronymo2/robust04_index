			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TYPICAL CLIENT IS 44, MALE AND A VICTIM OF MERGER  </P> <P> The average outplaced executive is a 44-year-old man who has been working for a  company more than 10 years and has an annual salary of about $70,582.  Typically, he is laid off as a result of a merger, acquisition or corporate  cost-cutting measures.  </P> <P> It takes about five months for the average outplaced executive to find a new  job, but he will probably benefit from the fact that average severance pay  lasts just over six months, according to a survey last year of nearly 900  clients by Drake Beam Morin, a career management and outplacement firm  considered one of the founding companies in the industry.  </P> <P> Out-of-work executives were younger, higher salaried and quicker to find jobs  than they had been in the last seven years, according to the survey.  </P> <P> The number of women clients, although still in the minority, increased  slightly, from 11% to 13%, reflecting an increased number of women in middle  management, the survey said.  </P> <P> Before losing their jobs, 25% of the people surveyed were general-management  types, followed closely by corporate staff members (such as accountants and  lawyers) and employees in finance, accounting, marketing and sales.  </P> <P> A good portion -- 38% -- found higher paying jobs, 36% took a cut in salary and  26% reported no change in their salaries.

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / Travel: Adrift in bliss between sea, sky and land - Kayaking off the coast of Maine Among Yankee New Englanders, a tribe generally known for its taciturnity, the people of Maine are supposed to be the most taciturn of all. Bemused contemplation of 'outta-state folks' is said to be their pleasure, the monosyllabic response their forte - 'Nope . . .', or 'Yup . . .' are supposed to be just about all a Down-easter feels inclined to say at any one time. But it was not that way at the Bailey Island General Store when I walked in one afternoon. Bailey Island sits at the end of a narrow finger of land - one of several collectively known as The Harpswells - that stick far out into Casco Bay north of Portland. It is hardly a major attraction. It has none of the summer mass tourism of Old Orchard Beach further down the coast, none of the moneyed, old-family cachet of Bar Harbour further up the coast. It is a hardy rural community, spread out along a treed and rocky coastline, that lives primarily by lobstering. Endless backwoods colloquy, however, appears to come a close second. I sat at the counter in the general store long after the blueberry muffins and coffee I had ordered were finished. It was not the community notice-board (Ed's Trucking - you call, we haul) that kept me lingering. Neither was it the pot-bellied wood stove, extinguished since last winter, nor the rack where general store habitues kept their own name-labeled coffee mugs. It was the habitues themselves, a clutch of flannel-shirted, baseball-hatted duffers gathered in favourite chairs at the end of the counter. I had never heard crustier, longer-winded griping in my life. Nothing was right with the world. The lobster season had gone all to hell, volunteered one coffee drinker. This was worth an emotional 20 minutes moaning. Hunting was not what it used to be, someone else threw in, and that was good for a 10-minute whinge. Something had got into the pumpkins this year, cackled a third, and they all got going on the woeful state of vegetable gardening. The local economy drew no less cynical a reaction: 'Well of course they can say the recession is over. Your cat can have kittens in the oven and you can say they're biscuits, but it don't necessarily make 'em so.' On and on it went. The baseball strike, the weather, the price of plywood, those damn-fool environmentalists from Washington. Life in Maine of late, it was roundly concluded with a Great North Woods flourish, was hardly worth a raccoon dropping. I was about to step out convinced there was nothing at all that Mainers could discuss happily, when someone brought up the subject of a recent canoe trip he had taken. Almost instantly the atmosphere changed - there were smiles, good natured anecdotes, discussions of the best routes, the best techniques, the best camping sites. Suddenly happy days had returned. I left feeling intrigued: if canoeing in Maine was something that could make this crowd happy, then it was something worth investigating. Not five minutes away, at the foot of the stone bridge leading on to Bailey Island, I was brought to a halt. Sitting on a wharf overlooking the wind-ruffled water of Harpswell Sound were a rack of brightly-coloured, strange looking craft. They seemed an odd mix between canoe and whitewater kayak. Where a canoe is high and open they were low and decked; where a kayak is short and stubby, they were long and narrow. They were in fact, sea kayaks, one of the most elegant and graceful one-man ocean craft around. I fell for them instantly. This was better even than plain canoeing. In five minutes I had introduced myself to Jeff Cooper, owner of the kayaks and proprietor of H20 Outfitters. Not only did we agree to meet for a bite that evening, but also arranged a day of sea kayaking. In The Happy Isles of Oceana - Paddling the Pacific Paul Theroux recounts an island-hopping trip he took from Australia across the Pacific to New Zealand, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, Tahiti, the Marquesas Islands, Easter Island and Hawaii. Accompanying him were two large canvas sacks - the separate halves of the sea kayak he assembled wherever the whim took him. And it took him often: the trip was something of an escape from an unhappy part of his life, the paddling a sort of therapy. There was nothing unhappy about Cooper - there is a constant twinkle of humour in his eye. Nor did he feel the need to escape quite as far as the south Pacific. But as he told me that evening over a swordfish and scallop dinner with his wife Cathy, Maine is his escape and sea kayaking his life. For beauty and enjoyment he is not even sure that he would trade the Pacific for the rock and pine-covered coast of northern New England. After 11 years here, Cooper cannot imagine returning to urban Pennsylvania. 'Old college friends sometimes call me up,' he laughed. 'They have MBAs, big businesses, big cars, big stress. I have some canoes and a big white Pyrenean dog. We are so different now it is hard to have a normal conversation. I teach sea kayaking, Cathy teaches canoeing and skiing for LL Bean's Discovery programme. It is not hard to fall for outdoors Maine; you'll see tomorrow.' I sat up that night on the porch of the ancient Driftwood Inn, a wonderfully unfashionable place of creaky floorboards and rusty bathtub water, imagining my own escape to a fishing community on the coast of Maine. Below the inn, the tide swirled and gurgled as it began its 12ft climb up the rough granite sides of Bailey Island. A night bird hooted from the spruce woods across a stretch of water. The moon rose. Miles out to sea, steaming south to Portland from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, the ferry-boat Bay of Fundy slipped away in a dim twinkle of lights. It would certainly be a different way to look at life I thought as, bed-bound, I too slipped away. But the best way to look at life in this part of the world, I realised a few hours later, is from out at sea, in a low-riding, swell-hugging kayak. With a small group I spent the morning in calm water near the wharf learning basic sea-kayaking techniques: the double-ended paddle, the knee-squeezing narrowness of the hull, the awkwardness of entry and exit, the closeness to the water surface - all took some getting used to. So, too, did the fluid, hip-swivelling paddling motion that Cooper made look so easy; on prolonged sea-kayaking trips it is this graceful movement that saves vital energy and wear and tear on arms. By lunchtime though, with several capsizings behind us, we all felt confident enough to propel our craft under the stone bridge against a rising tide, through a set of narrows, and out into the open water. It was a soft, hazy day, the kind on which the sun is barely discernible and the precise line between sea and sky disappears. There was no wind and the air was warm, but an occasional, inexpert dipping of my fingers below the water reminded me that this was no south sea - far from the Gulf Stream, Maine coastal waters remain cold all year. Along the rocks, large herring gulls swooped in and out from stony perches over the water. Cormorants dived, disappeared, shot up unexpectedly and dived again. On the way out to Pond Island, running a course among a thousand bobbing lobster buoys, we were joined by a party of seals; curious enough to stop robbing bait from the lobster pots below, they followed us for a mile or so. How much nicer to be out here looking in, I though as we paddled silently past the Driftwood Inn. Houses, forests, rocky promontories and deep coves came and went, all the more attractive for the broad seascape they sat behind. Closer in, I drifted to that restless place where water meets land, surging in among the swirling kelp, feeling the pull of the swell on the rocks. Exhilarated, I found myself gulping down great lungfuls of air and wishing it would never end. Real sea-kayakers pack their craft with water, food and camping gear and disappear for days at a time. I had done just one circuit of one small island. But there is nothing, I decided, like seeing life from barnacle level. Given the chance that afternoon of paddling a few more of the happy isles of Maine I could have had just one answer. 'Yup.' There are a number of companies that will rent sea-kayaks along the Maine coast with few questions asked. Sea conditions often change rapidly, however, and extreme caution is required; novices are advised to take basic instruction.

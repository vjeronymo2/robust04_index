			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Media Futures: Now in glorious . . . - High-tech stirrings in the world of cinema The cluster of cinemas around Lincoln Center Plaza on the upper west side of Manhattan has long been a mecca for New York film buffs, but next month it will acquire an added attraction when Sony opens a complex of futuristic cinemas. The Lincoln Center cinemas will include 12 different theatres where audiences will be able to choose from a wide range of movie technologies, ranging from interactive films to high-definition movies and the gigantic images of an IMAX screen. Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company which became a force in the film business five years ago by buying Columbia Pictures, sees the Lincoln Center as an experiment to determine whether there really is a market for high-tech alternatives to the two-dimensional film images that have for decades been flashed across cinema screens. Almost all the 'new' movie technologies on show at the Lincoln Center can already be seen at theme parks, virtual reality arcades and independent cinemas. Yet Sony's initiative is one of the first significant investments by a major entertainment group in innovative forms of cinema. The success or failure of the Lincoln Center experiment is certain to influence the way that Sony - and its competitors - show films to the public in future. One of the ironies of the entertainment industry is that, despite the mega-budgets and visual techno-tricks of modern Hollywood, movies have been shot on almost the same type of 35mm plastic film (at a standard speed of 24 frames per second) since the invention of the talkies in the 1920s. The last wave of experimentation came in the 1950s when the cinema faced the first onslaught of competition from television. It was then that the industry invested in innovations such as stereo sound, giant Cinerama images that required the use of no fewer than three cameras, and Smell-O-Vision, where the movie-going experience was 'enhanced' by appropriate scents pumped into the cinema. Stereo sound has survived into the 1990s, but Smell-O-Vision faded away along with other short-lived 1950s crazes. The major Hollywood studios have since reverted to traditional methods of movie-making, leaving experimentation to a handful of techno-aware entrepreneurs. George Lucas, director of Star Wars, and Doug Trumbull, a Hollywood special effects expert who worked on 2001: ASpace Odyssey and Bladerunner, developed different forms of 'motion simulation' cinema in the 1980s. Their techniques enable the audience to experience the action of the movie because of the speed at which the film was shot and the way the cinema seats move in sequence with the plot. More recently, a pair of New York technology buffs, Bob Bejan and Bill Franzblau, developed a method for making interactive films whereby the viewer determines the course of the plot. The main constraint on the development of these new technologies has been shortage of product. It is extremely difficult - in some cases impossible - to transfer movie footage shot by one method on to a different type of film. As a result, most film-makers have played safe by sticking to traditional 35mm film, even if they have been tempted by the creative potential of the new technologies. Similarly, cinema owners have been reluctant to equip their theatres for showing new types of film because the choice of movies is so limited. Some new technologies have found a home in theme parks, notably George Lucas's version of motion simulation which he devised for the Star Tours ride at Walt Disney's Disneyland park in California. Others have been restricted to specialist theatres such as IMAX, which significantly enlarges the frame size by using 70mm film and is shown at a handful of specially-equipped cinemas, including La Geode at the Parc de la Villette science complex near Paris. There are now signs that the market for more innovative types of film is expanding. The level of audience interest has increased steadily in recent years with the emergence of the new generation of young computer-literate consumers who are accustomed to encountering technology in other leisure interests, notably in theme parks or video games. As a result, the old breed of techno-entrepreneurs have been able to expand their activities. Showscan, the Los Angeles company which owns the rights to Doug Trumbull's motion simulation films, now has 10 theatres in North America. It opened its first one in Europe this summer (after years of licensing its concept to European cinema owners) at the Trocadero in London, and is now considering plans to open other theatres in Europe. Meanwhile, the convergence of the film industry with other sectors such as leisure and electronics means that the new generation of entertainment groups has a vested interest in experimenting with high-tech methods of movie-making for use in their theme parks and theatres. Disney has invested heavily in new technology to develop concepts for its parks. Time Warner is following suit, as is Sony, which recently set up a new subsidiary, Sony Retail Entertainment, to launch a series of theme parks, or entertainment centres, as showcases for all its products, including techno-toys, music and movies. The opening of Sony's new Lincoln Center cinema complex forms part of that strategy. Sony's research teams have been working in the cinema field, and plan early next year to screen at Lincoln Center a high-definition movie that they have adapted from 35mm film. Sony is also liaising with independents in the movie technology field, notably with Interfilm, the interactive film-making company founded by Bob Bejan and Bill Franzblau, with which it has negotiated a production deal. 'We're still at an early stage in this field', said Peter Newcombe of Sony in New York. 'We're not sure how the audience will react to our new theatres at the Lincoln Center. But if it's a smash, we'll certainly consider opening more of them.'</p>

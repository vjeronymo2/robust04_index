			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / IBM in health cash fiasco: Conflicts of interest blamed for waste of Pounds 20m in computer project A MEMBER of Wessex Regional Health Authority, who was also a director of International Business Machines, promoted his company's bid for an information technology contract with the authority, the Commons public accounts committee was told yesterday. Mr John Bourn, comptroller and auditor-general, identified serious failings in financial and management controls and conflicts of interest in fresh reports on the mishandling of computerisation in Wessex region during the 1980s. Mr Robert Sheldon, the committee's chairman, described the events set out in the reports as a 'truly horrifying story'. At least Pounds 43m was spent on computer projects and Mr Ken Jarrold, who became general manager in 1990, yesterday told the committee that Pounds 20m or more of this had been wasted. Mr Jarrold said it was 'very difficult indeed to justify the events' and said a series of conflicts of interest had been at the heart of them. An Andersen Consulting/IBM consortium was a successful bidder for one of the Wessex contracts. A member of the health authority who was a director of corporate services at IBM had promoted the bid, says the report. The report says the Andersen/IBM contract was approved at an inquorate meeting of Wessex's information group. Authority members were not formally informed that the contract had been awarded until after it had been signed. Wessex, says the report, employed Andersen Consulting as adviser to a selection panel while the company was bidding for the main contract. Andersen representatives attended several meetings at which the merits of competitors' systems were discussed and, although officers of the authority took exception to the apparent conflict of interest, no remedial action was taken. Mr Bourn's report says four people, including two former senior employees of the region, face charges of conspiracy to defraud as a result of other Wessex computer contracts.</p>

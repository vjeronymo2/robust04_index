			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Capital Markets: First-term losses down sharply at DnB DEN NORSKE Bank, Norway's biggest commercial bank, yesterday reported a sharp fall in first-quarter net losses to NKr138m (Dollars 20.5m) from NKr601m, but warned that the persistent high level of credit losses and non-performing loans made it far too early to declare an end to Norway's six-year banking crisis. Group net interest income rose by NKr91m to NKr1.23bn as other operating income - from the share portfolio, foreign exchange and other financial dealings - increased by NKr413m to NKr958m. DnB accumulated NKr245m in unrealised gains in the first quarter which were not included in the accounts. The gains came from an increase in the value of its share and bond portfolios - NKr137m for shares and NKr107m for bonds  -resulting from declining interest rates. 'The improvement in performance is thus greater than what appears in the accounts,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, chief executive. Group operating profit, before losses on loans and guarantees and write-downs on assets, shot up by NKr591m to NKr1.06bn. Losses on loans and guarantees increased by NKr153m to NKr1.17bn as the non-performing loan portfolio has risen by NKr484m to NKr12.07bn since the end of last year. Loan losses at the London subsidiary remain high - up from NKr66m to NKr123m for the quarter - and significantly impacted the level of overall group credit losses. The shipping loan portfolio had specified loan losses of NKr53m, against NKr84m last year, but accounted for more than 50 per cent of unspecified group loan losses of NKr170m. Group operating expenses were cut by NKr88m to NKr1.132bn year-on-year. 'We have achieved a steady reduction of costs each year since 1988,' Mr Hvistendahl pointed out. He said 121 full-time jobs had been cut in the first quarter while staff had been reduced by 37 per cent in the last five years to 6,185 at end-March.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 13 (YONHAP) -- The vice chairman of  China's Political Consultative Conference, Wu Xueqian, said  Wednesday that Beijing respects Pyongyang's independence and has  limited influence over its neighbor.    Meeting the press at the Shilla Hotel to wind up his visit  here, Wu said the perception that the North Koreans do what the  Chinese tell them to "is not true."    "We discuss matters of common interest with the North  Koreans  as this is of help to both of us, but it is entirely up to each  side to take action on the basis of such talks," he added.    Asked about the need for U.N. sanctions against North Korea  if it failed to change its policy in spite of the Security  Council president's statement on the nuclear dispute, China's  one-time foreign minister simply stressed the importance of  dialogue. "Nobody can tell how the dispute will develop," he  said.    Touching on North Korea's nuclear capability, he said he  could not make any judgements because he had no information on  its nuclear program.    China and North Korea have maintained a long relationship,  and bilateral economic links have developed rapidly despite  diplomatic normalization between Beijing and Seoul. Wu said,  "We'll keep our relationship with North Korea on the five  principles of peaceful co- existence, equality, reciprocity and  others."    Asked to comment on the issue of revising Chinese school  textbooks describing the Korean war as an invasion by the South,  he said, "I don't know much about it because it's not my area of  responsibility. When I return home I'll check into it with the  Education Ministry and if the need for revision is justified,  I'll see to it that the textbooks are revised."    He refrained from commenting on the Northward invasion  theory, however.    No pressure or sanctions should be used against Pyongyang to  maintain stability and peace on the Korean peninsula, because  such action would only worsen the problem, he said.    "President Kim Yong-sam also shares this view," he added. "I  hope for increased economic cooperation between China and South  Korea as the two economies are mutually complementary."    Asked about North Korean defectors in northeast China, he  said, "There may be such North Koreans but I don't think there  are many of them in China. As far as I know, they have no  influence on Beijing- Pyongyang relations."</p>

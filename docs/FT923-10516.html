			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Indonesian cement group advances 49% SEMEN Gresik, one of Indonesia's largest cement producers, yesterday announced net profits of Rp40.8bn (Dollars 20m) in the six months to June, up 49 per cent on a year earlier. However, brokers warned of depressed earnings in the second half and estimated 1992 net profits at about Rp65bn. The company, in which the government retains a majority stake, went public last year and is undertaking a Rp605bn expansion to lift capacity to 4.1m tonnes per annum by mid-1994 from 1.5m tonnes. Sales for the six months to June fell 2.3 per cent to 669,483 tonnes while operating income fell 13 per cent and operating margins fell to 14 per cent from 17 per cent. At the end of June, Gresik held Rp392bn on time deposit and interest income of Rp51bn for the half-year accounted for 82 per cent of taxable income. Brokers expected time deposits to fall to Rp60bn by year-end as payments for the expansion programme became due. Gresik's share price yesterday was unchanged at Rp5,700, but brokers said it could suffer from the expected flotation next month of Semen Tonasa, a state-owned cement company with a capacity of 1.2m tonnes a year. Plans to float Tonasa in 1990 were postponed after a fall in the Jakarta stock exchange.</p>

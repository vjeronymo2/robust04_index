			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Observer: Cut back The French government's vows to head off the currency speculators took on a sharper tone with finance minister Michel Sapin's radio broadcast following the hoist in the short-term repurchase rates. Although he described the object - to hit speculators 'where it hurts: in their pockets' - as a 'civilised' measure, there was nostalgia in his voice as he commented: 'During the revolution, such people were known as agioteurs and they were beheaded.' As it happens, he does not have all that far to look back. France did not officially abolish capital punishment until 1981, and the last use of the guillotine was on a murderer only four years before. Alas, the name of the last speculator to get the chop remains a mystery.</p>

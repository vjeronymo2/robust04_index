			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Lamont returns to City as Rothschild director MR Norman Lamont, the former chancellor, who was dropped from the cabinet in May, is to take on a job in the City. In a return to his former employer, Mr Lamont will today join NM Rothschild &amp; Sons, the merchant bank, as a non-executive director on the main board while remaining a backbench MP. Mr Lamont worked in asset management at Rothschild between 1968 and 1979 while starting his political career and serving as a Tory backbencher. He left the City in 1979 to become a junior minister in the first Thatcher government. The former chancellor said yesterday he was 'delighted to be going back' to Rothschild. Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, the chairman, expects Mr Lamont to spend two to three days a week working for the bank. Sir Evelyn said he also expected Mr Lamont to have some 'roving commissions' in which he could draw on his 'wide experience of the international scene', his 'experience of government matters' and his many years as a Treasury minister. Neither Sir Evelyn nor Mr Lamont would discuss the former chancellor's future income from Rothschild, although the annual report suggests most non-executive directors earn between Pounds 15,000 and Pounds 30,000. Since leaving the cabinet Mr Lamont has made do with a backbencher's salary of Pounds 30,854 and payments for occasional newspaper articles. As chancellor, he was paid Pounds 63,047, as well as having a 'tied cottage' in the shape of 11 Downing Street and the use of a mansion at Dorneywood, Buckinghamshire, for weekends. Labour yesterday attacked Mr Lamont's appointment. Mr Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said: 'Many of the people who were put out of work by Norman Lamont's policies would have been only too pleased to pick up a part-time job at his rate of pay. 'In fairness to them, he ought to have allowed a more decent interval before taking up this post,' he added. Mr Lamont said he expected to do other jobs, including writing his memoirs.

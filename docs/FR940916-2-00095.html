(Licensee) is the holder of Byproduct License No. 20-20592-01 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission) pursuant to 10 CFR Part 30. The License authorizes the Licensee to use certain stated byproduct materials for research and development as defined in Section 30.4(q) of 10 CFR Part 30. At the time of an NRC inspection in November 1992, Dr. William F. Kusmik was the Radiation Safety Officer at the facility. The License, originally issued on April 20, 1983, was amended in its entirety on March 3, 1993, and was due to expire on March 31, 1994, but has remained in effect since that time due to a timely renewal request made pursuant to 10 CFR 30.37(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On November 10-11, 1992, the NRC performed an inspection at the Licensee's facility in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. During the inspection, the NRC identified numerous violations of NRC requirements. As a result of the inspection findings, a Confirmatory Action Letter was issued to the Licensee on November 12, 1992. The inspector also found indications that information provided by Dr. William F. Kusmik (the Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) at the facility at the time of an NRC inspection in November 1992) in a letter dated September 21, 1992, did not appear to be accurate, and that records of monthly wipe tests at the facility may have been falsified. As a result, an investigation was conducted by the NRC Office of Investigations (0I). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of the 0I investigation, a transcribed enforcement conference was conducted on June 7, 1994, with Dr. Kusmik, to address whether he: (1) deliberately directed a Licensee employee to falsify certain NRC-required wipe test records; and (2) deliberately provided false or misleading information to the NRC in a letter dated September 21, 1992, in response to a previous Notice of Violation (Notice) issued by the NRC on July 29, 1992. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the issue of records falsification, Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that in 1991 he directed an employee to fabricate records of wipe tests for certain months (at a minimum, for November 1990 and February 1991), even though the tests had not been performed for those months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to the information provided in the September 21, 1992 letter sent to the NRC under Dr. Kusmik's signature, Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that he had stated in the letter that certain actions had been taken in response to NRC inspection findings articulated in the July 29, 1992 letter and Notice, when, in fact, those stated actions had not been taken. Specifically, in response to the July 29, 1992 Notice involving the failure to perform surveys of a certain laboratory required to be performed by License Condition 14, the September 21, 1991 letter stated that ``To avoid a repetition of these discrepancies, three individuals within the laboratory have been trained to perform these surveys.'' This statement was not accurate in that Dr. Kusmik stated during the enforcement conference that while he intended to provide such training, no such training subsequent to the July 29, 1992 Notice had been provided at the time Dr. Kusmik signed and sent the September 21, 1992 letter to the NRC. In addition, in response to a concern expressed in the NRC's July 29, 1992 letter transmitting the Notice, involving the licensee's plans to obtain access to a thyroid phantom or some other method to quantitatively determine thyroid uptakes of personnel, the licensee's September 21, 1992 letter stated that ``A calibrated survey meter with a Sodium Iodine [iodide] crystal has been recalibrated for thyroid counting using a thyroid phantom consisting of a plexiglas block approximately three inches thick.'' This statement was not accurate in that Dr. Kusmik admitted during the enforcement conference that the sodium iodide crystal had not been recalibrated at the time he had signed and sent the letter to the NRC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above, the NRC has concluded that in 1991, Dr. Kusmik caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a). Specifically, Dr. Kusmik deliberately directed an employee to fabricate records, required to be maintained by the License, of wipe tests for certain months (at a minimum, for November 1990 and February 1991), even though the tests had not been performed during those months. In addition, on September 21, 1992, Dr Kusmik violated 10 CFR 30.10(a) by engaging in deliberate misconduct that caused the Licensee to be in violation of 10 CFR 30.9(a). Specifically, Dr. Kusmik deliberately submitted to the NRC false information in the September 21, 1992 letter in which he stated that: (1) three individuals within the laboratory had been trained to perform surveys; and (2) a calibrated survey meter with a Sodium Iodide crystal had been recalibrated for thyroid counting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result, the NRC has serious concerns regarding Dr. Kusmik's performance and supervision of NRC-licensed activities, and in particular, the supervision of such activities. The actions of Dr. Kusmik, described above, were particularly serious since, as the RSO at the facility, Dr. Kusmik was charged with ensuring that Licensee staff adhered to requirements and performed activities in a safe manner. Rather than properly discharging those responsibilities, Dr. Kusmik set an unacceptable example for the individuals to whom he gave direction, as well as to others engaged in NRC-licensed activities at the facility. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

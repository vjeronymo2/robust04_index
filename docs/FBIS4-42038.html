			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS freelance correspondent Anatoliy Khologyuk] </F>   [Text] Tiraspol, 30 Jun (TASS) -- The special state of  affairs in the Dniester republic has been extended from 1 July  through 31 August this year. This was made public in a decree  by Dniester President Igor Smirnov which was broadcast on  Dniester republic radio on Wednesday [29 June] evening. The  main motives for extending the special state of affairs, it  states in the decree, are to help the militia wage the organized  struggle against crime and to preserve the state system of the  Dniester-Moldovan republic.    Ivan Fuchidzhi, acting minister of internal affairs of the  Dniester republic, was in favor of the special state of affairs  being extended in the region. He reported to the ITAR-TASS  correspondent that the special state of affairs will help the  militia bodies to purposefully wage the organized struggle  against crime in the region that has been stepped up of late  both in Tiraspol and other regions.</p>

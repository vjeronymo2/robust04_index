			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH GYM IN A FIGHT FOR SURVIVAL;  </P> <P> AUSTERITY: AN OXNARD BOXING CENTER IN A WORKING-CLASS NEIGHBORHOOD COULD BE THE  VICTIM OF CITY BUDGET CUTS.  </P> <P> From the outside, La Colonia Youth Boxing Center in Oxnard doesn't look like  much. But the single-story, stucco building on First Street in the heart of La  Colonia, a gritty, working-class neighborhood with one of the city's highest  crime rates, is bursting with energy.  </P> <P> On any given day the gym is crammed with up to 50 sweaty youths, beating on  punching bags, skipping rope, shadowboxing and sparring with one another.  </P> <P> The gym is so popular with the neighborhood's mostly Latino boys that Martin  Noriega, the gym's director, said he regularly turns away young boxing hopefuls  who are willing to pay the $3-a-month fee to join the gym.  </P> <P> "Right now we are understaffed so we can't take any more," said Noriega, who  runs the gym with the help of trainer Eduardo Garcia.  </P> <P> Because of a city budget crunch, city officials said they cannot afford to  expand the gym or hire more trainers. In fact, the gym, which operates on an  annual budget of about $50,000, is on a list of city services that the City  Council will consider for budget cuts in June.  </P> <P> "The city's resources are such that we are unable to expand the gym," said  Parks and Recreation Director Gary Davis. "It's a wonderful program. It is well  received and they have produced some good boxers."  </P> <P> In order to help balance an anticipated $1.8-million deficit in the 1990-91  budget, the City Council will consider about $500,000 in cuts from the Parks  and Recreation budget alone, he said. The list of potential budget cuts also  includes the Carnegie Art Museum, which costs the city about $175,000 to  operate annually.  </P> <P> Last year, city officials discovered that estimates of revenue for the 1988-89  fiscal year were about $2 million too high. It was also disclosed that the city  had exceeded its 1988-89 budget by $850,000.  </P> <P> Davis said the gym's budget pays for the maintenance of the building and the  salaries of Noriega and Garcia.  </P> <P> Noriega said he fears the gym will be the first cut on the council's budget  chopping block.  </P> <P> "If they eliminate this they are going to take away from the area where it is  needed the most," Noriega said.  </P> <P> The gym's equipment, including three speed bags, several heavy punching bags  and a time-worn ring, were purchased with money the boxers earned at  fund-raisers and monthly boxing shows at the Oxnard Elks Lodge, Noriega said.  </P> <P> Morale at the gym suffered another blow last week, when four of the gym's top  boxers were forced to cancel plans to compete in the regional Golden Gloves  boxing tournament in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Noriega, who has taken a team of boxers to the tournament each year for the  past five years, is recovering from back surgery and was unable to drive the  team to the fights.  </P> <P> Last year, when Noriega took four boxers to the tournament, all four won the  championships in their weight division, he said. One boxer won the state title  in the 132-pound category, he said.  </P> <P> "So, yeah, the boxers were disappointed," said Noriega, who learned to box as a  youngster, but never competed as an amateur or a professional.  </P> <P> Boxers between the ages of 8 and 16 are allowed in the gym between 4 and 5:30  p.m. Boxers over 16 use the gym after 5:30 p.m.  </P> <P> During a recent visit to the gym, the walls were lined with young men doing  jumping jacks and stretching exercises, while others worked out with jump ropes  and speed bags. The smell of sweat and the sound of boys pounding punching bags  and skipping rope filled the room.  </P> <P> Inside the ring, two young boys wearing large red gloves and head gear traded  jabs while several older boxers looked on and shouted encouragement. The boys  fought furiously and then listened to instructions from Noriega and Garcia  between rounds.  </P> <P> Twelve-year-old Fernando Chavez said he spends every afternoon in the gym  working on his boxing skills in hopes of some day becoming a world champion.  </P> <P> Aside from learning how to throw an effective uppercut and a stinging jab,  Fernando said he has learned "how to get along with others and how to be able  to follow instructions."  </P> <P> Fernando said that if it was not for the gym he would be "sitting at home,  watching TV and falling asleep."  </P> <P> Rolando Reyes, 11, said he has attended the gym for three years and hopes to  follow in the footsteps of his hero, Julio Cesar Chavez, an undefeated Mexican  boxer who has been champion in three weight classes since 1984.  </P> <P> Rolando said that since he became a regular at the gym he no longer eats candy  and other junk food.  </P> <P> "I learned how to get in shape," he said.  </P> <P> Noriega said his biggest challenge is trying to provide each young boxer with  some personal instruction and encouragement.  </P> <P> "I've got a lot of kids that because we could not give them attention they get  discouraged and leave," he said. "I see them on the streets later."  </P> <P> Garcia, whose two sons, Robert, 15, and Daniel, 23, learned to box at La  Colonia gym, agreed. "There are kids that if they had more attention would go  much further," he said.  </P> <P> Daniel Garcia, who began boxing at the gym when it first opened 11 years ago,  said he became a professional boxer at the age of 17 and now has a record of 14  victories and four defeats.  </P> <P> Garcia, who still trains at La Colonia with his father and brother, said he  doesn't mind the overcrowding at the gym but believes many of the boys could  become good professional boxers if they had more supervision.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of kids here that have a possibility of making it," he said.  </P></p>

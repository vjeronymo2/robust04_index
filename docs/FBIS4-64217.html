			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- During his visit to Bonn today, Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev presented plans for a major  foreign ministers' conference on Bosnia and underlined Moscow's  readiness for cooperation on the basis of partnership. After an  exchange of views with Klaus Kinkel, which lasted for  approximately three hours, Kozyrev left it open whether the  parties to the conflict should participate in the conference.  On the other hand, however, he stated that a comprehensive  cease-fire agreement should be concluded with the parties to the  conflict at this meeting "in the near future," and that a  political solution should be initiated.    Apart from the United States and Russia, France, Great  Britain, the United Nations, and the "troika" of the three  leading members of the European Union, Belgium, Greece, and  Germany will probably participate in the conference. Kozyrev  arrived in Germany after holding talks in Geneva and Paris.    After a working lunch at the government's guest house in  Petersberg near Bonn, Kinkel expressed the hope that the  conference would be held "in the near future." Russia must  continue be involved in the peace efforts and exert influence on  the Serbian side. It must be clear that "aggression is not  rewarded." Referring to the state visit by President Boris  Yeltsin in two weeks' time, Kinkel spoke of "untroubled and good  relations."    Kozyrev expressed satisfaction with the West, stressing that  military intervention should only be the very last resort.  There are also limits for the Serbs that must not be exceeded.  One such limit was the shelling of the hospital of Gorazde.  Officials close to the Russian foreign minister openly warned  against attacking the Serbs because this might "mobilize an  entire people."    The first step of the proposed foreign ministers' conference  will be the determination of safety zones in Bosnia. After this  measure, the next political solutions must be specifically  initiated. Afterward a summit meeting of all parties involved  can be convened, Kozyrev, who has departed for Moscow, stressed.</p>

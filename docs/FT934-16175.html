			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Hagemeyer raises Dollars 120m in private US placement HAGEMEYER, the Dutch-based international trading house, has raised Dollars 120m through a private placement in the US market. The funding, which is thought to be the first private placement by a Dutch company in the US, will be used to help pay for the acquisition of Newey &amp; Eyre, the Birmingham-based electrical distributor. Several foreign companies, mainly from the UK, have flocked to the US private placement market in recent months attracted by the ready availability of long-term funding at relatively favourable rates. US interest rates are at their lowest levels for 18 years. Hagemeyer is issuing Dollars 120m of notes with maturities ranging from five to 12 years, with an average life of eight years. Few UK banks are willing to lend money to corporate borrowers at such long maturities. The notes were priced to pay between 86 basis points and 95 basis points over the corresponding US Treasury bonds, which gives an average borrowing cost of 5.985 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO;  </P> <P> DRUMMER TONY WILLIAMS STICKS WITH RAW TALENT  </P> <P> Drummer Tony Williams is living proof that you don't have to forsake melodies  or a beat to make a new musical statement.  </P> <P> Williams, who plays the City College Theater with his acoustic quintet at 8  p.m. Monday in a show co-presented by KSDS-FM (88.3) and the San Diego Jazz  Festival, uses his raw talent to create within the limits of straight-ahead  jazz.  </P> <P> A child prodigy who was playing drums in Boston clubs with his saxophonist  father before his teens, Williams went to New York to join Jackie McLean's band  when he was only 16. With bassist Ron Carter and pianist Herbie Hancock,  Williams completed the rhythm section that propelled trumpeter Miles Davis  through such seminal '60s albums as "In a Silent Way," "Miles in the Sky" and  "Miles Smiles," albums that marked the birth of the rock/jazz marriage known  today as fusion.  </P> <P> But it was when he left Davis in the late '60s that Williams began to find  himself, melding elements of jazz and rock in a band called Tony Williams  Lifetime with guitarist John McLaughlin and organist Larry Young.  </P> <P> Williams' current band, together since 1985, is loaded with talent: pianist  Mulgrew Miller, trumpeter Wallace Roney, sax man Billy Pierce and bassists Bob  Hurst and Ira Coleman. Miller has been getting praise for his own debut solo  album.  </P> <P> With this band, Williams seems to have found an ideal setting. The music,  composed by Williams, is powered by his crisp stick work: rapidly shifting  layers of rhythms coming from carefully tuned drums that almost give his  playing a melodic quality. His crisp rolls and deft cymbal work have become a  trademark.  </P> <P> The drummer won't say much about the group, which recently released "Angel  Street," its third album.  </P> <P> "I've never had a band like this before. I like trying things that haven't been  tried. . . . The music? I can't put it into words. If you could explain music,  you wouldn't need music."  </P> <P> San Diego marks the halfway point on the band's six-week tour of the United  States and Canada. In August, they'll be playing jazz festivals in Japan.  Tickets for the San Diego show are $12 ($14 at the door), available at all  Ticketmaster locations or from the KSDS studios (234-1062).  </P> <P> The show is the first of what KSDS and the Jazz Festival hope will be a series  of jointly presented summer jazz concerts. Williams will be interviewed on KSDS  at 3 p.m. Monday.  </P> <P> Pianist Henry Butler, who opened a three-week gig at Elario's last night, has  most often been likened to pianist McCoy Tyner. But any similarities in their  percussive attacks are more coincidence than the result of direct influences,  Butler said.  </P> <P> Truth is, Butler's aggressive approach developed quite independently. He began  his musical career as a grammar school drummer, which instilled strong rhythms,  and he grew up in New Orleans, "which probably has more good drummers than any  city its size in this country," he said. 'With that kind of environment, one  almost had to be percussive."  </P> <P> Butler counts pianist Keith Jarrett and saxophone giant John Coltrane among his  influences. He has many talents beyond the piano: Besides singing and  composing, he also takes pictures, all the more impressive because Butler is  blind. "A moron can take a picture," he said. "A dog can do it if he knows  which button to choose with his paw." Butler's photos, though, aren't dogs.  They've been shown around the country to favorable reviews.  </P> <P> In La Jolla, he'll be backed by San Diegans Jim Plank on drums and Bob  Magnusson on bass.  </P> <P> Friday night at the Centro Cultural in Tijuana, two groups of Southern  California musicians will present "Homenaje a Charlie Parker," a memorial to  the pioneering bebopper. One band includes local sax man Charles McPherson,  one-time L.A. Express drummer John Guerin, pianist Frank Strazzeri and  trumpeter Chuck Findley. The other consists of pianist Mel Goot, drummer Carlos  Vasquez, percussionist Armando Rosas, bassist Bill Andrews, Mexican saxophone  player Esteban Favela, San Diegan Bruce Cameron on trumpet and possibly Coral  Thuet on vocals. Consider the event an early birthday party: Parker was born  Aug. 29, 1920.  </P> <P> Guitarists Al DiMeola and Larry Coryell electrified listeners with their fusion  work in the '70s, DiMeola with Chick Corea in Return to Forever, Coryell  leading his own bands, including The Eleventh House. Both are also prodigious  talents on acoustic guitar. On June 21, they join hot young French guitarist  Birelli Lagrene in a "Super Guitar Trio" at the Bacchanal.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Animal Logic, the band put together by bassist Stanley Clarke and former  Police drummer Stewart Copeland, hits the Bacchanal on Monday. . . . KSWV-FM  (102.9), which, with the help of disc jockey Art Good (formerly of KIFM), stole  the Catamaran's Cannibal Bar away from KIFM's Lites Out circuit for its own  Jazz Nite, has added a second club to its promotional lineup: the Full Moon in  Encinitas, which holds its "Moonlight Jazz" nights every Sunday. This week, the  club features the Mark Lessman Band. The Wave thus beats KIFM to the punch with  a club promotion in North County, ripe territory for light-jazz lovers. . . .  Spencer Nilsen, whose "Architects of Change" album is a mainstay of local  contemporary jazz stations, is considering recording an extended dance version  of "Church on Wall St." from the album. . . . New Age band Shadowfax, which  claims to have used more than 150 instruments from all over the world on its  new album, "Folk Songs for a Nuclear Village," plays the Del Mar Fair at 7:30  p.m. Sunday.  </P></p>

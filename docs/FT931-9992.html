			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / International Company News: Snecma says it made loss last year SNECMA, France's state-controlled aero-engine maker, yesterday said it had made a loss for 1992 but did not disclose the size, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. The company blamed the gloomy economic environment and delays in orders for civil and military aircraft. The group was also in the red in 1991, when it fell into a net loss of FFr67.8m (Dollars 12.6m) from net profits of FFr208m in 1990. Its performance has since deteriorated with a fall in sales to around FFr23bn in 1992, against FFr23.9bn in 1991. Snecma also suffered a FFr3bn decline in the value of new orders from the previous year's total of FFr7.3bn. The group has already announced plans to step up its cost-cutting programme. It proposes making additional annual savings of FFr500m by reducing stocks and accelerating its research cycle. These cuts will involve the loss of 650 jobs and 20 days of temporary lay-offs this year. Michelin, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, reported a 1.2 per cent decline in turnover to FFr66.8bn in 1992, from FFr66bn in 1991. The group said it had been affected by sluggish demand and exchange rate changes. Michelin, which returned to the black with net profits of FFr820m in the first half of 1992, against a net loss of FFr1.06bn in the same period of 1991, is already implementing a long-term rationalisation programme.</p>

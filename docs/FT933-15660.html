			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / No figure put on aid to Ireland, says Delors MR Jacques Delors, European Commission president, underlined yesterday that Brussels had not committed itself to any figure in the EC dispute with Ireland over its share of Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.36bn) in regional aid. Ireland at the weekend blocked agreement on rules for the regional programme for 1994-99, holding out for the IPounds 8bn (Pounds 7.7bn) Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds said he was promised at last December's Edinburgh summit. Irish foreign minister Dick Spring is understood to have rejected an offer of IPounds 7.5bn made by Mr Delors at last weekend's meeting of EC foreign ministers, although some senior Commission officials believe even this figure cannot be justified. But at yesterday's weekly meeting of the Commission, Mr Delors said no concrete commitment had been made to Ireland, according to a Commission spokesman. The official said the Commission had discussed the criteria for allocating the regional aid, which would be in the hands of the four commissioners directly concerned, most prominently Mr Bruce Millan, commissioner for regional policy. Mr Millan has been pushing for strict application of the allocation criteria decided at Edinburgh, which weigh factors such as regional income, unemployment and size of population, and which by some Commission calculations would give Ireland not more than IL7bn. Commission officials insisted there had 'been no confrontation, big or small' between Mr Delors and Mr Millan, but said the Commission president was irritated by publication of the figures. Negotiations with Ireland were expected to continue yesterday, with telephone contacts between Mr Reynolds and Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister of Belgium, which currently chairs the EC. Mr Delors is expected to contact Mr Reynolds today or tomorrow. The hope is that the European parliament will accept the framework regulation for the aid package when it meets next week, even though Ireland has affixed a reserve to it. If the parliament does not, it will only come back to it in the autumn, under a lengthy procedure which moreover grants MEPs veto powers. But if parliament does give its approval, efforts will continue to get an agreement with Dublin before foreign ministers meet in Brussels on July 19. This will only be possible if Mr Reynolds can get near his IPounds 8bn without subtracting from funds earmarked for the other poor member states to which the bulk of the aid goes - Spain, Portugal and Greece.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: HOME REMEDIES COULD SOOTHE THE PAIN OF COLD SORES  </P> <P> Question: I get cold sores whenever we go to the beach. They are extremely  painful and the scars last quite a while. My doctor tells me there is no cure.  Is there a home remedy that I could use on my vacation this month?  </P> <P> Answer: Over the years we have received lots of home remedies from readers. We  cannot vouch for any of them, but here they are.  </P> <P> One man swears by buttermilk. He writes, "After suffering for several years I  asked a doctor about treating fever blisters. His reply was not very  encouraging. My pharmacist said to drink buttermilk. I tried it. It's easy and  cheap and it has really cut down on the number of fever blisters I have  suffered."  </P> <P> Another reader suggests douching powder applied to the sore. She says dabbing a  little Massengill or Bo-Car-Al on the blister overnight helps speed healing.  </P> <P> An alternative would be the prescription medicine Zovirax (acyclovir). It is  available as an ointment or in pill form. Although it is not a cure it can also  speed healing or perhaps even prevent an outbreak.  </P> <P> You should also use a lip balm containing an effective sunscreen. This may  eliminate the problem.  </P> <P> Q. My wife and her mother both have high cholesterol. Even eating a very  low-fat diet has done little to lower it.  </P> <P> They both take Dyazide and have for many years. I have read in the paper that  Dyazide can raise cholesterol. How much does it affect cholesterol readings? Is  there a good substitute for Dyazide that does not increase the cholesterol  count?  </P> <P> A. Many people find it difficult to lower cholesterol even with a strict  low-fat diet. Some medicines may compound the problem, though. Thiazide  diuretics such as Dyazide may make it a little harder to achieve the desired  results.  </P> <P> Fortunately, there are other blood pressure medications that are less likely to  raise blood fats. Only your wife's physician can decide which drug is most  appropriate for her.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 5 TASS -- The intergovernmental talks  between the Russian and Czech delegations led by the heads of  two governments, Viktor Chernomyrdin and Vaclav Klaus, ended  here today with the signing of an agreement on encouragement and  mutual protection of investments and a protocol on mutual  supplies of goods in 1994.    After the ceremony of signing these documents, Viktor  Chernomyrdin told journalists that during the talks "we were  very much interested in the reforms which are being conducted in  the Czech Republic, their mechanism and results. We are also  following a path of reform, and I think there are many things we  in Russia can adopt from the Czech experience".    The Russian prime-minister said economic relations between  the two countries are now taking shape on a new, market basis  and stressed that it is necessary to build up trade and economic  ties.    Chernomyrdin expressed satisfaction with the talks and said  that the two delegations also considered the rescheduling of the  Russian debt to the Czech Republic, which Russia has "inherited"  from the former USSR.    "We identified the mechanism of debt repayment and  instructed  experts to prepare the required document for signing before May  30," Chernomyrdin said.    Vaclav Klaus said he was pleased with his talks with the  Russian prime-minister and particularly stressed the solution to  the problem of the Russian indebtedness. He said the new  document, which the two countries are planning to sign soon,  will contain a specific time-table of the debt repayment.    Klaus said that Chernomyrdin and himself also discussed  Czech  investments in the Russian economy.</p>

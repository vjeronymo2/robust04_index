			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE SEARCH FOR THE PERFECT FRIED CHICKEN;  </P> <P> PLUCKED TO ORDER  </P> <P> The enormous plaster rooster on the roof makes it hard to miss Slavko's Harbor  Poultry. The place has been around since 1922 when chickens were sold live,  butchered and plucked to order on the premises. But it wasn't until the '50s,  when competition from supermarkets was squeezing out independent sellers, that  shop owner Slavko Frlekin bought equipment to fry chicken for his customers.  </P> <P> "He didn't like the seasoning that could be purchased with the equipment so he  concocted his own. Dad loved to cook," says present owner, Jim Frlekin, who is  Slavko's son.  </P> <P> Almost as famous as Slavko's chickens are its potato "nuggets." These unpeeled  potato chunks are dusted with Slavko's special seasoning and deep fried to a  turn. Slavko's also sells better-than-average coleslaw and potato salad. The  shop has take-out food only.  </P> <P>  Slavko's Harbor Poultry, 1224 S. Pacific Ave., San Pedro, (213) 832-5723 or  (213) 832-8171. Open Tuesday-Sunday 9 a.m.-6:30 p.m.  </P> <P> LINDA BURUM  </P></p>

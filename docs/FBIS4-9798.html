[Salinas] Mr. Jose Cordoba is a Mexican citizen who has  worked loyally. I am very fond of him and value his services,  experience, and capability as related to economic issues.

[Salinas] I repeat, my message is one of unity,  encouragement, and harmony. [end recording]    Later on, President Salinas was asked about the nomination  of  the new PRI presidential candidate to which he pointed out that  during 1993 Mr. Zedillo had been one of the leading contenders  and that he is an intelligent person committed to democracy and  the legal order.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed Patricia Labiane: ``A `MUST' For Avoiding </F> Water Pollution'']    [Text] Just one storm and everything is overflowing. The  sewers spill out onto the land, the water is full of heavy  metals and hydrocarbons, etc. Heavy rainfall can multiply by up  to 10 times the rate of pollution recorded during periods of dry  weather. Water treatment stations are not capable of handling  pollution exceeding three or four times that for dry weather  conditions and do not perform their regulating role. The MUST  [expansion unknown] project, launched by the Corporation for the  Treatment and Economic Development of Water [OTV], a subsidiary  of the Compagnie Generale des Eaux [CGE], proposes checking the  overflow of waste water after periods of heavy rainfall. The  European scientific research program, EUREKA [European Research  Coordination Agency], found the scheme attractive enough to  award it its European label last June.    The MUST technology will be implemented progressively over  the next four years. Of the 96.6 million French francs [Fr] it  will cost, France will contribute Fr32 million, Fr10 million of  which will come from the Ministries of Industry, Post and  Telecommunications, and Foreign Trade.    The project, which replies to a European directive of May  1991, combines 10 industrial partners from four Community  countries. In addition to OTV from France, project leaders  include the Danish pollution removal systems engineers I.  Kruger, the Finnish chemical reagent producers Kemira Kemwater,  and the British modeling researcher Wallingford Software. OTV,  the European leader in the design and production of water  treatment plants, is the prime contractor, assisted in France by  other CGE subsidiaries: the Anjou Research economic interest  grouping -- which centralizes the group's research work -- and  Cochery-Bourdin-Chausse, specializing in road infrastructures.  <H5>  Precise Statistics </H5>   The project corresponds to a market with local communities  estimated to be worth several hundreds of billions of francs  over the next 20 years, a large share of which should return to  the Compagnie Generale des Eaux. On the practical side of  things, the project will propose ``reservoir highways''  underneath roads to collect rain water, new physical-chemical  settling techniques for treatment plants, a system for storing  the most polluted water before treatment, treatment plant  biofilters that are better suited to respond to large  fluctuations in flow, sensors to inform the plant of the level  of pollution in the water that will be arriving, etc.  <H5>  Computerized Rain </H5>   The project also envisages carrying out a whole series of  statistical studies that will simplify the adaptation of water  treatment equipment. Patrick Binot, OTV's deputy technical  director and head of development, explains: ``For a given  period, a rainfall curve is run through a computer model to  determine the amount of polluting substances released in an  average year by a given network and treatment plant, which can  thus be minimized.'' This gives a whole armory with which to  face up to any rain shower.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mahmud 'Abbas, member of the PLO Executive </F> Committee, by Khalil Abied in Tunis; date not given: "`We Have  To Get Back as Quickly as Possible'"]    [Text] [Abied] Yasir 'Arafat has declared that he will  not go to the autonomous regions as long as the international  community holds back funds that have already been promised. The  financiers say that the PLO has failed to establish the  institutions required for administering the funds.  Palestinians, on the other hand, maintain that the funds are  being used to put pressure on them. What is the truth?    ['Abbas] The Palestinian authorities have to return as  quickly as possible. That will be the touchstone for the  financiers. Once we are in the Gaza Strip and in Jericho, we  will be able to say: Here are our institutions, now, please give  us the money you promised. We will not give them any pretext  for blocking the money.    [Abied] The experiences of the past few months have not been  very encouraging. The talks between the Israelis and the  Palestinians were delayed.    ['Abbas] Both sides have wasted a lot of time. Now the  Palestinian authorities must quickly assume their tasks and  tackle the enormous economic and social problems. And we should  not forget that there are further negotiations to be held with  Israel on the handing over of authorities and the return of  refugees.    [Abied] Why do you not want to take part in the autonomy  administration? Are you annoyed?    ['Abbas] The fact that I was successful in the Oslo talks  does not mean that I have to assume part of the power in the  autonomous regions. The construction of the Palestinian regions  needs young, qualified people. I do not think that I am  suitable for a ministerial office.    [Abied] Does this mean that the existing `revolutionary'  institutions of the PLO and the 'revolutionaries' they contain  are not in a position to cope with the future stages?    ['Abbas] I doubt whether they are up to the complicated  challenges. For establishing a school, constructing roads, or  working out a development plan we need experts that have a  different mentality. It is not shameful for a revolutionary to  admit that he cannot build a state.    [Abied] Do the other Palestinian leaders share this view?    ['Abbas] Many of my comrades-in-arms have refused to  participate in the new Palestinian authorities because they hold  similar views. And several of the new "ministers" have been  quite reluctant to accept their nomination.    [Abied] You said that there will be a Palestinian state  within two years. What makes you so optimistic?    ['Abbas] Until the secret talks were held in Oslo it was  taboo for the Israelis to negotiate with the PLO. For them we  were terrorists. Today there are lively contacts between the  two sides, and there is increasing support in the Israeli  society for the idea of a Palestinian state. For the Israelis,  the most important thing is their security. That is why much  will depend on the capability of the Palestinian authorities to  safeguard this. If the Israelis get the feeling that a  Palestinian state does not threaten them, they will accept it.    [Abied] Is this not prevented by the Palestinian opposition,  especially the Islamic Hamas?    ['Abbas] There are two oppositions. The Syria-based  `Alliance of the Ten Organizations' and the opposition in the  occupied territories. The first makes a lot of noise, but it  does not have any influence. The latter is pragmatic. We have  told them: Why should we destroy the possibility of self-rule  with our own hands? In a few months' time there will be  elections in the autonomous regions. If the majority of  Palestinians speak out against the forces of peace and in favor  of those who want to continue the struggle, then we will respect  this decision.</p>

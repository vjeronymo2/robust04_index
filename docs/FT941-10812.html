			<p>940208 FT  08 FEB 94 / National Insurance rise set for assent Legislation introducing a rise of 1 percentage point in employees' National Insurance contributions cleared the Lords last night and is set to become law. The bill now awaits Royal assent. Viscount Astor, the junior social security minister, earlier told the Lords that the Benefits Agency was considering issuing contributors with annual statements of contributions made and the benefits to which they were entitled. At present people were told only if they had paid insufficient contributions or too many, and notification was often some years later, he said.</p>

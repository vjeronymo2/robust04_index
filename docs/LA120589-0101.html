			<p><P> December 5, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: DEANA SHIVELY:TAKING CHARGE IN THE CLUTCH  </P> <P> Deana Shively was forced to shoulder extra responsibility in Saturday's  Division II state volleyball championship match when La Habra High School  teammate Missy Clements dislocated her knee in the first game.  </P> <P> Shively, an outside hitter and The Times' Athlete of the Week, led her team  with 18 kills as the Highlanders (21-1) defeated Moraga Campolindo, 9-15,  15-10, 4-15, 15-5, 15-7, for their first state volleyball title.  </P> <P> "She was great," La Habra Coach Sandy Blumenthal. "She had to take charge when  Missy was injured, and she kept pulling the team together, convincing them not  to give up, besides picking up the slack."  </P> <P> Said Shively: "It's my senior year and I knew we had to do it. It was my last  game, no matter what."  </P> <P> Shively was named to the all-tournament team and earned all-Freeway League  honors for the second consecutive year.  </P> <P> Shively said she was happy about the state title -- though the Highlanders had  been league champions seven times in the 1980s, they had never won the Southern  Section 3-A title -- but now she has other things on her mind.  </P> <P> Soccer practice began a month ago and her first game is today.  </P> <P> Shively plays left wing on the soccer team and is a long jumper on the track  team.  </P> <P> "I've already missed a (soccer) game," Shively said. "Practice started as soon  as volleyball ended league, but I haven't been able to be there because we went  on (to the playoffs).  </P> <P> "I'm supposed to play in the game (today). I should really be able to walk  Wednesday," she said, laughing.  </P> <P> Shively said she would like to play volleyball in college.  </P> <P> "Volleyball comes easiest to me," she said. "I just love the game. But I wish I  was taller. I don't think I'll grow much more, so I haven't really looked at  any four-year schools."  </P> <P> She said she might attend a community college and transfer to a university.  "I'm not really sure what I'm going to do, but I know I better do it soon," she  said.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Shively has a soccer game to play.  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Lisa Almanza and Ana Kristich of La Habra, both juniors, were named to the  all-tournament team in Saturday's Division II state volleyball championships.  Almanza, a setter, and Kristich, a middle blocker, helped La Habra win its  first state volleyball title.  </P> <P> Sara Bone scored 21 points for El Toro Saturday as the Chargers defeated  University, 69-35, in the Irvine girls' basketball tournament. Teammate Karie  Yoshioka added 19 points, seven assists and seven steals.  </P> <P> Sophomore Keri Phebus, Corona del Mar's No. 1 tennis player, won the Southern  Section singles title for the second consecutive year, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, over  sophomore Anne Mall of Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Karin Schambeck had six aces in La Habra's state championship volleyball  victory Saturday, including eight consecutive points in the fifth game.  </P> <P> Deana Shively  </P> <P> La Habra High School  </P> <P> Position: Outside hitter  </P> <P> Height, Weight, Class: 5-6 1/2, 127, Senior  </P> <P> Last week: Shively had 18 kills in the state Division II volleyball title game.  </P> <P> Season: Shively, the team capain, led La Habra to the Freeway League and the  Southern Section 3-A titles.  </P></p>

Meanwhile, here in Colombia  the controversy that his trip to Japan has sparked is still  growing. Raul Gutierrez has filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Gutierrez] The rounds of applause amazed  President Gaviria in Tokyo shortly before he entered the  university [not specified] to receive an honorary doctoral  degree and when he appeared before approximately 4,000 students  wearing a cap and gown. The president explained here how  Colombia was the only Latin American country that grew during  the so-called lost decade, the 1980's.    He took his message elsewhere later. Bankers and  industrialists told him Colombia's negative image is being  exaggerated. He replied the violence his country is facing will  not destabilize the economy or democracy.    [Gaviria] Foreign investors who have conducted business in  Colombia during the last 30 years, including renowned Japanese  companies, deem Colombia's security problem as an affordable and  manageable risk.    [Gutierrez] Before he attended a meeting with journalists,  he  met with Prime Minister Hosokawa. President Gaviria will meet  with Emperor Akihito on 1 March. [end recording]</p>

The new government (interior) minister [El nuevo ministro de  gobernacion interior] is Danilo Parinello, a former Constituent  Assembly deputy, who said he accepted the post (considered to be  the most difficult in the cabinet) because of his friendship  with President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. He added that even though  he has no experience in the area of security he will carry out  the best possible actions. He announced the creation of an  immediate reaction group to take care of emergencies that may  appear.    Colonel Mario Alfredo Merida was appointed the new deputy  government minister. He has experience in military  intelligence. Former Justice of the Peace Salvador Figueroa was  appointed police director.    The high crime rate is one of the leading problems  confronting the government of Ramiro de Leon Carpio. Some  sectors have pointed out that unemployment and extreme poverty  suffered by the majority of the population are some of the  reasons for the high crime rate.</p>

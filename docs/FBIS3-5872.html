			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] On 1 March, the party Central Committee Secretariat  [PCCS] issued a directive on fighting social evil.    The directive says: The effective preventing and fighting of  social evils -- first of all prostitution and drug addiction --  is currently an urgent task that our party and government must  resolutely carry out with clear success in 1994. The decisive  factors in successfully preventing and fighting social evils are  the acceleration of socioeconomic development, the launching of  public movements, the increasing management of state organs, and  the expansion of the active role of mass organizations under the  leadership of party committees and party organs throughout the  country.    The PCCS requests:    1. All party echelons and organs from the central down to  the grassroots level must consider the work of preventing and  fighting social evils -- first of all prostitution, drug  addiction, and AIDS -- a very important task for 1994.    2. Party echelons and organs must work with local  governments and state organs to outline and execute plans and  programs to prevent and fight social evils in their localities.    3. First of all, a widespread public campaign must be  launched to accelerate propaganda and education on a large scale  to create strong public support for condemning and eliminating  social evils.    4. Grassroots party committees must incorporate the duty  of preventing and fighting social evils, waste, corruption, and  smuggling into their regular work. Party organs must conduct  regular checks on the work and lifestyles of party members in  the family and society. Party members with unhealthy lifestyles  must be quickly educated and prevented from any wrongdoing. If  they commit social offenses, they must be dealt with strictly  according to party discipline and state law. Party members who  are addicted to drugs or involved with prostitution or  debauchery must be expelled from the party.    The PCCS asks provincial, city, and central organ party  committees to execute this directive urgently.</p>

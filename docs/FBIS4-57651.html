			<p>BFN     [Text] Yesterday, Oswaldo Sandoval (NM C-90) [New  Majority-Change 90], CCD [Democratic Constituent Congress]  Foreign Relations Committee chairman, rejected any kind of  deadline or pressure for approving the Lima Conventions signed  between Chile and Peru. The conventions seek to iron out  disagreements derived from the 1929 Treaty. The opposition,  meanwhile, proposed canceling the implementation of the  documents. These comments were made on the occasion of the  first anniversary of the signing of the documents by the  Peruvian and Chilean Governments.    The NM-C90 legislator said talks between the two countries'  foreign ministries aimed at improving the text of the document  have been suspended since the new government took over in Chile.  "We (the committee) are waiting for the Foreign Ministry to  inform us about any possible progress," Sandoval said. He  recalled that the foreign minister told him about a month ago  that talks had been suspended temporarily due to the change in  government in Chile.    Sandoval said the only limitations that can be imposed on an  issue of this nature are those represented by the level of  consensus in the committee, in Congress, or in the population."  [no opening quotation mark as published]    Congressman Julio Dias Palacios (MDI) [Democratic Left  Movement], also a member of the Foreign Relations Committee,  noted he had presented a draft bill to have the diplomatic notes  and decrees on the Lima Convention be declared without effect.  "The government desire to solve the problems derived from the  1929 Treaty must be done within a framework where national  sovereignty comes first, and the agreements included in the  Treaty are respected, as we have been demanding," Palacios  argued.    The legislator said that in practice the process has been  thwarted, as Chile does not accept the observations made in  Peru. "Before we restart the process it would be preferable to  have everything done in the past annulled, so that we can start  negotiating conventions that are favorable to the country,"  Palacios said.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / MoD extracts pledge on VSEL British Aerospace has had to promise the Ministry of Defence that it will not close VSEL's Barrow shipbuilding facility in Cumbria if its takeover bid for the yard is successful, although further redundancies at the yard seem inevitable. The MoD has said that BAe cannot close Barrow without its express consent as part of the agreement to let its bid go ahead. The Barrow yard is the last in the UK which can build big warships such as aircraft carriers and assault ships now that the Swan Hunter yard on the Tyne seems doomed. The MoD and the Royal Navy are insisting that BAe must keep the yard open for national security reasons. However, VSEL, the yard's current owner, has already planned further job cuts at the yard as work on four Trident nuclear missile submarines winds down in 1996-97. Work on the next batch of Trafalgar class nuclear hunter-killer submarines is unlikely to start before 1998. BAe is likely to continue with VSEL's redundancy plan, but because there is relatively little overlap between BAe's and VSEL's businesses few additional redundancies are likely to result if BAe acquires the yard. It is not clear whether further redundancies would be involved were GEC, the other potential bidder, to buy the yard. Both BAe and GEC are likely to argue that bringing the Barrow yard within a larger group is likely to strengthen its chances of winning further work in future years and therefore offers better long-term job prospects than if VSEL remains independent. VSEL had been interested in acquiring Devonport dockyard, which refits nuclear submarines, and BAe may also be interested. Devonport is operated by a management consortium, DML, and it had thought that VSEL might join the consortium to bid for the privatisation of the dockyard. There are strong overlaps between the refitting of nuclear submarines and their original construction. BAe might replace VSEL as a potential member of the consortium to bid for the Devonport privatisation if its attempt to takeover VSEL is successful. Engineers and designers might then work both on Barrow and Devonport dockyards, cutting the total number needed. Initial bids for Devonport have to be logged with the MoD by the end of this month, with final bids submitted next April. GEC is thought to be less interested in Devonport, and may not join the consortium even if it does decide to bid for VSEL. But there may be some rationalisation between the Yarrow and Barrow yards if GEC wins control of VSEL, which could involve further job losses.</p>

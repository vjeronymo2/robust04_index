			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Italy's fight Italy's fiscal policymakers appear to have pulled off another high-wire escape act. In reality, however, the performance has only just begun. The government of Mr Silvio Berlusconi this week agreed spending cuts and revenue increases intended to keep next year's budget deficit to 8 per cent of gross domestic product. The measures fall short of a totally convincing demonstration of Italy's will to put its finances in order. Yet by starting a reform of the country's over-generous health and pensions systems, the Berlusconi government is at last showing signs of the resolve necessary to tackle its most intractable fiscal problems. Mr Berlusconi now has to maintain that effort without provoking further strains on the international financial markets or political and social disruption at home. The fractious Rome coalition has shown unusual unity in reaching a budget accord closely in line with advice from the Italian Treasury. However, the risks have been underlined by the trade unions' call for a one-day general strike next month against cuts in pension entitlements. Unions' quiescence on wages in the past two years has contributed to Italy's much-improved competitiveness. If they now make a determined effort to scupper the pensions reform, the coalition's mettle will be sorely tested. An additional cause for anxiety is that some official assumptions behind the budgetary arithmetic look optimistic. This year's 3 percentage point rise in real interest rates on Italian bonds, now yielding roughly 8 per cent over the inflation rate, reflects investors' nervousness about the high level of Italian debt as well as scepticism about repeated official promises to bring it under control. Italian bond-holders may shudder to recall that only two years ago, when Italy left the European exchange rate mechanism, the previous Ciampi government presented a medium-term plan to reduce the deficit to 4.7 per cent of GDP by 1995. If long-term Italian interest rates stay at the level to which they have risen since the summer, high debt service costs will cast doubt on the government's ability to meet next year's much less ambitious deficit target. Mr Berlusconi owed his March election victory to broad agreement in Italy that the country needed a radical break with past political and economic practices. But the advantage he enjoyed in appearing to offer a fresh start has withered during a summer of inaction, while the danger of a financial crisis has grown. In truth, the Berlusconi government has no option but to tackle fiscal reform - not piecemeal but root and branch. In spite of a level of taxation already well above the OECD average, Italy cannot escape further cuts in government spending and benefits, as well as a significant increase in tax revenues - from improved collection or higher taxes. The recent experience of Ireland or even the UK shows that it is not impossible to achieve a substantial adjustment to a country's fiscal position in a relatively short time. Mr Berlusconi's task is first to convince the electorate that such adjustment is necessary, and then to carry it out in a manner that spreads the pain as equitably as possible. He has taken the first steps in what will be a long and difficult journey. In the meantime, the 4 percentage point differential between yields on lira and D-Mark bonds underlines the gap between the scale of the challenge and the government's perceived ability to master it. Having decided to proceed with the budget, the prime minister must move quickly to bridge that gap.</p>

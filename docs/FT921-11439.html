			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Airlines suffer poor year EUROPE'S airlines suffered their worst setback since the second world war last year under the twin yokes of recession and the Gulf War. The number of passengers fell by more than 7m to 99m, the Association of European Airlines, which represents 22 scheduled carriers, said. This was more than seven times the decline experienced in recessions in the early 1980s and mid-1970s and confirm industry forecasts of grim trading conditions. Only routes to Latin America managed a small improvement in passenger numbers last year. Traffic volume finished the year slightly below the level of 1989. 'Events last year effectively cost the industry two years of growth,' the AEA said. By comparison, in 1986 after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor and the attack on Libya by US aircraft, passenger numbers fell 1.1m in five months. It recovered to previous levels by the end of that year. Air freight also suffered in 1991, with a 2.9 per cent decline in traffic. Steepest losses were on the North Atlantic route. Airlines cut capacity in response to falling demand. But passenger capacity fell by under 2 per cent, less than the decline in demand. This meant that the load factor, the proportion of seats occupied, was 68 per cent, down three percentage points on the previous year. Airlines closely monitor this figure as an indicator of profitability.</p>

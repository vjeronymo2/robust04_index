			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The crisis in Bosnia is becoming increasingly  complicated and packed full of threats. The NATO ultimatum has  provoked a furious Serbian reaction. In Belgrade extremists  such as ultranationalist Vojislav Seselj have even threatened to  bomb Italy and other NATO countries, as well as the blue helmets  deployed in Bosnia.    Defense Minister Fabbri, who telephoned U.S. Defense  Secretary Perry, regards the threats as groundless; thus, the  situation is very tense on the very day that the cease-fire has  come into force in Sarajevo.

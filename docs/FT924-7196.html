			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Foreign property investors calm over tax fears MOST foreign investors in American property are likely to increase or at least maintain their current investment levels, unless there are unfavourable changes to the US tax code this year, according to the Association of Foreign Investors in US Real Estate. Mr James Fetgatter, executive director of the association, said that foreign investors have been alarmed by 'the talk' in the presidential campaign, during which President-elect Bill Clinton said he would raise new revenues by getting foreign businesses to pay 'their fair share'. A survey of the association's 90 or so institutional members found one third planning to raise their investment levels if the tax climate remains favourable. About one third plan to retain current investment levels, and the remainder plan to reduce their levels of investment. The association's members ranked Washington DC as the most likely target of investment. 'The perception is that the city is a stable, solid market due to a captive audience of many law firms, lobbyists, government agencies, diplomats and so on with a steady demand for office space, housing and retail stores,' Mr Fetgatter said. On the list of cities most likely to draw foreign property investors, Atlanta ranked second, followed by San Francisco and Seattle. New York City was a distant fifth. Half of those surveyed said the property market in New York had worsened over the past year. Overall, foreign investors have not much changed their opinions of US property investment in the last year, although 70 per cent said they viewed the outlook for US property investment more negatively than five years ago. Mr Fetgatter said foreign investors were about evenly divided regarding their 1993 investment plans because of the mixed signals about the future of the US economy. Foreign investors became a significant factor in the US market in the early 1980s. Investment accelerated in the mid-1980s and levelled off by 1989. According to the US Commerce Department, foreign investment in US real estate now totals about Dollars 35bn. Members of the Association of Foreign Investors in US Real Estate include : Deutsche Bank Capital Corporation, Olympia and York, Banque Indosuez, Mitsubishi Estate, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Life Realty, the Shell Pension Fund and Philips Pensions Fund.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Hikmet Cicek] </F>   [Text] Ankara -- It has been learned that the Syrian  authorities have rejected a request from Jalal Talabani, leader  of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], and Kemal Burkay,  secretary-general of the Kurdistan Socialist Party [PSK], for a  meeting with the leader of the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party]  Abdullah Ocalan.    According to the available information, Talabani and Burkay  went to the Syrian capital Damascus last week to meet Ocalan.  It was said that Talabani and Burkay were going to propose to  Ocalan to declare a cease-fire on the eve of the local elections  [in Turkey]. Syria's refusal to allow the meeting to take place  opened the way to some speculation.    PUK's representative in Ankara confirmed that Talabani went  to Syria last week and stayed there for "a very brief period."  The representative said that he has no information as to  whether a meeting was held with Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan].    It has been learned that PUK leader Jalal Talabani has now  gone to Saudi Arabia from Syria. It was reported that Saudi  Arabia has extended an official invitation to Talabani. The  meeting with Talabani was interpreted as Saudi Arabia assuming  an active interest in the Kurdish problem.    It has also been learned that Semdin Sakik, PKK's Amed [area  covering Diyarbakir, Bingol, and Mus] provincial commander, has  resigned from his post and left for Germany. It was reported  that Sakik, who had kidney problems, resigned his position  voluntarily and that a new commander has been "appointed" for  Amed. The PKK circles ascribe reports of "differences" between  Sakik and Ocalan to the "psychological warfare" being waged by  the state.</p>

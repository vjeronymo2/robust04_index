			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Move to oust Tajik leader TAJIKISTAN'S cabinet and parliamentary presidium yesterday passed a vote of no-confidence in President Rakhmon Nabiyev, the country's hard-line communist leader, AP reports Dushanbe. Tajik radio and television, which reported the vote, said government and parliament leaders called a parliamentary session tomorrow to decide Mr Nabiyev's fate. Mr Nabiyev was believed to be in a garrison of the former Soviet army in Dushanbe and he reportedly met one representative of the cabinet there yesterday morning. His status as a popularly elected president leaves the legal consequences of the no-confidence vote in doubt. Meanwhile, anti-government protesters who had been holding 35 officials hostage in the presidential palace released all their captives late yesterday.</p>

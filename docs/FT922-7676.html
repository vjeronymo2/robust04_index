			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Special Report On Residential Property (2): Homes for hedonists / A look at the luxurious lifestyle offered by several new developments A ROUND of golf, a few sets of tennis, or perhaps a game of squash, followed by a swim, a massage, a hair-do and a gourmet meal - that is the lifestyle offered at one of England's leading developments; and all without leaving the front gate. The Americans call it a total leisure concept; that is to say, homes that are built within a secure environment with their own gardens but with shared facilities for all the popular leisure activities. The building and running costs of even a swimming pool or tennis court put them beyond the reach of many home buyers; a private golf course is too expensive for most millionaires. The answer, therefore, is communal facilities. Pre-war builders of the golf course and houses at St George's Hill, in Weybridge, certainly had the right idea, but until now very few developers had the courage, or the funds, to build a private golf course for their home buyers. Hubert C Leach, developer of Hanbury Manor, close to Ware, in Hertfordshire, has turned the old manor house (a former convent) into a splendid hotel and leisure club, with views across a lake and 200-acre parkland and golf course. Nearby the company is building mews houses and a number of large Jacobean-style houses, the latter costing form Pounds 500,000; the smaller homes start in price at Pounds 160,000. All buyers receive membership of the leisure club, but those fortunate enough to be able to afford one of the big houses get golf course debenture as well. Not every development has sufficient room for a golf course, but many do have space for swimming and tennis. Cala Homes (South) recently completed Grenehurst Park, close to Dorking, Surrey, is a development of flats within an old mansion and large houses in the grounds. Owners have shared use of many facilities, including an indoor pool, gym and tennis courts. Croudace Homes puts strong emphasis on the 'green' elements within its Richmond Park Heights development, at Kingston Hill, where there are nine acres of woodland and gardens. Focal point is a beautiful 42-foot swimming indoor pool. There are 42 homes costing between Pounds 195,000 and Pounds 248,000. Luxury and leisure should not be available for only the wealthy, however, at least that is the philosophy of Fairbriar Homes and Charles Church, both of which have developments aimed at the less-affluent buyers. Church's flats in Kingsmead, in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, provide a secure inner garden, and a pool and leisure centre. flats, which have views of river and woodland, cost from just under Pounds 55,000 to Pounds 99,950. On an awkward corner site in Purley Fairbriar Homes has built its French Apartments, looking away from the busy main road. There are tranquil gardens, bisected by a stream, and cars are hidden in a covered park giving more space above for a recreation area with a barbecue and a boules pitch. Residents also have shared use of a small gymnasium. Prices of flats at Purley are between Pounds 73,000 and Pounds 128,000.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos today said  that Turkey must stop causing artificial tension. At the same  time Ankara was criticized by European Union [EU] Commissioner  Hans van den Broek.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Nikos Meletis] Government  Spokesman Venizelos today said that the possibility of a  Greek-Turkish summit meeting has not been raised. The spokesman  characteristically stressed there will not be another meeting  like that in Davos, Switzerland.    [Venizelos] Theoretically we have never ruled out such a  possibility, but there are no plans and no specific proposal or  desire for something like that. What is important is that the  cycle of artificial tension must stop.    [Meletis] Venizelos repeated that the only outstanding  difference between Greece and Turkey is over the drawing of the  boundaries on the continental shelf. All other so-called  differences are unilateral Turkish demands and cannot be part of  a dialogue.    At the same time, in Ankara they are thinking seriously  following yesterday's criticism by EU Commissioner Van den  Broek, who made it clear that the deterioration in respect for  human rights and the lack of progress in the Cyprus issue  constitute serious obstacles in EU-Turkey relations. These  statements were made just one day after the Constitutional  Court's decision to dissolve the pro-Kurdish Democratic Party, a  decision which has drawn a lot of reaction.

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NFL TRAINING CAMP ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> DICKERSON'S BAD-MOUTHING OFFENDS COLTS TACKLE CALL  </P> <P> Indianapolis Colts tackle Kevin Call finds teammate Eric Dickerson's talk  offensive.  </P> <P> Dickerson fulfilled his threat to boycott the opening of training camp for  veterans Thursday at Anderson, Ind. The team is considering a five-day notice  that could lead to Dickerson's suspension.  </P> <P> Call, for one, wouldn't mind that a bit.  </P> <P> "From the things that he's said, my personal opinion is we don't need him,"  Call said. "After you bad-mouth somebody like that, what are you going to do  when this guy shows up? How's that going to react with other players."  </P> <P> Dickerson has frequently criticized the offensive line, which includes Call,  saying running behind it is an invitation to injury.  </P> <P> General manager Jim Irsay said Dickerson will be fined $1,500 for each day he  remains absent.  </P> <P> Dickerson has said at various times that he wanted to be traded, planned on  retiring or wanted a raise above the $1.45 million he's scheduled to receive in  1990.  </P> <P> Although the Dallas Cowboys just opened their training camp, Steve Walsh feels  the competition for the starting quarterback job is already over.  </P> <P> Barring injuries, Troy Aikman seems destined to direct the Cowboys' offense.  </P> <P> "I'm excited about the season but the job is definitely not up for grabs,"  Walsh said. "And I don't think there are any prospects for me to be traded this  year."  </P> <P> Walsh quarterbacked the Cowboys to their only victory in 1989, a 13-3 upset of  the Washington Redskins at RFK Stadium. But as soon as Aikman's broken finger  healed, Walsh was back on the bench watching the majority of the Cowboys' 15  losses from the sidelines.  </P> <P> Walsh completed 86 of 173 passes for 1,059 yards in five starts, including a  294-yard performance against Kansas City. However, his five touchdown passes  were overshadowed by nine interceptions and the 11 times he was sacked.  </P> <P> Quarterback Dave Krieg has agreed to terms with the Seattle Seahawks and is  expected to reclaim his starting status.  </P> <P> Krieg, who missed the first eight days of training camp, agreed Thursday to a  four-year contract with an option for a fifth year, Seahawks President Tom  Flores said.  </P> <P> Terms of the contract were not disclosed but Flores said the deal contains  incentive clauses.  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Bengals say they would be interested in signing former  Philadelphia Eagles tackle Kevin Allen, who served a prison term for sexual  assault, if the NFL reinstates Allen.  </P> <P> NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said Thursday that he will decide soon whether  to reinstate Allen, who was released by the Eagles in 1986 shortly before being  convicted of a Labor Day sexual assault against a New Jersey woman.  </P></p>

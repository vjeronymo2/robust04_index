			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Survey of France (4): Maastricht warfare - Policy towards Europe has been quietly modified France's conservative government has quietly modified its policy on Europe, but not on the aims it wants the European Union to pursue. Paris still retains its across-the-board ambitions for Europe to assert itself commercially and culturally in the world - if necessary against the US and Japan - to be the predominant geo-political force in its region of the world; to build something close to a European army that could be deployed independently of the US; and keep alive the possibility of economic and monetary union by the end of the decade. But the French government has shifted its position on how it wants these goals to be fulfilled. Most importantly, it says it wants a less political role for the European Commission, which should remember that it is merely the EU's executive, at the bidding of EU governments whose autonomy in many areas should be better respected in the name of subsidiarity. As Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR gaullists, puts it: 'The Commission should remember that only the Council of Ministers has true political legitimacy'. If that sounds like a phrase out of one of UK prime minister John Major's speeches, it is because the French right has gone through the same debate about Europe as its British counterpart (in a lower key) and it has come to some of the same conclusions. In France's 1992 Maastricht referendum campaign, the Commission became the butt of much anti-Maastricht criticism, and remained so because France accused it of exceeding its negotiating instructions in the Gatt farm trade deal it struck with Washington. If evidence were needed that the Battle of Maastricht is still not over, it was provided last month by the success of Mr Philippe de Villiers and his anti-Maastricht dissident conservatives in winning 13 seats in the European Parliament. If, then, many French would agree with Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, that there is no longer any place for 'philosopher kings' such as Mr Jacques Delors in the Commission, why did the UK end up vetoing the choice of France, Germany and eventually nine other EU countries, to succeed Mr Delors? This row was particularly revealing of the limits to Anglo-French convergence on European policy. While France saw in the Belgian prime minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's avowed federalism the right kind of managerial type to broker the Belgian-style compromises which will be needed to keep an enlarged EU together, Mr Major saw only the trouble the Belgian's avowed federalism could bring him within his own Tory party. But the UK also claimed to want to warn Paris and Bonn that they could not foist their choice on others. For it may be that the logic of France's new European policy will lead Paris and Bonn to step more into the Commission's guiding role. Elsewhere, Paris wants to: Put the Commission on a tighter rein in negotiating trade agreements. However, when it comes to anti-dumping policy, Paris has shown itself happy for the Commission to have a certain leeway from the Council of Ministers, where often a group of 'free traders', such as the UK, the Netherlands and Germany, often block such action; Increase the standing of the EU presidency in the conduct of foreign policy and improve the co-ordination of the policies of the 12 member states through some means other than the Commission. Put some substance into EU foreign policy. This was the aim of the 'conference on stability in Europe', which prime minister Edouard Balladur initiated in Paris in May. Whether it succeeds in getting East European countries to settle ethnic and minority problems by reaching 'good neighbour' accords with each other is open to doubt. Enhance the Western European Union (WEU) organisation as the EU's defence arm. In theory this should be much easier now that the US has agreed that WEU can use Nato assets. In practice, the WEU remains largely a debating society - as France found last month when it sought WEU backing for its humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. Looking ahead to the EU's next constitutional revision in 1996, Mr Alain Lamasoure, France's European affairs minister, has floated an interesting proposal. EU members should all agree to drop, over time, any opt-outs they won at Maastricht, and to restore some uniformity of rights and obligations among EU members. Otherwise, the EU may become unworkable as it gains new members. But the trade-off for countries such as Britain would be formal agreement that no further steps in European integration would be taken for a generation or so.</p>

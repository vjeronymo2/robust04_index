			<p><P> July 31, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: POP/ROCK  </P> <P> More than 50,000 Mozambicans jammed Maputo's National Stadium Sunday for  British rock artist Eric Clapton and African musicians in a concert coinciding  with the final day of a congress of the country's ruling party. Clapton,  heading the bill that included artists from Zaire and South Africa, kept the  crowd on its feet, taking them through his days with Blind Faith and Derek and  the Dominoes as police and soldiers in fatigues patrolled the perimeter of the  stadium. Scores of white South Africans, international aid workers and foreign  embassy officials also attended the concert, which was a stop on the final leg  of Clapton's Southern African tour (he already has played in Botswana, Zimbabwe  and Swaziland).

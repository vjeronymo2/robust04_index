Velasquez, as well as for  President-elect Rafael Caldera, the imposition of price controls  on family basket products comes in response to a public plea.  The fixing of prices on 10 family basket products via price  controls does not imply, in President Ramon J. Velasquez's  opinion, that a step backward will be taken in the process of  modernizing our economy. This measure is an attempt to halt  speculation.    Meanwhile, on this same subject, President-elect Rafael  Caldera said the measure should be temporary, and he explained  that in his government taxes will have to be paid.  Nevertheless, the idea is to get those who have more to pay  more and not for those who have less to pay more.    Asdrubal Batista, economic adviser to Caldera, also  commented  on the VAT and price control issues. For Batista, the VAT is  part of a tax system that unfortunately lacks fairness, and,  therefore, in his opinion, the whole tax system should be  totally reformed.    Here is what President Velasquez said:    [Begin recording] [Velasquez] Speculation has become  widespread and therefore it is the government's duty, as  indicated by law, to take steps necessary to protect the  consumers -- in other words, the majority of the people. In the  coming months, a number of reforms will have to be passed by  parliament. It is not that we will be taking a step backward in  the economy's modernization process. No, not at all -- no one  is thinking such a thing. Venezuela cannot step backward,  because those conditions of fiscal abundance in which everything  was subsidized and everything was protected was a situation of  false harmony that no longer exists. Unfortunately, this  situation no longer exists. [video cuts to interview with  President-elect Rafael Caldera]    [Caldera] We want those who can pay more to pay more, while  not placing a heavy burden on those who have less and, in turn,  can pay less.    [Unidentified reporter] Do you think that this can be done?    [Caldera] There is apparently willingness to implement the  measures necessary to save the fiscal deficit and to orient the  nation's economy. This economy should not be inflationary in  order to allow the necessary stability to develop. [video cuts  to interview with Caldera adviser Asdrubal Batista]    [Batista] It is regretful that currently those who have less  are paying more proportionately than those who have more. This  is what economists call a (?regressive tax) -- that is, an  implicit imbalance in the direct tax collection system. This  situation must be corrected, otherwise problems will occur over  and over again. In short, accounts cannot be paid, expenses  cannot be met, public services deteriorate completely, and the  people feel general dissatisfaction because the state is not  meeting its commitments. There is a law of dimension, and I  think it is as follows: The state must allocate funds for its  expenditures, and at the same time these disbursements must be  permanently and cleanly financed through taxes paid by the  community. [end recording]    All concurred that it is the next parliament that must  assess  the extent of the changes the nation has experienced and take  appropriate action.</p>

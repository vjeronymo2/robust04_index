			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Motherland Party [ANAP] leader Mesut Yilmaz has  declared that linking the U.S. military aid to Turkey to issues  other than security and to certain conditions is unacceptable.  Yilmaz, who is currently in the United States for the World  Forum meetings, began his contacts in Washington. TRT  correspondent Yavuz Yorulmaz reports from Washington:    [Begin Yorulmaz recording] Yilmaz first met with U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher. In a statement after the  20-minute meeting, Yilmaz said that bilateral relations and the  developments in Turkey's region were assessed with Christopher.  Yilmaz reported that during the meeting he emphasized that it is  unacceptable to Turkey to link the military aid to conditions.  Yilmaz said: Relating this subject to matters other than  security -- such as terrorism, against which Turkey is  struggling in a very legitimate way; or the Cyprus problem, a  national issue which Turkey has been following for 20 years --  is an unacceptable situation for Turkey.    Yilmaz said that Christopher, in turn, remarked that the  U.S.  Administration does not find it appropriate to link the military  aid to Turkey to conditions and that it will intervene with  Congress on this matter. Yilmaz noted that he also informed the  U.S. secretary of state that the Turkish public has serious  concerns regarding Poised Hammer and that this concern is  related to Iraq's territorial integrity.    Pointing out that during the meeting he also briefed  Christopher on the work conducted in Turkey with regard to  constitutional amendments, Yilmaz added: I conveyed to  Christopher that it would be extremely wrong to confuse  terrorism with the human rights issue, that the Turkish state  will in no way renounce its legitimate struggle against  terrorism, but that this struggle should not distract us from  certain steps we must take in the area of human rights.    Yilmaz said that during the meeting, he expressed the view  that the U.S. Congress decision to impose an embargo on  Azerbaijan is very unjust and that the U.S. Administration  should adopt a more balanced attitude with regard to the  Azerbaijani-Armenian conflict.    The ANAP leader later met with some members of the U.S.  Congress at a luncheon hosted in his honor by Turkish Ambassador  Nuzhet Kandemir. In a speech at the dinner, Yilmaz stated that  Turkey's importance increased further in the wake of the Cold  War and that Turkey is playing a constructive role in its  region. [end recording]</p>

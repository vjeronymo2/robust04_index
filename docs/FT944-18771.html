			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Fishing: Trout that grew and grew When Darwin landed on the Falkland Islands in 1834 he was unimpressed. Wild cattle roamed a trackless waste otherwise devoid of mammal life. But Darwin was not a fly fisherman. Even if he had been, the meandering estuaries and thin, curling rivers would have stirred no tremors in his casting arm, for the only freshwater fish in the Falklands were two small species of no account. The estuaries were dominated by bulbous-headed, slim-tailed grey mullet which slipped in and out on the tide, not a sportsman's target. Darwin's genius lay in looking back in time, not forward. Even the pioneers of the 1940s, who changed the Falklands fishery, had no idea what their actions would produce. Brown trout eggs were imported from England and Scotland, making the 8,000-mile sea journey in trays of ice. On arrival in sub-Antarctica they were transferred to milk-churns, strapped to horses, and hauled to the interior. There they were put in the sweet waters of the slow-moving, spring-fed rivers. Brown trout are a resilient, adaptive, tough and invasive species. Originally found only in Europe, today's map reflects their colonisation of the rest of the globe. Wherever Europeans went they took fish with them, and there are now naturalised populations as far apart as Japan, New Guinea, Peru and Pakistan. Within 10 years of the brown trout introductions, Falklanders found themselves catching trout which had turned silver and grown immeasurably bigger than their impoverished brethren. The questing brown trout, finding inadequate food in the rivers, which were also prone to dry up and lose essential oxygen, had migrated to estuaries and the sea, where protein-rich krill swarmed. The present record for a Falklands sea trout, winkled on to the bank of the San Carlos river in 1992 by Alison Faulkner, a British angler, is nearly 23lb. Scale analysis showed it to be a remarkable 10 years old and to have spawned at least five times. Sea trout have this advantage over the Atlantic salmon, their rival gamefish: they are better able to recover from the rigours of spawning, they spawn more often and, because the core stock remains in fresh water, they cannot, like salmon, so easily be exploited to the verge of extinction. It is a curious fact of the brown trout's sea-going urge that it principally motivates the female; males stay at home. When the female returns, silver and big and bursting with ova from the tremendous larders in the salt, two or three share a communal nest. The diminutive resident brown male can then fertilise the eggs of several females. Enough biology. The proper concern of all self-respecting Falklands visitors is how to attach this gleaming silver maiden to a fly manipulated by a fishing rod. The answer is, as it should be, with difficulty. The really big fish in any migratory run need special attention. In the Falklands the sea trout run into rivers from January until the end of the fishing season in April. The best fishing month is February. But the big fish tend to run together, towards the end of the season, and waste as little time as possible in freshwater. On the Chartres river, in West Falkland, ghillie Tony Blake said he and Alison Faulkner had seen sea trout so big they could have eaten her record-breaker. Blake is a fishing phenomenon himself. Everything that happens as you fish the pool under his eagle-eye relates to his search for the big fish. A 2lb trout jumped. He said: 'Right. The big fella won't be here. He would have chased that minnow out. Try there.' I did. He was there. Meantime my fishing partner had caught 27 sea trout, averaging 2 1/2 lb, in three hours. Blake particularly likes the story of the American fly-dresser who came to report on which of his 200 flies Falklands sea trout would take. 'How are you getting on?' Blake inquired. 'Badly,' replied the American. 'They take them all.' If the Falklands was situated where the Canaries are, British fishermen would be trampling the grass flat on the banks. As it is, virtually no one goes there. For more information: Go Fishing Canada, Swan Centre, Fishers Lane, London W4 IRX. Tel: 081-742 3700.</p>

			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: So you want a 10% return - Michael Dyson explains how The mail-shot headline offered '10.03% paid annually, free of basic rate of tax, until the year 2000'. Such a promise, together with 'Backing Assets of a Triple A-rated bank' sounded the perfect answer for investors wanting high income from a low-risk investment. Sadly, this insurance 'bond' (as the marketing men insist on calling their products) is linked to the performance of the FT-SE 100 index for determining how much capital is repaid in the year 2000. If the FT-SE 100 growth is 0 per cent a year or negative, investors will lose 75 per cent of their original investment (a loss of almost 15 per cent even if you add back the income received). In order to receive full repayment of your capital, the FT-SE 100 growth must be 4.99 to 9.99 per cent a year. So, is it unrealistic to expect 10 per cent a year and reasonably safe capital? The answer is that it is remarkably easy, and within the reach of most private investors. The plan in the following example can be created through any broker or share shop, and should return 10 per cent a year in addition to a final repayment of around 95 per cent of starting capital. A greater loss could arise, but is unlikely unless markets are about 30 per lower than present levels when you want your income. The only caveats are that you need to have part of your annual capital gains tax allowance (now Pounds 5,800) available each year and take care with bed and breakfasting. Suppose you have Pounds 15,000 to invest. You buy six separate zero dividend preference (ZDP) shares with wind-up dates on consecutive anniversaries (or as close as possible). These shares are issued by split capital investment trusts which have pre-determined wind-up dates on which all the assets are sold and the shareholders repaid. The ZDP investors receive no dividends from the trust but normally have a first charge over the assets up to a pre-determined repayment price, substantially higher than the issue price. So, a capital gain is virtually certain for anyone holding to redemption. The point of the plan is to buy shares with staggered redemption dates which can be redeemed in turn to produce your 'income'. Present tax legislation means that because there are no dividends, there is no income tax liability, although the CGT liability becomes payable on redemption or disposal. Both your annual 'income' and your final return of capital will produce taxable gains, albeit reduced by indexation. Larger holdings will benefit from some prudent bed and breakfasts on the main holding. The number of shares bought should be the amount required to create an annual repayment for the desired 'income' - in this example, Pounds 1,500. One of the investments - the one which is redeemed last - should be large enough to repay 10 per cent plus as much of the original capital as possible. (In our example, you get 97 per cent of your starting capital back but should allow around 2 per cent for expenses). And that is all there is to it. For the purpose of this article, we chose the six shares that best match the described insurance product, but the take-over theory is extremely flexible and can offer many alternative arrangements - such as escalating income, income holidays or a different time scale. In addition, all or part of the plan may be sold before maturity, subject to market conditions). Michael Dyson is a director of BZW Capital Markets.

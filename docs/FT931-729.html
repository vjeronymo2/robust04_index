			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (2): Investors' paradise - The business ethic that sucks in the cash AS RECENTLY as 1980, there was no such thing as a Singaporean computer components industry. Today the island republic is the world's largest manufacturer of computer disk drives, accounting for more than half of world production, and a big supplier of a wide range of other computer peripherals, semiconductors and electronics equipment. In the early 1970s, the textile industry accounted for some 17 per cent of manufacturing employment in Singapore. Now the figure is well below 10 per cent, and declining. These are two examples of the extraordinary swirl of change that continues to invigorate the Singaporean economy. They help to illustrate how a country with no natural resources, a miniscule land area and a static indigenous workforce has managed to carve out its position as a leading competitive player in a number of international industries, from consumer electronics to oil refining and petrochemicals. The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter would have recognised what is happening. Writing in the first half of this century, he called it 'creative destruction' - the process of unremitting innovation and renewal in an economy affected by the free play of market forces. In Singapore's case, the market is the world, and it has exposed itself to - and benefitted from - the full force of international competition by maintaining a stance towards foreign investment as open and unrestrictive as you will find anywhere. Some 3,000 multinationals have operations of some kind on the island, more than 750 of them in manufacturing. Foreign investors are as much as ever the motor of Singapore's development. Initially attracted by its low-wage workforce and by heavy public investment in an ultramodern infrastructure - for two decades investment has represented 35 to 40 per cent of annual gross domestic product, higher than in any other industrialised or industrialising country including Japan - they are constantly encouraged by government to spend on upgrading their plants with the latest technologies. The aim is to create a virtuous circle in which higher labour productivity earns higher wages, and low-wage, labour-intensive businesses either die or move offshore. Singapore is uniquely unsentimental about preserving industries which have lost their competitive edge: the timber business, for example, once a local mainstay, is now virtually extinct, while textile manufacturing on the island has moved inexorably to the high-value end of the market while spinning off low-cost operations to Malaysia and other neighbouring countries. Their place has been taken by productive, technology-driven industries such as consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment and precision engineering. The last 20 years provide countless examples of this shift - as always, under the guiding hand of government bodies such as the Economic Development Board. Having established itself as an oil refining and bunkering centre, Singapore moved into bulk petrochemicals and is now assiduously developing higher-value products such as speciality chemicals and pharmaceuticals. The trick consists not just in attracting new investors: more importantly, it involves encouraging heavy investment by those already installed, so that technology companies such as Texas Instruments that came to Singapore in the early days have repeatedly upgraded their locally-manufactured product mix. And the search goes on: Singapore has remained especially alert to global changes in the consumer electronics industry. It is now positioning itself as an important production base for digital compact cassette players and notebook computers. Mr Philip Yeo, the hyperactive EDB chairman and Singapore's industrial czar, reckons that of every fresh investment dollar that comes to the island, two thirds represents spending by companies already in place. The increasing quality of those investments is evident from the pattern last year. Manufacturing investment commitments reached a record SDollars 3.5 bn, 21 per cent up on 1991, and the prospective yield on those projects, in terms of gross value-added per worker, rose to SDollars 240,175 - more than three times the existing average in the manufacturing sector. This constant drive for higher value-added makes sense given Singapore's severe physical and demographic constraints. It is also getting more urgent all the time in view of the intensifying competition for investment among low-wage Asian economies, which are themselves gradually following Singapore 'up the value chain'. To understand why, compare labour and land costs in Singapore with those elsewhere in the region. The starting wage for a production worker in Singapore is SDollars 630 a month; in Penang, Malaysia, it is SDollars 264; and in Vietnam it is SDollars 80. In Singapore, a square metre of industrial land costs 10 times what it does in Penang and 30 times what it does in Vietnam. Unable to compete on wages, land or on the size of its domestic market, Singapore has quite deliberately priced itself out of the business of low-cost manufacturing; partly for political reasons, the government will not prop up labour-intensive industries by allowing companies to import more foreign workers. Instead, it has been forced to develop alternative attractions to retain the loyalty of its multinational partners. As Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, put it last year in terms that might be a corporate mission statement: 'We must be competitive in combining the whole range of factors and produce a package that is better than what our competitors can offer. This requires hardworking and highly skilled workers, good management and government, a politically secure environment, good physical and social infrastructure. 'It also requires us to be alert to changes in technology, investment and market trends. It means constant restructuring of our economy to have a mix of industries in which we are competitive.' What this means in practice was mapped out in a strategic plan produced by a committee of business and labour leaders, government officials and academics in October 1991. It recommended a series of measures aimed at improving the skills of the workforce, at encouraging companies to automate and shift labour-intensive activities offshore, and at getting multinationals to think of Singapore as a managerial and service hub for South-east Asia rather than just a production base. Specific moves in train include: Research and development. In co-operation with the multinationals, Singapore is now engaged in a big effort to boost R &amp; D activities on the island. It has established a National Science and Technology Board to oversee a proliferation of research institutes in a wide variety of disciplines from microelectronics to biotechnology and, by providing financial incentives, to double R &amp; D spending to 2 per cent of gdp by 1995. In the same period, it wants to raise the proportion of scientists and engineers in the workforce to 40 per 10,000 workers from the present 28. That compares with R &amp; D spending of 3 per cent of gdp in Japan and 1.8 per cent in South Korea. Recruitment and training. The EDB is mounting a targeted recruitment drive overseas with a view to bringing engineers, computer scientists and other skilled manpower to Singapore from Europe, North America, Russia and other Asian countries including India. The aim is twofold: to pre-empt a looming skills shortage in the region as a whole, and to compensate for the fact that the government finds it difficult to lure Singaporeans into factory jobs as opposed to what they perceive as the more glamorous services sector. 'We have to make a more concerted effort to recruit people now because the other countries in the region are growing,' says Mr Suppiah Dhanabalan, trade and industry minister. In addition, Singapore is pitching to become a regional training centre for multinationals in Asia. The US communications giant Motorola, for example, recently sent a team to train on the island from the plant it has established in China. The commercial spinoff for Singapore is obvious. 'That way, I can sell more components,' says Mr Yeo. Regional investment. Singapore's attempt to push multinationals' low-cost, lower-skill operations offshore is now accelerating. Its main focus is the so-called 'Growth Triangle', an unusual initiative to foster economic integration between Singapore, the southern Malaysian state of Johor and Indonesia's nearby Riau islands. The EDB actively encourages investment in Johor, and Singapore is collaborating with Indonesia's Salim group to build industrial parks on Batam and Bintan, two islands in the Riau group. Attracted by the prospect of working with Singaporean expertise and efficiency and Indonesian wages, more than 30 companies have taken space on Batam, and exports from the plants already operational are growing fast. Here, too, the gains for Singapore far outweigh any concern about lost investment, for companies establishing operations in Johor or Batam generally do so in order to perform more sophisticated tasks in Singapore. There cannot be many examples of an industrialising country actively encouraging foreign investors to go elsewhere. The fact that Singapore does is a measure of its confidence both in the increasing sophistication of its economy and in the enticing prospects for growth in the wider region.</p>

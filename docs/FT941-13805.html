			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Treasury to sell catering agency The Treasury is to sell Forward, the troubled civil service catering agency, to Sutcliffe Catering Group, a subsidiary of the Granada leisure group. Sutcliffe has an annual turnover of Pounds 370m and employs 20,000 staff. It already has about 2,000 contracts to provide catering services to public and private sectors. Forward's turnover for 1993-94 is expected to exceed Pounds 30m. The privatisation of Forward follows the discovery by the National Audit Office of financial irregularities at the agency, including mismanagement and fraud, which may cost Pounds 900,000 of public funds.</p>

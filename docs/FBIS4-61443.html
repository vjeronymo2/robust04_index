			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by UKRINFORM correspondent Aleksandr Litvinov for </F> TASS]    [Text] Kiev 5 May TASS -- Ukraine should have made great  contribution to environmental security in Europe, if it closed  down the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.    Such was the position which visiting representatives of the  G-7 countries expressed at a meeting with Yuriy Kostenko,  Ukrainian minister for environmental protection, on Thursday [5  May].    If the Chernobyl nuclear power plant keeps on functioning,  it  will thus pose a permanent threat not only to Ukraine, but also  to other countries of the world, they emphasized.    According to Kostenko, his ministry has always been the only  state body to consistently demand that the Chernobyl nuclear  power plant be closed down as soon as possible.    The measures, which are being taken now to reinforce the  plant's security, will hardly suffice to prevent radioactive  pollution of the area in case of another accident, he said.    Representatives of the so-called "pro-nuclear" lobby, who  exercise much influence at all levels of power throughout the  Commonwealth of Independent States, put up a most fierce  resistance, he explained. They insist on a constant build-up in  nuclear capacities, gambling on the fact that Ukraine has now to  face the problem of insufficient power supplies.</p>

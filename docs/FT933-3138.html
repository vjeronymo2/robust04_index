			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Hewitt falls to Pounds 335,000 HEWITT Group, the manufacturer of industrial ceramics and refractories, reported a Pounds 76,000 drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 335,000 for the six months to June 30. However, the company said, last year's interim figure of Pounds 469,000 had been enhanced by a one-off profit of Pounds 98,000 on the sale of an investment. During the period Hewitt entered into a joint venture with the technical ceramics division of NV Koninklijke Sphinx, the Dutch sanitaryware and ceramic tile group, and the result this time had benefited from a three-month contribution amounting to Pounds 96,000. Turnover for the six months rose from Pounds 3.74m to Pounds 4.36m, boosted by Pounds 975,000 of sales from the Sphinx operation. Borrowings had risen during the first half, the company said, in order to finance the acquisition of Sphinx and the continuing investment programme in Germany. Gearing at the period end stood at 64 per cent, but that was expected to fall in the second half, the directors added. The interim dividend is being raised by 20 per cent to 1.5p (1.25p) and is paid from earnings per share down from 7.3p to 6.4p.</p>

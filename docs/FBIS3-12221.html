In its  contacts, the Jordanian Government held Israel responsible for  the incident and its consequences. It urged the international  community to assume its responsibilities toward putting an end  to such acts that desecrate holy places, terrorize secure  citizens, and escalate violence.    In this context, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan, minister of state  for  foreign affairs, summoned separately the ambassadors of the UN  permanent member states -- the United States, the United  Kingdom, France, China, and Russia -- the ambassador of Greece,  in its capacity as the current chairman of the European Union,  and the ambassador of Indonesia, the current chairman of the  Nonaligned Movement, to his office in the Foreign Ministry. He  conveyed to them the Jordanian Government's condemnation and  denunciation of this criminal incident against innocent,  defenseless worshipers and the violation of the sanctity of holy  places. The Jordanian Government held Israel fully responsible  for this massacre and urged it to conduct an immediate  investigation, since it provides for the settlers' weapons,  freedom of movement, and access to holy places.</p>

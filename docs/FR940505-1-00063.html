			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some 1999 truck travel in the Sacramento area would be by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fleets not subject to any fleet standard. The emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions available depend on the contribution to vehicle miles  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traveled made by fleets which are subject to the rule. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose of this proposal, it is assumed that 80 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> onroad heavy duty miles come from California fleets, yielding an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated reduction of approximately 6 tons of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per day.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Nonroad growth cap. The remaining NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shortfall is approximately 17 tons per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day, 13 percent of total mobile source inventory or 33 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the light duty motor vehicle NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  inventory in 1999. Before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> turning to activity reductions in the light duty motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category, it is reasonable to consider whether any reductions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available in this time frame from nonroad heavy-duty equipment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The difficulties of implementing a retrofit rule are discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I.D. However, there are emission reduction strategies which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be implemented by equipment fleet operators in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento area. For example, nonroad engines meeting higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national standards should be available from manufacturers as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> early as 1996. There are also applications which have on-road  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> configurations as well as nonroad configurations, and fleet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operators can purchase replacements meeting the tighter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the reasons that the overall nonroad category is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to contribute significantly to a 1999 inventory is that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it has been unregulated up to this time. The other reason is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that substantial growth is projected for the category: 8.8 tons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per day NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  increase from 1990 to 1999. If growth in emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the largest NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> -emitting nonroad sources could be avoided,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the task of attaining the standards by 1999 or any later date  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be made easier. EPA is proposing as part of the 1999  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment FIP that growth in the nonroad heavy-duty category be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capped such that NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  emissions not exceed 1995 projected levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The cap would be implemented via a fleet averaging concept like  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that described in section III.D.4 which contains the nonroad  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal for the 2005 attainment strategy. Section III.D.4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes a declining fleet average emissions level to assure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the historical rate of engine turnover is maintained; the 1999  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment cap would require that fleet operators acquire and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utilize low emission engines as necessary to maintain NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions at projected 1995 levels. The estimated benefit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this cap is the reduction of approximately 4 tons per day of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which would have resulted from further growth in the heavy-duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) No drive days. The remaining NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shortfall is approximately 13 tons per day which amounts to approximately 10 percent of the total mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source inventory, 16 percent of the on-road mobile source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory, or 25 percent of the light duty motor vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inventory in 1999. This represents a substantial reduction from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sources that can not be significantly controlled by further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> technological solutions or forced turnover to cleaner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternatives. Therefore, the shortfall would have to be achieved  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with even more difficult measures that focus on reducing the use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of mobile sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activity restrictions could be obtained from various mobile  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source categories using a variety of regulatory approaches. For  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, broad-based reductions from essentially all categories  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be obtained with such blunt measures as fuel surcharges or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gas rationing. More focused reductions could be made by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> targeting motor vehicle activity through fees on vehicle-miles- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traveled (VMT) or no-drive days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA believes such potentially severe measures should only be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selected after substantial public participation and debate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the Agency is compelled to make a selection for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed 1999 attainment date option. When faced with a similar  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dilemma in the 1990 proposed FIP for the South Coast Basin (55 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 36458), EPA chose to limit mobile source activity with a no-drive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day program for on-road motor vehicles. Today's proposal also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains that control measure in order to achieve the sizeable,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> remaining NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  shortfall for the 1999 attainment option. More  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically, in order to achieve the 13 tons of NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed, EPA is proposing that each highway vehicle registered in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Sacramento nonattainment area be prohibited from being driven  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one day out of five weekdays.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Recreational boat fees or prohibitions. A no-drive day, which is imposed on all highway vehicles one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> out of five weekdays, would produce approximately a 20 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decrease in the emissions of the remaining NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and VOC from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> highway vehicles. This would be sufficient to reduce NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> X <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sacramento area to the area's carrying capacity. However, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> VOC reductions from the above no-drive day proposal provides only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eleven out of the required fifteen tons per day. The accelerated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retirement strategy and growth cap proposed for heavy duty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines do not significantly affect VOC emissions. There is a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonroad mobile source category, recreational boating, which does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contribute significantly to the VOC inventory in Sacramento and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will eventually be reduced through the adoption of national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards for new engines and subsequent fleet turnover. It is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible to achieve an accelerated turnover similar to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required for heavy equipment either by restricting the operation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of boats which use engines which do not meet new national  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, or by imposing a fee on the excess emissions from such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> boats. As a final measure in a 1999 attainment option for VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions, EPA is proposing a fee system or boating restriction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which will reduce emissions from recreational boating by one- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third in 1999. A similar fee system is explained in the 2005  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attainment proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

The Union Minister for agriculture, Mr. Balram Jakhar, and  his Israeli counterpart, Mr. Yaakov Tsur, signed the areement,  which will result in cooperation between companies or  institutions of the two countries through collaborative  activities and exchanges.    At a joint press conference following the signing, Mr.  Jakhar  and Mr. Tsur felt there was vast scope for increasing bilateral  cooperation since the restoration of diplomatic relations  between the two countries two years ago.    Mr. Tsur stressed on intense cooperation in the field of  water and soil management, stating that his country has been  recently facing a shortage of water, and Israel would welcome  the help of Indian scientists in this field. Israel has been  supplying water to the entire country through a 400 km pipeline  connecting to a reservoir lake, and India could provide valuable  know-how in this field. Israel will make optimal use of water  through the drip/sprinkler system developed by Pune's Finnolamb  Company, with whom an agreement has been signed. Mr. Jakhar said  that Israel will get the system at the same price that the  Indian farmers get. He said that there were other areas where  Israel has agreed to help India in her developmental projects.  It was remarkable how Israel had come up as a forerunner inspite  of many serious impediments.    Commenting on the excellent work done by Indian scientists  in  agricultural research and development, Mr. Tsur said the two  countries could cooperate intensively in the fields of plant and  animal sciences, farm mechanization, and technology.    Mr. Jakhar called for jointly working for greater  agricultural production, through development of hybrid seeds,  fertilizers, greenhouse and energy-saving technologies and by  developing a marketing infrastructure while making use of  Israeli expertise in these areas.</p>

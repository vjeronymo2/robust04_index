			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The Food and Drug Administration said it planned a 98% reduction in the amount  of lead permitted to reach beverages from ceramic pitchers because of new  evidence that extremely small amounts of lead can hurt children. Lead at  concentrations tolerable by adults can limit body growth and intelligence of  children and can cause brain damage and behavior problems. Lead in pitchers  comes from the glaze commonly used to make ceramics smooth and impervious.  Officials are most concerned about acidic liquids such as orange juice eating  away at the glaze and causing lead to leach. Small cream pitchers would not be  subject to the new standard.  </P></p>

This was stated  by Andrey Vavilov, Russian Federation deputy finance minister.    Whereas in 1992-1993 military spending accounted for around  5  percent of GDP, this year it will represent 5.03 percent, A.  Vavilov said. Pointing to the need to cut defense spending in  the light of Russia's foreign policy commitments, the deputy  minister admitted that circumstances do not permit this process  to begin. According to A. Vavilov, the Russian troop withdrawal  from distant and nearby foreign countries in particular and  provision for these servicemen will require very considerable  expenditure.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Wellington, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China and Japan  have been recognized by New Zealanders as the markets with  greatest growth prospects, showed the result of a survey  available today.    The National Research Bureau, which conducted the survey,  concluded New Zealanders had now become aware of the importance  of trade with Asian countries.    Seventy-eight percent of the 600 people surveyed felt Asian  tourism was good for New Zealand and 57 percent favored  education institutions attracting fee-paying Asian students.    However, many New Zealanders are wary of Asian investment  and  immigration, the survey showed.    The result indicated 29 percent welcomed Asian immigration  to  New Zealand as good for the country, and 25 percent thought  Asian investment as good.    Thirty-three percent of the people had mixed feelings about  the immigration, 25 percent thought it would be neither good nor  bad, and 13 percent believed it would be bad for New Zealand.    On the Asian investment, 46 percent had mixed feelings, 18  percent opposed it and 11 percent considered it as neither good  nor bad.    The bureau said people were concerned Asian investment could  move ownership and control of businesses overseas, a similar  attitude New Zealanders held toward the United States and other  countries 20 years ago.    The prime reason for people opposing Asian migration came  from the fear for the perceived takeover of jobs from New  Zealanders.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / A parting of the ways When people tell us that the European Community is in a bad way, they usually recite the standard list of symptoms: the disarray of the exchange rate mechanism, the failure to stop the war in Bosnia, the decline in voter support for the Maastricht treaty. There is, however, a much larger and more difficult structural problem facing the Community than any of these transitional phenomena: as a result of the end of the cold war the member states must rethink the nature of the Community - its size, its purpose, its essential character. The Community's nature is bound to change through wholesale enlargement. There is now a throng of countries, in Europe and on its periphery, that wants to join the Community. Four members of the European Free Trade Association are negotiating now, and could join the Community by 1995. The east Europeans do not yet qualify; but the 12 have already, in effect, conceded that, if the east European states continue with democratic and economic reform, their applications cannot be rejected nor long delayed. Within a measurable time-frame, therefore, the Community could include most of Europe up to the Russian frontier, including some countries in the Balkans, plus at least a few in the Mediterranean, with a total membership of 25 or more. Expansion on such a scale, taking in countries with radically different economies, cultures and recent histories, is obviously not like adding pieces to a string of dominoes. Such enlargement cannot fail to change the internal character of the group; more important, it cannot fail to change its geo-political significance. The cold war is certainly over; but we have no grounds for making optimistic assumptions about the future course of events in Russia. One reason the east Europeans want to join the Community is that they are pessimistic about Russia, and they have experience on their side. If the Community extends to the Russian frontier, the implementation of a common foreign and defence policy will not be a dilettante hobby, as in the Maastricht treaty; it will be an absolute necessity. Do the 12 member governments underline this fact, when they blandly concede the notion of future membership for east Europe? They do not. This is just another of those dangerous truths about the choices facing the Community, about which politicians prefer to keep quiet. Yet it is obvious that wholesale enlargement will require the Community to redefine its place, its size, its objectives, its constitution. In particular, it will have to redefine its relationship with Russia and the former Soviet Union; and partly as a result, it must redefine its relationship with the US. Paradoxically, it is the American relationship which is the more pressing geo-strategic dilemma. For 50 years, the political geography of the world was defined by the east-west confrontation; as a result, Europe's role was largely defined by its alliance with the US. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the role of the Atlantic alliance is in doubt. Working out a new transatlantic modus vivendi for the new era must obviously be a two-sided affair. This is is what makes the erratic foreign policy gyrations of the US administration so disconcerting for west Europe. In several crises - Somalia, Bosnia and Haiti - the administration does not seem to know what it is doing. But behind the accusations of incompetence, there is the more serious worry that, in spite of his claims to the contrary, the US president is giving a generally lower priority to foreign policy - which, when it comes to peace-keeping, is apparently what Congress wants. The most immediate problem for the transatlantic alliance is how to keep Nato alive. Since 1989 the allies have tried to inject life into Nato by adopting a new peace-time strategy. But its credibility as a defensive military alliance is bound to be uncertain, in the absence of an acknowledged enemy. Nato's dilemma is parallel to that of the Community: what does it say to the countries in east Europe which want to join? In Germany last week, at a two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, gave a two-tone answer: on Wednesday he said no membership and no security guarantees, but perhaps some bilateral co-operation agreements. But on Thursday he said membership may be offered to those which qualify. The US clearly has not made up its mind. The heart of Nato membership is the US nuclear guarantee to all European members. Yet it is hard to see why the US Senate should ever agree to extend this guarantee to new members at a time when Washington is reducing its military presence in Europe. And the more the countries of east Europe appear in real need of such a guarantee (against instability in Russia), the less the US will want to provide it. Some Nato members, such as Britain and France, would prefer to prevent enlargement, for fear it could involve a weakening of the US guarantee to west Europe. Yet the exclusion of east European countries from Nato would raise serious questions about the consequences of their admission to the Community. It would be difficult to reconcile European defence with Nato defence if the two organisations had different memberships. The significance of the Community's probable expansion into east Europe, therefore, is that it could mark the beginning of a parting of the ways between Europe and the US.</p>

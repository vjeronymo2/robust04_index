			<p>920910 FT  10 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Portals records 8% improvement to Pounds 12.6m PORTALS GROUP, the specialist paper and environmental protection and control products group, reported pre-tax profits up by 8 per cent, from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 12.6m, in the six months to end-June. The improvement was achieved on turnover down 3.3 per cent from Pounds 94.5m to Pounds 91.4m. Mr Michael Morley, chief executive, said the results demonstrated Portals' 'resilience in difficult trading conditions.' He added that the outlook was 'neutral to mildly positive,' but cautioned that with some 60 per cent of Portals' business derived from overseas, 'any advance for the year as a whole must depend on a general pick-up in international activity'. The profit gain reflected a modest advance in the papermaking division and a recovery in the protection and control business, with a further decline in interest charges offsetting a reduction in its central division. The security and specialist papermaking division posted operating profits 3.8 per cent higher at Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 9.73m) on turnover down 2.6 per cent at Pounds 46.7m (Pounds 48m) reflecting deferred sales which have slipped into the second half. Price pressures were offset by efficiency gains and a continuing capital expenditure programme will see Pounds 14m spent this year compared to Pounds 12.7m in 1991. The protection and control division posted a 22 per cent rise in operating profits to Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2.8m) on turnover of Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 45.6m). The Computer Technology and Bradley Lomas Electrolok businesses achieved strong profit advances with the former winning important contracts from the National Rivers Authority and the BBC. The Houseman air and water hygiene business held up 'reasonably well in difficult UK trading conditions which placed pressure on its traditional water treatment chemicals business'. However, Mr Morley said the performance of Airoil-Flaregas, which makes low-emission burners for the petrochemicals industry, was still 'unsatisfactory.' Operational difficulties have not been fully overcome and orders reflected the reduced level of activity in the petrochemical market. As a result it posted a loss similar to the first half last year. As expected the operating loss in the central division increased to Pounds 760,000 against a Pounds 445,000 loss last year. The second half is expected to produce results close to break-even. Net debt on July 1 stood at Pounds 5.7m, down from Pounds 16.4m, representing gearing of 5 per cent. The interest charge fell from Pounds 364,000 to Pounds 97,000, reflecting the strong cash flow in 1991. Earnings came out at 14.15p (13.39p) or 13.97p (13.21p fully diluted. The interim dividend is maintained at 5p. COMMENT Portals' results, as usual, are solid if not inspiring. The group has gained a reputation as a reliable and defensive company, and the latest results bear all the fingerprints of a safe pair of management hands. The lower turnover in the papermaking division is disappointing, as is the continuing loss at Airoil-Flaregas, although it seems likely this will be resolved one way or another shortly. In the meantime the capital expenditure programme should generate further improvements in efficiency in the specialist paper business. With projected full-year profits of Pounds 27.5m, earnings of 30.2p, Portals is trading on a prospective p/e of 12.4. This is a stock to hold rather than buy at present levels.</p>

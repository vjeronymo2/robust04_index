			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: End seen to bull run in base metals The present bull market in base metals will probably end in the third quarter of 1995, according to analysts at the Merrill Lynch financial services group. However, before the downturn, 'the bull run from January to July 1995 could be very exciting indeed,' it is suggested in Merrill's latest monthly base and precious metals report. Mr Ted Arnold, metals analyst, and Mr Stephen Waite, senior European economist say: 'The strong price gains that have been seen in 1994 are not likely to be experienced after the end of the second quarter of 1995. But that is not the same as saying that the average price trends will collapse. 'We think the rocket-like price trajectories of most base metals will flatten out and begin to turn lower in the latter half of 1995.' Some selected metals, such as nickel - used intensively in the production of capital goods - may be able to show a rising price and rising average price trend for another year or so after the bull phase has ended. The authors point out that bull markets in metals rarely last for more than 18 to 24 months primarily because new production capacity is encouraged to start up or existing mines are expanded. Also high prices sometimes encourage 'a big response from the scrap sector'. In addition some demand is lost because metal users in the face of sharply rising prices switch at the margin to other products or processes. The exception is that copper is virtually price inelastic as it is essential for copper wiring and the cost of metal used is a very small component of total prices of products. The authors also point out that bull markets end because interest rates rise with economic activity and at some point become high enough to choke off demand at the margin and slow down activity. That is usually when a period of stock liquidation begins. However, miners and aluminium smelters continue to maximise production to reduce unit costs and so stocks of surplus metal start to build up again on the London Metal Exchange. One feature of the present bull market has been the involvement of the hedge and commodity funds who have been buying in anticipation of higher metals prices. The authors warn that the funds are likely to anticipate the time when consumption will start to slow down and production starts to satisfy current demand. 'Our guess is that when that happens the funds will go as aggressively short as they went aggressively long earlier this year. When they start to sell short and get out of their long positions, relatively high stock levels in most metals will reinforce the market's bearishness.'</p>

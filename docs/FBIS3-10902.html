Jose Miguel Alfaro has a  live report from La Moneda Palace:    [Alfaro] Good afternoon, in an unusual event in our history  President Frei began his administration by meeting with business  people from 20 countries as a demonstration of the new  government's intention to continue the process of introducing  Chile to the international market. Let us look at the report we  prepared:    [Begin recording] [Alfaro] The president began the first day  of his administration early this morning in La Moneda Palace. He  then went to Carreras Hotel to open a meeting with the business  people. He reiterated that it is a moral responsibility and an  important economic objective for his government to eradicate  extreme poverty. To do that he said it is necessary that Chile  double its income during the next decade.    [Frei, in progress] ...of what I said, I do not want to fail  to mention that in Chile we are not willing to sacrifice our  culture or our national identity or the values of equity or  solidarity or deteriorate the qualify of our standard of living  and environment or put our political and social stability at  stake for the sole purpose of achieving economic growth.    [Alfaro] President Frei concluded his speech by inviting the  business people to do business in the country, and in this  manner cooperate with the progress of Chile. He said the larger  private investment is, the larger the public investment to  overcome poverty will be. After President Frei finished his  speech, the speakers were Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat,  Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia, and Public Works Minister  Ricardo Lagos. The following is a report from Arturo Harlen.    [Harlen] More than 100 of the most important world business  people are meeting in Carreras Hotel this morning. They are  getting familiar with the Chilean conditions for foreign  investment. This meeting gave an opportunity to the new  ministers from the economic area to disclose their policies.  Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat pointed out the private sector's  participation in the country's development and explained the  benefits offered by Chile to foreign investors. He noted that  the new economic officials have made a commitment to maintain  clear rules and the country's stability, especially for  investors.    [Aninat] The stability of the rules, the continuity of  growth, and the importance of investment and savings to create  more and better jobs are basic commitments for this government.  The Finance Ministry I head and the economic team in general  will not fail to maintain the stability that was achieved with  so much effort in the country.    [Harlen] Public Works Minister Ricardo Lagos said this  government has the challenge of providing the country with an  infrastructure compatible with a growth with social justice. He  noted that ports, airports, and highways must be modernized. He  said he has identified about 1,600 projects that are essential  to achieve development. He said a large part of these projects  will be given to private companies for their construction, which  means a great opportunity for new business deals. Finance  Minister Eduardo Aninat indicated that growth close to 4.5  percent is expected this year and that with this growth Chile  will be completing 11 years of continuous economic growth. [end  recording]    [Alfaro] I would like to note that President Frei will hold  a  luncheon for the participants of the meeting with world business  people in the next few minutes. This is all the information I  have from La Moneda Palace. Back to the studio.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / International Company News: Fokus Bank property arm under investigation Fokus Eiendom, the property arm of Fokus Bank, Norway's third-largest commercial bank, is to be investigated following alleged irregularities connected with property dispos-als. The transaction has already forced the resignation of Mr Leif Klevan, the bank's managing director and chairman of Fokus Eiendom. Mr Stein Oeverland, Fokus Eiendom's chief executive, is expected to shortly step down. Under Mr Klevan and Mr Oeverland, Fokus carried out 250 property disposals with an estimated value of NKr1bn (Dollars 138.8m), since January 1992, including the alleged sale of a stake in a shopping centre. Norway's banking, insurance and securities commission, the finance industry watchdog, has launched an investigation into Fokus and its property arm. Fokus Bank itself plans an internal audit of the property unit. The bank said the purpose of its investigation was to 'uncover eventual irregularities of transactions and to evaluate Fokus Eiendom's routines for the purchase and sale of property'. The group is to submit its findings on June 27. The final report will be handed to the board in August.</p>

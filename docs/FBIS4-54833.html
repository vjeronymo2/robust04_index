			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivo Komsic, leader of the Croatian Peasants' </F> Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina and member of the B-H Presidency,  by Ankica Posavljak; place and date not given: "Before the HNV,  We Were Fighting Against the Muslims"]    [Text] In Sarajevo delegations of the Croatian republic  of Herzeg-Bosna and of the Bosniak-Muslims side have been  discussing the appointments to official posts of the Federation  of Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, the question of who will be  president has remained unanswered, despite the fact that the  Constitution of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina (that was  adopted on 30 March in Sarajevo) stipulates that president ought  to be appointed within 30 days of the adoption of the  Constitution. Time is running out, but the Croats and  Muslims-Bosniaks have not yet been able to agree on which people  the president will be chosen from. Even if they eventually  agree that the future president should be a Croat, the question  remains who will be the president, since the Croatian People's  Council [HNV], which was founded in mid-February this year in  Sarajevo, although objecting to being referred to as a political  party, still has political aspirations regarding the future head  of state. Furthermore, 10 days ago the HNV put forward Ivo  Komsic, chairman of the Croatian Peasants' Party [HSS] for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a presidential candidate. This was an  occasion to talk with Komsic.    [Posavljak] Unlike your regularly participation in all the  negotiations between the Herzegovina Croats and Muslims, always  as a member of the Bosniak delegation, you were not present at  the latest round of talks?    [Komsic] It was about an agreement between the two  governments on economic and humanitarian matters, and I am a  member of the Presidency, rather than a minister in the  government. Also, it was a meeting of two parliamentary  parties: The Croatian Democratic Community [HDZ] and the Party  of Democratic Action [SDA], to which I do not belong. I do not  know what kind of agreement they will reach, but regardless of  what they agree, it is necessary to carry out talks with other  parties in the Parliament of Bosnia-Herzegovina, because not a  single deputies' club in the Parliament is homogeneous. Also,  one has to reconcile attitudes within the Croatian deputies'  club, and within the Muslim-Bosniak deputies' club, because both  of them are heterogeneous. They are composed of parties with  different orientations.    [Posavljak] You said that the latest round of talks was  about an agreement between two parliamentary parties, whose  legitimacy had been confirmed by the elections back in 1990. It  is obvious that the SDA and the Muslim-Bosniak leadership are  making agreements with their partner in power, namely the HDZ.  Your HSS is not taken into consideration, is it?    [Komsic] To put forward such arguments is to try to revive  the old argument about which party is legitimate, and which has  a right to represent the interests of the Croats in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We feel that such a debate is superfluous,  all the more so since the war has changed many things in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and many parties have squandered their  legitimacy and legality. The parties may discuss issues and  reach agreements, but all the agreements must be reached within  their deputies' clubs, while there is also the highest authority  -- the constituent assembly, where decisions are made by a  two-thirds majority. Proposals that are passed in the clubs do  not necessarily have to pass in the assembly.    [Posavljak] The HSS was founded as late as last year, so it  could not take part in the 1990 elections, but now it is  competing for power.    [Komsic] When a party was founded is not important at all.  The HSS revived its activities in Bosnia last year, and nobody  can deny any party's right to put forward its candidates. The  HSS is to be given considerable credit for the accomplishment of  peace in Bosnia, even for the achievement of the Washington  Agreement and the institution of the constituent assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Contribution to peace is the only measure by  which the legitimacy of any political party can be measured.  The time has come for the position of certain parties to be  determined by evaluating their contribution to peace. The HSS  has its deputies' club in the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  and I have to say that a number of HDZ deputies support the work  of the HSS.    [Posavljak] Who are those deputies?    [Komsic] I do not want to mention names, but I will  corroborate my assertion by saying that a member of the HNV and  HSS won the support of a majority of HDZ deputies when the  chairman of the Croatian deputies' club was being elected at a  previous constituent assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Posavljak] You are promoting the HNV and its candidates  although you claim that the HNV is not a political party. What  is it then? Is it an association of citizens, and can it be  taken as a serious political party as such?  <H5>  Rift Among Croats </H5>   [Komsic] The HNV is an executive body of the Croatian  National Assembly that took place in Sarajevo on 6 February this  year. That body is struggling for the implementation of the  conclusions adopted at the convention, which are absolutely in  accord with the Washington Agreement and the Constitution of the  Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and will struggle for it until  everything that has been agreed upon or planned is implemented.    [Posavljak] Did the foundation of the HNV cause a division  into loyal and disloyal Croats, that is, to what extent have you  contributed to the disintegration of the unity of the Croats at  a time when intensive homogenization of the other two peoples in  Bosnia-Herzegovina is taking place?    [Komsic] If we value the collective interest of the Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is for peace, I suppose, then there  is no need to campaign against the HNV and the people who have  brought about peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Before the  foundation of the HNV and its concept of federation, we had a  war between the Croats and the Muslims. The theory about a rift  among the Croats is sustained by those who are struggling for  power, by those who tried to create a national state for  themselves in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and who cannot reconcile  themselves to their political defeat. The new Constitution  represents their defeat, and now those forces want to achieve  power again in order to protect their own interests. As for the  Croatian nation here in Bosnia-Herzegovina, those who  disintegrated the Croats, who sacrificed half a million Croats  for the creation of a Croatian national state in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, are now trying to push their policy through  the institutions of the Federation. They are trying to revive  and deepen the rift that they themselves caused among the the  Croats by campaigning against the HNV.    [Posavljak] You keep saying that the HNV has brought about  peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that your policy brought about  the Washington Agreement as well. However, the representatives  of the Croatian republic of Herzeg-Bosna claim the same for  themselves, and it is they who signed the document. Who is to  be given credit for the accomplishment of the peace agreement  between the Croats and Muslim-Bosniaks?    [Komsic] Representatives of the Croatian republic of  Herzeg-Bosna stated their attitude at the assembly in Livno, and  according to the Livno resolution the Croatian people claims  sovereignty and statehood in Herzeg-Bosna, while all other  Croats would be protected by international institutions for  human rights and freedoms. That means that their resolution  declared us to be a national minority in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but  this concept of theirs as stated in the Livno resolution  ultimately failed.    [Posavljak] In view of your attitude that it is precisely  the HVN that has preserved the Croats' equality as a nation in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, how do you interpret certain denunciations  on the part of certain groups among the Croatian people, saying  that you are a Croatian Sejdo Bajramovic [the Albanian member of  the Yugoslav Federal Presidency before the war]    [Komsic] I can only say that history will answer many  questions.  <H5>  In Politics -- Out of Necessity </H5>   [Posavljak] The HNV has already announced its criteria that  the candidates for federal posts should meet. One of those  criteria is that none of the candidates should ever have been  involved in the Croatian-Muslim war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Are  there any such people among the current politicians at all? I  refer thereby also to you and to Stjepan Kljujic, member of the  Bosnian Presidency, because the Croats in central Bosnia  consider you to be indirect participants in the conflict, but on  the Muslim side?    [Komsic] Those are insinuations, and in proposing these  criteria we referred to the people who were actively involved in  the conflict either as protagonists, or through the media,  generating hatred between the two peoples.    [Posavljak] Are your attitudes and explanations supported  by the Croats in central Bosnia, where you yourself come from,  and would you dare visit your native town of Kiseljak now,  convinced of the correctness of your policy?    [Komsic] An unpredictable danger in such places not only for  me, but also for other people, lies in uniformed groups or  individuals who have broken loose from any control. Those who  are under the control of or subordinated to the General Staff of  the Croatian Defense Council represent no danger for any of us,  which means for me as well. I travelled enough during the war  throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina, and I stayed in Grude, Citluk,  and Capljina without any fear.    [Posavljak] You also said that the HNV put the blame for the  conflict on those who had generated hatred between the peoples  by waging a media war. One of the elements of the Washington  Agreement stipulates the urgent cessation of the media war.  While listening to Sarajevo Radio these days I have noticed  that the Croats are still referred to as Ustashas. Do you feel  uncomfortable when you hear that the official, state-run media  refer to your people in such a way?    [Komsic] I have already made many public statements about  the terminology used, which is quite unbecoming to the media.  After all, the Ustasha movement was never in conflict with the  Muslims, and never supported the partition of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and, because of the fascist connotation that  the term conveys, we disagree with the use of it. It is  incorrect rather than offensive.    [Posavljak] What will happen to your political career if the  HDZ and the SDA reach an agreement? Do you see any political  future for yourself if Herzeg-Bosna's candidate becomes  president?    [Komsic] My engagement in politics has resulted from  necessity, from the need for the protection of Croatian  interests in the region. I am not worried about my political  career because I have never aimed at one. Everything that I  have done has been out of necessity, to save what could be  saved, and now we want the consensus between Muslims and Croats  to be preserved through the implementation of the Constitution.    [Posavljak] Still, you have not given up your candidacy for  the future president of the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Komsic] My candidacy for one of the leading offices in the  Federation was announced by the HNV some 10 days ago, while  other things will be determined in the course of negotiations.    [Posavljak] With respect to your attitude that everything  that you are doing is for the benefit of the Croatian people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, would you give up your presidential  candidacy if the Croatian interest demanded that?    [Komsic] Yes, because it is all about the implementation of  the project of Federation, and if somebody else were to  implement it, I would be very happy.</p>

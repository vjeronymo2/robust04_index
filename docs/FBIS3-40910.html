			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pavel Felgengauer: "Choosing an Objective </F> American Style"]    [Text] Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin have agreed that the  strategic nuclear missiles of the United States and Russia will  now be trained in not on the territory of the "probable enemy,"  but instead--on the empty regions of the world ocean. Now if  something were to happen, the combined megatonnage of the two  superpowers would merely slaughter fish and, perhaps, a couple  of unfortunate fishermen.    This, of course, is a large step forward compared to Cold  War  times when, at the beginning of the eighties, on both sides of  the ocean fingers were literally quivering over the launch  buttons. The re-aiming of the strategic missiles was possibly  the last in a long list of peaceful initiatives of Gorbachev,  Reagan, and Bush, which made the beginning of the nineties quite  different from the beginning of the eighties.    In this case, the initiative came from the American  military.  The Pentagon was concerned about reductions of staff and combat  readiness in the Russian Army, about which there were many  reports last year, and also the general crisis in our country,  as a result of which, as they think there, there was a greater  probability of unsanctioned or accidental launching of missiles.    The Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs was happy to  support  the new peace initiative, and the Ministry of Defense and  General Staff had no objections. The agreement was signed, but  neither in the United States nor in Russia was there any  possibility of monitoring compliance. All questions of  controlling strategic nuclear forces (SYaS) are a carefully kept  state secret. Nothing is known specifically--all one can do is  guess. But one can assume with a certain amount of confidence  that the Russian (Soviet) missiles were not aimed anywhere in  particular anyway. There are various possible versions of their  application and, correspondingly, a set of flight assignments.  The order to launch and, correspondingly, the number of the  flight assignment come from Moscow at the same time, and the  team on duty in the underground command point in a standard  situation does not participate in the launch at all. It merely  echoes the commands from Moscow in the event of a possible  failure of the electronic system, but itself can launch nothing  without an order from Moscow granting permission.    When a year and a half ago President Yeltsin spoke about the  fact that our missiles were not aimed at the cities of England  and the United States, he undoubtedly spoke the truth, although  in the West they did not really understand this ("Where are they  aimed, then??!") Probably for the Americans aiming the missiles  in a different direction really could serve as an additional  safeguard against an accidental nuclear war. But since the  majority of Americans, particularly the military--patriots of  their homeland--are firmly convinced that the American way of  solving any problem is the best, they are thus convinced that  our equal triad of strategic nuclear forces is more or less a  copy of their triad. Which in reality is far from the case.  Frequently, fundamentally different technical and  military-political solutions were used in the Soviet Union.    The most reliable thing would probably be for our presidents  to simply take and exchange nuclear buttons, and thus put an end  to the threat of nuclear war once and for all. Incidentally, the  already mentioned differences in the organization of strategic  nuclear forces could make sure that this exchange would not be  altogether equivalent, either. It has long been known that what  is good for the Russian is good for the German (or, say, the  American).... Or, as Sir Kipling wrote: "East is East and West  is West, and never the twain shall meet."</p>

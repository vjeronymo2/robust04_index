In an opening statement at the SDPP Central Executive  Council  meeting, Karayalcin said the recent massacre in Sarajevo has  taken the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina beyond the dimensions of  a human tragedy. Stressing that Turkey will not allow the  problem to be defined as a human tragedy and then discarded  among the many daily discussions, Karayalcin said that foreign  policy friendships are different than individual ones. He added:    [Begin Karayalcin recording] Should our friends fail to  demonstrate their friendship after this incident as well, then I  believe that ties of friendship do not mean a lot. Turkey will  feel the need to reassess its relations of friendship and mutual  assistance depending on the stand to be adopted by its allies  following the developments of 5 February. [end recording]    In reply to a question, Karayalcin said Prime Minister Tansu  Ciller briefed him on the appointment of Isparta Deputy Aykon  Dogan as state minister.    Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin briefed the meeting on the  steps taken toward a solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina problem.</p>

			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Pound falls as pressure grows for rate cut MOUNTING PRESSURE on the UK government to expand the economy and cut interest rates sharply unleashed speculative selling of sterling which pushed the pound down to a five-year low against the dollar yesterday. As UK industry leaders urged the government to ease off its fight against inflation in favour of immediate action to bring the economy out of recession, dealers sold pounds in the belief that base rates could be cut by as much as 2 percentage points when the chancellor makes his Autumn Statement on Thursday. On the domestic money market, traders priced a full percentage point cut in base rates into their cash market operations. Three-month money, which often acts as a bellwether of base rate trends, closed around 7 per cent, down from 7 3/16 per cent on Friday. As hopes of a cut in borrowing costs grew, sterling fell by nearly 2 cents to a close of Dollars 1.5210 in London. It is understood, however, that Mr Lamont is not contemplating such a radical step as a 2 point base rate cut. He has let it be known that weekend reports suggesting the government might order an immediate cut in rates to 6 per cent are 'not realistic'. At the Confederation of British Industry's annual conference in Harrogate, delegates maintained pressure on ministers to unveil a detailed plan for economic recovery on Thursday. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, one of two cabinet ministers at the conference yesterday, heightened expectations when he said the Autumn Statement would 'mark a turning point in the future course of the British economy'. The chancellor's proposals, he said, would present the public with further evidence that the government was dedicated to ensuring that all its policies were tailored to recovery, growth and jobs. Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, said Thursday's statement was critically important and would be seen as a test of the government's determination to bring about lasting recovery. Sir David Lees, chairman of GKN and head of the CBI's economic affairs committee, said inflation should no longer be the dominant theme of policy. 'The battle we need to win now is against the lack of confidence which is holding back growth and investment in the economy.' Official figures showing that lower interest rates failed to entice consumers into borrowing more last month provided further evidence yesterday of a continuing lack of confidence in the economy. Net consumer credit fell by Pounds 60m in September, suggesting that consumers are attempting to pay off expensive debts before taking on new loans. After its fall in London, sterling continued to drop in New York, touching Dollars 1.5090 - a level last seen in January 1987 - before closing at Dollars 1.5105. The pound fell 3 1/2 pfennigs to DM2.4150 in London but steadied in New York to DM2.4239.

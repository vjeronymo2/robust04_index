			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: Dance is at the crossroads - Ballet in 1993 The year is going, let him go;/Ring out the false, ring in the true. Such Tennysonian thoughts could be those of dance-lovers after twelve months of false ballets; false dancing; false dealing; false repertories, and false seasons. A critic's - this critic's - accounts for 1993 are dismaying. Artistic falsehoods abounded. How else to explain the Royal Ballet's diabolical version of Don Quixote, in which not one single ingredient - design, text, score, production, performance - was right, and a wonderful old ballet was served up, in Coral Browne's memorable phrase about an actor 'like two tons of condemned veal'. Consider, too, Glen Tetley's La Ronde, which was deposited on the Opera House stage like an old Wienerschnitzel, with the activities of its copious scenery more interesting than the relentless grind (in any sense of the word) of its choreography. This was the year of David Bintley's gnat-busy Tombeaux, and of his awful misreading of Sylvia for Birmingham Royal Ballet. We were also faced with less than triumphant novelties in a recent programme that went under the witless title of White-hot and Different, with another piece from William Forsythe to hit out at us, short but aggressive, like a child mugger. The restoration of Ballet Imperial with nearly all the glorious Berman designs, albeit not quite enough of the glorious dancing, was good news, as were Irek Mukhamedov's appearances as Balanchine's Apollo (a grand hellenic torso) and the Prodigal Son. He was also outstanding as Romeo, in Judas Tree (which looked very fine), and seemed like Sisyphus as he tried to give some momentum to Don Quixote. Nina Ananiashvili was seen at the Opera House as a grand and Russian Firebird (with Stuart Cassidy an excellent Ivan), and Darcey Bussell showed an ideal physical sympathy for her Balanchine roles - clear and ardent. Debut of the year at Covent Garden was Sarah Wildor's memorably intense and luminous Juliet, exquisite, bright with promise. Also on the side of truth, Birmingham Royal Ballet brought Ninette de Valois' noble Job back to Covent Garden, and then took it to Coventry cathedral (Dame Ninette had long hoped to see it in such a setting). We admired Marion Tait and Miyako Yoshida, and the return of Massine's Choreartium showed the troupe at its best. Standards of classic dancing were otherwise less sure, and both Sleeping Beauty and Romeo were under-manned. English National Ballet gained Derek Deane as a welcome new director, put on a serious Bolshoi-style Swan Lake and a traditional Sleeping Beauty. The best news was that Deane had started to polish the ensemble: performances in Beauty looked truer, sharper than for years. Thomas Edur remains a shining example of aristocratic style allied to dramatic sensitivity, and is thereby unique on our ballet-scene. The indomitable London City Ballet - which, I must suppose, Heaven rather than the Arts Council is determined to save - closed and then re-opened. Hurrah] Hurrah, too, for Kim Brandstrup's Arc Dance, also not favoured by the Arts Council, which continued to produce valuable dance with Brandstrup's Antic. The year's abundant falsities included suspect and fearsome goods from home and abroad. I list, from a sense of duty but with considerable distaste: Maurice Bejart's Lausanne troupe which brought farragos about Chaplin and Italy that were a vexation to the spirit, and vehicles for Sylvie Guillem (Sisi) and Koen Onzia (The Miraculous Mandarin, with Onzia as a transvestite tart) which were made bearable by their central performances. The ill-named Stars of American Ballet, Prague Festival Ballet, Batsheva from Israel, Nederlands Dans Theater 2 (wonderful dancers; insupportable repertory) and Nederlands Dans 3 (sheltered accommodation for dancers over 40); Scottish Ballet looking glum in an unlikely Anna Karenina; the Cholmondelys and the Featherstonehaughs in the tiresome Precious; Northern Ballet Theatre in a spirit-lowering triple bill and an inexcusable Cinderella; an apotheosis of Euro-trash in The Place's Dance Workshop Europe: these, and many more, celebrated the rule of the tasteless or the inept. The single worst event of the year - and like the Chinese water torture it was slow and inexorable in its eight weeks of inadequacy - was the Anglo-American television survey Dancing on BBC2, which combined garrulity with political correctness and a stupefying inability to cope with its subject. And as the apotheosis of what was wrong with 1993, let me cite the proposed re-shaping of London Contemporary Dance Theatre (a troupe of which we can be unabashedly proud) and the anticipated expansion of Rambert Dance which, without Richard Alston, (who gave it an uncompromising but clear image), is an unknown quantity. Contemporary dance is at the crossroads - and that is where the dirty work takes place. There were, though, great truths on view. The New York City Ballet's eight week Balanchine Festival, featuring 73 of the master's works, was a grand achievement, made even more glorious for me by the performances of Kyra Nichols, who can do no wrong. I reported with greatest pleasure on performances at the Paris Opera where the repertory is lively, and the dance is radiant, both from such etoiles as the flawless Elisabeth Platel, Manuel Legris and the recently promoted Nicholas LeRiche, and from serried ranks of hugely gifted youngsters. Twyla Tharp's company and her dances also looked very good on a visit to the Paris Opera. Our own major visitors came from Russia. The Kirov made an odd impression at the Coliseum. Their version of the Lavrovsky Romeo was a mistaken choice; the omnipresent and flashy Julia Makhalina was not the best advertisement for Petersburg classic style, and Farukh Ruzimatov removed himself after a few self-parodying performances. Happily, certain younger ballerinas - Irina Shapchits, Veronika Ivanova, Larissa Lezhnina - and the corps de ballet were there to tell us of Kirovian excellence. The Bolshoi stormed the Albert Hall. Here, I fear, is the shape of ballet to come: huge arena, pop presentation, expensive tickets, dance as a gladiatorial art, and seek in vain for many niceties of style or choreography. Big ballet equals big bucks. The Grigorovich repertory can sustain this exposure; the traditional classics looked bleached, beached. There were heart-whole performances from the Bolshoi's dancers, with such newcomers as Andrey Uvarov, Sergey Filin, Yury Klevtsov, Elena Palshina a delight to see. And at the Edinburgh Festival, Mark Morris - despite losing his theatre - reasserted the rule of fine and subtle choreography with his thrilling Liebeslieder Waltzer and a triple bill, appreciatively recorded here by Alastair Macaulay. In surveying the year, certain things must be recalled with especial gratitude. I have mentioned the unflawed dancing of Elisabeth Platel and Kyra Nichols. The appearance of Mikhail Baryshnikov with the White Oaks Project for two nights at Sadler's Wells, showed us sublimest artistry. At an age when most male dancers have hung up their shoes, Baryshnikov - in pieces by Twyla Tharp and Mark Morris - was as brilliant, as rhythmically vivid and physically exhilarating, as the young divinity we first saw in 1970, and the great artist we knew in the succeeding decades. It was miraculous dancing, life-enhancing. And Life-enhancing in a very different way was a performance by Amici, a group of men and women variously and seriously handicapped, who, under the leadership of Wolfgang Stange, produced a dance piece (The Journey) which spoke eloquently of their problems, of their aspirations, and of their gifts. Unlike much of what 1993 brought us, Amici's work is of great value.</p>

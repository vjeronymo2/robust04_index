			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / International Company News: Italcable sounds cautious note on earnings for year ITALCABLE, the Italian state-owned company which operates most of the country's international telephone services, has struck a cautious note about net profits for 1991, despite a 13 per cent rise in traffic last year. The caution stems from last year's 20 per cent cut in international phone charges which, according to analysts, will bite into earnings for the year. At the interim stage in 1991, Ital-cable's turnover fell 1 per cent to L341bn (Dollars 290.4m), despite a 12 per cent traffic increase. Pre-tax earnings dropped 9.3 per cent to L136bn. In a letter to shareholders, the company said turnover had remained at 'a good level', despite the tariff cut and would allow the payment of an 'adequate' dividend. Financial revenues from treasury operations rose by around 16 per cent last year. Stet, the Italian public-sector concern which controls the state's telecommunications interests, is loosening its hold on SIP, the main telephone utility, in a further partial privatisation. Stet's stake in SIP's savings shares will fall from 53.6 per cent at present to 33.1 per cent under the terms of a L400bn convertible Eurobond to be issued this month. Precise details of the issue, which will carry warrants convertible into SIP savings shares, have not been released. However, the exercise price for the warrants will be set between 104 per cent and 110 per cent of the average price for SIP savings shares in the five days before the issue. The deal, which will lower Stet's overall share of SIP's capital to 53.5 per cent from 58.4 per cent at present, follows a Dollars 275m international equity offering of savings shares in Stet itself last June. Once all associated warrants are exercised, that transaction would reduce to around 30 per cent the stake in Stet's savings shares owned by the IRI state holding company.</p>

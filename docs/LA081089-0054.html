			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOU CAN HELP: BECOMING ONE FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS  </P> <P> For his Spanish-style ranch house, Bud Breul of Thousand Oaks would like to  find a 14-inch or 18-inch church or school bell, but has no idea where to look.  Do any sources ring a bell with our readers, or will Breul not be buoyed until  the next round?  </P> <P> Betty Ellyn of Los Angeles is looking for a litter container that fits over the  center bump of a car and is weighted down by sandbags. Can you help get Ellyn  over the hump, or will the solution to her problem literally never be in the  bag?  </P> <P> Ed J. of Los Angeles is after an Eames -- or similar-style -- black leather  footstool with aluminum-type or metal base, preferably with a pedestal base. He  has the Eames chair to go with it. Can you help Ed become a gracious chair man  again, or will he have that sinking feeling only after we put him on a  pedestal?  </P> <P> For a college-bound student, Zafira Berke of Los Angeles needs fitted,  solid-color sheets for bunk beds. Can you help before Berke goes bonkers, or  will that student never be a sure bed to pull down straight A's?  </P> <P> Reader-to-Reader Help Line: To add to a friend's collection, Leslie at (714)  354-9801 (days) or (714) 780-2172 wants a Scotty dog figure that was a Home  Interiors hostess gift about a dozen years ago; the figure, about 10 inches  high and 12 inches long, is no longer available from Home Interiors. Since  Leslie obviously has been barking up the wrong tree, please do something before  her friend's collection goes to the dogs. . . . Mary at (213) 378-5903 needs  the beater for a discontinued Model K4B KitchenAid mixer; please see to it that  things don't get beat up -- or mixed up -- any more in Mary's kitchen. . . .  It's been a while since we had a request for a sweater stretcher, but Francine  at (213) 602-1821 needs one quickly. Please make sure that she doesn't get bent  out of shape too much. . . . Mark at (714) 635-4133 needs to replace the hood  ornament on his Volvo; it was accidentally broken off recently and is no longer  carried by dealers. Please be Swede about this and make sure that Mark isn't  tempted to do something drastic about this problem, such as using a re-Volvo.  </P> <P> Note: The Reader-to-Reader Help Line is only for one-time items or for products  no longer available in stores. And you must give us written permission to  publish your telephone number, so that others may contact you directly.  </P> <P> Mrs. Jerry Polzine of Anaheim informs us that Tapioca Pearl (Bille de Tapioca),  which had been off the market and which some readers had asked for a while  back, is now available again and can probably be purchased in many Oriental  food markets.  </P> <P> It should soon be all downhill for Diana Christianson of Carlsbad, who wanted  pine tar for wooden skis. Bill Getz of the Wm. Getz Corp. of Santa Ana,  nationwide distributors of pine tar, says the store nearest to Carlsbad is  Westwood Sports of Vista, (619) 487-2147. And Ruth Johnson of Downey suggests  contacting the Cumberland General Store, Route 3, Box 81, Crossville, Tenn.  38555, telephone (800) 334-4640.  </P> <P> Vera Palmiero, who was looking for hosiery with a cotton foot, should soon be  on softer footing. Florence Parks of Los Angeles says she gets such hosiery  from James &amp; Williams Shoes, 5763 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, Calif.  90036, telephone (213) 938-3505; she usually orders by mail and says the item  comes in one color only: beige. Our other source is also a mail-order firm.  Sarane Van Dyke of Los Angeles, Helen Tomsky of Sun Valley, Margaret Beyer of  Santa Ana, Corrine Brawley of Anaheim and Lila of San Diego all report that  such hosiery can be obtained from National Wholesale Co. Inc., Lexington, N.C.  27294, telephone (704) 249-0211.  </P> <P> We now have two mail-order sources for Mrs. Henry of Huntington Park, who wants  covers for four-slice toasters. Amy M. Meedel of Eagle Rock says catalogues put  out by Spencer Gifts, 500 Packets Court, Williamsburg, Va. 23189, and  Ambassador Gifts, P.O. Box 52146, Phoenix, Ariz. 85072-9825, carry the covers.  Meedel adds that some K mart stores also have them.  </P></p>

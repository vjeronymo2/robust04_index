			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SYNAGOGUE OPENS DOORS TO CONGREGANTS WHO ARE DEAF  </P> <P> For much of her youth, Judy SlomovicGunter missed out on the Jewish culture she  deeply cherished.  </P> <P> Deaf since birth, she frequently could not understand the teachers or  participate in class discussions at her North Hollywood religious school. And  the deaf community offered no programs in Jewish education.  </P> <P> She was an outsider in both worlds. Until she discovered Temple Beth Solomon of  the Deaf in Arleta in 1982.  </P> <P> "It's the only place I can feel both deaf and Jewish," Slomovic Gunter said  through an interpreter.  </P> <P> About 250 Southland Jews, most of whom are hearing impaired, belong to the  congregation, which celebrates its 29th birthday this month.  </P> <P> By providing congregants who sign for Sabbath services every other Friday and  religious instruction on Sundays, the synagogue enables hearing-impaired Jews  to observe their faith without misunderstanding or embarrassment. Worshipers  say they feel a genuine sense of community with their peers. In addition, the  temple is a forum for socialization.  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Obstacles  </P> <P> "We can't go to a regular movie because we can't follow the dialogue," said  Slomovic Gunter. "It's there and yet it's not accessible to us. Deafness is not  just a hearing loss. It's a communication loss, and the last thing we need when  we go to temple are more obstacles."  </P> <P> Rabbi Alan Henkin, who is not hearing impaired, said the synagogue helps make  up for "deaf people's limited opportunity for empowerment in society."  </P> <P> Henkin said congregants staff all the committees, set the budget and the  schedule for the Sunday religious school, and organize services. When they are  not meeting in person, they communicate with a TTD (Telecommunications Device  for the Deaf) machine, through which their typed messages are relayed back and  forth over the telephone lines.  </P> <P> Temple members regard their self-sufficiency with great pride.  </P> <P> "We are grateful for the help of others," said Bess Hyman, 70, who joined the  congregation in 1973. "But we feel our temple is, of, by, and for the deaf and  that is important to us. We pay its bills and we understand its services."  </P> <P> According to Martin Florsheim, president of the National Congress of Jewish  Deaf, there are an estimated 750,000 hearing-impaired Jews in the United  States. Temple Beth Solomon, he said, is one of a handful of synagogues for the  hearing-impaired in the United States -- the others are in New York, Chicago  and San Francisco.  </P> <P> Temple Beth Solomon was organized in 1960. With comedian George Jessel in  attendance, worshipers held their first Sabbath service in the Chadwick Chapel  of Temple Israel of Hollywood. For the first five years, members traveled to  various host temples and became known as "the mobile congregation."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seeking Home  </P> <P> By the mid-1960s, congregants were eager for a permanent location. They found  it in 1965 when the temple bought the Arleta building, which belonged to  another synagogue, Temple Beth Torah.  </P> <P> One of the initial questions was: With what branch of the Jewish religion --  Reform, Conservative, or Orthodox -- would the new synagogue affiliate? Henkin  said the temple's founders approached the Orthodox and Reform communities, but  were accepted only by the Reform movement. Some Orthodox Jews, he added, have  not always accepted the hearing impaired.  </P> <P> "There is a body of uninformed literature among some Orthodox Jews," Henkin  said, "which makes assumptions that because they can't hear, they can't think  clearly, a body of law which severly restricts deaf people. But outside of that  part of the Orthodox community, this attitude is seen as anachronistic."  </P> <P> Most congregations, Henkin said, have been receptive to deaf worshipers. Other  synagogues have invited Jews from Temple Beth Solomon to attend their services.  Temple Valley Beth Shalom in Encino, for example, is currently making plans to  help celebrate the 1991 bar mitzvah of Brad Cohen, whose Encino family belongs  to both synagogues. A rabbi from each temple will lead the ceremony for Cohen,  who is hearing impaired.  </P> <P> "Temple Beth Solomon is a perfect example of the Jewish community attitude that  all its members are entitled to express its tradition," said Neal Schnall,  principal of the Hebrew School at Temple Valley Beth Shalom.  </P> <P> Yet, Henkin said, while many synagogues welcome hearing impaired congregants,  they don't provide the resources to make worship meaningful for them.  </P> <P> "They don't understand all the issues," Henkin said. "Finding interpreters for  $10 or $20 an hour can get expensive, and they will do it maybe once a month."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sign Language  </P> <P> Said Florsheim, who is hearing impaired: "I would love to see rabbis learning  sign language and understanding deaf culture so they can serve us better. We  would love to see many temples for the deaf, but it's unrealistic due to the  small number of deaf Jews in other cities."  </P> <P> At Temple Beth Solomon, Henkin read from the prayer book while worshipers sign.  Congregants include hearing-impaired children and adults, along with some  hearing parents of deaf children.  </P> <P> The absence of music is very noticeable, especially in a religion which regards  song as a powerful expression. Henkin said the temple occasionally, on special  holidays, employs a choir of hearing impaired people, who sign simultaneously  with the songs, "but generally, we find it part of the hearing culture, which  has no place in a deaf synagogue."  </P> <P> Hyman, who was born with a slight hearing loss and didn't become totally deaf  until 15 years ago, admits she misses music in services but added, "Look at  what I am getting instead, Judaism in a language I can understand."  </P> <P> Temple Beth Solomon, said Hyman, has helped her renew her sense of dignity,  lost when hearing difficulties caused her embarrassment at her temple in West  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "They gave me a front seat at their high holiday services and that's a good  thing because front seats are usually very costly," said Hyman, of Van Nuys.  "But I couldn't understand and follow. I stood up long after everyone else, and  I sat down long after everyone else."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Observing Laws  </P> <P> Other congregants share Hyman's appreciation for Temple Beth Solomon, even if  they may differ on how customs and laws should be observed. At Temple Beth  Solomon, members of all three branches of Judaism must learn to coexist. Even  though the temple is affiliated with the Reform movement, there are members who  are Conservative and Orthodox.  </P> <P> "I guess it illustrates in a very tangible way the manner in which people can  meet each other in spite of differences and be united," said Barbara Boyd,  congregation president.  </P> <P> Boyd recalled a temple banquet three years ago when she was persuaded by  Slomovic Gunter to serve kosher food. Boyd said she wanted to argue that a  reform synagogue didn't need kosher food at banquets. "She argued back," Boyd  said, " 'Yes, but do you want to reach the whole Jewish deaf community?' And I  had no argument left. So we decided on a kosher event, and it was a tremendous  success."  </P> <P> Slomovic Gunter said when she first became involved in Temple Beth Solomon in  1982 she brought her Orthodox upbringing with her.  </P> <P> "I felt TBS wasn't Jewish enough," she said, "and that rubbed some of the  long-timers, so it took some maturity on my part to be more tolerant of other  people."  </P> <P> Slomovic Gunter belongs to the younger set of hearing impaired Jews at a temple  dominated by older men and women; one recent Friday night service attracted  only a few of the younger crowd.  </P> <P> She said young deaf Jews often marry outside their faith, and when the issue of  religious affiliation is brought up in the family, they choose another religion  because they haven't received much, if any, education in Judaism.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hope for Future  </P> <P> The lack of youth involvement causes concern among the congregation's leaders.  They hope to keep young people interested by promoting activities such as  weekend camp outings, and they point to members Brad Cohen and Nathan Caldwell  as their hope for the future.  </P> <P> Brad, 10, who takes bar mitzvah classes once a week with Rabbi Henkin, said  Temple Beth Solomon serves both academic and social needs.  </P> <P> "I like to listen to stories about what the Jewish people did a long time ago,"  Brad said, as his father interpreted. "And I like to have good friends. I can  understand so much more than at the (hearing) synagogue."  </P> <P> His parents, Lou and Shelley, who are both hearing, said Temple Beth Solomon  has brought their family closer together.  </P> <P> "It makes the family a whole now," said Shelley Cohen. "There's only so much  Jewish education you can teach at home. If you start it at home, it doesn't  have the same impact. Now we can build on the things he learns at temple."  </P> <P> Nathan, 11, of Panorama City attends Sunday classes, and looks forward to a  life of regular enrichment in Jewish culture. "I want to learn more about God,"  he said.  </P> <P> His mother, Sharon Caldwell, who is also deaf, said Nathan shows a much greater  interest in Jewish customs and history than she did as a teen-ager. Like many  deaf Jews who attended hearing synagogues, she says she never fit in, and  showed no interest in further religious instruction. She is excited her son  will be able to carry on the Jewish tradition.  </P> <P> Slomovic Gunter acknowledges she will never catch all the richness of Jewish  culture because of her hearing loss. But Temple Beth Solomon will bring her  much closer than she ever imagined.  </P> <P> "I just learn to adapt to the situation that's been forced on me," she said.  "I'm proud to be a Jew in my own way."  </P></p>

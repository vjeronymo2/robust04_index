			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / International Company News: AssiDoman reports 65% rise AssiDoman, the newly-formed Swedish forestry group, yesterday announced a 65 per cent increase in first-quarter profits and increased its forecast for the full year. Profits after financial items rose to SKr344m (Dollars 43.5m) from SKr208m after a 4 per cent increase in sales to SKr3.86bn. The company, which was partially privatised in March, predicts full-year profits of more than SKr1.5bn due to increased efficiency and the improving outlook for the pulp and paper industry. Last year profits were SKr876m. The Swedish government sold off a 49 per cent stake in AssiDoman in March, raising SKr7.6bn in Sweden's biggest privatisation to date. The privatisation followed the merger of two state-owned forestry groups, Assi and Doman, at the start of the year. A third company, NCB, which was majority state-owned, is being merged with the group and has been consolidated from the start of the year. The first-quarter performance showed the benefits of stronger operating results from Skog &amp; Tra, which lifted profits to SKr311m from SKr223m, while Kraft Products achieved a SKr11m profit after a SKr36m loss. The group raised overall operating profits to SKr390m from SKr285m, despite falling profits in the carton and packaging divisions. Financial outlays fell to SKr46m from SKr77m due to lower interest rates and a reduced net debt. NCB made a SKr24m profit from a SKr41m loss. AssiDoman's shares closed yesterday at SKr162. Individuals paid SKr138 a share at privatisation.</p>

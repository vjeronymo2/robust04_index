He added: "Lebanon is still in  intensive care and will not be able to be moved from it unless  stability is achieved. And the Lebanese people's interests lie  in the building of a strong and capable state." He stressed  that "Syria has no ambitions in Lebanon."    Khaddam was speaking to a delegation from the [Lebanese]  Chamber of Commerce and the Lebanese Banks Association headed by  'Adnan al-Qassar, which visited Damascus the day before  yesterday [12 January] at the invitation of the Syrian Chambers  of Commerce and Industry Federation to discuss ways of  reinforcing economic relations between the two countries in the  implementation of brotherhood, cooperation, and coordination.    The Syrian vice president pointed out that "there are many  things which prompt the Lebanese and the Syrians to cooperate.  And if peace is established in the region, Israel's aim will be  to control economic, tourist, and other resources; the Arabs  will become a consumer market for it; and it will become an  agent for the big economic establishments. In the West there  are no friendships, but interests, and the quarter close to the  West's interests is Israel."    Khaddam said that "the big loser from that will be those who  have money and Lebanon, because Lebanon is the most competitive  country, and if Israel hits this center, the scene will become  vacant for it. This is why attempts to strain the situation in  Lebanon cannot be excluded from this context."    He said: "But if peace is not established in the region, the  world economic situation is moving toward forming blocs and  economic groupings, while our problem in the Arab states is that  we behave as though each state is a world superpower. If we had  established a common Arab market when the idea first emerged, we  would have attained unity by now. And if Lebanon and Syria can  proceed together -- even through a modest experiment -- in this  connection, this would serve the interests of the two countries  and the other Arab states. We are open to anything that  achieves this aim."    He added that "Syria has achieved major advances in 25  years,  even in the petroleum field, because we know what we are doing  and what we are going to achieve. We have no ambitions in  Lebanon. We must take the interests of the two countries into  account and act on that basis. Our common interests are in our  Arab affiliation. If we do not correct our relations --  political and economic -- there will be no Arab homeland."    He pointed out that "Lebanon can recover its status and  prosperity quickly, because of the Lebanese people's flexibility  and broad experience. But that cannot be achieved without the  existence of a state. This state cannot be brought about unless  everyone contributes to bolstering it. There are attempts to  disrupt the situation in Lebanon. Recent security bombings are  part of these attempts. In the end they all serve Israel's  interests. Lebanon is still in intensive care, and today we see  in it for the first time a serious attempt to build a state and  enable the institutions to play their roles. The Lebanese  people's interests lie in building a strong and capable state.  If Lebanon does not have the stability, it will not be able to  move out of intensive care."    He stressed "bolstering the Lebanese state and putting  Syria's capabilities at its disposal to restore stability and  begin the building stage in Lebanon." He said that "any  cooperation between the private sectors in Lebanon and Syria is  a national demand which we support with all our capabilities."</p>

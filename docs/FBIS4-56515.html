			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edilson Coelho] </F>   [Text] The principal national weapons manufacturers are  looking abroad for an alternative to their low domestic sales.  The main Brazilian arms industries -- CBC [Brazilian Ammunition  Company], Taurus, Rossi, Boito, Urco, and Imbel [War Materiel  Industry] -- which are currently earning $300 million annually,  export about 75 percent of their production. CBC, which belongs  to the Arbi and Imbel groups, is investing $2.7 million in a  publicity campaign to promote its Pump CBC 12 shotgun. CBC  expects to sell 9,000 of the shotguns this year, at a price  between $400 and $800 each.    Domestic sales amount to nearly 220,000 units per year.  Taurus and Rossi from Rio Grande do Sul sell mainly handguns  and revolvers. They account for nearly 90 percent of legal arms  sales. CBC believes it may double its domestic sales this year.  The publicity campaign, which began in March and which will  last until December, with striking adds that explain the  product, is part of the sales support strategy. Distribution is  the strong point of CBC. "We deliver our product within five  days," says Operations Manager Marco Aurelio Salvany. CBC sells  its products through 500 stores.    CBC turned to the domestic market after a restructuring  process which combined productivity and a dollar price reduction  of up to 54 percent. "We will expand domestically, taking  advantage of our increased production capability," Salvany said.    CBC has invested $1.8 million in machinery, equipment, and  new processes. CBC will invest $10 million in 1994 and 1995 to  increase its ammunition production.    CBC is considered the largest Brazilian ammunition  manufacturer with a production of 221 million cartridges in  1992. It also produced a total 32,000 units of the Pump CBC 12.  CBC sells ammunition in the United States under the trademark  Magtech. It expects to manufacture 90,000 units this year, only  10 percent of which will remain in Brazil.    With the recession at the beginning of the 1990's, other  national manufacturers targeted the international market. As a  result of large export operations -- mainly to the United States  -- Taurus opened the Taurus International Manufacturing  subsidiary which is responsible for 52 percent of its $51.2  million sales last year. It produced 400,000 handguns and  revolvers. Taurus is the third most popular handgun in the  United States.    For Rossi, which was founded 105 years ago, selling abroad  was a way to survive. Rossi's .38-caliber 5-shot revolver --  the main competitor for Taurus in revolvers -- is the company's  best-selling product. It accounts for $30 million worth of  annual sales. In 1989 Rossi adopted a Total Quality Program to  improve productivity and to compete with the United States and  Canada where it must compete with the famous Colt, Rugger, and  Smith and Wesson revolvers.    "When the recession hit the United States we had good  quality  and the best market prices," says Rossi Sales Manager Paulo  Schilling. He said that 60 percent of Rossi's production is  exported.    The Boito company, a small hunting weapon manufacturer, is  based in Veranopolis, Rio Grande do Sul. It has annual sales of  $12 million and is also engaged in exports. Following the  philosophy of its founder, Elias Ruas Amantino, the company has  never produced the personal security weapons that could increase  its sales in Brazil and in the countries to where it sends 95  percent of its production. "We know we are losing an opportunity  to make money, but we respect the principle established by our  founder," says Commercial Manager Manoel Ruas Amantino.    CBC was founded in 1926 by the Matarazzo family to produce  bullets for hunting weapons. The company currently belongs to  the Arbi and Imbel groups. It is investing $10 million to  transform itself into one of the most modern ammunition  manufacturers in the world. With the purchase of new, totally  automated equipment from Germany, Italy, and Belgium, CBC will  soon be producing four cartridges per second.    "We will be able to modify our production at any moment  without quality loss," says Operations Manager Marco Aurelio  Salvany. Installed in Maua, greater Sao Paulo, the company  manufactures from .22-caliber ammunition to projectiles for FAB  [Brazilian Air Force] fighters. Of the $100 million CBC plans  to earn this year, 88 percent will come from cartridge sales.    Beside the modernization project -- quality control will be  computerized -- the CBC is linking its network of distributors.  "The sales team will work on cellular telephone-linked notebooks  [preceding word given in English]," Salvany says. Orders will  be logged in the central CBC computer so as to inform the  production line. "The saving of time is essential for  competitiveness," he says. The idea is to deliver orders within  24 hours.    Having conquered the Brazilian market, CBC intends to do the  same abroad, where it has 45 distributors selling in 65  countries. "We want to be among the main weapon and ammunition  manufacturers in the world," Salvany said.    Report on the weapons market in 1993    Sales: $300 million    Weapons sold: 225,000 units in Brazil and 775,000 units  abroad.    Regional participation in sales: Southeast (44 percent);  South (16 percent); Center West (15 percent); Northeast (20  percent); and North (5 percent).    Ammunition sales in Brazil: 97.9 million cartridges.    Ammunition exports: 114 million cartridges.    Companies: CBC (Sao Paulo); Rossi (Rio Grande do Sul);  Taurus (Rio Grande do Sul); Boito (Rio Grande do Sul); Urco (Sao  Paulo); and Imbel (Sao Paulo).    Jobs: 10,000 direct and indirect jobs    Most sold model: .38-caliber five-shot revolver (price:  $250)    Investment to increase production: $10 million this year  in CBC.</p>

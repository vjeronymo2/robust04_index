			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow April 17 ITAR-TASS -- Russian independent  television's Sunday analytical programme Itogi opened its last  issue with a series of reports about the abrupt aggravation of  Russian-Ukrainian relations caused by the occupation by  Ukrainian commandos of some Black Sea Fleet targets.    The incident was eventually settled and the presidents of  the  two countries, Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, reached an  agreement on Black Sea Fleet. The agreement evoked  "interpretations which differed in principle", the Itogi host  said.    According to Ukrainian Defence Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy,  the agreement reached is evidence that "Russia acknowledged that  the Russian Federation and Ukraine are equal partners."    Black Sea Fleet Commander Admiral Eduard Baltin said in an  interview that "up to date Ukraine owes the Black Sea Fleet more  than 17 billion roubles", which is a clear sign that Ukraine is  "trying to live on somebody else's account." Speaking about last  week's events, the admiral said they reflect the intention "to  cover up the present economic situation with political  ambitions".    The unification of the monetary systems of Russia and  Belarus, the agreement on which was signed last week, has evoked  mixed reaction in both countries, the Itogi host said.    According to Yegor Gaydar, the leader of Russia's Choice,  "this is a purely political decision, and the economy was  sacrificed to politics".    State Duma Deputy Sergey Glazyev said "the unification of  the  monetary systems must be followed by a transition to a customs  union and further integration".    Yabloko coalition Leader Grigoriy Yavlinskiy said there can  be no "clear-cut response to the agreement signed because its  specifics are not known".    Public opinion poll conducted on order from Itogi revealed  that 36 per cent of those polled favoured the unification of the  monetary systems of the two republics, while 41 per cent said it  should not be done.    "If the reached accord eventually strengthens inflation in  Russia, the government will be in for much trouble," Itogi  concluded.    As concerns Belarus [Byelorussia], its former leader  Stanislav Shushkevich, who has already joined the race for  presidency in the republic, criticised the agreement, stressing  that it makes no mention "of the Chernobyl catastrophe, which  claims 15 per cent of all budget allocations in the republic  every year".    Itogi announced that the Commonwealth summit, which ended in  Moscow, adopted a number of documents, mainly recommendations,  which have no direct effect. According to Boris Yeltsin, who  spoke at the closing press conference, "the CIS is not a rigid  factory management".    As concerns decisions in the military field, Itogi noted  that  "judging by all appearances, Russia will have to shoulder the  main burden". "The bulk of the tasks has fallen to the share of  Russia," Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev said.    Both Itogi and Voskresenye reported on the centenary of  Nikita Khrushchev and stressed the contradictory and  extraordinary character of his activity.    A public opinion survey ordered by Itogi, revealed that 37  per cent of those polled recall Khrushchev's role in exposing  the cult of the personality (37 per cent), the large-scale  cultivation of maize (24 per cent), country-wide housing  construction (24 per cent), as well as with the launch of the  first artificial Earth satellite, the first manned flight into  space, the development of the virgin lands and the Caribbean  crisis.    The second part of the programme was devoted to  international  affairs, and opened with a report on Russian President Boris  Yeltsin's "strange" visit to Spain, which Itogi described as "a  test of the Russian president's ability to run the state."    "Everybody noted that the president was in good shape," the  Itogi host stressed.    Itogi highlighted the aggravation of the situation near  Gorazde, where the NATO aviation shelled Serb targets. Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said in an exclusive interview  with Itogi that the new initiative proposed by him in Yugoslavia  calls for the unblocking of Gorazde and work towards an  agreement on an end to military activities along the entire  frontline.    The minister, who was just back in Moscow from a trip to  Serbia on President Yeltsin's instructions, said "the  realisation of these measures will create a favourable situation  for the resumption of the negotiations on the political  settlement".    Andrey Kozyrev also said that every step taken by the Serb  side will be accompanied, for our part, "by a resolute raising  of the question about the lifting of the sanctions". He  stressed that "such a consistent progress is a must". "I think  Russia has remained the only strong player on this arena, who  has not marred its reputation with irresponsible actions," the  minister said.    He reported that Russia has been informed by the West about  the latest developments around Gorazde. As a result of  consultations, we succeeded in convincing them that one should  not make haste this time around," Kozyrev said. "It is necessary  to consult Russia, we must act in concert", Kozyrev stressed.</p>

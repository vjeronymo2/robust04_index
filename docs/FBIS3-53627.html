The casualties suffered by terrorist  elements as a result of IRGC vigilance has increased ten times,  and included top ringleaders, he said.    Zolqadr was outlining the corps' activities on the eve of  IRGC Day marking the birth anniversary of Imam Hoseyn (peace be  upon him) whose selfless struggle has continued to inspire  revolutionaries in every age and era.    The prophet's (pbuh) younger grandson who tasted the cup of  martyrdom in Karbala in 61 A.H. (680 A.D.) in order to resurrect  Islam was born in al-Madinah on the 3rd of Sha'ban (falling this  year on Jan. 16) in the fourth year of the Hijra.    Zolqadr said that in the fight against drug trafficking,  IRGC  personnel have destroyed 50 convoys of international traffickers  and seized 14.5 tons of illicit drugs this year.    He added that the IRGC killed in shoot-outs or arrested 940  smugglers in the eastern part of the country in the said period.</p>

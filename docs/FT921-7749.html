			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: CountyGlen losses leap to IPounds 153,000 CountyGlen, the Irish property investor and trader, continued to seek suitable acquisitions; search and evaluation costs were reflected in a loss of IPounds 153,000 (Pounds 141,700) for the six months to October 31. That came from turnover of IPounds 38,000, and compared with a deficit of Pounds 49,000 on turnover of IPounds 52,000 in the previous year. Losses per share were 4.3p (1.5p). The principal focus of activity was a joint venture on the proposed retail development in the Tallaght area of Dublin. Though no longer a likely investment, discussions continue to recover costs which were incurred.</p>

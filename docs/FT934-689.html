			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Monetary tests apres le deluge After the summer currency upsets that forced an emergency widening of fluctuation bands in Europe's exchange rate mechanism, French monetary policy has entered a period of relative calm. The French franc's recovery this month to pre-crisis levels against the D-Mark represents a modest success for the now independent Bank of France. The Bank has been able to make steady cuts in interest rates without damaging the franc's rally from its undervalued levels in August. However, the French authorities should resist the temptation to order any triumphant hoisting of the tricolor. France is heading towards the presidential election in 1995 at a time of low growth and 3m-plus unemployment. The economic and political strains that caused the midsummer pressure on the franc have abated. It would be unwise to conclude that they will not reappear. Three-month French interest rates, at about 6 1/2 per cent, are now only 0.3 point above rates in Germany - 5 1/2 points below the levels at the start of the year. Ten-year French bond yields are down to 5.7 per cent, 0.05 point above German levels, representing a fall of nearly 2 1/2 points since January. However, the French inflation rate is only 2 per cent, and still falling. French interest rates are thus still far too high to allow satisfactory recovery. Achieving further sustainable interest rate cuts, perhaps another 2 percentage points at the short end of the market, is an essential objective for next year. Competitive problems According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, France is weathering its worst two-year period for growth since 1945. French gross domestic product is forecast to rise just 1.1 per cent next year after a 0.9 per cent contraction this year. The rising French trade surplus appears to indicate that French exporters have only limited competitive problems. However, according to the OECD, French manufacturers in 1993 suffered a greater fall in export market share than any other industrialised country in Europe apart from Germany. The likelihood of a weaker D-Mark in coming months could give a modest economic stimulus to France and other countries linked to the D-Mark, by increasing opportunities for interest rate cuts. However, as long as France remains bedevilled by the key structural problem of inadequate employment creation, economic navigation will remain arduous. In its ERM policies since the summer, France has managed to fulfil a number of interrelated objectives. Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has reinforced his grip on policy. Indeed, the general applause given to Mr Balladur's successful manoeuvrings over the Gatt deal has been one of the factors behind the franc's recent firmness. Released from its unsustainable obligation to defend the previous narrow bands, the Bank of France has been able to repay its unprecedented foreign exchange debts built up at the high point of the crisis on July 30. By maintaining the central D-Mark/franc parity, France has kept alive the possibility of clinching the Maastricht goal of economic and monetary union later in the 1990s. Chief headaches It is precisely in the link between European and domestic policy, however, that Mr Balladur's chief headaches lie. After the breakdown of Franco-German monetary co-operation during the summer, rebuilding confidence between Bonn and Paris will be difficult. The French and German authorities are sensibly avoiding any talk of a speedy formal return to narrow bands. However, their evident fear that such a move would encourage now-quiescent currency speculators to return to the fray underlines their limited faith in the ERM's underlying strength. To achieve Emu, re-establishing French economic policy credibility is a necessary, but not sufficient condition. It will also require a degree of political consensus with Germany which was not evident during the summer. Successive French governments, however, regard Emu as an objective for which they are ready to make large sacrifices. For the time being, the mix of policies followed in Paris since the summer storm seems to offer France the best chance of eventually bringing the prize into reach.</p>

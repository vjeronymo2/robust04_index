			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["na/tl"-signed report: "CDU Sets a Sign for Citizens' </F> Society With Its New Basic Program"]    [Text] Hamburg -- The delegates of the Congress of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] in Hamburg unanimously adopted  the new basic program of the CDU with one abstention. It is  replacing the basic program adopted in Ludwigshafen in 1978.  The Hamburg program is the first all-German basic program of a  German party after reunification.    With the new program, the CDU is drawing conclusions from  the  intellectual and political changes in Germany, Europe, and the  whole world. The basic program is characterized by the general  motto "Freedom in responsibility." The idea of responsible  freedom belongs to the Christian concept of man of the CDU.    According to the chairman of the CDU committee responsible  for drafting the party principles, Reinhard Goehner, the program  follows the ideal of a free and responsible society, a citizens'  society as opposed to an individualistic-privatistic affluent  society. The "distribution society" is to be replaced by a  "responsible society."    The program does not include a proposal leading to higher  state expenditure, Goehner stressed. In areas where a higher  expenditure is required, funds should be shifted in a way that  no additional costs arise. This means that the CDU will have to  reduce the new indebtedness, which rose as a result of German  unification, and the state quota and taxes and charges.    The development of the social market economy into an  ecological and social market economy was the subject of a  controversial discussion at the party congress. As reported  yesterday, the delegates voted in favor of this change by 359 to  279 votes. The expansion of the social market economy to an  ecological and social market economy was primarily rejected by  representatives of the Economic Council and the social  committees. They were against watering down the trademark  social market economy.    According to Goehner, the development of the economic and  social system into an ecological and social market economy and  the preservation of God's Creation are the major messages of the  new basic program. In order to use the strength and the  innovative power of the economy to a greater extent to protect  the environment, the CDU want to integrate ecological elements  in the tax law more than in the past, and it wants to introduce  environmental surcharges, possibilities for compensation, and  regulations concerning certificates and liability.    Largely in conformity with the action program for growth and  employment, which was also adopted by the CDU Congress, the  basic program contains a catalogue of measures and demands  designed to strengthen Germany's attractiveness as a business  location and to create new jobs.    With the basic program, the CDU acquires a stronger profile  as the "party of the family." After a heated debate, the  congress voted in favor of family splitting. In order to  safeguard the multi-generation agreement [to finance pensions]  in view of the demographic changes, the CDU advocates  family-friendly measures in the tax and social insurance law.  It wants to acknowledge the additional burdens resulting for  parents from child education to a greater extent as  contributions within the pension system.    The pension insurance is to remain contribution-oriented and  thus performance-oriented. The CDU advocates linking the  pensions with the development of the wages of the employees and  their prosperity. Labor Minister Bluem again rejected uniform  pensions. A basic pension would be a service for drop-outs,  financed by others.    The social committees expressed satisfaction with the  results  of the discussions of the program. Social gaps of the draft  have been eliminated. The prospect of a "negative tax,"  proposed by the Christian Democratic Employees and the Economic  Federation, was adopted. This is a milestone in the sphere of  tax policies.    In the discussion about the part of the CDU's new basic  program devoted to domestic policies, several speakers attacked  the opposition in Bonn, the Social Democratic Party of Germany  [SPD]. The legacy of the so-called 1968-generation continues to  largely dominate the policy and program of the SPD, Bundestag  member Rupert Scholz from the CDU criticized. For the CDU in  Germany, this is nit acceptable -- neither politically, legally,  nor ethically. It is true that the state has to ensure the  freedom of its citizens, but freedom must also serve the  community and take into consideration moral and ethical values.  "Unconditional and irresponsible libertinage" is unacceptable.    Late on Tuesday [22 February], a debate about the  significance of plebiscites in the CDU's new basic program took  place. The CDU of Saxony demanded that the sentence should be  deleted from the draft program according to which the CDU  rejects referendums at the federal level. This option must at  least be kept open for the new laender, a speaker demanded.  Scholz and CDU Bundestag member Friedbert Pflueger, however,  were against that. Only in a parliamentary democracy can the  consensus be achieved that is required in a pluralist society,  Scholz stated. He accused the SPD of discrediting parliamentary  democracy with its support for plebiscites. Pflueger warned  against devaluating parliamentary decisions through referendums.  Finally the few delegates who were left late in the evening  spoke in favor of not eliminating the sentence that the CDU  rejects referendums at the federal level.    Interior Minister Manfred Kanther defended the law on the  fight against crime, which will be discussed at the Bundestag  today, Thursday. It includes two dozens of important measures  that cannot be renounced only because it was not possible to  achieve a consensus on other major issues. Referring to the  Free Democratic Party of Germany, which largely rejects the  "great bugging campaign," Kanther stressed that the alarming  crime rate among foreigners who stay in Germany for a short  period should not be concealed. On the other hand, the crime  rate among Germans and foreigners who stay in Germany for longer  periods is the same. Johannes Gerster, deputy chairman of the  Bundestag group of the CDU/Christian Social Union [CSU], also  spoke in favor of stressing the issue of internal security  during the election campaign.    The debate about European policies was unexpectedly  peaceful.  The old basic program still included the goal of a democratic  European federal state, to be organized on the principle of  subsidiarity. However, in the discussion about the new CDU  basic program, the element of a federal state was accorded less  significance. After a short debate, the CDU Congress agreed on  the formulation, adopted earlier by the Executive Committee,  that the European Union should be shaped in a "free, democratic,  federal, and subsidiary manner." In his speech, Finance  Minister Theo Waigel tried to play down the differences between  the CDU and parts of the CSU over Europe's future. Waigel  stated that the treaty on the European Union does not provide  for federal states.    In their speeches, the CDU officials were generally critical  of the press. As a result, restrictive regulations for the  media were included in the basic program. Thus, the right to  counter-declarations should be widened for the affected persons,  and every citizen should be granted a legal claim for damages  against the press and the radio.    The SPD criticized the CDU's new basic program. The CDU has  abandoned the social market economy and embarked on the path of  a "slightly modified Thatcherism." The tradition-conscious  Christian Democratic Employees are apparently losing influence.  The new program will not stop "the draining process concerning  contents and personnel, for which Kohl is personally  responsible," SPD spokeswoman Dagmar Wiebusch stated.</p>

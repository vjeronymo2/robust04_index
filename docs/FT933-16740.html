			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / World Trade News: EC chemicals curbs sought EUROPE'S chemical industry association has called on the EC to apply trade measures against east and central European chemicals manufacturers. Cefic, the European Chemical Industry Council, has asked for intervention after substantial increases in imports from the east at low prices. It claims these have not always been set by market economy principles. The body warns that parts of the EC industry could be forced to close plants and shed jobs. The five areas affected are fertilisers, soda ash, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), caprolactam (a precursor of nylon), and melamine (a plastic). PVC imports from the east have increased from 84,000 tonnes in 1989 to about 270,000 tonnes last year, while prices have fallen about 30 per cent. Soda ash imports have also risen, from 27,000 tonnes to 162,000 tonnes, as prices fell 10 per cent. Caprolactam imports shot up from 606 tonnes to 33,000, as prices fell 30 per cent. Nevertheless the EC's overall surplus in chemicals trade with eastern neighbours rose to Ecu1.01bn (Pounds 774m) from Ecu527m in 1990. ICI - DuPont swap, Page 20</p>

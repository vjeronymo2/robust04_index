And if actor Jim Warren, creator of Soap Star! trading cards, has his  way, you may soon be hearing, "I'll trade you a Billy Warlock for a Melissa  Brennan."  </P> <P> A Soap Star! set ($6) -- which includes 12 full-color cards, one of which is a  soap alumnus who's made it big -- features such popular performers as Kin  Shriner (Scott) of "General Hospital" and Robin Mattson (Gina) of "Santa  Barbara" and provides bios and little-known facts about the stars.  "Surprisingly," Warren says, "one of every 10 orders is from a man."  </P> <P>  Soap Star! cards: $6 and SASE to Red Star, P.O. Box 3555, Hollywood, Calif.  90078.  </P> <P> ROBIN TUCKER  </P></p>

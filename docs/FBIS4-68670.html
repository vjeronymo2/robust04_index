			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Polonitskiy under the rubric "Provinces": </F> "Bryansk Oblast Duma Began Its Work: Seats Divided Between  Agrarians and Local Authorities"]    [Text] Bryansk--On a second attempt, the Bryansk Oblast  Duma has convened its first session. Elections to the new  representative body took place in six out of nine three-mandate  districts in the Bryansk region. There were 150 contenders for  27 seats in the oblast duma. The greatest activism was shown by  voters in rural districts--it was thanks to them that 18  candidates got their mandates. Voters in the three districts in  the oblast center did not turn out in the numbers needed to make  up the required 25 percent that would make the elections valid,  and have lost their representation in the duma.    Of those elected, 50 percent are agrarians, and the rest are  members of the executive branch from a rayon to oblast level.  The statute on elections to the oblast duma envisages that  one-third of the deputies will work full-time; however, so far  not a single deputy of the current term has dared to leave his  administrative or directive job and become a professional  politician. Deputies will consider the question of temporary  rules for the oblast duma, elect a chairman and his deputy, and  form permanent committees.</p>

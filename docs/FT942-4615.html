			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Distaste grows for Italy's far right The growing challenge to the presence of neo-fascist members of the new Italian government in European Union institutions widened further yesterday, when another EU ministerial meeting was held up by a protest from Belgium. Yesterday's incident, at a council of environment ministers in Luxembourg, follows a denunciation of the Italian neo-fascist leadership at the weekend by Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and the decision on Tuesday by all four main Dutch parties to boycott the Commission if Rome names a far-right candidate as one of its two commissioners. At the end of last month, an EU telecommunications council was held up when the Belgian Socialist minister, Mr Elio de Rupio, refused to shake hands with his Italian opposite number, Mr Giuseppe Tatarella, deputy prime minister for the far-right National Alliance (AN-MSI), 'deploring' his presence in a democratic forum. Yesterday, Mr Jacques Santkin, the Belgian Socialist environment minister, marked the presence of another Italian neo-fascist, environment minister Altero Matteoli, with a statement underlining the obligation of EU ministers to defend democratic principles. The recent commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings to liberate Europe from fascism, he said, 'should make us reaffirm loudly and clearly the fundamentals of democracy'. Mr Matteoli replied that 'the principles of freedom and democracy referred to will never be put in doubt'. He also pointed out that President Bill Clinton began his D-Day remembrance trip to Europe in Italy, and had showed no compunction in meeting AN-MSI ministers and the party leader, Mr Gianfranco Fini. Mr Delors, however, responded on French television at the weekend to recent remarks by Mr Fini by saying that 'we must move from a vigorous vigilance' of the Italian far-right 'to a more concerned vigilance'. Mr Fini had said that the fascism of Mussolini had been positive until the 1938 racial laws; that Europe had lost its cultural identity as a result of the D-Day landings; and that 'there are moments when freedom is not an essential value'. Mr Delors said: 'I read (this) with anger in my heart.' The position of the Dutch parties was underlined by Mr Gijs de Vries, a prominent right-wing liberal MEP, who warned that the European parliament would veto the new Commission if it contained an Italian neo-fascist. The dominant Socialist group at Strasbourg, set to bolster its position in this week's Euro-elections, voted in May to boycott all Italian neo-fascists in EU institutions. Italian government officials indicated yesterday that it was unlikely that Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, would name an AN-MSI candidate for Brussels, favouring instead Mr Enrico Vinci, current secretary-general of the European parliament, and Mr Marco Panella, the maverick Radical party MEP and national MP. Some EU diplomats also said Mr Berlusconi was unlikely to back Belgium's premier, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, favoured by France and Germany to succeed Mr Delors next year, in the light of successive Belgian snubs to his ministers. All the main candidates to succeed Mr Delors are courting the Italian premier before the Corfu EU summit on June 24-25.</p>

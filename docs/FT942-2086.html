			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Government squares up for long rail dispute The government appeared to be digging in for a lengthy confrontation with the RMT rail union yesterday as ministers repeatedly attacked the union's 'irresponsible' pay claim. Amid angry Commons exchanges, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, condemned the strike planned for tomorrow and warned that some passengers would not return to the railway. It also emerged that Mr MacGregor has established a committee of senior ministers to monitor the strike by signals staff and guide the government's response. The committee met for the first time yesterday to discuss the prospects for further railway chaos if Aslef, the train drivers' union, also decides to strike. Talks aimed at averting a second 24-hour strike by signals staff were under way last night at Acas, the conciliation service. The talks were delayed by 90 minutes when management of Railtrack, the state-owned railway infrastructure company, arrived late. Union officials said they were pessimistic about the prospects of ending the dispute. In the Commons, Mr MacGregor said it was 'damaging to the railway for the unions to undertake a series of strikes on an 11 per cent, no-strings pay claim'. He told MPs at question time that Railtrack wanted to achieve a settlement based on talks on restructuring, which would be separate from the company's 2.5 per cent pay offer. He also dismissed claims that Railtrack had spent more on refurbishing its headquarters than the estimated cost of settling the strike. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, blamed the government for intervening to order Railtrack to withdraw a proposed pay offer of 5.7 per cent.</p>

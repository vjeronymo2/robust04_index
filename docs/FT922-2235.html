			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Observer: Back to business The Conservatives may still not be the most popular party in Scotland but there is little doubt that in dealing with the media during the election they were the nicest and best equipped of the Scottish political parties. All credit to their 32-year-old chief press officer, Alice Luce. She was promoted to the post only three weeks before polling when her predecessor Brian Townsend suddenly resigned. So it seems somewhat crass of her bosses to sack her along with five others in post-electoral cost-cutting at head office. In the macho style of City of London firings, the normally diplomatic party chairman Lord Sanderson ordered her to clear her desk and leave the building at once. Then he replaced her with his personal assistant, David Watt. Luce, who had worked for the party for four years, feels badly let down, especially as - for the first time in Scottish Tory general election campaigns since 1979 - this year's ended with the party increasing both its vote and its number of seats. The party's 'commitment to employing women in high places seems rather hollow,' she says. Lady Thatcher would doubtless agree.</p>

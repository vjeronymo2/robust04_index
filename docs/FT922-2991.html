			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Books: No fun finding father THE LOST FATHER by Mona Simpson Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 14.99, 506 pages MONA SIMPSON'S critically acclaimed 1986 debut novel, Anywhere But Here, provided an exhaustively detailed account of a relationship between a mother and daughter. Now, in her follow-up, The Lost Father, Simpson explores the relationship between that daughter, Mayan Stevenson, and her father, a wayward Egyptian-born professor, John Atassi. The difference is that the father is absent, having disappeared when Mayan was a young girl into the vast American wilderness of unlisted phone numbers and unregistered employment. Mayan is now 28, a lonely medical student living in New York City. Acutely aware that her unresolved feelings for her dad are causing her deep emotional trouble, especially with men, she decides to hunt him down. She hires private detectives, phones the FBI and badgers distant relatives. Gradually, finding John Atassi becomes an obsession, dominating her waking life and clouding her dreams. Her life savings are soon exhausted, her relationships with friends and lovers compromised. And yet, the shards of information she picks up prove more frustrating than enlightening, painting a cubist portrait of a wastrel and con-man who does not want to be found. Undaunted, Mayan sets out in search of him, to Wisconsin, to the Montana college where her father worked, even to his Egyptian birthplace. Gradually, the strain begins to take its toll on her, not simply the wear and tear of the search but also the psychic bruising brought about by accepting the fact that he has well and truly abandoned her. She is afflicted by the cruel truth that 'all you have to do to become somebody's God is disappear.' Just when she seems on the verge of wrecking her life she finds him, living a life of unrivalled blandness. He is no god at all, but rather a charming, spineless has-been feeding on dreams of missed glory. Having finally purged the demon of his absence, Mayan feels she can now get on with her life. The bare bones of this book suggest that it could have been compelling reading - there is something almost mythical about Simpson's overall conception, the way Mayan must travel though a labyrinth of dead-ends and trick corridors before coming to the truth. Some scenes are good enough to make you almost believe that the author deserves the ridiculously fulsome accolades heaped upon her by US critics. But, in the end, The Lost Father is crushed by the weight of its own detail. What could have been a effective 200-page tale becomes an unmanageable behemoth at over 500. Every time I felt myself getting caught up in Mayan's quest I was shunted off into a digression, usually a bit of writing school bravado. All this talent serves to remind you that it is the author speaking rather than her heroine, depriving the book of much of its potential emotional sting. Equally disappointing is the book's resolution, which degenerates into a series of aphorisms that add nothing to the book's psychological weight.</p>

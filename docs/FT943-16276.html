			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: Reichmann recruits Soros aide Mr Paul Reichmann's efforts to resurrect his family's property empire took another step forward with the appointment of two experienced executives to senior posts in recently-formed Reichmann companies. Mr Evan Marks, a close adviser to financier Mr George Soros, has been named chief executive of Reichmann International, the New York-based partnership between Mr Soros and the Reichmann family. Reichmann International acts as an adviser to Mr Soros's Quantum Realty Fund. Mr Vernon Schwartz, former president of Catellus Development, a large California-based developer in which Reichmann-owned Olympia &amp; York had a 15 per cent stake, was recently appointed to head Reichmann International Mexico. The Mexican company, which is also a joint venture between the Reichmanns and Mr Soros, is about to begin construction of a USDollars 500m development on the western outskirts of Mexico City and a Dollars 250m downtown office tower. Mr Schwartz, who will be based in Toronto, will also become chief executive of a new Reichmann-owned company, as yet unnamed, which will oversee the family's interests. The new Reichmann business operates from the same offices in Toronto occupied by Olympia &amp; York before it collapsed two years ago. Mr Paul Reichmann, with brother Albert still at his side, has recruited about a dozen executives. Among the recent arrivals is Mr Donald McCutchan, formerly Canada's ambassador to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>

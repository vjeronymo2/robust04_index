			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: BCE sells 16.5% stake in Talisman BCE, Canada's biggest tele-communications group, is quitting the energy business with the sale of 16.5 per cent of Talisman, formerly BP Canada, for CDollars 326m (USDollars 251m). BCE's 10.9m Talisman shares are being sold to a consortium of investment houses made up of Burns Fry, Gordon Capital, Nesbitt Thomsom and Toronto Dominion Securities at CDollars 30 a share. The investment group proposes to resell the shares through the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges with settlement due June 21. BCE, which is the parent company of Northern Telecom, diversified into energy via TransCanada PipeLines in the mid-1980s. In the past three years, it has sold its TCPL shares, but was left with control of Encor, TCPL's exploration unit. British Petroleum sold its 57 per cent stake in Talisman in May 1992 for CDollars 373m.</p>

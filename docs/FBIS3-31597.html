			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Members of the parliamentary National Democratic  Club of the Slovak National Party [SNS] headed by Ludovit Cernak  have decided to establish a new party with the working title  National Democratic Party [Narodno Demokraticka Strana]. In  this context our correspondent asked the leader of this group  Ludovit Cernak for a comment. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] How will the situation that has arisen  affect  the Slovak domestic political scene as a whole?    [Cernak] It will affect the domestic political situation. We  have to find a proper place, a place we belong to. We will have  to do this, so that a normal voter would recognize whose  policies are demagogic and who is genuinely interested in  defending Slovakia's interests. In the medium term, given the  people we have, given their ideas and their potential, I dare  say I will very quickly build a nationally oriented alternative  for Slovakia, an alternative that will not play second fiddle in  the early parliamentary elections.    [Correspondent] In what way are you going to sort out the  situation of the SNS National Democratic group in the parliament?    [Cernak] It is likely that the decision to expel us and to  urge us to surrender our mandates will not be made in the  parliament. But no matter what happens, we will retain our  membership in the deputies' group we have created and we will be  implementing the policy which the whole group and not only our  faction should have represented. We will give the correct names  to all the deeds and all the mishaps, so that the Slovak voter  will not succumb to populism again, so that this voter can  compare words with deeds.

			<p><P> October 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> MA AND KAHANE AT MUSIC CENTER  </P> <P> An event was clearly in the offing Monday at the Music Center as a large crowd  strolled in the plaza and queued for cellist Yo-Yo Ma's recital. That chamber  music could create such a stir is heartening indeed.  </P> <P> What transpired within the packed Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was more heartening  still, for Ma's rapport with his audience is achieved through a combination of  total musicianship and a friendly stage presence.  </P> <P> The cellist's choice of keyboard partners is likewise impossible to fault. On  this occasion it was pianist Jeffrey Kahane, who proved both a consistently  complementary collaborator.  </P> <P> The first two works on the program, both by Beethoven, were in fact the  pianist's show: the bubbly variations on Mozart's "Bei Mannern welche Liebe  fuhlen" and his mighty Sonata in C, Opus 102. In both, Kahane provided  animation, fluency and power, as well as a keen appreciation for his partner's  needs.  </P> <P> In the ensuing Shostakovich Sonata, the players meshed flawlessly, with Ma the  sweetly sad singer and Kahane projecting just enough of the requisite acerbity.  </P> <P> Whether in its original form or in the alternative editions for cello or flute  and piano, the Franck Violin Sonata has been worked to death and deserves a  rest. And from Ma's swooningly lush, shudderingly vibratoed reading one could  suspect him of overcompensating for its familiarity by overperforming. HERBERT  GLASS  </P></p>

According to  a decision by Major General Dani Yatom, the commander of the  Central Command, the curfew was lifted from the town early this  evening, except for the area near Bet Hadassah and the Avraham  Avinu courtyard. Only Arab residents who live in this area will  be allowed to enter this area. The wholesale market near the  Jewish settlement in Hebron will not reopen for the time being.  Our correspondent Moti Amir reports that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] reinforced its units in Hebron in order to  maintain order and to increase the sense of security for the  town's residents.</p>

The ticket is headed by Fernando  Pino Solanas, followed by Mary Sanchez, Carlos Auyero, and Juan  Pablo Cafiero.    The center-left alliance delayed the release of its  candidates' ticket due to a controversy that arose especially  over the third place, which was sought by "Juampi" Cafiero,  Auyero, and the People's Encounter [Encuentro Popular] party.    The two first places on the ticket and the merits of Juan  Pablo Cafiero (one of the FG constitutional reform bill's  drafters) were not objected to by anyone. The problem was that,  according to some leaders, the FG ticket had a heavy Peronist  bias with "Juampi" in third place, and the pluralist composition  advocated by the FG people was therefore reduced.    Afterward, there were tugs of war between the People's  Encounter and the New Progressive Space [Nuevo Espacio  Progresista] leaders. The New Progressive Space leaders finally  managed to place Auyero in the third place. In addition to  having a long political record, Auyero is a constitutional law  professor.    Auyero is followed by Maria Ines Brasesco from the Union of  Argentine Women, Dario Torres Molinas from the People's  Encounter, and Gustavo Cardessa from the Christian Democratic  Party.</p>

			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / Fugitive Schneider in contact Mr Jurgen Schneider, the fugitive German property magnate, has made contact through a lawyer with the Frankfurt prosecutor's office, for the first time since his disappearance three months ago, an official said yesterday. The lawyer had presented a power of attorney on behalf of both Mr Schneider and his wife Claudia, whose property empire collapsed when they disappeared, leaving debts of around DM5bn. His disappearance unleashed Germany's biggest financial scandal in years and embarrassed scores of banks and contractors who had crowned him the country's 'construction king'. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor said the authorities still had no indication of the Schneiders' whereabouts.</p>

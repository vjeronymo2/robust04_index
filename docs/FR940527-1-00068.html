			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> H. State Labor Market Option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In addition to the alternatives discussed above, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also considering a State labor market option (SLMO) under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which hospitals would be able to voluntarily design labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas within their own State boundaries. Although we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not formally proposing the SLMO at this time, we welcome  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments on this option. Under the SLMO, an application to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design labor market areas could be submitted by a group of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals or any entity that represents hospitals that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be affected under the SLMO (for example, a state hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association, the Office of the Governor, etc.). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application would have to include a statement signed by each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's chief executive or chief financial officer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supporting participation in the SLMO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SLMO is being considered on the premise that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals within a State may, in some circumstances, have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better information than HCFA concerning local labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competition between hospitals. Accordingly, we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering the SLMO along with the alternatives discussed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> above, which we believe would require legislative changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Absent changes to the statute, we believe that the SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would offer opportunities for hospitals to design labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas that are more reflective of local wage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions than the current system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 1. Criteria for Participating in a SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Below we describe some of the criteria we would apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine whether labor market areas under the SLMO could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be approved. (We have not fully designed or specified the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitations for creating labor market areas under the SLMO,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and we are interested in any comments from the public for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developing criteria under which a SLMO would be approved.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, we envision that hospitals participating in a SLMO  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could design labor market areas under the following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> restrictions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;We are considering limiting approval of labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas under the SLMO to cases in which there is unanimous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support among hospitals. (We may also consider use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``overwhelming support'' as a criterion rather than unanimous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> support. We likely would specify a percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating hospitals that must support the SLMO labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> market areas (for example, 75 percent). Such a criterion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may also specify that to be approved, the SLMO labor market  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area must be supported by each hospital that would lose more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 5 percent of payments relative to the current system.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Aggregate payments to hospitals participating in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO could be no higher than they otherwise would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the absence of the SLMO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All hospitals that participate in the SLMO must sign an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for it to become effective. Although the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application could come from a group of hospitals or its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> representatives, each participating hospital must sign the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application and agree to its provisions. In addition, each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating hospital must indicate in the application (or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a separate agreement) that:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The participating hospital waives its rights to any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index it would otherwise receive absent the SLMO,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> including a wage index it might receive through geographic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclassification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The hospital understands how its participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO would affect its prospective payments, including an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> understanding that the hospital's wage index could be higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or lower under the SLMO in comparison to its wage index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under labor market areas in the absence of the SLMO. (The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO application would only have to specify that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital understands the effect of HCFA regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding SLMOs and that there may be a reduction of their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wage index as a result of participation. The hospital would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not have to indicate the precise level of its wage index in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the SLMO application.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Labor market areas under the SLMO would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> automatically renewed each year for the purpose of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculating the wage index until one or more participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals withdraws its support for the SLMO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Labor market areas under the SLMO generally would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> prohibited from crossing State boundaries. The only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exception would be that hospitals from a bordering State may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be included in a SLMO labor market area if they are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently located in an MSA that crosses a State boundary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, the wage index would be calculated as if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals in the bordering State were included under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SLMO labor market area. For hospitals in the bordering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State, the wage index would continue to be calculated as it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is under the current system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

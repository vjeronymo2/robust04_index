			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "The End of the </F> Vietnam Era"]    [Text] The U.S. Senate last week approved a resolution  urging President Bill Clinton to normalize economic ties with  Vietnam. The proposal was submitted by a Vietnam war veteran  and prisoner of war, and supported by other senators who are  also Vietnam war veterans. Because the resolution was a mere  recommendation, it was believed that it would be merely another  step in the process of normalizing U.S.-Vietnamese ties, which  has been dragging since 1991. Extremely propitious conditions  -- particularly the insignificant opposition of groups demanding  the identification and location of those soldiers missing in  action in Vietnam -- allowed President Bill Clinton a few days  later to lift to commercial embargo in force for 19 years.    In fact, the timetable established by the Bush  administration  to normalize U.S.-Vietnamese diplomatic ties is being fulfilled.  One year ago, Vietnamese authorities helped to locate those  missing in action and as a result of the Vietnamese troops  withdrawal, Cambodia was able to hold elections. Thus the  international and domestic prerequisites the U.S. Government  announced as essential for normalizing its ties with Vietnam  were met.    The process was delayed because of the action of outspoken  veteran groups, which have important electoral clout, that were  dissatisfied with the almost insignificant progress to locate  the almost 2,300 soldiers missing in action. One of the  remaining myths of the war is that U.S. prisoners are still kept  in concentration camps, which is like saying that the fictitious  Rambo films are true.    Once the precautions of election year were left behind,  reason and business prevailed. Vietnam is a rapidly growing  market of 70 million people offering good business opportunities  that were previously denied to U.S. manufacturers. The  Vietnamese market grows 8 percent per year and the socialist  rigors applied to the economy have almost been nonexistent since  the end of the 1980's. These considerations weighed heavily on  President Bill Clinton's decision. It is true that Clinton can  only lift the embargo now that the painful "Vietnam drama" --  the feeling of self-inflicted defeat that undermined U.S. pride  for two decades -- is already part of the past.    By allowing the normalization of business ties -- diplomatic  ties will be restored shortly through which Vietnam will have a  more favorable status which in turn will promote trade --  President Clinton ends a stage in history that enables the world  to know the true limits of power and force and opens a stage of  business cooperation that will benefit all involved nations.</p>

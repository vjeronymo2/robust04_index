			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: Northern weakens Food manufacturer Northern Foods weakened on busy turnover of 3.5m in the face of a number of profits downgrades. Hoare Govett cut Pounds 7m from its 1994 forecast to Pounds 165m, and Pounds 6m to Pounds 180m for 1995. Two other brokers were reported to have moved their figures to similar levels, according to dealers. A food manufacturing analyst said worries over the company's meat division had surfaced at what was described as a cautious meeting with institutions this week. Concern over the performance of part of the biscuits business was also said to have contributed to the downgrades. Northern shares retreated 8 to 273p. A 30 per cent jump in interim profits to the top of market expectations sent Kingfisher shares forward, although they slipped back in late trading to close a penny down on balance at 645p. Turnover was a hefty 5m. Stores analysts said that in spite of the good headline figures, lower operating margins were giving cause for concern. The worrying home improvement business, which has been the cause of heavy losses at Kingfisher's DIY rivals, saw B&amp;Q post a small profits rise. However, Kingfisher said the market remained difficult, with margin pressure increasing. Ladbroke, which owns Texas, edged down a penny to 198p. Do It All co-owner WH Smith 'A' lost 7 to 446p. Reports that BT is considering moving into cable television and video transmission was said to be behind falls in Rank Organisation and Carlton Communications. BT is developing a video-on-demand by telephone line for the UK, and is drawing up plans to launch it next year. Rank and Carlton are both heavily involved in the video duplication business. Rank shares lost 8 to 794p, while BT slipped a penny to 419p. Carlton received support from Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank arguing that the current rating understates the earnings per share growth of the next two years. The house believes the group will achieve eps of 53.1p in 1994, against 34.2p in 1992. Carlton shares shed 10 to 735p. Vague talk about a possible sale of Granada's stake in the BSkyB satellite venture was heard, although leisure analysts were dismissive. Granada added 7 at 453p. Hoare Govett and NatWest Securities were again recommending Thorn EMI, up 7 at 990p. Following the sale of 5m shares by directors of Airtours the stock declined 6 to 403p, the price at which they were placed in the market on Monday. A bout of nervous trading hit British Aerospace ahead of today's interim figures, sending the shares 8 lower to 420p in trade of 2.7m. Analysts expect profits to be in the region of Pounds 28m to Pounds 30m, against a loss of Pounds 129m a year ago. At the time of last year's interim report the company announced that it was to make a second-half provision of Pounds 1bn, a move that more than halved the share price. Shares in industrial management group Porter Chadburn fell sharply, giving up 9 to 25p, after the company reinforced an earlier profits warning, saying first-half profits will be well below last year's on a like-for-like basis. Chemicals group Laporte eased 2 to 621p in front of tomorrow's interim results. Profits forecasts range from Pounds 46m to Pounds 49m, but hope that there will be some accompanying surprises was offset by the general worries overhanging the sector. Many of those worries surround BOC, which has been out of favour since this summer's profits warning. Yesterday there were no takers for stock slushing around the market; the shares fell 6 to 636p. Shares in Reuters Holdings hit a new high yesterday on the back of the company's presentation to the New York investment community. Breaking out of a tight and recent 35-point range, the stock climbed 14 to 1580p. Rothmans International 'B' shares weakened 16 1/2 to 661 1/2 p on concern that the group's Footsie status is in doubt. Meanwhile, investors switched into BAT Industries, the tobacco and insurance group, whose shares rose 7 to 466 1/2 p. Buyers of Zeneca sought the attractive yield, ahead of the company going ex-dividend next month. The stock appreciated 14 to 733p. Foods group Dalgety continued to benefit from Monday's results, adding 3 at 493p. Strauss Turnbull was recommending the stock on dividend considerations and as reasonable value on price/earnings grounds. Hazlewood Foods fell back as talk of a downgrade was heard. There was also speculation that one of its board members, rumoured to be involved in takeover talks at Manchester City football club, might sell his shares to raise funds. Hazlewood shed 8 1/2 to 174p. A positive round of press meetings gained good coverage for plans for expansion by Boots, the chemists. The shares put on 2 at 491p. Next moved up 5 1/2 to 208 1/2 p on speculative buying amid reports that it, too, was poised for expansion. United Friendly 'B' shares fell 42 to 635p after posting a 36 per cent slide in first-half profits to Pounds 6.1m from Pounds 9.5m. Printer Watmoughs jumped 16 to 748p after revealing raised half-year profits of Pounds 6.4m and an increased dividend.</p>

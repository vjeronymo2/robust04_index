			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq has expressed  satisfaction with the Shamgar Commission's findings and said it  is a comprehensive and in-depth report that relates to the roots  of the incident and shows what must be done. The chief of staff  expressed satisfaction with the fact that no steps need be taken  against Army officers. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will  study the findings carefully, and it is still unclear if  disciplinary measures will be taken against anybody in the IDF.  In an interview, Lieutenant General Baraq also said the IDF is  already taking and will continue to take the measures necessary  to sharply reduce the risk of such events, which have grave  repercussions for Jews and Arabs, recurring. He stressed,  however, that he cannot say at present that something like the  Cave of the Patriarchs massacre could not happen again.    Knesset Member [MK] Ori Or, chairman of the Knesset Foreign  Affairs and Defense Committee, said his committee will make sure  the report's findings are implemented. He said the true  background to the incident is the ongoing war in Judaea and  Samaria. The friction between Jews and Arabs in the Cave of the  Patriarchs and other places must be reduced and supervision of  radical Jewish and Arab groups must be tightened. MK Or also  said the settlement leaders in Judaea and Samaria know that the  extremists among them are a major affliction and that there are  those who are under no control whatsoever; therefore, even after  publication of the Shamgar report's findings, if somebody  decides to use his weapon, nobody can prevent him from doing so.    MK Dedi Zucker, chairman of the Constitution, Law, and  Justice Committee, criticizes the fact that the commission dealt  only with the massacre itself and not with law enforcement in  the territories. I expected the commission to present a sharp  indictment of the conditions existing for many years in the  territories, Zucker said. On one hand, the commission says the  massacre occurred like a bolt of lightning, and on the other, it  points to the fact that the law was not enforced in the  territories. There is no police force there to deal with both  security and civilian matters. How does one reconcile between  those two aspects? MK Zucker asked, adding that for the most  part, the Shamgar Commission ignored that connection, which  means it snowed us. [passage omitted]    The Shamgar report was received in Qiryat Arba' with a sigh  of relief. Local council heads welcomed the fact that the  findings did not include recommendations to restrict prayer  arrangements for Jews at the Cave of the Patriarchs. Rabbi  Moshe Levinger said that if the defense establishment defends  the Jews, it might be possible to enter the cave unarmed. Our  settlement affairs correspondent Gil Litman reports that  according to the Council of Jewish Settlements in Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip, the settlers' stand has been  strengthened. It has been shown that the action was perpetrated  by one person, and an entire public should not be blamed. The  test will be to maintain the Jews' right to worship, the council  said. [passage omitted]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 26 June  carries a roundup of opposition reactions to the Shamgar  Commission report compiled by Hayim Hecht, who says that "the  Likud Knesset faction calls for honoring the conclusions of the  Shamgar Commission to the letter. A statement issued by the  Likud says the report proves that the government did not prepare  properly for preventing extremist acts. The National Religious  Party [NRP] faction says the commission's conclusions pull the  rug out from under the feet of those who organized the political  campaign of incitement against the settlers. The NRP is  demanding that any changes in prayer arrangements at the Cave of  the Patriarchs be introduced only with the agreement of the  chief rabbis. The Tzomet faction emphasizes that the report  clears the Hebron settlers of any charges. Tzomet Chairman  Refa'el Eytan says the report suffers from the syndrome of  putting all the blame on the lowest military levels. The  Moledet faction is demanding that the Knesset hold a special  debate on the Shamgar Commission conclusions this week."]</p>

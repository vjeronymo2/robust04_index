This Notice also extends the period for public comment on the corrected materials. Specifically, these corrections pertain to Pages 1&hyph;19 through 1&hyph;30 and Attachment 1&hyph;4 of Section 1 of the Technical Background Document on Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment in Support of the Regulatory Determination on Cement Kiln Dust, Section 1 being titled ``Expanded Risk Assessment for the Onsite Management of Cement Kiln Dust.'' This Technical Background Document is Number S0019 in RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;94&hyph;RC2A&hyph;FFFFF. The corrected materials, in the form of substitute pages 1&hyph;19 (revised) through 1&hyph;30 (revised) and Attachment 1&hyph;4 (revised), have been placed in RCRA Docket No. F&hyph;94&hyph;RC2A&hyph;FFFFF as docket entry No. S0019.A, and have also been placed in EPA's Superfund electronic bulletin board (CLU&hyph;IN). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were five general errors in the CKD human health risk assessment materials which need to be corrected. They include: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Fixing a ``rounding'' error which inadvertently assigned all facilities into a risk category one order of magnitude higher than estimated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Revising risk results for 5 sites to represent ``best-estimate'' results. (High-end risk estimates were inadvertently used.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Revised risk estimates for two sites located near lakes. The dilution capacity of the two lakes is actually orders of magnitude greater than what was used in the original material announced in the September 14, 1994, notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Revised risk estimates for 14 sites for which we did not have constituent concentrations. In the original document, risk estimates assumed 95th percentile concentrations for metals. In the revised tables, if risk at the sites could not be determined as negligible using the 95th percentile, then risk at the sites are listed as ``unknown'' rather than estimating the risk using the 95th percentile assumption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Add the results of the aquatic pathway exceedances of constituent concentrations as defined in the Ambient Water Quality Criteria (AWQC). These were calculated but inadvertently left out of the previous document. They represent a risk element not included in the previous edition. The AWQC exceedance results is a new subsection inserted at the end of the revised results subsection. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Because of these corrections, the Agency is extending the comment period pertaining to Section 1 and Attachments to Section 1 of the Technical Background Document on Human Health and Environmental Risk Assessment, only, until November 10, 1994.

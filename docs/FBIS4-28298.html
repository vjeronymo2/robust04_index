			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Nuclear Hide-and-Seek' Under `Nuclear Umbrella'"--KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese SANKEI  SHIMBUN recently exposed that a Japan-U.S. nuclear secret  agreement was signed in November, 1969, allowing the  introduction and passage of U.S. nuclear weapons to Okinawa,  Japan.    Commenting on this, NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined article  today  says the signing of the agreement has rendered legality to the  introduction, deployment and use of U.S. nuclear weapons in  Japan and reduced the islands of Japan to a U.S. nuclear forward  base against socialist and Asian countries.    The disclosure of the agreement has made it all the clearer  that the "three non-nuclear principles" which the Japanese  rulers have claimed to be "a symbol of a non-nuclear, peaceful  state" is nothing but a screen for covering up the introduction  of U.S. nuclear weapons and Japan's nuclear armament, the  article says, and goes on:    It was with a view to promoting their own nuclear armament  program under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella" and with the U.S.  assistance that the Japanese reactionaries made a secret nuclear  deal with the United States even by harming the dignity and  interests of the Japanese people.    The Japanese ruling quarters have, in actuality, been  accelerating their nuclear armament behind the screen of the  "three non-nuclear principles". They have already secured  technologies and facilities for the development of nuclear  weapons and even their launching system.    The operation of Monju, a fast breeder reactor for  abstracting quantities of plutonium, means a new dangerous step  in the Japanese reactionaries' nuclear armament.    Now, Japan can become a nuclear power any moment it decides  to.    Their noisy talk over the DPRK's "nuclear issue" is a clumsy  trick to divert elsewhere the public attention at home and  abroad and find an excuse for their own nuclear armament and  reinvasion of Korea.    Stupid and reckless are the Japanese reactionary ruling  quarters' acts of bringing another nuclear disaster to Japan,  far from drawing a lesson from their defeat in the past.    They would be well advised to stop playing a "nuclear  hide-and- seek" under the U.S. "nuclear umbrella".</p>

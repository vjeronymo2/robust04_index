When Americans and West Europeans met they  used to discuss "high politics": nonproliferation and  deterrence, detente and armament. But these problems have  meanwhile become classical history. What is more: Unemployment,  health insurance, and immigration have become international  politics. Why?    One reason is that traditional security problems have  disappeared -- for the time being: There may be many small wars  going on all over the world, but not a single one of them poses  a strategic threat to the West. Second, the fate of Western  governments hardly depends on traditional foreign policy any  more: Neither Clinton nor Kohl will topple over Bosnia or  Somalia -- a dramatic contrast to the internal uproar that the  Vietnam War or the stationing of Pershing produced.  Unemployment, however, is the most dangerous time bomb ticking  under the thrones of the powerful -- just remember George Bush,  the glorious winner of the Gulf War, who was ousted by recession  20 months later. After all: Even the last backwoods politician  has now realized that his domestic policy problems -- meaning  unemployment or immigration -- cannot be solved exclusively  within the structure of the national state.    This is the logic that created the job summit. That not much  would come of it was predictable, because summits rarely produce  anything that was not put on paper beforehand in painstaking  detail. In addition, few of the G-7, the big industrial nations,  face the same economic situation requiring the same economic  solution. How, for example, are the highly indebted Germans to  carry out the economic policy program demanded by Clinton? But  what is more important than the outcome of the summit is the  process -- the mere event as such. The G-7 seem to have  realized -- or they suspect it -- that globalization is taking a  little more of their autonomy away from them every day and that  increasingly less can be tackled on a purely national level.    Also, worldwide recession -- 36 million unemployed in the  OECD area, the highest figure since the great depression -- has  made the arrogance disappear that used to be linked with terms  such as "model Germany." With 12 percent unemployment in France  and 10 percent in Germany it is difficult to teach the others  what is what. But the Americans, who have created 34 million  new jobs over the last 20 years (the more populous Europe  produced only 10 million), are no longer very happy with their  "job machine" either. Very often wages are extremely low, and  middle-class incomes are stagnating.    This has made the two sides willing to learn from one  another. With their high wages and social contributions (the  highest in the world), the Germans are condemning more and more  people to permanent unemployment; at the same time, generous  social benefits are not a great encouragement for people to look  for a job. A little more "Americanization" -- fewer subsidies,  more competition -- would do no harm. The Americans, on the  other hand, are fascinated by German and Japanese vocational  training: A week ago, Clinton presented a $3.4 billion program  to this end.    The only question is whether such models are transferable:  It  is doubtful whether a young American would work for a meager  apprentice payment for three years to get his certificate of  qualification. Another question is whether the German model --  it goes back to the Middle Ages -- is still up to date. It may  work quite well for tradesmen and industrial workers, but most  of the new jobs are created in the service and information  sectors. Is an apprenticeship the best way to become a computer  programmer or marketing manager, for whom creativity is more  important than trade discipline? After all, young Germans are  beginning to doubt this method as well, judging from the  increasing number of students compared with apprentices.    And what about the formerly highly praised German managers?  Many of them cannot leave high-rising hierarchies behind, while  in America and Japan one middle-management layer after the other  is cut out of the pyramid. It is worth considering how General  Motors and Ford could gain market shares in Europe in 1993,  while total sales of new cars dropped by 15 percent.    These are questions that cannot be answered at the summit:  Show effects are more important than facts there. Nevertheless,  Clinton must be praised for the initiative because it enhances  the necessary shift in awareness. "High politics" increasingly  have to deal with the "darker sides" of social and economic  policy; at the same time, nobody can escape globalization by  concentrating on national issues. Detroit has not achieved  much, but it has shown what the states still have to achieve  before the turn of the millennium.</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS / ROSEMEAD;  </P> <P> PUTTING IT POLITELY, THIS CAMPAIGN SEEMS CIVIL  </P> <P> All's quiet on the campaign front.  </P> <P> Though other San Gabriel Valley cities may greet the election season with  political bickering and hot debates, Rosemead has not even scheduled a  candidates' forum.  </P> <P> "We are a bedroom community, and we like to keep it that way," Councilman Gary  Taylor said. "The more peaceful and quiet, the better."  </P> <P> So although three candidates are competing for two City Council seats in the  April 10 election, a polite atmosphere prevails.  </P> <P> Taylor, 49, is seeking reelection, as is Mayor Dennis McDonald. Challenger  Frank Villar, who might be expected to attack the status quo, is unfailingly  civil.  </P> <P> "I don't think the council is doing a bad job, but I do think they need fresh  ideas and new blood," Villar said.  </P> <P> Despite the gentility, a few positions have emerged.  </P> <P> Taylor, a construction supervisor who has been on the council for 16 years,  three as mayor, said his biggest concern is making sure redevelopment projects  don't get in the way of private homes.  </P> <P> "I want to continue watching homeowners' rights," Taylor said. "We are a fully  developed city, and I want to make sure residents keep control of their  property without others taking over."  </P> <P> McDonald, 47, fire marshal for El Monte, has been on the council since 1987,  serving as mayor for the last year. He said he will continue working on plans  to create a community center with low-income housing for senior citizens. He  also says Valley Boulevard needs more landscaping and business parking.  </P> <P> Whereas the incumbents point to their experience, challenger Villar, account  manager for Ambassador Sales Co., said he represents a "new vision." Villar,  who has served on the Temple City Recreation and Parks Commission for 14 years,  said his main concern is providing programs for young people, "to get them off  the streets and away from gang activity."  </P> <P> "I want to see a multipurpose center for boys and girls that would include arts  and crafts classes, sports classes, counseling -- all in one place," said  Villar, who refuses to specify his age, saying only that he is in his 50s.  </P> <P> The top finishers on April 10 win four-year terms on the council, which  annually elects the mayor from among its five members.  </P></p>

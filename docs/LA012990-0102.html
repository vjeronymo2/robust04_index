BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JUICE CANS WILL BE RECYCLED TOO WITH CAMPBELL, REYNOLDS' PACT  </P> <P> Campbell Soup Co. and Reynolds Metals Co. announced today a long-term supply  agreement under which Reynolds eventually will provide recyclable cans for all  Campbell's juices.  </P> <P> The agreement includes Campbell's Tomato Juice, V8, Spicy V8 and Juice Bowl  brands in both 5.5-ounce and 11.5-ounce can sizes.  </P> <P> Reynolds' patented Stay-on-Tab ends also will replace former tape tab ends on  Campbell's juice cans.  </P> <P> "The same advantages which have made the aluminum beverage can the  consumer-preferred container in the beer and soft drink markets are also  applicable to non-carbonated beverages," said Jeremiah Sheehan, vice president  and general manager of the Reynolds Can Division.  </P> <P> In order to meet Campbell's demands, Reynolds will add new capacity to three  existing can manufacturing operations.  </P> <P> The Richmond-based company operates 10 aluminum can manufacturing plants and  two can end-making facilities in the United States.

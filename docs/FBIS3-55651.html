In an interview  with Interfax today, he pointed out that he listed the reasons  for the decree in the descending order.    Shakhray declined to comment on individual provisions of the  document, though pointing out that "this seems to be a fourth  reshuffle of the government." He supposed that if they left  more than one vice prime minister in the government, there will  be more of them in future (according to a presidential decree,  the prime minister shall have four vice prime ministers, two of  them being first vice prime ministers - Interfax note.)    Shakhray said he had not received a proposal to chair the  ministry for federation affairs and regional policies designed  to replace the State Committee for Federation and Nationalities  Affairs he chairs now.</p>

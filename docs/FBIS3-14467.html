			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cairo, 26 Mar (MENA)--Arab League Secretary General  Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has demanded that Israeli settlers in  the occupied Arab territories be completely disarmed and that  all settlements in these territories be dismantled and removed  in line with UN Security Council Resolution 465.    In his speech to the opening session of the Arab League  Council's conference, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed that Israel  must implement the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949,  particularly in connection with protecting people living under  occupation. He urged that an effective international presence  be expeditiously established in the occupied territories. He  declared that the Arab countries are committed to a  comprehensive and just peace in line with UN and Arab  resolutions.    'Abd-al-Majid said that Israeli procrastinations and inhuman  practices have encouraged the settlers' criminal propensities,  resulted in greater violence, and created real obstacles to the  peace process, which, he noted, cannot continue unless the  minimal conditions for restoring trust are met and Israel stops  evading its commitments.    He announced that the Arab group at the United Nations has  decided to form a troika representing the Arab ambassadors to  the United Nations and the heads of the Arab group for the  months of February, March, and April. This troika, he said,  will hold a meeting with the U.S. permanent delegate to the  United Nations. The Arab group also instructed the Egyptian  delegation to prepare a draft message on behalf of all Arab  countries that expresses a united position on Jerusalem.    Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that this message will be approved by  the Arab group and sent to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali  and to the president of the UN Security Council to be  distributed as an official document.    Regarding inter-Arab solidarity, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid explained  that the closing of Arab ranks will enable the Arab countries to  revise some of the principles and charters governing collective  Arab action and set them forth in a new form that is more in  line with contemporary Arab wishes. He pointed out that this  requires a discussion on amending the Arab League charter and  the establishment of an Arab court of justice as a mechanism to  solve inter-Arab disputes peacefully and prevent their  escalation.    'Abd-al-Majid said that within the context of a  comprehensive  Arab reconciliation, the Arab League seeks to resolve the  problem of the Kuwaiti detainees and those who are missing. He  added that this will be a positive factor in allaying the  current tensions, both for the families of the Kuwaiti detainees  and the missing and in regard to the efforts to alleviate the  suffering of the Iraqi people, in whose territorial integrity we  are concerned and interested.    Discussing pan-Arab security, he said: Security, in our  view, now means one thing--to be or not to be. He noted that  pan-Arab security now has many sides covering most aspects of  joint Arab action, both economic and political, as they are two  sides of the same coin.    He urged the Arab League Council to work quickly and  seriously to restructure the Arab economic situation to help us  avoid any negative repercussions, especially from the GATT.    He expressed regret over the continuing crisis between Libya  and some Western countries despite Libya's flexible stand and  eagerness to settle the crisis in the context of international  legitimacy. He called on the three Western parties to be  responsive to the efforts by several parties to reach a solution  that respects Libya's territorial integrity and is in line with  Article 33 of the UN Charter, which calls for resolving  differences between states through dialogue and peaceful means.    He reiterated the Arab League's support for the United Arab  Emirates' efforts to regain all its legitimate rights and its  sovereignty over its three islands in the Gulf. He also  expressed his support for the United Arab Emirates' measures to  recover these rights and hoped that Iran will respond by  handling the issue peacefully and with wisdom.    Speaking about the situation in Somalia, 'Abd-al-Majid  praised President Husni Mubarak's initiative that contributed to  achieving national reconciliation in Somalia. He said it was  time that the fraternal Somali people directed their efforts  toward reconstructing their country so that Somalia can resume  its role in the Arab arena.    Discussing the situation in Yemen and Sudan, the Arab League  secretary general expressed confidence that the Yemeni leaders'  wisdom will help overcome this crisis and enhance ties among the  people in that nation. He said we are following the situation  in Sudan with extreme concern, and expressed his hope that the  Arab League Council will adopt a resolution asserting its clear  commitment to Sudan's unity and its opposition to any attempt to  separate the south.</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> BLACK CAESAR IS BACK: M. C. Hammer may be on top now, with L. L. Cool J making  a run at him, but wait -- who's on deck, ready to throw down the year's hardest  rap attack? None other than Big Daddy Kane, who returns next week with a wildly  eclectic new album, "Taste of Chocolate." The record has a killer dance track  ("Keep 'Em on the Floor"); a plea for black positivity ("Who Am I"), which  features Malcolm X's daughter, Gamilah Shabazz, and "Big Daddy vs.  </P> <P> Dolomite," an outrageous dozens-to-the-death insult duel between Kane and Ray  (Dolomite) Moore, the legendary black comic. Kane also teams up with Barry  White on "All of Me," a silky duet where White provides Big Daddy with the kind  of paternal romantic advice that Humphrey Bogart offered Woody Allen in "Play  It Again, Sam." As always, Kane's cheeky wordplay reigns supreme, especially on  "No Dam Good," a Kane critique of some old girlfriends. Dissing his ex-playmate  Monique, Kane realizes her wardrobe says it all: "Bamboo earrings, all big and  looking silly, with extensions hanging down like Milli Vanilli."  </P></p>

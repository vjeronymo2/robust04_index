			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Remigijus Barauskas: "A Dangerous Load in </F> Radviliskis"]    [Text] Seventeen cisterns with almost 900 tonnes of  methanol have been detained at the Radviliskis railway station  since last Thursday [3 March]. The attempts of a Russian firm  to ship this load through Lithuania to Germany failed for the  second time.    Our customs officials detained the train for the first time  on 6 January at the Vaidotai station. Since the consignor had  no permit from the Environmental Protection Department,  Lithuanian officials turned the train back. After the attempt  to bring the methanol in from Belarus had failed, the firm tried  to do this from Latvia's territory. On Thursday, the cisterns  arrived from Daugavpils to Radviliskis. From there they had to  travel to the port of Klaipeda, and later by the Mukran ferry to  Germany. However, Lithuanian customs officials detained the  load again.    According to F. Stankevicius, senior inspector of the  Customs  Work Organization Division at the Customs Department, Lithuania  is currently negotiating with the Latvians on the return of the  methanol. However, Latvia does not yet want to accept the load  that is dangerous to the environment.</p>

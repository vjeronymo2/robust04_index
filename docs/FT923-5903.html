			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indonesian oil exploration falls short of target INDONESIA SIGNED a record number of oil production sharing contracts last year but a concomitant rise in exploration expenditure failed to materialise, according to the annual petroleum report published by the US Embassy in Jakarta. The government signed 22 production sharing contracts with oil companies in 1991, up from 14 in each of the previous two years, and the report estimates a further 15 could be signed this year. However, only 123 exploration wells drilled last year, 38.5 per cent below the number forecast by Pertamina, the state-owned oil and gas company. Actual exploration and development expenditure by oil companies was Dollars 1.875bn, significantly lower than the Dollars 2.27bn budgeted. The report cautions that oil companies are farming out exploration in frontier areas, where the cost of a wildcat well exceeds Dollars 30m, in order to limit exposure. Pertamina forecasts that oil companies' exploration expenditure will reach Dollars 2.84bn this year, although the report says the softness of the oil market may lead to 'some erosion in budgeted outlays'. The report estimates Indonesia's crude and condensate production in 1991 at 1.592m barrels a day, dropping to 1.53m b/d in the first quarter of this year. Exports in 1991 averaged 905,000 b/d, of which 44 per cent went to Japan and 11 per cent to the US. The value of Indonesia's oil and condensate exports last year totalled Dollars 6.4bn, down from Dollars 8.75bn in 1990. Indonesia also produced 22m tonnes of liquefied natural gas last year, accounting for 38 per cent of world production. All production was exported, with Japan accounting for 80 per cent, South Korea 13 per cent and Taiwan 7 per cent. LNG exports in 1991 were valued at Dollars 4.04bn.</p>

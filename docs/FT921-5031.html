			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / Occupational pension funds show average 16.9% return for 1991 OCCUPATIONAL pension funds achieved an average rate of return (income plus capital appreciation) of 16.9 per cent last year, according to the WM Company, the bigger of the two main performance measurers. Excluding property, which had a bad year, the funds returned 18.8 per cent. All the other main categories of investments, UK equities, overseas equities, UK bonds and overseas bonds, returned between 18 per cent and 21 per cent. The average return achieved by fund managers in UK equities was 20.0 per cent, compared with the 20.7 per cent theoretically obtainable on the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index. Overseas equity portfolios returned 20.9 per cent compared with 23.7 per cent on the FT-Actuaries World ex UK Index. The figures reflect more than 2,000 funds worth Pounds 240bn in aggregate. WM reports that, as in 1990, companies last year took more out of their pension funds than was received through investment income and employees' contributions. This reflects the continued prevalence of fund surpluses and employers' contribution holidays. Total holdings of equities - UK and overseas - reached an all-time high of 77 per cent last year, and was even higher for smaller funds. Cash holdings fell sharply. Exposure to UK bonds and property also fell. In the past five years, in spite of the stock market crash of 1987 and a negative-return year in 1990, pension funds have returned 9.9 per cent a year on average, comfortably ahead of inflation of 6.4 per cent and slightly ahead of average earnings growth of 8.8 per cent.</p>

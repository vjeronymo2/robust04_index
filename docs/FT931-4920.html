			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / Letter: Industrial comparison selective Sir, In criticising the 'tub-thumping' of the manufacturing lobby, Tony Thomson of Bankers Trust Investment Management (Letters, March 5) offers a rather selective argument. To reassure us that things are not as bad as they seem, he compares the UK's manufacturing performance to that of other English-speaking countries, with France thrown in as the token 'other'. Unfortunately, our anglophone friends share the UK's dismal record on manufacturing investment and boom-bust economic growth, as well as (no coincidence this) our rentier culture and an over-developed stock market. His accusation that British manufac-turing industry was historically 'over-manned and under-managed', also comes rich from a representative of the securities business. Those in glass houses, Mr Thomson. Andrew Mitchell, 56 Esmond Road, London, W4 1JF</p>

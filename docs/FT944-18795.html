			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Life offices face shake-out - At least 40 could close under new rules Consumers should benefit next year when life insurers enter a period of increased regulation and price competition. What is not clear is whether the predicted demise of at least 40 of the total 103 life offices is entirely good news. Clearly, it depends on whether you buy your long-term investment product from a winner or loser. The trigger for the shake-out is the introduction in January of rules that require life offices to tell clients exactly how much they pay advisers and salesmen in commission, and what deductions they make for administration. Until then, they can hide behind meaningless 'standard charge' illustrations that tell you nothing. Naturally, the low chargers and the top performers (not necessarily the same offices) are fairly relaxed about their future. The rest are worried. Last week, we reported a Money Management survey on personal pensions which revealed that the Hearts of Oak friendly society deducted 40 per cent of a client's premiums in charges. From January 1995, the client will be told about these costs before making a commitment - and is likely to buy elsewhere. In theory, providers who combine high charges with poor performance should go to the wall. In practice, the government is unlikely to let this happen because of the destabilising effect this would have on an already beleaguered life and pensions industry. Instead, we are likely to see a series of take-overs and mergers led by the companies with the most financial clout. Only this week, Sir Mark Weinberg, the man behind some of the largest and most successful direct sales operations, announced he was to chair a new company with a Pounds 100m 'vulture fund'. His aim is to hover over the stragglers, pick off the best, close them to new business and manage their existing funds. Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the consulting actuary which is predicting the demise of 40 life offices, also said that just 10 per cent of existing offices appeared to be cost-effective. It added: 'The remainder, mostly traditional life offices, are leaving themselves open to attack by the new, lower cost, simple-savings providers.' The question investors should be asking is: 'If I invest with a life office that subsequently is taken over, will my fund be well managed?' (After all, financial clout is not synonymous with good performance and low charges). The answer, unfortunately, is: 'That depends.' In theory, a fund that is closed should do well because it does not bear new business costs. On the other hand, if the high charges imposed by the original life office are maintained, along with the early termination penalties, you could be stuck in a situation where it is unprofitable to stay but expensive to get out. To make its predictions, Bacon &amp; Woodrow considered the cost of acquiring new business and maintaining policies in force. It then provided a rough identikit of the survivors but no actual names. Among the survivors, however, B&amp;S listed bancassurers (which sell financial products to bank or building society customers) and life offices that concentrate on specialist products sold through independent advisers. Clear losers were the subsidiaries of foreign companies, which made up the bottom 10 in the rankings. Also at risk were the broad-based, medium-size life offices that try to be all things to all men - and, in practice, do nothing very well.</p>

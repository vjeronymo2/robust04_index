			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Shrinking navy prompted great nuclear race: David White tracks the two-year highly politicised battle for the contract to refit Trident submarines THE STRUGGLE to secure industrial work from Britain's shrinking navy has set communities in the far corners of the country against each other, competing for influence like the city-states of medieval Italy. Last month an alliance between Glasgow and the Cumbrian stronghold of Barrow-in-Furness succeeded in eclipsing the shipbuilding tradition of Tyneside. Their battle ended with the Swan Hunter shipyard in receivership after losing a contract to build a helicopter carrier. Now Rosyth in eastern Scotland has lost a desperate and protracted contest to hold on to its role as the refit yard for the submarines carrying Britain's strategic deterrent. The choice of the rival Devonport dockyard at Plymouth as the site for refuelling and refitting the new Trident vessels means Rosyth will also lose its work on other nuclear-powered submarines. The work is at present split between the two dockyards. With refits worth between Pounds 3bn and Pounds 5bn over the next 20 years, submarines provide the backbone of the business. The consolation prize - the promise of 18 big warship refits for Rosyth - cannot disguise the devastating blow to the yard and the potential threat to jobs in Fife. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, talked of 'a healthy future for both yards'. But Rosyth's prospects, beyond the promised programme of work, are at best uncertain. From experience, its managers, Babcock Thorn, are suspicious of government promises. As a Devonport executive commented recently: 'Nobody believes there's a long-term future for the dockyard that doesn't have Trident.' The 'great nuclear race' was launched two years ago when Devonport made an unsolicited bid to take the Trident work. It realised that the smaller submarine fleet planned by the Ministry of Defence would justify no more than one facility. Rosyth, with a new dock project under construction, would be the natural choice. In a highly politicised battle, the government backed away from a decision late last year and has since postponed it several more times. The two sides have conducted a tit-for-tat propaganda campaign. Rosyth, counting on the backing of Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, said as many as 18,000 jobs were at risk; Devonport's claims rose to 23,000. The two argued over where the Conservative party would suffer most - in Scotland or the south-west, where five of six seats in and around Plymouth are Tory-held. Each yard tried to prove that the other could exist on surface ships alone: Rosyth argued that Devonport was ideally placed next to an important warship base; Devonport said Rosyth was more likely to manage on a smaller workload. It suggested that Rosyth's partly built new submarine dock complex could be used to modernise oil tankers. The government has already sunk more than Pounds 120m into the complex, known as RD57. The original plan for a covered dock would have cost Pounds 450m to complete. In the face of Devonport's counter-proposal, Rosyth pared that down to Pounds 267m. In December it dug up another, cheaper plan, based on adapting existing docks and undercutting Devonport's Pounds 162m price by Pounds 15m. Devonport retorted by saying it could provide the same facilities as Rosyth for Pounds 131m. It then hit on a new way of handling nuclear refuelling and cut its estimate to Pounds 120m. Rosyth also reduced its figure. On Tuesday, at the 11th hour, it produced a radically revised proposal for Pounds 60m, but to no avail. Apart from investment costs, Devonport argued that the nuclear workload would enable it to carry out other ship refits at unbeatable rates, saving at least Pounds 100m over the next 15 years. Government procrastination has served to cut its costs sharply but at the expense of political wear and tear. 'The delay has done harm to both ends of the country,' says Mr David Jamieson, Labour MP for Plymouth Devonport. Measures to cushion the impact by guaranteeing work to Rosyth place an artificial constraint on Devonport by limiting the number of surface ship refits it can compete for. How much that is likely to affect Devonport's business is not yet clear. 'You could refit the entire Royal Navy from now onwards using the dry docks at Devonport and support 4,500 people,' says Mr Peter Whitehouse, business development manager at Devonport Management Ltd. Navy officers believe that would have saved the service money. But it proved politically impossible. DML argues there will only be enough work to occupy one dockyard fully, and that two dockyards can be maintained only as long as one is artificially subsidised. Since the yards were placed under private-sector management six years ago, work volume has dropped sharply. In spite of diversification into activities ranging from yacht-building at Devonport to train-refurbishment at Rosyth, the combined workforce has been halved in that period from more than 17,000 to 8,650. The workload will decline further as more of the fleet is made up of modern frigates designed to need less upkeep. One senior navy officer says: 'We have not really adapted to the end of the steam age.' Replacing ships' steam engines involved substantial rebuilding, but today's gas turbine engines can be swapped at sea. The MoD's intention six years ago was to increase the amount of competition outside the 'core' programme of work allocated to the dockyards. The ministry still wants as much competition as possible in surface ships and to move further towards full privatisation after the managers' contracts run out. Last summer, proposals were invited for the purchase of one or both yards. About a dozen companies responded, but the government decided to wait until the nuclear submarine contest was decided before taking its plans further. Naval shipbuilders, which want a share of refit work, will be in the front line of bidders. Interested parties include GEC, owner of the Yarrow yard on Clydeside. The terms on which privatisation will be handled remain unclear. The government is expected to keep at least a golden share in the nuclear facilities, to avoid being held over a barrel in the setting of prices for servicing Trident boats. The MoD is anxious to hand over responsibility for redundancies, hitherto paid for by the government. 'There has to be a further shake-out in the whole shipbuilding and refitting industry,' a senior ministry official said this week. At the start of the decade, more than 30,000 were employed building and overhauling ships for the navy. By the end of the 1990s the figure is not expected to be more than about 11,000-12,000.</p>

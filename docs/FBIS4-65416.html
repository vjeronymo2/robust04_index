			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Nahit Mentese has said that the  fight against the separatist terrorist organization PKK [Workers  Party of Kurdistan] is continuing successfully and added that  there is a 300 percent increase in the number terrorists who  surrendered in the first four months of 1994 in comparison to  the same period last year.    In the statement, Mentese explained that the terrorists  suffered great losses and lost their logistics abilities as a  result of the determined fight waged against the terrorist  organization with the intensive support of the people and the  democratic institutions. Indicating that the terrorists could  not put up a fight against the fully-equipped, trained, and  disciplined security forces, Mentese said that the struggle  became increasingly successful when the logistics support of the  organization was cut off following the cross-border operations  into northern Iraq.    Mentese stated that 500 terrorists -- 186 terrorists killed,  four wounded -- were captured in operations conducted against  the dissipating terrorist organization during 1-15 May. Mentese  added that 197 long-barreled rifles, 37 revolvers, 386 bombs,  and large quantities of ammunition were seized during these  operations.    Explaining that collective surrenders, including members in  high-level positions, were taking place for the first time,  Mentese stressed that during this period 48 terrorists -- 22 in  Sirnak and 7 in Agri and Van [as heard] -- surrendered to the  security forces, handing in their weapons. Mentese said that  collective surrenders from the terrorist organization's militant  cadres in the mountainous region are expected to increase.    The statement further notes: Nowhere in the world did  terrorism achieve its goal. The terrorists will not be able to  reach their goal in our country also. Our state will fully  control the terrorist organization and render it ineffective,  thus eradicating it completely from the country's agenda.    I am taking this opportunity to call on everybody who joined  the PKK terrorist organization: Come, trust the state, and  surrender yourself to its affectionate hands. Take advantage of  the Law of Repentance and thus attain the right to live as one  of the respected citizens of this country.</p>

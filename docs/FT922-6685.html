			<p>920522 FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Winterthur reveals 11% rise in net income WINTERTHUR, the Swiss insurance group, reports an 11 per cent rise in net income for 1991 to SFr262.9m (Dollars 180m), thanks to strong contributions from Swiss non-life business and North American direct business. The directors have recommended a 3 per cent rise in dividends to SFr70 per registered share and SFr14 per participation certificate. They have also decided to accept non Swiss holders of registered shares on the register. Gross premiums jumped 17 per cent to SFr14.6bn with nearly 3 per cent of it coming from currency conversion. Investment income was up 15.4 per cent to SFr40.5bn. Winterthur Life, the group's largest subsidiary, raised its premium income by 20 per cent to SFr4.26bn. Overseas branches had premium growth of more than 40 per cent, mainly because the company took on some important group insurance contracts in Belgium and Spain. Winterthur Life made an operating profit of SFr650m; 50 per cent higher than in the previous year. More than 97 per cent of it was allocated to the bonus fund. Investment income was up 17.2 per cent to SFr1.47bn and net income ended up at SFr16.8m, up 7.7 per cent.</p>

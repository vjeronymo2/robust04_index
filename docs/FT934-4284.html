			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Betterware shares fall on boardroom changes Shares in Betterware fell 10p to 148p yesterday as the home shopping company announced the appointment of a new finance director to replace Mr Terry Hockley, who is to lead the group's expansion overseas. The shares have fallen from a six month high of 278p in recent months. The decline has been fuelled by the downgrading of 1994 annual profits after increased interims, decisions by the founding Cohen family to reduce its holding from 63.4 per cent to 50.3 per cent at a price of 230p a share, and a large overhang of stock. The company stressed that Mr Hockley had been 'promoted to international director'. Betterware, which is facing a mature market in the UK, is seeking to expand in Europe. It entered the French market about two years ago, Spain earlier this year, and plans to set up in Germany next year. Mr Hockley, who has been Betterware's finance director since 1990, had 'extensive international experience over many years', the company said, including US multi-nationals Textron, Burlington and United Technologies. Mr Peter Hartley, former finance director and subsequently managing director of Texas Homecare, will succeed Mr Hockley. Mr Hartley, a chartered accountant, left Texas in July. Mr Andrew Cohen, Betterware chief executive, said Mr Hartley's appointment 'adds further strength to our board and allows Terry to concentrate on our continuing thrust into the European market.'</p>

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHADOW OVER ONLY HALF OF GERMANY;  </P> <P> IF WORLD MUST GET IN A FRENZY, EAST MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE TOO  </P> <P> The international media have been mauling West Germany's public image, even  prompting the German press to set upon its people with cannibalistic ardor.  German complicity in the construction of a poison-gas plant in Libya has  implicated German businessmen, embarrassed German political leaders and  maligned the image of West Germany as a nation. Columnist William Safire, with  strident eloquence, recently wrote of the "Auschwitz in the desert," dubbing  the West German people Todeskraemer -- merchants of death.  </P> <P> This is not the first time the Nazi past has raised its lurid head over the  West Germans. In May, 1985, the laying of wreaths at the Bitburg cemetery  sparked similar outrage when it was disclosed that the burial ground contained  the graves of several SS members. Last fall, Bundestag Speaker Philipp  Jenninger, a Christian Democrat, resigned after he offered some well-intended,  but poorly received, remarks commemorating Kristallnacht, the Nazis' pogrom of  November, 1938.  </P> <P> Such events make one thing clear. Forty years after the collapse of the Third  Reich, the German people, still living under the shadow of the Nazi legacy,  must be careful with what they say -- and with what they export. The recent  past has vested West Germans with the moral imperative to carry themselves more  prudently than other nations. The involvement of Belgians, Danes and Austrians  in the poison-gas business has not evoked a similar sense of outrage.  </P> <P> But what about the East Germans? From the outset it was known that East Germany  was also involved in the construction of the poison-gas plant in Libya. Yet  East Germany has received only passing mention in the world media. Should not  East Germans bear the same moral burden for German fascism, German racism and  German crimes against humanity?  </P> <P> The territory occupied by East Germany constituted nearly one-third the  landmass of Hitler's Grossdeutschland and provided Lebensraum for approximately  20 million Aryan pure bloods, over 30% of whose electorate cast their votes to  the Nazis in 1933.  </P> <P> However, the shadow of the Nazi crimes that haunts West Germany rarely troubles  the Germans to the East. How is it that the East Germans have avoided this  stigma? In part, the East Germans were generally more assiduous in persecuting  former Nazis. They also consciously distanced themselves from many aspects of  the German past, adopting a new national anthem and leaving the people in Bonn  to toil with the tainted lyrics of "Deutschland uber alles." East Germany also  promoted the handy Marxist-Leninist syllogism that equates capitalism with  fascism, explaining that West Germany, as a capitalist state, inherited the  Nazi legacy.  </P> <P> The inaccessibility of East Germany to the Western media further helped to  insulate the country from recrimination. While East Germany remains a closed  society under Soviet domination, West Germany provides a more accessible target  for the world media. Camera crews can button-hole citizens on the streets of  obscure towns like Lahr. Reporters can comb West Germany's free press for  significant disclosures about government complicity in scandalous affairs.  Public officials can be called to account before the national and international  media.  </P> <P> At the same time, the West Germans' attempts to deal with the Nazi legacy in a  meaningful way have drawn attention to their role in the Holocaust. Films like  "Heimat," a mini-series that did for German fascism what "Roots" did for  American racism, pulled the skeletons out of the communal closet and paraded  them before prime-time television audiences. The highly acclaimed German  painter Anselm Kiefer, whose work was exhibited in Los Angeles and New York,  creates vast, painful canvasses that place Semitic and Teutonic imagery in  ominous constellations.  </P> <P> West Germans neither defend their past, nor deny their complicity in Nazi  crimes. As Chancellor Helmut Kohl observed during the commemoration service at  Bergen-Belsen on April 21, 1985, "reconciliation" for Nazi crimes can be  achieved only "if we Germans acknowledge our shame and our historical  responsibility."  </P> <P> The world media are justified in finding German interests in Libya's poison-gas  plant morally reprehensible, just as they found Kohl's initial denial of West  German involvement politically irresponsible. However, West German involvement  in Rabta, Libya, is not the same thing as fascist atrocities in Auschwitz,  Poland. Let's hold the Kohl government accountable for its transgressions, not  for those of the Nazi regime. Further, if we want to insist that the West  Germans, because of their past, have a moral obligation to act more responsibly  than other nations, let's not forget that the East Germans share the same  historic legacy and the same present complicity.  </P></p>

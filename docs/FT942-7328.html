			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / Landlords criticised on energy efficiency Owners of accommodation for private rental make the least investment in energy efficiency, according to a report published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Although many of these households will suffer the greatest impact from the imposition of value added tax on fuel, they are in the worst position to take steps to cut their bills, it says. The conclusion highlights one of the weaknesses of the Energy Saving Trust, whose future was the subject of a tense and prolonged Commons committee meeting yesterday. The trust, which is intended to subsidise energy saving measures by households, plans to direct almost all of its schemes at owner-occupiers. Some of the poorest households, particularly in urban areas, may not qualify. Yesterday, MPs on the Commons environment committee were grilling Ms Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, about her unwillingness to pass on the costs of the trust's schemes to gas customers. She said she would consider each scheme on its merits in the light of its cost-effectiveness. The IFS report says 'there are certain areas in which market failures may deter households from making rational decisions regarding energy efficiency investments'. While tenants in rented housing would benefit from lower fuel bills if the property were well insulated, responsibility for decisions about the fabric of the building usually lies with the landlord. The IFS report calls for improved information for tenants about energy efficiency. 'Only if tenants are willing to pay higher rents for more energy efficient properties will landlords face an incentive to make energy efficiency investments,' it argues.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Judy Lotz video report] </F>   [Text] Restrictive orders were issued today also against  residents of the settlement of Tapuah in Samaria. Judy Lotz met  two of them, who declared they will disobey the orders:    [Begin recording] [Lotz] What does your order say, David?    [David Axelrod] My order says that I may not enter Hebron  and Qiryat Arba' for three months, starting yesterday.    [Lotz] Did you have to turn in your gun?    [Axelrod] I did not receive this order, but I heard it  exists.    [Lotz] Did they come to take away your gun?    [Axelrod] They left notice that I should turn it in.    [Lotz] Did you?    [Axelrod] I did not, and I have no such intention.    [Lotz] You are violating the law, are you not?    [Axelrod] Am I? Forsaking Jews to be murdered is a violation  of our beliefs.    [Binyamin Ze'ev Kahana] I do not believe people will turn in  their guns. I find this hard to believe. I believe people will  rather sit in jail.    [Lotz] Will you turn in your gun?    [Kahana] I will turn in nothing. I find these orders  insignificant. They are illegal, immoral, and unreasonable.    [Lotz] Will you travel to Hebron and Nabulus, in defiance of  the orders?    [Kahana] I will go anywhere I please in this country. [end  recording]    The police arrested today Eyal Noqed, another Kakh activist,  who is one of the five the police are seeking to place under  administrative detention. Our police affairs correspondent Uri  Kohen-Aharonov has learned that Noqed was captured in an  apartment in Ra'anana, following intelligence information.  Currently, there are two Kakh members in police detention.  Qiryat Arba' residents fear that exile orders will be issued  this evening.</p>

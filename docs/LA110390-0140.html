			<p><P> November 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR SALE: USED S&amp;LS, INCLUDING LINCOLN  </P> <P> Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, the Irvine-based thrift that has become a symbol of  the nation's savings and loan debacle, was put up for sale Friday by federal  authorities.  </P> <P> Once owned by Charles H. Keating Jr., Lincoln was one of 18 failed savings and  loans put on the block by the federal Resolution Trust Corp., the agency formed  last year to clean up the S&amp;L mess. Also put up for sale was Imperial  Federal Savings Assn. in San Diego, the largest failed thrift in the state.  </P> <P> The failure of Lincoln, seized by regulators on April 14, 1989, is expected to  cost taxpayers more than $2 billion, which could make it the most expensive  S&amp;L failure ever. The RTC on Friday said Lincoln has $2.7 billion in assets  and $2.4 billion in deposits in its 29 branches. Lincoln has continued to post  huge losses, losing $327.3 million in the first six months of the year.  </P> <P> Lincoln, Imperial and the other 16 thrifts are being sold thanks to a loophole  in last year's thrift bailout bill. It allows the government to borrow up to  $18.8 billion to keep the bailout from stalling.  </P> <P> Congress adjourned last weekend without providing more money for the cleanup.  Federal regulators had been planning to sell or close 192 failed S&amp;Ls, with  assets valued at $119 billion, over the next six months.  </P> <P> Both Lincoln and Imperial are expected to be sold in either January or  February, an RTC executive said. Most deals the RTC is doing now involved only  the sale of branches, deposits and a minimum of assets, typically low-risk home  loans. In recent months, the main bidders for large failed thrifts in the west  have been two giant California banks, BankAmerica Corp. in San Francisco and  Security Pacific Corp. in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Lincoln probably has become the best-known failed thrift in the nation.  Keating, who faces numerous criminal and civil charges, used the thrift to  build vast real estate and resort projects. He also battled with regulators,  who argued that the thrift was a time bomb waiting to explode. Such politicians  as Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) have been criticized for ties to Keating.  </P> <P> Imperial, which has 78 offices in California, was the nation's 16th largest  S&amp;L when it was seized on Feb. 23 and severed from its parent firm,  Imperial Corp. of America. Regulators linked Imperial's failure to the  S&amp;L's troubled junk bond holdings, bought largely through the collapsed  Drexel Burnham Lambert investment bank, and losses in consumer loans,  especially auto loans.  </P> <P> During 1989, Imperial held about $1.5 billion in junk bonds, making it the  second largest holder of junk bonds among the nation's thrifts. The S&amp;L  held slightly more than $1 billion in junk bonds when seized, and now has about  $700 million in junk bonds, according to Imperial spokesman KennUlrich. The RTC  said Imperial has $7.9 billion in assets.  </P> <P> Imperial has been linked in shareholder suits to an alleged "daisy chain" that  involved Imperial, Drexel and various clients of Drexel. The suits allege that  former Drexel junk-bond financier Michael Milken orchestrated junk-bond deals  for Imperial to pump up fees for Drexel.  </P> <P> The S&amp;L's financial woes were driven by a decision to bolster Imperial's  profit margins by entering non-traditional and risky businesses such as junk  bonds and consumer lending. The strategy worked for a while, but Imperial  lacked the expertise to manage the troubled consumer loan portfolio. Imperial's  troubles were compounded when the market for junk bonds fell apart in 1989.  </P> <P> Imperial entered non-traditional businesses during the mid-1980s under the  leadership of Ken Thygerson, a former banking industry regulator who once  acknowledged that Imperial's non-traditional business ventures were "strange  and mysterious things" to most S&amp;L executives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE LINCOLN SAVINGS SAGA (Southland Edition)  </P> <P> 1926: Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan receives its California charter.  </P> <P> 1976: Charles H. Keating Jr. moves to Phoenix from Cincinnati to take over  Continental Homes of Arizona from parent company, American Financial Corp.,  later known as American Continental Corp.  </P> <P> 1979: Keating settles with Securities and Exchange Commission after being  accused of making insider bank loans totaling $14 million while at AFC.  </P> <P> 1984: American Continental acquires Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan for $51 million,  moving the S&amp;L out of the home-mortgage business and into speculative real  estate and junk bond investments.  </P> <P> 1985: Keating opposes regulations imposed by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board  limiting the amount of direct investments S&amp;Ls make in speculative real  estate and other ventures.  </P> <P> 1986: Federal and state regulators begin examination of Lincoln's books.  Federal regulators contend that Lincoln failed to report losses. Keating says  regulators are harassing Lincoln.  </P> <P> 1987: Bank board alerts SEC of possible securities violations. Federal  regulators in San Francisco recommend a federal seizure of Lincoln. Five  senators, including Alan Cranston (D-Calif), meet with Edwin Gray, head of  Federal Home Loan Bank Board, on Keating's behalf. M. Danny Wall replaces Gray.  The SEC launches an investigation of American Continental.  </P> <P> 1988: Wall orders a new examination and a transfer of Lincoln's supervision  from San Francisco to Washington.  </P> <P> 1989: In April, American Continental files for protection under Chapter 11 of  the bankruptcy code, restricting regulators' access to its records. The next  day Lincoln is seized by federal regulators. Keating sues to regain control of  Lincoln. Hundreds of American Continental bondholders sue Keating for fraud.  Resolution Trust Corp. in September files a $1.1-billion civil racketeering and  bank-fraud lawsuit against Keating and 19 associates. Keating refuses to  testify before the House Banking Committee in November. Senate Ethics Committee  begins probe of charges that Cranston and other senators improperly intervened  with federal regulators on Lincoln's behalf. Wall resigns. State and federal  grand juries begin criminal investigations.  </P> <P> 1990: Keating says in federal court that regulators wrecked Lincoln. The state  attorney general, through Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner, wins approval for  a special state grand jury to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing in the  sale of American Continental bonds. The State Department of Corporations sues  Keating and two executives for the return of $200 million to bondholders.  Federal judge rules that regulators acted properly in seizing Lincoln, saying  Keating looted it. Keating resigns from American Continental. Office of Thrift  Supervision seeks $41 million in restitution from Keating. A state grand jury  indicts Keating and three associates on 42 counts of fraud relating to the sale  of American Continental bonds. Keating spends a month in Los Angeles County  Jail before being released -- when his bail is reduced to $300,000 from $5  million.  </P> <P> Researched by Dallas M.

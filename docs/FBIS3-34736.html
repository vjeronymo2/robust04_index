			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary prepared by the News Research and Commentaries </F> Group]    [Text] Incoming reports indicate that after three days of  efforts, U.S. President Bill Clinton was finally able to set up  a telephone contact with his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin  yesterday and discuss the NATO ultimatum to the aggressor Serbs  who are violating Security Council resolutions.    Russia, which is considered to be an ally and supporter of  the Serbs, does not have a positive view on the recent NATO  ultimatum and wanted this issue to be discussed by the Security  Council. However, apparently the 30-minute telephone  conversation between Clinton and Yeltsin has reduced the extent  of the differences of opinion between the two sides on the  West's decision and on the ultimatum. After the telephone  conversation, Moscow stated that the United States and Russia  have agreed on a division of tasks among the conflicting sides  in Bosnia that will eventually help to overcome the Bosnian  crisis.    Before the Clinton-Yeltsin discussion, Russia's UN  representative had called for an extraordinary Security Council  session. However, after the telephone conversation, he  rectified the objective behind such a session and stated that  what Russia has in mind is the dispute over the disarmament of  Sarajevo.    The truth is that currently not only the Russian Government  but the Russian opposition parties have adopted a negative  stance on the ultimatum. Some political experts believe that  even though Yeltsin's flexibility toward Clinton stems from his  interest in Washington's support for Moscow, politically it will  lead to the weakening of Yeltsin's position at home. Meanwhile,  what Yeltsin attaches hopes to is what the rest of the world  feels: the West's deceitful stance, which weakens the  possibility of a NATO attack on the Serbs.    The West's policy of double standards on international  crises  and differences in its acts and deeds on Bosnia have reached an  intolerable point. In tandem with the West's warning to the  Serbs and the setting of a deadline for the withdrawal of their  heavy arms from around Sarajevo, the leader of the aggressive  and criminal Serbs was able to gain UN agreement on forming an  investigating commission to determine which side was responsible  for the shocking massacre at Sarajevo market. The UN's  agreement with this request is tantamount to the acquittal of  the Serbs in this rare crime.    Actually, the West has granted the Serbs a concession  vis-a-vis the ultimatum against them. Meanwhile, with the  mitigation of pressures on the Muslims with the evacuation of  positions around Sarajevo, they have added military pressures on  Muslims in other parts of Bosnia. For this reason, the Bosnian  representative at the Geneva talks disagreed with efforts to  separate the fate of the Bosnian capital from the fate of other  regions and stated that he wants a comprehensive agreement on  Bosnia.    At a time when the European Community and its  representatives  in the Geneva talks, as well as the Croat and Serb sides, are  seeking to dismember Bosnia, it is only the Bosnian Muslims who  continue their jihad for preserving the integrity of the country.</p>

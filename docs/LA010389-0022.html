			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> One hundred professors and prominent personalities have signed a petition  asking the Polish government for open elections to the Sejm (Parliament) this  year, a spokesman said. The petition, presented to the government ombudsman's  office and given to Western news agencies, said any citizen should have the  right to run for the Sejm after being nominated by a certain portion --  possibly 1% -- of eligible voters. Currently, nominations are controlled by the  Communist Party, which in effect determines how many seats go to Communists, to  allied political parties and to non-party members.  </P></p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / MB-Caradon seeks new challenge: CarnaudMetalbox stake may raise Pounds 500m Ever since the Carnaud-Metalbox merger, there has been speculation that MB-Caradon would not be a long-term holder of its 25.3 per cent shareholding. At last there is a formal decision by the UK group to sell the stake, which has provided a large chunk of profits but much less in cash dividends. The decision by MB-Caradon to seek shareholders' authority for a sale marks the rehabilitation of the packaging group rather than discontent with the merger. CarnaudMetalbox's share price, in sterling terms, has never been higher. But for a couple of years after the merger, MB-Caradon looked to be stuck with the holding. The merger seemed doomed by a clash of cultures at the top and the share price dived. MB-Caradon and CGIP, the French holding company with an equal stake in CarnaudMetalbox, together claim the credit for introducing new management to the packaging group. Mr Jurgen Hintz, an American, became chief executive in autumn 1991 and appears to have cut through Anglo-French difficulties and galvanised the group. Profits have improved and the share price has recovered. Mr Peter Jansen, chief executive of MB-Caradon, says: 'We have always said there would be a moment when it was worth our while to sell. It is not a bad moment to consider it.' MB-Caradon's patience has been rewarded and a sale at the current market value - of Pounds 549m at last night's closing price - will give it a good profit on last year's book value of Pounds 344.4m. Now speculation will turn to two new questions. Who will buy the stake, and what will MB-Caradon spend the money on? Mr Jansen says: 'We have given a clear indication we want to sell. But there is always the possibility that no-one will buy.' However, he does not seem seriously worried that there will be a lack of buyers. Analysts think that the decision to hold an extraordinary meeting on March 4, rather than waiting for the annual meeting in May, suggests MB-Caradon already has a purchaser in mind. There are restrictions on the sale, though. Under an agreement between MB-Caradon and CGIP, CGIP must be given the chance to match a third party bid. Without an identified third party, MB-Caradon can offer the stake to CGIP at the average share price over the preceding 60 trading days. CGIP can then buy all or part of the stake. It is hard to see why another company would want to get into MB-Caradon's position - receiving a small cash return on a large investment - without the agreement with CGIP which has effectively given the two shareholders control of CarnaudMetalbox. A buyer could, perhaps, hope that CGIP will eventually want to sell its stake, opening the way for a full bid. For its part, CGIP does not seem to have the cash to acquire the whole of MB-Caradon's stake. Other companies friendly to CGIP might be interested. Or there is the possibility that CGIP could buy part of the stake and the rest could be placed. Mr Jansen feels that a placing would not give MB-Caradon the best price, though it might be welcome to CarnaudMetalbox, especially if UK institutions, which sold after the merger, reinvested. MB-Caradon's balance sheet is already strong, with net debt of Pounds 69.1m. If it raises Pounds 500m from the sale, and gears up as well, it could make a sizeable acquisition or a number of smaller ones. Mr Jansen says the group wants to 'find a replacement for CarnaudMetalbox's profits stream, that we could do better with because we could manage it'. That replacement must be 'something within our focus.' In the longer term that means building products - Mr Jansen admits that in time security printing could be overwhelmed within the group - probably in the UK and Europe. Mr Jansen says he is 'more comfortable to buy in an upturn' and believes the UK economy will recover sooner than economies in continental Europe which he says will be less buoyant in 1993. He believes there are plenty of opportunities for acquisitions and prices have not yet moved out of reach. MB-Caradon's products - which include Everest double glazing, Twyfords bathroom fittings and Mira showers - are mainly branded goods aimed at the housing repair and maintenance market. These are the sort of businesses the group will look at, Mr Jansen says. But judging by the stock market reaction yesterday, many companies in the sector are seen as targets. Far from dying down, speculation about MB-Caradon's plans will flourish until the stake is sold and the money reinvested.  -------------------------------------------------        CARNAUDMETALBOX RECOVERS  ------------------------------------------------- MB-Caradon (Pounds m)  -------------------------------------------------                    1989      90     91 Total trading profit    117.7   121.3  125.5  ------------------------------------------------- of which CarnaudMetalbox    37.1    31.8   31.8  ------------------------------------------------- Dividend received            5.7     7.3    7.8  ------------------------------------------------- CarnaudMetalbox (FFr bn)  -------------------------------------------------                    1989      90     91     92  ------------------------------------------------- Turnover           22.3    24.4   25.5   24.8  ------------------------------------------------- Pre-tax profits             1.5     1.6    2.0    n/a  ------------------------------------------------- Year to December 31  -------------------------------------------------</p>

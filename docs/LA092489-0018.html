			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: THE WORLD WE CREATED AT HAMILTON HIGH BY GERALD GRANT  (HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $9.95)  </P> <P> A thoughtful meditation on the problems of secondary education in America  during the latter 20th Century. The first section of the book, a fictionalized  history of a composite "typical" high school between 1953 and 1985, reveals the  effects the shifting mores of those troubled decades had on class structure,  curriculum, teaching and discipline.  </P> <P> Gerald Grant's theory of education, which comprises the second half of the  book, is more problematic. He argues that all education must have "a strong  positive ethos" (i.e. a moral basis) but fails to resolve the thorny question  of how to establish that ethos in a pluralistic and increasingly fragmented  society. His call for community consensus as first step seems naive, if not  unrealistic, at a time when the decline of the American educational system is  the subject of widespread debate and controversies rage over teaching  evolution, sex education, AIDS prevention, the importance of minority cultures  and instruction in languages other than English.  </P></p>

Galway oystermen expect to harvest hundreds of thousands of  oysters from mid-November to the end of December, but at the end  of their first day boatmen had 40 oysters between them, instead  of the normal thousand for each of a dozen boats.    Oyster beds at Clarenbridge, the village that hosts an  annual  oyster festival, have almost been eliminated and other areas are  at risk. The threat comes from bonamia, a wasting disease, which  poses no threat to people eating oysters but is fatal to the  shellfish.    Environmentalists say bonamia is one of the worst ecological  disasters to strike Ireland this century. There is no known cure  and marine scientists have found that its effects could take  between 50 and 100 years to clear.    Michael Kennedy, manager of Ireland's Western Region  Fisheries Board, said: "Something like 90 percent of the shells  are coming up empty. It is very, very serious."    Bonamia spread to Europe from California, destroying  millions  of oysters in France, and reached the British Isles a decade  ago. In Britain, it was first located in the West Country and  spread to the south and east coasts.    Len Hodges, 70, who runs the Duchy of Cornwall farm, near  Falmouth, said that before the disease arrived in 1983 he had a  staff of 18, but had since had to lay off all but three. To  survive, many farmers have begun breeding the Pacific oyster,  which is unaffected by the disease.</p>

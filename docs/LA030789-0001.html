			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: BUSH FLIES IN WITH A LINE FOR BARBARA'S LATEST CHAPTER  </P> <P> The First Lady hopes her new project will be one for the books. Once again  turning her attention to a longtime favorite cause, she announced the formation  of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy. The volunteer program,  headed by Joan Abrahamson of Los Angeles' Jefferson Institute, will raise money  and distribute grants to existing literacy programs that involve not only  children, but also their parents and grandparents. President Bush paid a  surprise visit to the White House lunch at which the foundation plan was  announced, labeling himself "a fly on the wall" who has "studied with Barbara  Bush and learned a lot." Among the 120 luncheon guests were women who are  learning to read along with their children. Also attending were Education  Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos and Labor Secretary Elizabeth Hanford Dole.  </P> <P>  -- Japan's Empress Dowager Nagako, widow of Emperor Hirohito, observed her  86th birthday privately with her family at the imperial palace, a spokesman  said. The empress dowager, who has made few public appearances since last year  because of worsening health, lunched with her son, Emperor Akihito, his wife,  Empress Michiko, and other family members, the spokesman said. No public  ceremonies were scheduled because of continued mourning for Emperor Hirohito,  who died Jan. 7.  </P> <P>  -- In another part of Asia, final preparations were under way for the  coronation of a 43-year-old prince as the new Sultan of Jogjakarta. Prince  Mangkubumi, who runs a construction company and heads local branches of the  Chamber of Commerce and the ruling political party, will be crowned today in  one of Indonesia's last kingdoms. The prince is the eldest son of  Hamengkubuwono IX, a hero of Indonesia's struggle for independence and ruler of  one of Java's four remaining sultanates for 48 years before he died last  October at age 76. He held national government posts, but "the new sultan will  only reign over the family," an official said. Hundreds of guards took up  positions around the palace courtyard as retainers prepared a banyan tree to be  planted by the new sultan to mark the start of his rule. SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

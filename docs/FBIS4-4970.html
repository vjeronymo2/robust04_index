			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by John Wallach] </F>   [Text] The United States may have no more than "a few days"  warning of any North Korean attack against South Korea, a senior  U.S. intelligence official disclosed Monday.    The short warning time has led U.S. forces to employ a "vast  array" of technological and human spy techniques to keep ahead  in the war of nerves on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. official  said.    North Korea's troops are as close to ready as any forces  that  we ever faced in the Cold War, he said. "With the high state of  readiness that has developed over quite some time, you can't  expect hopefully more than a matter of a few days" warning, he  said.    The U.S. official said the problem of knowing if and when  North Korea plans to attack is compounded by the fact that  Pyongyang has increased the numbers of "forward deployed" troops  along its border with South Korea and "their general condition  of readiness."    Thus, if North Korea wanted to attack, "it wouldn't have to  change a great deal," he said.    Since the end of 1992, North Korea has increased its  military  strength from 16 corps or 144 divisions to 17 corps or 152  divisions, boosting the total number of North Korean troops to  1,030,000, he said.    Two-thirds of North Korea's troops are positioned within 60  miles of the demilitarized zone (DMZ) at the 38th parallel  dividing the two nations. Seoul, South Korea's capital, is only  25 miles from the DMZ, within range of North Korea's big  artillery pieces.    U.S. plans call for a combined U.S.-South Korean force of  about 400,000 troops. The United States currently has 37,000  troops in South Korea.    Among the techniques used by the CIA to detect changes are  satellite photography, electronic or "signals" eavesdropping,  aircraft and "humint," the intelligence gathered by human  beings, presumably South Korean agents smuggled into North Korea.    "You try to look at patterns of behavior and see if they're  changing," the official said. "Our warning people have long  lists of things they are particularly interested in."    They include such seemingly mundane items as shipments of  morphine designed to treat expected casualties and unusually  large shipments of ammunition and other supplies.    Other warning signs include unusual troop movements, the  mobilization of reserve forces.    None of these has yet showed any unusual activity, the  official said.    But the art of obtaining such knowledge, when your enemy  goes  to inordinate lengths to conceal it, is an inexact science at  best, the official said.    The experts divide the signs into two categories:  unambiguous and ambiguous.    "You're rarely lucky enough to get absolutely clear-cut  signs  because the other guy tries to disguise it and also tries to  frighten you by doing some things that may not be genuine," he  said.    Such advance warning is critical to providing U.S. and South  Korean troops with enough time to prepare for either a  counterattack or to launch a preemptive strike, a move which  Defense Secretary William J. Perry has pointedly refused to rule  out.</p>

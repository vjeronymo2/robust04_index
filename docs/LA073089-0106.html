			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CARIBBEAN CARNIVALS -- A MAGICAL BLEND OF DIVERSE CULTURES  </P> <P> Behind the Caribbean's sandy beaches, palm trees and fruity rum drinks is a  festival waiting to happen. A festival, Caribbean style, is part street party,  part masquerade and part jam session.  </P> <P> Travelers to Trinidad know that a Caribbean festival is not a spectator sport.  Unlike an American parade, where people line the sidewalks watching the bands  march and majorettes twirl, audience participation is part and parcel of  Caribbean festivals. When a Carnival band goes by, playing its infectious  calypso or steel-band music, the audience jumps in and dances in the street  with the music makers.  </P> <P> "The music almost forces you to participate," said singer and poet Hollis  (Flash) Lashley, a native of Trinidad who lives in Silver Spring, Md. "It's  what our Caribbean culture is all about. The movement and music and color of a  festival are an integral part of who we are and how we live."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Take Festivals Along  </P> <P> These festivals have become such an important part of peoples' lives in the  Caribbean that they don't leave home without them. Wherever West Indians settle  in large numbers, their festivals are likely to follow. Brooklyn, Toronto,  Baltimore, Boston and London have all been host to Caribbean festivals.  </P> <P> In Washington, the Smithsonian Institution is recognizing these annual events  as an art and as the cultural expressions of the people of the Caribbean in a  new exhibition, "Caribbean Festival Arts," continuing until Feb. 15, 1990. The  exhibition, originally organized by the St. Louis Art Museum, is complemented  by dozens of special events, including live performances of calypso and  steel-band music, crafts and costume-making demonstrations, films and  educational programs.  </P> <P> "In presenting three festivals -- Junkanoo, Carnival and Hosay from Trinidad  and Tobago -- we hope to give North American audiences a sense of the Caribbean  culture," Vera Hyatt, the Smithsonian's project director for the exhibition,  said. "The essence of this culture is a synthesis of many influences: African,  English, French, Indian and Spanish. A kind of cross-fertilization took place  in the islands of the West Indies and the result is a culture that is unique to  the Caribbean."  </P> <P> In the exhibit, as in a real-life festival, the dominant themes are music and  masquerade. Music is at the heart of any festival, whether it is reggae in  Jamaica or French songs in Haiti or steel bands in Trinidad.  </P> <P> </P> <P> European Influences  </P> <P> Original Carnival music can be traced to European influences -- to minstrel  bands and court music. The African sounds of drums were introduced in the 17th  Century when millions of African slaves worked on the sugar-cane plantations  dotting the islands.  </P> <P> Calypso was introduced in the mid-1800s in Trinidad where slaves sang the  call-and-response songs and humorous ditties of their African homelands.  Today's soca, popular music combining calypso and American soul, began in 1975  with the release of two recordings, "Sweet Music" and "Endless Vibration" by  singer Lord Shorty.  </P> <P> Reggae originated in the mid-1960s as a music of the Jamaican poor. The  distinctive sound of reggae's loud electric bass with organ, piano and drums,  was popularized in the United States in the early 1970s in the film "The Harder  They Come," starring singer Jimmy Cliff, and through tours of Bob Marley and  the Wailers.  </P> <P> But the drum provides the pulse of all Caribbean music, and nowhere is that  more obvious than in the steel band. The pan or steel drum tradition goes back  to the drums of Africa. When the Trinidad government banned drums in 1883 on  the grounds that they were loud and disruptive, the "tambour bamboo" bands  played on, using bamboo cylinders similar to the African Shango drum ensembles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Found' Instruments  </P> <P> Fifty years later, bands were experimenting with an array of "found  instruments" -- including kettles, salt boxes and paint cans -- to give louder,  stronger sounds.  </P> <P> On V-E Day, May 8, 1945, everything from trash cans to biscuit tins was fair  game for the drummers rejoicing in the streets. One year later, a new device  arrived on the Carnival scene -- the 55-gallon oil drum, used to ship  Venezuelan oil to refineries in Trinidad, Aruba, Curacao and other Caribbean  islands. The unique sound qualities of the oil drums and their availability  made them immediately -- and lastingly -- popular.  </P> <P> Today, some say that Carnival without pan would be like nature without color.  Journalist Knolly Moses, a Trinidadian living in New York City, occasionally  plays pan and describes the experience this way: "A veil is lifted and it takes  everyone over. It's almost as if I'm possessed. The music is that powerful. Our  goal is to bring everyone together with our music."  </P> <P> The costume of masquerade of festivals is also steeped in traditions that can  be traced to the days of slavery and rule by European colonists. Jamaica's  Junkanoo traditionally celebrated in late December, today is often presented on  important state occasions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Masks Came in Handy  </P> <P> Junkanoo is the perfect illustration of African and European influences,  according to Judith Bettelheim, co-curator of "Caribbean Festival Arts" and  professor of art at San Francisco State University. The masks worn during  festivals came in handy during the years before emancipation, she said, since  slaves could make fun of their owners during festivals while remaining  anonymous behind their disguises.  </P> <P> Costumes are also essential to Carnival, and today many people begin planning  next year's creation the minute this year's festival is over.  </P> <P> Masquerade bands number from 100 to 5,000 members; a band leader sets the theme  for his group, which can be literally anything under the sun -- from sailors to  extraterrestrials. A 1981 band, "Jungle Fever," organized by Trinidad's Peter  Minshall, required 2,500 costumes, 15 seamstresses and more than two dozen  painters and decorators. The band's most spectacular costume measured 15-by-2O  feet and sparkled with 220,000 hand-stitched sequins. Regardless of theme, the  bands' most elaborate masquerades are made of wire structures covered with  brilliantly colored and decorated fabric.  </P> <P> The costumes and bands are different every year but, according to poet Lashley,  a veteran of more than 20 Carnivals, a traditional Carnival will include at  least one American Indian, a sailor and a casual, randomly costumed Ole Mas  (Masquerade) band.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Costumes a Treasure  </P> <P> Roslyn Ledley, who lives in Brooklyn, N.Y., said she began wearing costumes at  Carnival as a child when she would "dress in a little nonsense." She now  treasures her costumes. "I feel so good because other people can see what we  can do with a few pieces of material," Ledley said. "We make these costumes  come alive in the streets."  </P> <P> Exhibition curator John Nunley of the St. Louis Art Museum sees the costumes  themselves as art. "These modern urban costume designers," he said, "are  artists who use non-traditional objects -- tinsel, aluminum, mirrors and bottle  caps -- to fashion their masquerades, which remind me of dancing mobiles.  </P> <P> "It's the almost magical combination of music and masquerade that makes these  festivals unique," Nunley added. "The costumes are a visual art but the rhythm  and beat of the music is what draws people into the celebration."  </P> <P> Trinidad hosts what one guidebook calls the "granddaddy of all festivals."  Carnival-goers begin preparation in January when costumes are designed and  steel-band rehearsals begin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> King and Queen Named  </P> <P> On the Friday before Carnival, celebrated during the week before Ash Wednesday,  contests are held to select the king and queen. On Saturday, thousands of  schoolchildren play mas on the streets of Port-of-Spain and that evening the  steel-band competition, or Pan-O-Rama, is held. Bands play through the night  and on Sunday in preparation for Jouvay (from the French for opening day)  Monday, when bands parade through the streets of the city to Independence  Square.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Carnival's grand finale, the air is filled with the sounds of  soca, calypso and steel bands as the revelers parade over an outdoor stage to  show off their costumes.  </P> <P> Carnival is as unique to Trinidad as Junkanoo is to Jamaica. But, in their own  ways, they are unifying events. "The festivals of these islands are what bring  the various elements of the diverse cultures together," the Smithsonian's Hyatt  said. "It is the one art form that cuts across the social and economic  stratification that is so prevalent in the Caribbean."  </P></p>

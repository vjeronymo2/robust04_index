			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TA SR report: "Cohesion: Path Toward Prosperity"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--"I appreciate President Michal Kovac's  realistic view of the contemporary Slovak political scene and  the Slovak Republic's present problems." This is how Jan  Carnogursky, chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement  [KDH], reacted to the Slovak president's New Year address, which  was broadcast on radio and television on Saturday [1 January].  Slovakia does indeed need a broad coalition, the KDH chairman  continued, and our movement is ready to form such a coalition  along with those parties or parts of parties whose programs are  compatible with our program in the sense that at least a  compromise is possible.    Other politicians, too, voiced their opinions on the  contents  of the Slovak president's New Year address.    "The idea of a broad coalition is not new. The Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL] endorsed it before and after the  elections. We have never claimed that we have five experts for  every ministerial post [allusion to Prime Minister Meciar's  statement] and that we could accomplish everything on our own,"  SDL Chairman Peter Weiss said. "The SDL was ready to cooperate,  but the idea of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  was such that it would share not power but only responsibility  for the execution of power. Saying `join us' represents no  platform for cooperation. A broad coalition is not possible with  the HZDS as a whole, but only with that part of the HZDS that is  willing and able to draw moral and political conclusions from  the mistakes committed by the ruling movement," the SDL chairman  added.    Milan Secansky (HZDS): "What I appreciated in the  president's  New Year address were his words about Slovakia's prosperity,  which, as he stressed, can be achieved only through unity. I  consider the unification of the politically fragmented forces in  Slovakia the only way to achieve prosperity."    Vojtech Bugar (Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement):  "The president realistically assessed the possibilities for the  emergence of a broad coalition, which should stabilize the  political situation in Slovakia. Current problems must not be  brought to a head but tackled. I cannot help but agree with this  view. And I can even agree with the view that, without the HZDS,  it is impossible to form a broad coalition. However, I am  convinced that it is possible to form such a coalition without  Mr. Meciar."</p>

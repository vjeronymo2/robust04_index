			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 31 Mar -- During his visit to Moscow,  Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev expressed a proposal  to create a Eurasian union within the framework of which  supernational bodies would be formed to coordinate economic and  military policy. Within the framework of this union it is  necessary to elect a single parliament by way of direct  elections, to create a council of defense ministers and a single  defence complex, and also an interstate secretariat, which would  be appointed by heads of states, Mr. Nazarbayev believes.    He stated that the countries, which are in agreement to the  principles of a Eurasian union, would enter its composition and  mutual relations would be developed with the other countries of  the former USSR on a bilateral basis. Nursultan Nazarbayev  noted that he discussed this issue during talks with Russia's  President Boris Yeltsin.    Commenting on this proposal by the Kazakh president,  Ukraine's Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko noted: "This is not a  new idea for us. It has already been put forward. We have  looked and listened to it closely. However, it if is now an  official proposal then we should approach it more seriously,  study it in detail, define our stance, and make an appraisal.  If this is a Eurasian union, then issues of both a political  and an economic nature arise as the main factors of future  cooperation. Therefore, I am not yet ready to give a final  answer. However, I can say that there should be cooperation in  the geopolitical space of the former Soviet Union. And this  cooperation should naturally be initiated on some kind of an  appropriate basis, but without creating such structures that  would serve as a supernational body or which would acquire the  rights of an international subject. One could cooperate on this  basis.    Therefore, Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal (I think that he  will make it at the meeting of heads of CIS states on 15 April)  needs to be studied in more detail."</p>

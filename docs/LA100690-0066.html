			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONCRETE SHELL POURED TO HOLD FIXED PIPELINE  </P> <P> Work to repair the major water pipeline break in Scripps Ranch was progressing  on schedule Friday and authorities said Tuesday remains the projected date for  restoring water service to 400,000 parched customers in East and South  counties.  </P> <P> Repairs "are going very well," said Jim Melton, spokesman for the San Diego  County Water Authority, which provides water to most of the county.  </P> <P> San Diego County's first Stage 4 alert remains in place, but with customers  reducing their water consumption by up to two-thirds in some areas, all five  water districts affected by the shortage decided to ease outdoor watering  emergency restrictions from 5 p.m. Thursday to 8 a.m. Sunday.  </P> <P> The lifting of mandatory restrictions allows residents to water their parched  landscaping once between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. during the designated days. Use of  sprinklers and watering of lawns is prohibited.  </P> <P> Water authorities, however, urged residential and commercial customers not to  go overboard. Outdoor watering is otherwise prohibited until the lifting of the  Stage 4 alert.  </P> <P> Water abusers face citations or the shut-off of their water, but this has not  happened during the crisis, officials said.  </P> <P> Otay Water District originally did not ease its restrictions, saying the  situation remained critical for its more than 100,000 customers, but announced  Friday that it was joining the other four water districts in lifting the ban  temporarily. Otay's residential customers with even-numbered addresses may  water from 5 p.m. today to 8 a.m. Sunday and customers with odd-numbered  addresses may water from 5 p.m. Sunday to 8 a.m. Monday.  </P> <P> The other affected districts are the Padre Dam Municipal Water District and  Helix, Riverview and Lakeside water districts, which serve eastern areas of the  county.  </P> <P> Landscaping of Otay Water District customers received some relief Thursday when  eight water trucks covered the 128-square-mile area spraying water collected  from neighboring water districts. Local construction companies donated the use  of the trucks through the weekend.  </P> <P> On Friday, San Diego County Water Authority crews finished welding 40 feet of  replacement pipe into existing pipeline and began pouring concrete into the  support frame surrounding the new pipe.  </P> <P> The pouring of 80 yards of concrete will continue through today to create the  1-yard-thick concrete shell that supports the steel pipeline. The pipe will  carry about 70 million gallons daily.  </P> <P> After the concrete shell has cured, the pipeline will be filled with water and  pressurized, a process that takes nearly a day. Water service is to be restored  Tuesday, but officials would not estimate the time of day.  </P> <P> "That's no guarantee, but that's what we're planning," Melton said.  </P> <P> East and South county residents have been relying on surplus water supplies and  water from Lake Jennings in Lakeside since the Sept. 28 pipeline rupture.  </P></p>

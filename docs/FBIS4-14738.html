			<p>BFN     [Text] Gradual demilitarization would be the best  arrangement for the Crimea, the republic's President Yuriy  Meshkov said at a news conference in Simferopol. He was against  the situation where, as he puts it, the defense units of two  countries are stationed on its soil.    Meshkov said that he did not press for the independence of  Crimea. He explained that he wanted the Crimean republic to be  autonomous in resolving economic issues.    According to the president, 1,081,000 out of the 1,087,000  eligible voters responded to the March 27 poll. Treaty  relations between the Crimea and Ukraine were supported by 78.4  percent, dual Crimean-Russian and Crimean-Ukrainian citizenship  by 82.8 percent, and making the Crimean president's decrees  binding on issues not yet covered by the Crimean legislation, by  77.9 percent.    Meshkov said that the elections of the Crimean parliament  "bore out the results of the presidential elections and showed  that the Crimean population supported the platform of the Russia  bloc." He described as clumsy the allegations of certain  politicians that ethnic Russians alone had voted in the  elections.</p>

			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WILANDER GETS EASY START IN FRENCH OPEN  </P> <P> Defending men's champion Mats Wilander of Sweden should have an easy time in  the first two rounds of the French Open tennis championships.  </P> <P> In today's draw, he was chosen to meet a qualifier in the first round. If he  wins, his second-round opponent will be the winner of another match between two  qualifiers.  </P> <P> Wilander, the No. 4 seed, won three Grand Slam titles in 1988 and vaulted into  the No. 1 ranking in the world. Since then, however, he has been off form and  dropped to No. 4 in the rankings.  </P> <P> His opponents will be determined Sunday following the completion of the  qualifying tournament for the final 16 spots.  </P> <P> Top seed Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia will meet West German Davis Cup player  Patrick Kuhnen in the first round.  </P> <P> No. 2 seed Boris Becker, who led West Germany to the Davis Cup title, faces  American Jim Pugh in the first round.  </P> <P> Third-seeded Stefan Edberg of Sweden drew Czechoslovakia's Marian Vajda for his  first match, while fifth-seeded Andre Agassi of the United States will play  another Swede, Johan Carlsson.  </P> <P> On the women's side, defending champion Steffi Graf of West Germany, seeking  her sixth straight Grand Slam title, is the top seed and Gabriela Sabatini of  Argentina is seeded second. Both should reach the final easily since Martina  Navratilova and Chris Evert are skipping the tournament.  </P> <P> Graf drew American Camille Benjamin in the first round, while Sabatini got  Japan's Akemi Nishiya.  </P></p>

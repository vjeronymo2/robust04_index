"The Russian representative in the Security Council should  use the right of the veto in case the issue of air operations of  NATO (in Bosnia) is discussed", the Party of Russian Unity and  Accord (PRES), headed by Sergey Shakhray, said in a statement  circulated in the Duma on Friday.    On Thursday Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN  Security Council on Bosnia.    Air strikes on the conflicting sides in Bosnia are  "inadmissible and extremely dangerous", PRES said in the  statement, adding that the strikes will cause much more  casualties than the mortar attack on Sarajevo market on Saturday  which claimed at least 68 lives.    "In the concrete conditions of Bosnia-Herzegovina air  strikes  cannot be either limited or selective. The tragedy in Sarajevo  market will be multiplied in case of bombardments", the faction  said.    The direct involvement of NATO forces in combat actions will  escalate violence which can spread to other countries and result  in unpredictable consequences, the faction warned and said that  it is only possible to ensure ground protection of UN  humanitarian convoys in Bosnia.</p>

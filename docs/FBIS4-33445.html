According to Cuban delegation sources, Robaina and His  Highness Al Thani spoke for more than 30 minutes in a positive  atmosphere, consistent with the signs of hospitality and respect  shown the delegation throughout its stay here.    The two officials exchanged views on the current status of  bilateral relations and agreed that both governments have an  interest in finding ways to increase and develop these  relations. The Cuban official expressed his country's interest  in developing cooperation in areas that have already been  identified, including health, medical products, and tourism, as  well as in other areas where equal opportunities and  possibilities for investment exist.    Moreover, Prince Al Thani reasserted his country's  determination to maintain independent relations with Cuba, based  on respect for each country's sovereignty and the freedom to  choose its own means of social development.

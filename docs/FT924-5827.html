			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / World Trade News: French MPs vote on farm deal veto today A French parliamentary vote late today against the US-EC deal on farm trade became a certainty yesterday as the three main opposition parties laid down a resolution, calling on the government to veto, if necessary, the Gatt agreement. Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the agriculture minister, has cautioned that to brandish a possible veto at this stage would be to advertise France's weakness and isolation within the EC. But the government cannot afford to put a less anti-Gatt motion to the National Assembly, if it wants to avoid being outflanked on such a sensitive issue in the run-up to next March's elections. The neo-Gaullist RPR and the UDF and UDC centrist parties are manoeuvring to try to prevent the government turning the near-total consensus on the Gatt issue into a confidence vote in the shaky Socialist government. But, in substance, the government and opposition positions will not be far apart, because both sides want a show of unity to impress EC partners with the depth and breadth of French hostility to the draft Gatt accord, which would cut subsidised EC exports by 21 per cent over the next six years. Today's crucial cabinet meeting, at which the government will decide what motion to put to Parliament, and the subsequent National Assembly debate, will come under pressure from some of farm unions gathered in Paris to protest. The opposition motion says the draft agreement is: 'Contrary to the fundamental interests of France as well as of the EC'; Insists a Gatt deal must be compatible with reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and be balanced in its scope; Asks the government to request a special EC council 'to inform its partners immediately of the impossibility of France giving its agreement to this text'; Presses the government to 'use all means at its disposal, including its right of veto, to obtain these fundamental guarantees before pursuing Gatt negotiations and before putting CAP reform into effect'. Protesting French farmers yesterday saw their case strengthened by an estimate from Insee, the government statistics service, that their average income will fall 5.9 per cent this year, after rises in the past two years.</p>

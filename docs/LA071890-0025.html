Kevin McNeal Watson was arrested after the shooting death of Richard  Mavar, 30, in his home Sunday night.  </P> <P> The shooting occurred just after 11 p.m. when an intruder, armed with a  high-powered rifle, surprised Mavar and his wife as they sat in their family  room. Police said the intruder entered the house through doors left open  because of the heat. Watson was picked up by officers shortly after the  shooting as he jumped over a fence in the quiet residential neighborhood. The  victim and his wife had moved into the new home only three months ago.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Last night [30 December] at the Ministry of the  Revolutionary Armed Forces headquarters, Raul and Commander of  the Revolution Juan Almeida presented epaulets to a group of  Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR] officers promoted to the rank  of colonel, men who have fulfilled their mission exemplarily in  defense, teaching, and research.    After the ceremony, I approached Army General Raul Castro  and  asked him to speak to the Cuban people. Please listen to his  words. I invite our listeners to keep them in mind.    [Begin recording] To our entire people, especially to my FAR  and Interior Ministry [Minint] comrades: I congratulate you on  the 35th anniversary of the triumph of the Revolution. This  congratulations is for struggle against all problems. The coming  year will also be difficult. Everything is dependent upon our  effort.    To the FAR and Minint troops: We have faced difficult times  before, even before the triumph of the Revolution; even earlier  generations, beginning with the Mambises. We maintain that same  spirit of never surrendering, of courageously facing all  adversity -- objective and subjective problems. There are as  many of one as of the other.    This year, during the 35th anniversary, when television and  radio play the national anthem -- which, as a matter of fact,  they forgot to play a year or two ago -- please dedicate at  least one moment to thinking about, internalizing thoughts: What  has each one of us done? Not what have others done. What are our  faults? What individual shortcomings have we? Begin with  yourself and follow up with an analysis of the whole the Cuban  people.    I wish you happiness, which means: Continue the struggle.</p>

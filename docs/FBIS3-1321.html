In reaction to that letter, the UTD and CAR chairmen  each accompanied by one aide met the same day at 1530 to put  finishing touches to their discussions on the choice of a prime  minister. The two parties agreed that the CAR should propose  one of its activists to take up the prime ministerial post.  Following this agreement the CAR proposed a name that was then  accepted by the UTD. The two political parties are now waiting  for the head of state's invitation to a meeting in order to  convey the name to him. [end recording]</p>

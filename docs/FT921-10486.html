			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / High rate of poll tax court calls reported MORE THAN one in five of poll tax payers in Labour-controlled boroughs have received summonses for non-payment, three in four of which have led to court liability orders, according to a survey of 21 district councils. The survey, published yesterday by the Local Government Information Unit, was confined to Labour councils in England. It confirms a report last year by the Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, which found that 21 per cent of poll tax payers required a summons before paying. According to the survey, conducted between April 1990 and September 1991, summonses were issued against 442,000 of the nearly 2m poll tax payers covered by the councils; 77 per cent resulted in liability orders. Fewer than one in 10 of those summoned had paid their tax in full before their cases came to court, while 86 per cent of liability orders were being pursued by bailiffs at the time of the survey. Reading district, one of those surveyed, summoned 34,000 of its 98,000 poll tax payers in the 1990-91 financial year, with liability orders made against 30,000 - up from 26,000 in the first year of the tax. About one in seven of the orders applied to those paying only 20 per cent of the tax - mostly students or those on income support - who make up a tenth of the boroughs' charge payers. 'The administrative costs of recovering money from those paying at the reduced rate are out of all proportion to the sums involved,' said Mr Peter Innes, the borough treasurer.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Ramon Rojas] </F>   [Text] San Jose, 26 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- Hundreds of kilograms  of cocaine reach the United States every month in which Central  America is used as a "bridge." Most of the drug is hidden in  trailer trucks or in ships, as certain police operations in the  last few years have shown.    Costa Rican Security Minister Luis Fishman told ACAN-EFE  that, contrary to what everyone thinks, the maritime route is  not the primary transportation means for the drug going from  South America to North America, but rather the land route is.  According to the minister, the drug generally reaches Panama  from Colombia by sea. There it is loaded on to trailer trucks  with different types of merchandise on its way north until it  reaches the United States, the largest market in the world.    The strongest blows against drug trafficking activities,  however, have been dealt when the drug is being transported on  ships, in high speed boats, on its way to the United States.  The most recent blow took place last week in a joint operation  between Nicaragua and Costa Rica.    In this operation, the authorities arrested five Colombians  and a Guatemalan citizen after being alerted by the DEA. The  drug traffickers were caught by Nicaraguan authorities in Costa  Rican waters. According to media reports, the group belongs to  the Pereira Cartel in Colombia and will be returned to Costa  Rica, where they will be prosecuted for drug trafficking. In a  high speed boat, which left the Colombian port of Buenaventura,  this group was carrying 650 kg of drugs, which would supposedly  be unloaded somewhere in Guatemala from where it was to be  transported to the United States by land, according to police  sources.    In the last four years, more than 3,000 kg of cocaine have  been confiscated in Costa Rica alone, according to official  reports. Most of the drug was transported in ships on the  Pacific Ocean and were detected by radars operated by the DEA in  northern Costa Rica and Panama. Fishman noted his government's  firm commitment to fight drug trafficking activities with all  its resources, but said the police lack the means for more  effective action.    In a report released earlier this month, the U.S. State  Department praised the efforts made by the Central American  Governments, with the exception of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, in  their fight against drug trafficking and money laundering  activities.    Nicaraguan Government Minister Alfredo Mendieta said in  Costa  Rica on Monday that this joint operation, which resulted in the  arrest of six drug traffickers on Friday and the confiscation of  the drug is a demonstration of his country's willingness to  fight drug trafficking activities. "It has been proven that the  fight against drug trafficking activities is not the  responsibility of a country, but of the international community.  The success of the operation conducted by Nicaragua and Costa  Rica is proof of that," he pointed out.    According to the State Department, the scarce resources of  the Costa Rican authorities and the lack of professionalism of  the security services preclude greater progress in the fight  against drug trafficking activities in Costa Rica. It pointed  out that the port of Limon, the largest Costa Rican port, has  become the primary drug trafficking point between the Colombian  island of San Andres and the Nicaraguan Caribbean coast with the  United States.    Fishman has repeatedly talked about the need for greater  cooperation by the consumer nations for a more effective action  against drug trafficking in Central America.</p>

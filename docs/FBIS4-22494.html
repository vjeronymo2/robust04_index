			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Dmitriy Matsnev, candidate of economic sciences, </F> Institute of Economic Forecasting of the Russian Academy of  Sciences: "Sovereignty of the Russian Regions: Political Myth or  Economic Fact?"]    [Text]  <H5>  Evaluation of Economic Independence </H5>   The ominous symptoms of Russian collapse appeared about 1  year ago, in early 1993. The problem of making the Russian  regions sovereign did not arise out of nowhere; during the  radical transformations being carried on in the country an  objective trend toward weaker inter-regional links appeared.  They were caused by the general, critical worsening in  manageability of the country's economy, the drop in production,  the liberalization of foreign economic activity, the increase in  rates for transportation services, and the universal development  of "barter economy."    The economic space of Russia is formed from significantly  different regions which are distinguished by level of economic  development, sectorial specialization, and natural-climatic  conditions. At the same time these regions are strongly  dependent on one another. For one, they are closely interlinked  by deeply specialized high-tech production. For two, for a large  majority of the regions the output produced in them can only  find users in the domestic Russian market. During the prolonged  period of joint development a certain social division of labor  among regions and sectorial specialization of regions within the  framework of a single Russian economic complex took shape. This  led to the situation where a large share of the output in each  region is being produced for these partners or received from  them. In the late 1980s this proportion was at a level of  roughly 23-30 percent, that is, from a quarter to a third of the  output was produced for other regions and consumed as the result  of import it from them. A further disruption of links among  regions will inevitably intensify the drop in production, which  in turn will inevitably lead to growth in social tension.    Science has the essential tool for modeling economic  processes, which makes it possible to forecast deformation,  weakening, and even the disintegration of links among the  Russian regions and to assess the impact of changes in these  links on local economies. A cycle of these modeling calculations  for 11 consolidated Russian economic regions was made at INP RAN  [Institute of National Economic Forecasting of the Russian  Academy of Sciences]. The calculations showed that the decrease  in domestic final product of a region is directly proportional  to the degree of weakening of its external links. For each  region the coefficient of this proportionality shows the  magnitude of change in its final product (in percentage) for a  one percent change in external links, that is, it shows how  dependent the region is on its external links. If this  coefficient is zero, the region is completely independent of  external links. This means that its regional reproduction  process is capable of being carried out on an autonomous,  isolated, autarkic basis. If the coefficient of dependence of  the region's economy on external links is equal to one, the  region is completely dependent on external links and if they  were fully broken the region would not be able to carry on the  reproduction process. This fits regions with the most open  economic systems.    As a result of the modeling calculations the following  values  were obtained for the coefficients of dependence of the  economies of the Russian regions on their external links:    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Coefficients of Dependence on External Links                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ural                                  |0.49                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |West Siberian                         |0.62                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volga                                 |0.65                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Central                               |0.67                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northern                              |0.69                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Eastern                               |0.71                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |East Siberian                         |0.74                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |North Caucasian                       |0.75                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volga-Vyatka                          |0.76                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northwestern                          |0.78                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Central Chernozem                     |0.92                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      A kind of "experimental" confirmation of our theoretical  calculations is the fact that it is precisely in the most  "independent" of the Russian regions, the Urals, where the  Republic of Bashkortostan, which declared its sovereignty as  early as 1990, and the Ural and South Ural Republics, which in  July 1993 tried to emerge on the basis of Yekaterinburg and  Chelyabinsk Oblasts of the Russian Federation respectively, are  located.    The oil and gas workers and miners of the West Siberian  region, who are next after the Ural Region in level of economic  "independence," conduct themselves quite independently. The  Republic of Tatarstan, the main constituent part of the Volga  Region, acts with great confidence in dealings with Russian  federal authorities--this is the third-ranked among the Russian  regions in level of economic "independence."    So the less the economy of a region depends on external  links, the higher the level of objective preconditions for its  economic sovereignty. And vice versa.    What paths can the Russian regions take, and what awaits  them  if these preconditions become reality?  <H5>  Possible Strategies </H5>   Modeling the behavior of the Russian regions according to  the  strategies of their possible behavior produced the following  results (see Table No 1 below).

At  the same time, the weakening of links among regions makes the  strategy of regional free trade objectively possible, above all  for the Ural, West Siberian, and Volga regions. In the  transition to this strategy they even experience a certain  increase in internal final product, mainly from sale of the  output of their oil and gas industry at world prices. For all  the other regions the strategy of regional free trade appears to  be a definite lesser evil than the strategy of autarky because  the decline in their economies within the framework of one of  the strategies will be fundamentally less than in the other.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Diagram of Russian Economic Space and Regional Distribution (by percentage)|  | of All-Russian:                                                           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Region)          |Production Volume |Fixed Production  |Number of Persons |  |                  |                  |Capital           |Employed in Produ-|  |                  |                  |                  |ction             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northern          |4.2               |5.3               |4.1               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Northwestern      |5.9               |5.5               |6.2               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Central           |20.6              |15.4              |20.3              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volga-Vyatka      |5.5               |4.9               |6.2               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ural              |14.6              |15.1              |14.0              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |West Siberian     |12.1              |13.8              |10.8              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |East Siberian     |5.9               |7.7               |5.9               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Far Eastern       |5.7               |6.3               |5.2               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Central Chernozem |5.1               |5.4               |5.4               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Volga             |11.8              |12.6              |11.9              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |North Caucasus    |8.6               |8.0               |10.1              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      But not all of these regions will be able to carry out the  strategy of regional free trade in reality. This is tied, first  of all, to the correspondence between output exported from the  Russian regions and the requirements of the world market, that  is, with its competitiveness under world price conditions. For  the Northern Region, where export of output from the timber  industry and ferrous metallurgy predominates, and for the Far  Eastern and East Siberian regions (export of output from timber  industry and nonferrous metallurgy) these requirements and  conditions are feasible in principle. Consideration must also be  given to the traditional export orientations of the sectors  themselves in these regions. The machine building output that  dominates in the export of the Central, Volga-Vyatka, and  Northwestern regions will hardly be able to become competitive  under world market conditions in the near future. This also  applies to the machine building, light, and food industry of the  North Caucasian and Central Chernozem Regions. Therefore, five  regions (Central, North Caucasian, Volga-Vyatka, Northwestern,  and Central Chernozem) will lose the possibility of supplying  themselves on an equivalent basis with energy media,  construction materials (or raw materials to process them), and  output from timber and wood processing industry from the other  six Russian regions which, within a strategy of free trade,  would be oriented primarily to the world market. For this reason  the five old industrial regions of Russia will be doomed,  against their will, to a strategy of regional autarky. As a  result, within the unified Russian national economic complex two  alternative strategies of behavior will begin to be realized by  its constituent parts, which is shown in Table 1 by means of  arrows pointing in the appropriate direction. This will  inevitably lead to further weakening of links among the Russian  regions.  <H5>  Evaluation of the Consequences </H5>   The consequences of realizing both strategies for the  Russian  regions will be extremely negative. The disastrous decline in  production has already been discussed. However, the strategy of  regional free trade will also be accompanied by extremely  negative consequences for a number of regions. As the result of  its implementation, agriculture and light and food industry,  unable to withstand competition with the corresponding products  in the world market, will cease to exist in the Ural and West  Siberian regions. In the West Siberian region they will lose, in  addition to these, the ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy,  machine building, timber, wood processing, and building  materials industries. In the Volga region light and food  industry will be forced out of existence.    The table shows how this factor has caused a sharp decrease  in the volume of aggregate product in these three regions.  Because of the deep decrease in the level of integration in  economic development in these three regions the coefficient of  dependence of their economies on external links is rising  sharply and will be equal to one, that is, they will become  economic systems that are absolutely dependent on world economic  links. This will mean a complete loss of their economic  sovereignty because they will become resource appendages of the  world market. At the same time, owing to the significant  decrease in production volumes because of the elimination of  whole groups of sectors in the West Siberian, Ural, and Volga  regions, an equally significant rise in unemployment is  inevitable--from 27 to roughly 60 percent of the total number of  persons employed in material production there. This will  inexorably lead to such an intensification of social tension in  these regions that the slight economic advantage from  realization of the strategy of regional free trade will be far  outweighed by the social costs, above all the loss of social  stability.    The consequences of a transition to the strategy of free  trade will be entirely different for the Northern, East  Siberian, and Far Eastern regions. In the first two regions the  decline in material production will not exceed two percent. The  Far Eastern region is somewhat of an exception; the decline in  production there will be at the level of 11 percent (mainly  because of a decrease in production volume in the food industry,  construction, and agriculture). By contemporary measures such a  decline is not disastrous, so one need not fear a tangible  increase in unemployment in these three regions as a result of  their transition to the regional free trade strategy.  Realization of this strategy also will not have a significant  impact on the level of these regions' economic dependence on  external links. For all three regions this coefficient will  decrease slightly: from 0.69 to 0.66 for the Northern Region,  from 0.71 to 0.61 for the Far Eastern Region, and from 0.74 to  0.72 for the East Siberian Region.    At the same time realization of the strategy of regional  free  trade will make it possible, using the opportunities of the  world market, to sharply improve supply of food and light  industry products to the population of these three regions and  supply of fuel, metal, chemicals, and machinery and equipment to  their production sectors. The situation with consumer goods will  be especially critical. The proportion of import in consumption  of light industry products in the Far Eastern and Northern  regions exceeds 65 percent. The proportion of import in  consumption of food industry output in the East Siberian Region  is roughly 37 percent. These regions significantly exceed all  other Russian regions for these indicators; in other words, they  are too dependent on deliveries of food and light industry  products (mainly from the Russian Central Zone and South). But  forecasts made by the INP RAN of the development of these  sectors show that light industry production for Russia as a  whole will decrease by one-half in 1995 compared to 1990, while  food industry production will decrease by more than one-third.  Under these conditions it is hard to talk about normal supply of  essential products to inhabitants of the Northern Region, who  mostly live in extreme natural conditions.    It is even harder to solve the problem of supplying light  and  food industry output to inhabitants of the East Siberian and Far  Eastern regions. The great remoteness of these regions, given  liberalization of prices for energy media and the corresponding  sharp increase in transportation charges, will inevitably create  an economic barrier that hinders the economic links of the Far  Eastern and East Siberian regions with the rest of Russia.  Therefore one need have no doubt that realization by the Far  Eastern, East Siberian, and Northern regions of an "open door"  policy with the world community within the framework of the  strategy of regional free trade will get the necessary support  from a large majority of their populations.    Social stability in these regions may be a promising  guarantee that they will receive essential investment from the  world market. This will make it possible to solve one more of  the most critical problems of the Far Eastern, East Siberian,  and Northern regions. Their sectorial specialization is oriented  to the extraction and primary processing of natural resources  under harsh natural-climatic conditions. Throughout the world  this kind of production has extremely high capital-output ratio  and capital investment intensity. According to INP RAN  forecasts, however, by 1995 the volume of capital investment in  the Russian economy may decrease by more than one-half compared  to 1990. This will inevitably force the Far Eastern, East  Siberian, and Northern regions, before anyone else, to start  looking for the vitally necessary investment in the world  market, and this investment will be offered only on condition of  a transition to the strategy of regional free trade.    The analysis permits us to conclude that the objective  preconditions for economic sovereignty are minimal for five  Russian regions in the Central Zone and South of European  Russia--the Northwestern, Central, Volga-Vyatka, Central  Chernozem, and North Caucasian regions. These regions have the  greatest interest in preserving the integrity of the Russian  economic space, because otherwise they are doomed to the  strategy of regional autarky with its disastrous economic and  social consequences.    The Ural, West Siberian, and Volga regions, who receive some  economic benefit from possible realization of the strategy of  regional free trade, have the objective preconditions for  economic, and therefore also political, sovereignty. But  vigorous implementation of a policy of achieving sovereignty  will have negative social consequences in these regions. These  regions will therefore be characterized by a "smoldering  sovereignty" that is ready to flare up in "bright flames" every  time there is a general deterioration of the socioeconomic  situation in the country, because against this background the  costs of the policy of achieving sovereignty will not be so  notable, while the economic benefit will be particularly  tangible.    Given preservation of the current situation in Russia,  realization of the strategy of regional free trade, that is  following a policy of economic sovereignty as a minimum, will,  in our opinion, be the only possible way for the Northern, East  Siberian, and especially the Far Eastern regions to survive.  They have all the essential preconditions--economic, social, and  geographic--to implement this strategy. This means that it will  not be held up by political considerations.  <H5>  The Path to Concord and Unity </H5>   How can the disintegration of Russia be avoided? In looking  for a way out of the situation that has developed we should  consider first the real, historically established  characteristics of the Russian economy.    The objective economic foundation of the equality of the  different regions within Russia is interdependence and mutual  complementarity in the framework of a unified reproduction  process that is weakly linked with the world market. It  presupposes equality of political and economic rights,  conditions, and accountability of the different Russian regions  within the framework of a single country. But the market to  which the reforms being carried out in Russia is oriented never  does anything but intensify the territorial differentiation of  economic, and accordingly also political, space; in principle it  cannot ensure political and economic "equality among subjects  who are different." Therefore the political equality of subjects  of the Federation which is proclaimed in the new Russian  Constitution, not reinforced by economic equality among the  regions, will in fact be illusory, and therefore federalism in  Russia will be unstable and ineffective.    To overcome the contradiction between good political  intentions and objective economic reality we must forego the  orthodox principles of market fundamentalism, base ourselves on  an understanding of the actual characteristics of Russian  economic space, and prevent the transformation of the profound,  historically established differences among the Russian regions  into insoluble political conflicts among the corresponding  subjects of the Russian Federation. While creating the necessary  conditions for democratization of the political and economic  life of Russia its economic system must differ in that the state  should play a fundamentally greater economic role. In the  specific situation of contemporary Russian reality this can be  realized under the conception of inter-regional  institutionalism. It presumes that state regulation of Russia's  economic space in the interests of all Russian society is not  limited to just budget-finance and credit aspects, but actively  employs the methods of planned regulation. It is used to  implement equal strategic roles for economically different but  politically equal, in decision-making under the Constitution,  subjects of the Federation in shaping, jointly with federal  organs of state power, a unified system of basic socioeconomic  goals of agreed-upon development of Russia's unified economic  space in the interests of all its regions and establishing  national economic, intersectorial, and inter-regional  proportions in the Russian economy appropriate to these goals.  Within the framework of this federal strategy the state  institutions of the subjects of the Federation must work jointly  to perform the coordinating function of ensuring purposeful  agreement on direct contract links between suppliers and  consumers of output in the different regions. The appearance of  independently cooperating subjects of the Federation who are  managing collectively in the Russian economic space, and bear  mutual accountability for the results of their economic  activity, and their coordinated joint activity toward planned  regulation of the Russian economy make it possible to ensure  equal rights, equal conditions, and equal accountability to  enterprises located in significantly different Russian regions.  In this way federal-regional planned regulation in the interests  of the entire society is a means of realizing the principle of  "equality among equals" not only in relation to the regions, but  also in relation to all Russian enterprises.    With the functioning of such a system of economic activity  the heterogeneity of the Russian economic space and the  interdependence and mutual complementarity of its regions become  crucial, objective preconditions for the integrity of Russia and  create conditions for the political equality of the economically  different subjects of the Federation. The country's political  system, built on the foundation of such an economic system, will  ensure a stable state arrangement for the new Russia and  guarantee the unity of its economic space.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / New fizz on the box It's not the real thing. But J. Sainsbury has decided the television advertisement for its new cola will go better with a few American icons thrown in. Unabashed by complaints last month from a certain well-known world market leader, which forced Sainsbury to change the design on the outside of the can, the food retailer is to run an advert which rummages through American cultural baggage in search of increased sales. A bemused employee watches an American basketball player in a limousine as it pulls up outside a Sainsbury's superstore, whose car park is full of American cars. The slogan promises that Classic Cola - made from concentrate supplied by Cott, the Canadian soft-drinks manufacturer - delivers a 'classic American taste at a Sainsbury's price'. The commercial shows Classic Cola's new packaging, although cans with this design will not go on sale until late July. Sainsbury altered the typography of the design - white italic lettering on a red background - after Coca-Cola complained that its resemblance to Coca-Cola's cans might confuse customers. Mr Ivor Hunt, Sainsbury's marketing director, denied that the advertisement was a response to heavy advertising by Coca-Cola, and said the advert - to coincide with the time of year when soft drink sales are highest - had been budgeted for since Classic Cola was launched. 'It is a logical and necessary stage in the post-launch development of the brand,' he said. 'It is much better to get the product in (the stores) and make sure the logistics are in place before starting the advertising.' The Classic Cola advert was developed by the creative consultancy Fourhead. Sainsbury's usual agency, Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, faced a potential conflict of interest with another client - Pepsi.</p>

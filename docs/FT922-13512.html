			<p>920411 FT  11 APR 92 / Bargain hunters send Tokyo stocks soaring JAPANESE stocks rebounded yesterday as investors sought bargains following the market's recent sharp fall. The Nikkei index of leading shares rose 1,252.51 points to 17,850.66, its fifth-largest single-day jump. Prices were buoyed by the easing of US interest rates, strong rises in American stocks and bonds and, above all, by a sense that the recent sell-off had gone too far. Shares opened at their low and rose continuously through the day to close at their high. Yet, stockbrokers said many investors remained nervous and uncertain about how long the rally would last. Mr Shigeru Akiba, of UBS Phillips and Drew, the Swiss-owned broker, said: 'Of course investors can take some comfort from the size of the rebound, but this sort of volatility is not the sign of a healthy market.' The authorities welcomed yesterday's rebound: Mr Hiroshi Yasuda, the vice-minister at the finance minister, said stocks were now at a reasonable level for buying. A sharp reminder of the continuing problems in the financial community came with news of the Hachidai Corporation, a property developer, being declared insolvent with debts of Y114bn (Pounds 490m). A central reason for the market's recent gloom has been concern about the burden of bad debts on banks from speculative investments in stocks and property. Yesterday bank shares, which had fallen by over 30 per cent since the beginning of the month, recovered sharply with some stocks rising by the maximum permitted daily limit. Securities industry executives have repeatedly urged the government to support the market by measures to encourage securities buying and by steps to boost the economy. Last week's cut in the Official Discount Rate, the Bank of Japan's key lending rate, and plans to bring forward public works spending proved insufficient to restore investors' confidence. Yesterday, sentiment was buoyed by reports that leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party were considering proposals to cut taxes and boost public spending in the financial year which started this month by means of a supplementary budget. Discussions on a possible supplementary budget will now begin in earnest following the passage of the basic budget bill through the Diet on Thursday. Politicians are also examining plans to allow public sector pension funds to invest a bigger proportion of their money in securities. However, officials of the ministry of finance have so far opposed moves which might appear like artificial efforts to prop up shares.</p>

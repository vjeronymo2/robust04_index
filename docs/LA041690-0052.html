			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> CELTICS, MAKING A MOVE, GET PAST KNICKS, 101-94  </P> <P> Larry Bird may be, as Magic Johnson claims, all the way back, but there is a  new look to the Boston Celtics in their bid to return to elite status in the  NBA.  </P> <P> Until he missed last season because of surgery on both Achilles' tendon, for a  decade, Bird was the player the Celtics went to in the clutch.  </P> <P> When the Celtics rallied to beat the New York Knicks, 101-94, Sunday at Boston  for their sixth consecutive victory, it was Reggie Lewis they turned to in the  clutch.  </P> <P> Bird's shooting was horrendous, so it was up to the sharpshooting third-year  guard if the Celtics were to keep their slim hopes of winning the Atlantic  Division alive.  </P> <P> The Celtics, after building a 13-point lead early in the third quarter, allowed  the Knicks to fight back and take a six-point lead. The Knicks were still in  front, 88-87, with 4 1/2 minutes to play. That's when, with Bird five for 22  from the field, the Celtics turned to Lewis.  </P> <P> In the next 3 1/2 minutes, Lewis scored eight of the points in a 10-5 run that  handed the Knicks their 24th consecutive defeat in Boston.  </P> <P> Except for his shooting, Bird was outstanding. He had 17 rebounds and 13  assists. He blocked a shot by Patrick Ewing, stole a pass and grabbed a key  rebound in the last 90 seconds.  </P> <P> "We forced them to go to the man we wanted to shoot," Knicks' Coach Stu Jackson  said. "He just didn't miss in the clutch."  </P> <P> Lewis made 12 of 18 shots and finished with 34 points.  </P> <P> The Celtics, who are 1 1/2 games behind the Philadelphia 76ers, can win the  division by winning their last four games. They play home-and-home with  Chicago, Orlando and at Philadelphia. The 76ers play Indiana and at Detroit  before closing out with Boston.  </P> <P> Johnson said he watched his friend Bird on satellite TV and learned that Bird  is back to his best form.  </P> <P> Utah 103, Minnesota 90 -- Karl Malone kept his cool at Minneapolis and the Jazz  increased their lead in the Midwest Division to two games over San Antonio.  </P> <P> Malone, thrown out in the first half of Saturday night's loss to Houston at  Salt Lake, had 32 points to pass the 10,000-point mark in his four-year career.  He also had 12 rebounds.  </P> <P> A crowd of 40,415 enabled the expansion Timberwolves to draw a million fans.  They need 43,485 at the Metrodome in their finale to break the record of  1,066,505 set by Detroit in 1987-88. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

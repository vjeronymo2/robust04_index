			<p>921124 FT  24 NOV 92 / International Company News: Extra aid for Norwegian banks NORWAY yesterday unveiled a NKr5bn (Dollars 775.2m) rescue plan for its three biggest banks - Den norske, Christiania, and Fokus - and warned this would be the last time they would receive state support. The latest rescue package increases to NKr20bn the amount transferred to the three banks in the past 12 months. In addition, the banks' own insurance fund has pumped NKr7.4bn into the sector, of which NKr7.2bn has been written off as losses. Last year, Christiania and Fokus bank saw their share capital wiped out and were acquired by the state. Den norske, Christiania, and Fokus face far-reaching measures to reduce costs by 15 per cent in order to comply with terms and conditions of the rescue plan. In the nine months ended September, the three banks suffered combined net losses of NKr3.7bn. The NKr5bn aid package is made up of NKr4bn in 'paid-in' core capital and NKr800m in state guarantees of which NKr260m is in cash. The ordinary capital of Den norske, the biggest bank, has been wiped out by losses, and its ordinary shares are to be written down to zero. Den norske's three biggest shareholders at end-October included the county employees' pension fund with a 12 per cent stake, Vital Forsikring, the big insurance group, with 8.9 per cent, and the national pension fund with 7.2 per cent. Den norske is to receive NKr1.5bn in preference capital and a guarantee of NKr600m. This means the state's shareholding in the bank will rise to 70 per cent from 55 per cent. The bank said operations would be streamlined further in 1993 and assets reduced by NKr7bn to NKr155bn. Costs would be reduced by 7 per cent, both in 1993 and in 1994. Christiania Bank, the second biggest bank, will be supplied with core capital of NKr1.9bn of which NKr1bn will be in the form of new share capital after the current share capital is written down against uncovered nine-month losses. The remaining NKr900m will be in the form of a subordinated loan.</p>

			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: ADT to sue over stake taken in Lep ADT, the security group which has written off Pounds 65m on its 27 per cent stake in Lep Group, is suing Lep and four of its present and former directors, writes Jane Fuller. The court action is being pursued in the US by an ADT subsidiary called Itoba. It has complained that ADT relied on misleading public statements when it bought shares in Lep in 1990. Last year Lep, the freight forwarding and security concern, incurred a loss of Pounds 235.1m after Pounds 219.4m of exceptional and extraordinary charges. The biggest write-off was the entire US property portfolio, previously valued at Pounds 93.4m. The group slid to more than Pounds 500m of net debt and Pounds 109m of negative shareholders' funds. With company doctor Mr David James installed as chairman, a rescue package has been negotiated entailing about 25 banks swapping Pounds 180m of debt for 85 per cent of the restructured company.</p>

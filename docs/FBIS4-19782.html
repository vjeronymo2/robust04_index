			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara, April 20 (AA) -- The Foreign Ministry on  Wednesday [20 April] said that relations between Turkey and  Germany have very strong foundations, adding neither country  should allow third countries or circles to hurt them.    Speaking at his weekly briefing on Wednesday, he said that  German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has personally confirmed  the fact that German tanks were not used by Turkey in its  operations carried out against terrorists.    He said that from time to time misunderstandings can emerge  between two countries, which in turn lead to certain  difficulties.    "What matters is that both countries should be determined to  overcome them," Ataman said. "Both countries have the necessary  political will for this. Turkey hopes the strengthening of  existing mutual trust will help to overcome these  misunderstandings."</p>

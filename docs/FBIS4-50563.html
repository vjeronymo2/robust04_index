			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 12 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Minister of  Defense Chi Haotian met with Zbigniew Zalewski, deputy chief of  General Staff and chief of logistics of the Polish Army today,  expressing the hope for enhancing contacts between the two  armies.    The armies of the two countries had had the same experience  in fighting against fascists and aggression in the past and  under the new situation, they also share common issues of  economic development and army building in their respective  countries, he said.    Some experience of Poland's army building is also worth  learning, said Chi, who visited Poland in 1992 as chief of the  General Staff of the Army.    Zalewski said he was deeply impressed by the marked progress  scored by the Chinese Army in its army building. He also shared  the view of Minister Chi that there exists a great potential for  further cooperation between the two armies.

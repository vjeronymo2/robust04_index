Stating this here today after his return from a two-week  visit to four African countries--South Africa, Mozambique,  Zimbabwe and Botswana--Minister of State for External Affairs  Salman Khursheed said such a grouping has great scope for  collaborating with ASEAN and Australia. He said the African  National Congress in South Africa has shown interest in the  idea, which was mooted by South African Foreign Minister R.F.  Botha during his visit to India last year.    Mr Khursheed, who was in South Africa from January 12-14,  said South African businessmen have shown interest in investing  in the tourism sector.    This was the second visit by the Minister in the last six  months to South Africa which, after emerging from the apartheid  era, is expected to hold multi-party elections in three months.</p>

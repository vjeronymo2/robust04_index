			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (19): A fine gloss on the world's best china - Industry MINTON: THE FIRST TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF DESIGN &amp; PRODUCTION By Joan Jones Swan Hill Press Pounds 70 391 pages ON APRIL 30 1851 Queen Victoria enjoyed a preview of the Great Exhibition in London's Hyde Park. She noted in her diary: 'We walked the whole round of the galleries. We saw beautiful china from Minton's factory and beautiful designs.' The Queen also maintained her well-established patronage of her favoured Staffordshire pottery by purchasing an extravagant Minton dessert service. In many ways the Great Exhibition represented the coming of age of Herbert Minton's company. His spectacular display was widely acclaimed for the quality and diversity of his products and the new ranges, parian porcelain figures and colourful majolica glazed earthenwares for example, provoked excited comment. International fame, business success and a clutch of medals were the fitting rewards for a manufacturer who had been deeply involved in the planning of this great event. Minton's enthusiasm for the venture was underlined by his sponsoring it to the tune of Pounds 10,000, a risky investment that, in the event, paid off handsomely. Herbert Minton, that prime example of the Victorian enlightened entrepreneur, died in 1858 but the company founded by his father Thomas in 1793 lived on, and is now celebrating its bicentenary. The event has been marked by the publication of Joan Jones' history of this remarkable company, a book that makes it seem extraordinary that this great pottery should be, in relative terms, so little known. Minton has been poorly served by history. This is only the third major book written about the factory while Wedgwood has inspired over 50. Yet, in its day, Minton was by far the better company whose products, more exciting and more diverse, were respected worldwide. This book is a rich survey of what Mrs Jones, curator of the Minton Museum, optimistically calls Minton's 'first two hundred years' but the emphasis is clearly on the Victorian period and this fills the bulk of the book. The early Thomas Minton years of fine tableware production, in spite of their obvious appeal to collectors, merely set the scene for the dramatic expansion that followed, first with Herbert Minton and then in the hands of his nephew, Colin Minton Campbell. These two showed how inspired leadership, the pursuit of individuality and the willingness to take risks, backed by adventurous design, were the perfect way to guide a business and keep its products at the forefront of the international marketplace for over 60 years. Even after they had gone, the impetus they had built up kept Minton at the top of the pile for some time before the inevitable decline set in, a slow downward spiral that led to Minton becoming a part of the Royal Doulton Group in 1968. It has to be said that, from the evidence of this book, Minton's second century, to 1993, does not look nearly as good as its first, and it takes up only a fraction of the pages. Whether anyone will find anything interesting to say in 2093 remains to be seen, but the signs are not all that promising What makes this book unique is the quality, and quantity of its colour plates, and these are a constant seduction away from Mrs Jones' excellent text. However, the point made again and again by both text and plates is the power of design as a marketing tool. Minton's strength in the past, and its commercial success, was due to a series of remarkable marriages between art and industry. Some brides were well known, the sculptors John Bell and Baron Marochetti for example, or key figures such as AWN Pugin and Dr Christopher Dresser, along with Minton's French imports, notably Leon Arnoux, their part director throughout their most dynamic period. Others are little known today, unjustly buried in the backyards of ceramic history. The prime example is John Wadsworth, an inspired designer whose distinctive style spans the Art Nouveau, Art Deco and post-war periods, a man whose rightful place is with the great names of 20th century design. Wadsworth also seems to have been the last outpouring from that extraordinary well of creativity that made Minton what it was in the Victorian period. What remains is, sadly, a glorious past of originality and dynamic leadership submerged in modern concepts of brand name management.</p>

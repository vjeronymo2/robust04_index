			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / US new home sales down 13.8% US SALES of new homes plunged 13.8 per cent between December and January, but the figures may have been distorted by bad weather, Commerce Department figures indicated yesterday. The official index of leading indicators - a guide to future economic developments - stagnated in January, a setback after big increases in preceding months. Analysts said the reports confirmed other recent data suggesting the pace of economic growth had slowed from an annual rate of nearly 5 per cent in the final quarter of last year to an annual rate of perhaps 3 per cent. Some forecasters, however, are growing more bearish. Mr Allen Sinai, chief economist at The Boston Group, an economic consultancy, said economic growth might dip to an annual rate of only 1-2 per cent in the current quarter, raising doubts about whether or not the upturn can be sustained. The drop in new home sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 561,000 in January was the steepest in 11 years and left sales at their lowest level in eight months. Sales figures were 17 per cent lower than in January last year, a strong month for the housing market. However, most of the decline occurred in the north-east and west, regions affected by bad weather conditions. Sales in the south were unchanged and sales in the Midwest dipped only modestly. Sharp falls in mortgage rates and a recent decline in the 'affordability index' - the ratio of house prices to incomes - are widely expected to underpin the market this year. Mr Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street brokerage, predicted 'very robust growth in the home-building sector' later this year. The index of leading indicators rose 0.1 per cent in January after robust increases of 0.7 per cent and 1.7 per cent in November and December. Components of the leading index moved in opposite directions, with five indicators signalling expansion and six contraction. The positive indicators included a rise in unfilled orders for manufactured goods, higher prices for sensitive materials and a longer average working week.</p>

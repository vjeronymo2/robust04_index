			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The third growth of leaves on the vandalized Treaty Oak in Austin, Tex., is  turning "brown and crunchy," but a city forester said he remains hopeful the  landmark tree will refoliate -- at least partially -- next spring. But forester  John Giedraitis said even if the 500-year-old tree survives, it will not be the  same sprawling live oak that admirers remember before it was intentionally  poisoned with the powerful herbicide Velpar. City workers have removed all the  poisoned soil and are continuing to mist the tree with cooling spring water and  protect it with giant sun shades to lessen stress as temperatures climb into  the high 90s each day. Paul Stedman Cullen, 45, of Elroy has been charged with  felony criminal mischief in the poisoning of the tree.  </P></p>

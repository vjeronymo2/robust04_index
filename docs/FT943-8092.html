			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Impartiality of Whitewater counsel thrown into doubt Controversy over the naming of Mr Kenneth Starr as new Whitewater special counsel in succession to Mr Robert Fiske has grown this week, with Democrats, legal experts and the media questioning both his impartiality and the circumstances of his appointment by a special judicial panel. The New York Times went so far as to call on him to step down. The newspaper, a harsh critic of alleged ethical violations by the Clinton administration, said the appointment 'looks terrible under the law and the ethical precepts the judges say they recognise'. Earlier, Senator George Mitchell, the majority leader, had also come close to suggesting withdrawal. 'If the standard is the appearance of independence . . . then it seems to me there is a greater appearance of the absence of independence in his case than there was in Mr Fiske's case.' Criticism of the appointment of Mr Starr, the solicitor general under President George Bush who last year considered running for the US Senate as a Republican from Virginia, falls into two parts. The first centres on the relationship between Judge David Sentelle, chief of the special judicial panel which named Mr Starr, and the two arch-conservative senators from North Carolina, Mr Jesse Helms and Mr Lauch Faircloth. Mr Sentelle, appointed by President Ronald Reagan, is a protege of Senator Helms. Mr Sentelle was a member of the federal appeals court which overturned the Iran-Contra conviction of Mr Oliver North, now the Republican candidate for the Virginia Senate seat. Last month, shortly before the Starr appointment, Mr Sentelle was noticed lunching with Mr Faircloth and they were later joined by Mr Helms. All three deny discussing Whitewater but the meeting brought down criticism from legal scholars, who described it variously as 'wildly imprudent' and 'probably unethical'. The second reservation stems from the fact that Mr Starr, at the request of a conservative women's group, considered filing a 'friend of the court' brief in support of Ms Paula Jones, who has filed a civil suit seeking damages from President Clinton for alleged sexual harassment. Even though the brief was never filed, the Times wrote that his original decision further blemished the appearance of his impartiality.</p>

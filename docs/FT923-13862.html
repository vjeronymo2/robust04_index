			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Abbey to sell 39m shares unclaimed since float ABBEY NATIONAL, the bank, is to sell off more than 39m shares left unclaimed from its 1989 flotation and will give part of the proceeds to charity. Mr John Fry, group services director, said the shares would be sold during 1993 but no decision had been taken about the timing or whether they would be put on the market in a single allocation. 'We will not drip-feed them on to the market,' he added. The shares, about 3 per cent of the total outstanding, have been held by Abbey National since 1989 while it tried to find their owners. Analysts yesterday welcomed the move, saying they expected it to add about 0.5p to Abbey National's earnings per share, expected by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew to be around 30.7p this year. Abbey National is to write for a seventh and final time to the 390,000 customers who should have received the shares out of 5.5m eligible people, telling them that they could still claim them. Mr Fry said Abbey National did not know why so many of its customers had not taken up their offer of 100 free shares, worth Pounds 130 at the time of the float and around Pounds 273 today. It will publish notices in six national newspapers on July 20. Customers who believe they are entitled will have to complete forms demonstrating their eligibility. Abbey National will place between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the cash it receives from the shares in Abbey National Charitable Trust which administers its charitable donations.</p>

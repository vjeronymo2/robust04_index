			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Bifu opts against strike at Lloyds FINANCE UNION Bifu today decided against launching industrial action over a pay freeze and proposals for performance-related pay by Lloyds Bank. Bifu members in Lloyds voted narrowly in favour of a series of one-day strikes in a ballot that ran through August. But the turnout was so low that union officials felt unable to authorise industrial action. Mr Rob O'Neill, assistant secretary, said: 'The message to the bank is clear. Many staff are not happy with the bank's proposals, but are not prepared to take industrial action. Rather than vote no in the ballot and give the bank the impression that they are happy, they have stayed away. He added: 'We are very disappointed. Lloyds are the most profitable high street bank, yet they have imposed a pay freeze on staff. 'There is widespread concern in Lloyds over pay and that will not go away. We're not ruling out another ballot in the future once Lloyds' plans on pay become clearer.' As well as a pay freeze this year, Lloyds says it wants to scrap across-the-board increases and link future pay to staff performance. A separate Bifu dispute over shift working at Lloyds London computer centre continues.</p>

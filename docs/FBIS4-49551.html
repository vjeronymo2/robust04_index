			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By special reporter Ting Yu (3060 7183)] </F>   [Text] A recent sample survey in Qingdao showed that  although 86 percent of the respondents were full of confidence  in the prospects of China's reform and opening up, the support  of the general public for some policies which are in force or  will be adopted declined. In the survey items reflecting the  current conditions of social life, the decline in people's  satisfaction mainly concentrated in the fields representing the  costs of economic development and in the fields covered by the  reform measures to be adopted. This was regarded as a warning  about rising discontent in society. Over 70 percent of the  respondents supported greater the political structural reform.    The results of the survey, which was conducted by the public  opinion research institute of the Chinese People's University,  were made public yesterday. The opinion survey was mainly  carried out among 1,200 residents of Qingdao at and above 14  years of age. It was said that the degree of accuracy for the  survey was 95 percent, and the margin of error was under 3  percent.    The survey showed that as reforms were more intensively  carried out and the inflation pressure remained high, the living  conditions of the general public continued to improve in 1993.  Of all respondents, 71.9 percent expressed satisfaction at the  current social and political situation; 70.9 percent and 67.8  percent expressed satisfaction at the economic situation and the  conditions of cultural life. However, people were deeply  dissatisfied with public conduct, interpersonal relationships,  and the relationship between cadres and ordinary people.  Respondents showing discontent in these areas accounted for 44  percent, 45.1 percent, and 45.8 percent respectively. The rates  marked a new high in the relevant opinion polls in recent years.  Many people were also discontented with price levels and  product quality.    The survey showed that, because some policies being adopted  recently were not well-coordinated, people's concern became  deeper and people showed stronger reliance on the state and  their work units. People generally hoped that they would get  help in the aspects of retirement insurance, medical insurance,  and housing. Although people still generally agreed that the  policies that had been adopted and would soon be adopted were  "basically feasible" as a whole, the degree of support obviously  declined. In particular, the degree of support for the price  policy declined by the biggest margin: People regarding it as  feasible accounted for only 13.8 percent; those regarding it as  basically feasible accounted for 43 percent; those regarding it  as not quite feasible accounted for 16.9 percent; those  regarding it as infeasible accounted for 10.7 percent; and those  saying unknown to this question accounted for 15.7 percent. The  support index declined by 0.45. The support indices of the  housing reform policy and the public-funded medical service  policy decreased separately by 0.23 and 0.21. The labor and  employment policy and the retirement welfare system that have  not been reformed fully recorded the smallest margins of decline  of the support indices.    Most people hoped that vulgar competition and corruption  arising in the process of developing the market economy would be  brought under control. Sixty-five percent of respondents said  that they were not happy although their living standards were  enhanced these years. Eighty percent of respondents expressed  concern over the mainland society's future development. People  expressing concern over continuing price hikes accounted for  78.6 percent; those expressing worry about an out-of-control  economic situation accounted for 64.6 percent; people expressing  worry about worsening corruption accounted for 63 percent; and  people expressing certain concern and deep concern over  aggravated polarization between the rich and the poor accounted  for 62.5 percent. On the other hand, 73.5 percent of the  respondents expressed support for pushing the political  structural reform forward at an opportune moment.    Among the indices of people's satisfaction in various  aspects  of social life, those related to entertainment and market supply  slightly increased as compared with the same period of last  year, but those related to local transportation, environmental  protection, working conditions, public sanitation and health  care, and housing conditions all declined somewhat. Statistics  also showed that older people and poorly educated people were  comparatively more satisfied with the current conditions. The  index of satisfaction in the group of illiterate or  semi-illiterate people was 0.49, but that in the group of people  having received tertiary education was -0.3. The assessment  made by soldiers, retired personnel, workers, and self- employed  laborers was higher the overall assessment level, but that by  college students, government functionaries, and professionals  engaged in scientific research, education, and medical services  was lower than the overall level.</p>

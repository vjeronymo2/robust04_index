			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / People: Compass swings towards Europe In an unusual move, health care and catering company Compass Group has hired a non-executive director, Austrian-born Fritz Ternofsky (right), as a full-time board member. Chief executive Francis Mackay, who quips that the typical non-executive is there 'to create maximum embarrassment with the least amount of effort', agrees that it is usually difficult to judge the true ability of a part-time director. However, he had been impressed by Ternofsky's knowledge of branded retail catering, and by his input into Compass's strategy review over the past eighteen months. 'It also helps in terms of perception - we instantly become a more European company.' Last month, Compass acquired the airport restaurant and contract catering business of SAS Service Partner, and Ternofsky will be responsible for developing that operation. His native tongue will also come in handy in Germany where Compass is interested in building on the two hospital contracts that came as part of the SAS deal, as well as searching out other suitable acquisitions in contract, airport, and station catering. Ternofsky, 49, has worked in Britain since 1964. In his last job he worked for Canadian company Scott's Hospitality as managing director and chief executive officer of its European business, which included UK Marriott Hotels and Perfect Pizza outlets.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 8 (TANJUG) -- Croatia will intensify  its activities and initiate "a diplomatic offensive" in an  effort to re-integrate the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)  into Croatia, TANJUG learned on Tuesday from well-informed  Croatian sources.    The R.S.K. is now one of the U.N. Protected Areas (UNPA) in  Croatia.    Croatia will focus its activities on negotiations with the  R.S.K. local and military authorities about the return of Croats  who have fled these lands. The negotiations will be brokered by  the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR).    The same sources maintain that Serb representatives will be  offered a possibility of re-integrating the R.S.K. territories  into Croatian districts, as well as cultural and administrative  autonomy in the lands where they constituted a majority  population according to the 1991 census, and the right to take  part in district assemblies.    The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 in predominantly  Serb-populated parts of the former Yugoslav Republic of Croatia  in response to Croatia's forcible secession from former  Yugoslavia and its attempt to reduce the Serbs' status as a  constituent nation to that of a national minority.    The R.S.K. has been the UNPA since 1992, but Croatia has  launched three large offensives against Krajina's territories  since then, while uninterrupted Croatian Army attacks on Serb  positions along the demarcation lines ceased after a ceasefire  had been signed last December.    However, all efforts to reach a lasting agreement on a  cessation of hostilities have been unsuccessful so far.    The sources estimate that the main purpose of Monday's visit  of Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic to the Senj-Lika  District, bordering on the R.S.K. in western Croatia, was a  preparation of a new "diplomatic offensive" against the R.S.K.    Jure Radic, head of the presidential office and  secretary-general of Croatia's ruling party the Croatian  Democratic Union, confirmed on Saturday in Osijek that Croatia  intended to initiate "a diplomatic offensive" backed by "a  variety of political skills." The Osijek District borders on the  R.S.K in eastern Croatia.    The sources estimate that Croatia's officials will primarily  undertake these activities to "collect evidence" that it is  necessary for the United Nations to prolong its mandate in the  R.S.K., i.e. to convince the international community that the  re-integration of the R.S.K. into Croatia is impossible unless  pressure is put on Krajina.    The current UNPROFOR mandate in the R.S.K. is due to expire  on March 31, and it is to be renewed by the U.N. Security  Council if approved by the countries that signed the Cyrus Vance  plan on the introduction of U.N. Protected Areas to Krajina.    At the same time, the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry said it had  rejected the proposal by UNPROFOR Commander in the UNPA "South"  Sector, George Oehring, to negotiate with representatives of the  Serb National Party whose leader is Milan Djukic.    The Serb National Party is one of the opposition parties in  Croatia which has been instructed by the Croatian regime to  gather all Serbs who have chosen to remain in Croatia. The  party has proclaimed itself to be a protector of their minority  rights.    A statement released by the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry says the  R.S.K. considered this proposal by the Serb National Party as  "one which lacks seriousness," while the document "peace with no  alternatives" by this party, proposed late last year as a  negotiating basis, was described as "a set of forgeries."    According to the R.S.K. Foreign Ministry, the document  "contains untenable information that, instead of 400,000 Serbs,  only 180,000 Serbs have been expelled from Croatia, and that,  instead of 500,000 Serbs, only 180,000 are living there at this  time."    The document advocates a kind of "confederal" autonomy of  the  R.S.K., but it does not envisage for Krajina to have the right  to secede from Croatia.    The R.S.K. authorities underscore that Serbs, who are  entitled to self-determination like any other former  Yugoslavia's nation, have voted in a referendum to live in an  independent state, and therefore any further negotiations on the  issue are totally out of the question.</p>

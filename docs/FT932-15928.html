			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Letter: Exchange rates: building a reputation and avoiding disorder (2) Sir, the logic of Mr Grey's gloss (Letters, April 6) on Mr van den Muyzenberg's letter (March 30) is incontestable and points up the paradox that fixed exchange rates must be variable. The worrying question is, how, in a world abounding with economic and financial information, they can be varied effectively but without disorder. If alignments are sizeable the perfect solution would be to make them when least expected by the market. But this is a contradiction verging on an absurdity. If, at the other extreme, you wait until the commentators and the bankers all agree that the moment has come, then you obviously make it easy for speculators and for those responsible for managing international funds to place their bets. Conditions for automotive alignment are hard to envisage. Small, frequent variations are an option, but would look and feel to the trader rather like floating. Can the trader and the operator in invisibles have their cake and eat it too? Or must they simply accept the need to pay for some insurance, in the form of hedging, against movements in exchange rates which work for, not against, a reasonable equilibrium?

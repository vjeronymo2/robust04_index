			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> G. Disproportionate Share Adjustment (&sect;412.106)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1886(d)(5)(F) of the Act provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional Medicare payments for hospitals that serve a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate share of low income patients. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(d)(5)(F)(vii) of the Act, as added by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6003(c)(1)(B) of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and amended by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4002(b)(1) of Public Law 101&hyph;508, specifies the formula for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the disproportionate share adjustment percentage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for hospitals that are located in an urban area and have 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or more beds, or are located in a rural area and have 500 or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more beds. The statute establishes different payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formulas for different years, including a change in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formula for discharges occurring on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations concerning the Medicare disproportionate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share adjustment are set forth at &sect;412.106. Under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.106(c)(1)(i), a hospital that is located in an urban  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area and has 100 or more beds, or is located in a rural area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and has 500 or more beds, must have a ``disproportionate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient percentage'' of at least 15 percent to qualify for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate share payment adjustment. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 412.106(d)(2) sets forth the formulas for determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disproportionate payment adjustment factors applicable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these two groups of hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are not proposing changes to any part of &sect;412.106  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in this proposed rule. However, we wish to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospitals are aware of the revised payment formulas that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will take effect in FY 1995 pursuant to the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Specifically, for discharges occurring on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1994, any such hospital with a disproportionate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> share patient percentage greater than 20.2 percent will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive a disproportionate share adjustment equal to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.88 percent plus 82.5 percent of the difference between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20.2 percent and the hospital's disproportionate share  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient percentage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> H. Changes Affecting Essential Access Community Hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (EACHs) and Rural Primary Care Hospitals (RPCHs)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;&sect;412.109, 485.602, 485.635, and 489.102)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On May 26, 1993, we published a final rule to implement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the EACH program (58 FR 30630). The rule set forth the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for designating certain hospitals as EACHs or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RPCHs, the conditions that an RPCH must meet to participate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Medicare, and the rules for Medicare payment for services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished by EACHs and RPCHs. The final rule implemented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1820 of the Act, as added by sections 6003(g) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6116(b)(2) of Public Law 101&hyph;239 and revised by section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4008(d) of Public Law 101&hyph;508. The amendments were intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promote regionalization of rural health services in grant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, improve access to hospital and other health services  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for rural residents, and enhance the provision of emergency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other transportation services related to health care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the publication of that rule, we have identified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> several necessary additions to the EACH/RPCH provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, to provide for orderly review and adjudication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disagreements about whether a facility's designation has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been terminated properly, we propose to specify under new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.109(e) that a determination by HCFA that a hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not meet the criteria for EACH designation, or that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's EACH designation should be terminated, is subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to review under 42 CFR part 405, subpart R.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also propose several clarifying changes to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of ``direct services'' at &sect;485.602, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clarifying references in &sect;485.635, the condition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation on provision of services. These revisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely would restate more clearly our existing policies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under which the services listed in &sect;485.635(b) (``direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services'') must be furnished by employed staff, not under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agreements or arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we are proposing to revise the range of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory services that an RPCH must furnish as direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services. In a final rule with comment period published on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> December 2, 1993 (58 FR 63533), we revised the RHC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at &sect;491.9 to eliminate, as required direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services, tests not classified as waived under the Clinical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratories Improvement Act of 1988 (CLIA). (See 42 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 493.15.) We made these changes in the RHC regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the CLIA program introduced participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements that may cause some RHCs to withdraw from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, creating a shortage of available medical care in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because RPCHs typically are located in rural areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to those served by RHCs and serve similar patient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations, and because the RPCH designation criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 1820(f)(1)(H) of the Act state that RPCHs must meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the requirement for direct provision of routine diagnostic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> services in the statutory definition of ``rural health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clinic,'' we believe it is appropriate to impose the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements in both settings. Therefore, we propose to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revise the RPCH regulations at &sect;485.635 to require the RHCs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide directly the following laboratory services:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Chemical examination of urine by stick or tablet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method or both (including urine ketones);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Hemoglobin or hematocrit;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Blood glucose;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Examination of stool specimens for occult blood;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Pregnancy tests; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

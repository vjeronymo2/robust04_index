			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Records: Jazz new and old IT IS entirely appropriate that ECM's 500th production should be from Jan Garbarek, the label's foremost exponent of its often gloomy, usually thought provoking, European contemporary music. After the disappointment of the Norwegian saxophonist's last outing, the soprano sitting uncomfortably alongside the North Indian classical music of Ustad Fateh Ali Khan (Ragas and Sagas), Twelve Moons is a welcome return to form and the old group. Where he seemed starved of oxygen on Ragas, Garbarek burns bright here, set against the luxurious rhythm section of Marilyn Mazur's mixed percussion, Eberhard Weber on electrobass and the sparkling synth confection of Rainer Bruninghaus. Compositions rooted in Norwegian lore or based on the music of Edward Grieg are the unlikely soundscapes for the leader's searing declamation: the ululating vocals of Agnes Buen Garnas and Mari Boine, the extraordinary and emotional accompaniment. Jolly it isn't, uplifting it is. When I first put American Keith Jarrett's new ECM disc Bye Bye Blackbird into the slot, I was convinced a mosquito had become trapped in the speaker cabinet. Several minutes into the title track I thought that comedian Jerry Lewis had joined the pianist's trio for some kind of zany scat routine. If Jarrett's piano playing is at its potent best here, so is the vocal accompaniment. Do not be too alarmed, the absent minded squeals do abate a little later to reveal an empathetic tribute to the late Miles Davis. The Standards Trio of Jarrett (piano), Gary Peacock (bass) and Jack DeJohnette (drums) recorded this session shortly after Miles Davis died but held back the issue until the public mourning had subsided. In not a maudlin way, the trio reflect on 'the sound which came from silence' with Davis favourites such as 'Straight no chaser' and 'I thought about you', around the yearning joint composition, 'For Miles'. Quite apart from its value as a testament to a chapter in jazz history, Bye Bye Blackbird gives a seductive yet 'clubby' view of Jarrett outside the introspection of the solo performance. The American drummer Paul Motian is an important but much underrated figure in modern jazz who has shed new light on the work of others - notably Monk and Bill Evans - in recent releases alongside tenorist Joe Lovano and guitarist Bill Frisell. Paul Motian and the Electric Bebop Band finds his usually suspended drumming technique brought down to earth for some bracing bebop standards and 52nd Street themes. Flanked by the choppy guitars of Brad Schoeppach and Kurt Rosenwinkel, the elastic tenor of promising newcomer Joshua Redman fronts the band through classic bop tunes such as 'Darn that dream' and 'Shaw-nuff'. This is accessible Motian at his most interesting. First among the re-releases is a splendidly annotated three disc anthology from Ella Fitzgerald's years under Norman Granz. The release of Verve's First Lady of Song which coincides with her 75th birthday, contains little new for the dedicated fan in its 51 tracks. As a sampler for the almost sacred 'Songbook' sessions, however, it is essential listening. Through Gershwin, Porter, Berlin and Ellington, the cut glass diction and natural musicality make Fitzgerald the perfect medium for these composers. All aspects of Fitzgerald are here too. From the number that started it all, the easy swinging 'A-tisket A-tasket' via the hilarious muffed vocals of 'Mack the knife' to the transcendental scat of 'It don't mean a thing', this is an essential purchase for those without the works. Jan Garbarek, Twelve Moons ECM 1500 519500-2; Keith Jarrett Trio, Bye Bye Blackbird ECM 1467 513 074-2; Paul Motian and the Electric Bebop Band JMT 514004-2; Ella Fitzgerald, First Lady of Song Verve 517898-2</p>

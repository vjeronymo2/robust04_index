			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Brinkman Has Sleepless Night -- </F> Purple Coalition Near"]    [Text] CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Brinkman  seriously considered resigning after the heavy election defeat  of his party. "I had a sleepless night about it," he admitted  yesterday. In the end, he decided to stay and yesterday  afternoon received the support of his parliamentary party, which  elected him to be its chairman. Yesterday, after the first  meeting of the new, much reduced parliamentary party, Brinkman  did not want to go into the question of what sort of cabinet  should emerge, in the view of the CDA.    According to sources in the CDA, the parliamentary party  feels that the two big winners in the election, the D66  [Democrats 66] and the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy], must be the first ones to investigate which parties  could work together in a new cabinet. The VVD is also thinking  along these lines. PvdA [Labor Party] leader Kok did not want  to make any comment about the "color" of the new cabinet. In  his view, it was obvious that the "biggest party and the biggest  winner in the elections," respectively his party and the D66,  should form the basis for the new cabinet.  <H5>  Kok: Tempo Behind Formation </H5>   "The `color' of the coalition is very important," Kok said.  "But the key question is: With which parties we can make the  best agreements on the basis of our program." The PvdA leader  said it was "dangerous to first express a preference for parties  and only then see whether you can agree."    According to the PvdA, the formation process should be  completed as quickly as possible. "We must join speed with  carefulness, otherwise 1995 will be a year lacking in policies,"  Kok said. Despite differences over program with other parties,  Kok appeared reasonably optimistic. "Of course, there are  complications and a willing attitude is needed to reach  compromises, but I am positive in the main," he said.    Kok did not want to answer the question of whether it was  necessary to appoint someone to investigate whether a coalition  could be achieved, or appoint someone to actually form a  cabinet. He is to advise Queen Beatrix on this issue tomorrow.  "It seems more sensible to me that Her Majesty is the first  person to hear that from me," he said.    Outgoing minister Van Thijn, who is not a member of the PvdA  parliamentary party, found it hard to imagine that the current  coalition partners, the CDA and PvdA, could both continue to  govern in the new cabinet. "It would be very strange if the  present coalition came out of the formation process a winner,"  he said. "It is obvious that one of the two will give way in  the cabinet formation process." Van Thijn made his comments in  an interview with ELSEVIER magazine about the election results.    Van Thijn regarded a "purple" coalition comprising the PvdA,  the VVD, and the D66 as closer than ever, all the more so given  the CDA's campaign style. "The CDA set up its campaign in a way  that leaves you cold. They monopolized values and standards,"  Van Thijn said.    If it came down to a cabinet comprising the PvdA, the CDA,  and the D66, then in his view it was not reasonable for  Brinkman, leader of the CDA parliamentary party, to be part of  it. "It is not self-evident that Brinkman will take part in a  progressive majority cabinet," the PvdA politician said.    The PvdA parliamentary party elected Kok as its chairman,  Wallage as first deputy chairman and former parliamentary  chairman Wltgens as second deputy chairman.    The much larger VVD parliamentary party needed little time  to  decide on what advice it would give the Queen. It decided to  leave a free hand to the leader of the parliamentary party,  Bolkestein. Bolkestein made it clear in the debate of leading  candidates that in his eyes the CDA/PvdA coalition, supplemented  by the D66, could not continue to govern. "That would come down  to a continuation of the policies of the last four years," he  said. "That is not what the voters want."    In the VVD parliamentary party, there have been calls for a  liberal duo (comprising the VVD and the D66) to be appointed to  investigate whether a coalition could succeed. But because  [D66] Van Mierlo's advice is uncertain (the D66 will meet  today), it was decided to give Bolkestein a free hand. "He will  act as he sees fit," one member of the parliamentary party said.    Yesterday, the CDA parliamentary party started "in an  oppressed mood" to look into the causes of the heavy election  defeat. "Criticism was made of those who played a leading role  in the election campaign," Brinkman said. The parliamentary  party also came to the conclusion that it would have to take a  more independent attitude toward the cabinet and give less  support to the government. The parliamentary party will continue  its discussions next Wednesday.    The CDA executive committee also wants an "in-depth  analysis"  of what went wrong. A proposal to this effect will be on the  agenda of a party executive meeting tomorrow.</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Bad omens for presidential polls - France France's Euro-election results were yesterday being read mainly for what they portend for next May's presidential election, the ultimate prize in French politics. The omens are worst for Mr Michel Rocard who led his Socialist party to its lowest vote score (14.5 per cent) since the early 1970s. This has reawakened interest in the candidacy of Mr Jacques Delors as the only plausible alternative Socialist standard-bearer for the Elysee. The European Commission president said yesterday he was still 'absolutely' loyal to Mr Rocard, and there is no reason to disbelieve him. But the fact that this loyalty cannot be proved until December - when Mr Delors leaves his Brussels post - gives Mr Rocard a difficult six months to come. However, Sunday's vote also threatens to prise the centre-right apart. The official Euro-list of the governing UDF-RPR coalition gained only 25.5 per cent of the vote. This poor performance led some senior conservatives yesterday to question both the wisdom and necessity of trying to field a single UDF-RPR candidate for the presidency. This questioning bodes ill for Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, whose presidential hopes rest very much on his supposedly consensual appeal to both coalition parties, but well for Mr Jacques Chirac, who has the firm launchpad of his RPR party machine and may soon use it to put his Elysee campaign into orbit. If Mr Chirac does this and Mr Balladur, who is of the same RPR Gaullist party, continues to sit on his hands, then one or several presidential candidates from the UDF may emerge. But by the time the final round in the presidential election comes around next May, the race will probably be down to two runners, wearing the colours of right and left. Under these circumstances, even Mr Rocard's losing presidential score would not be less than 44-46 per cent (depending on his right-wing rival), according to opinion polls conducted over the weekend. These provided a forceful contrast to the fragmentation of Sunday's Euro-vote, resulting from the proportional system which France uses only in Euro-elections. The two big surprise splinters emerging out of this fragmentation were the lists of 'Energie Radicale', led by Mr Bernard Tapie, and of 'l'Autre Europe', led by Mr Philippe de Villiers. Both scored around 12 per cent, giving them 13 seats each in Strasbourg. Neither, however, can be regarded as a serious presidential candidate, at least not yet. Mr Tapie has far more pressing business to pursue than a distant dream of the Elysee. Election to Strasbourg may provide him with additional parliamentary immunity from investigations into his companies and properties. What the controversial Mr Tapie has done is to take over the small Mouvement des Radicaux de Gauche (MRG) party, without changing its traditional pro-Socialist orientation, to boost its support with his personal charisma. Having him as an ally is therefore more of a judicial problem than an ideological challenge to the Socialists. To the extent that Mr Tapie is still out of court then, his support can probably be safely added to that of the Socialist party proper next May. By contrast, Mr de Villiers's anti-Maastricht appeal is a serious ideological test to the centre-right's unity.  -------------------------------------------- Population: 57.4 Seats: 87 Results  -------------------------------------------- (Turnout 53.5%; 1989, 48.7%)  -------------------------------------------- Party*            Parliament    % vote      Seats                group    '94   '89  '94   '89  -------------------------------------------- UDF/RPR   EDA/LDR/EPP  25.5  28.9   29    26 PS                PES  14.5  23.6   16    22 AN                 NA  12.3     -   13     - RE               NA**  12.0     -   13     - FN                 ER  10.5  11.7   10    10 PCF                LU   6.9   7.7    6     7 Greens         Greens   2.9  10.6    0     9 Centre        EPP/LDR     -   8.4    -     7  -------------------------------------------- Source: Ministry of Interior estimates  -------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations: AN = Other Europe group; Centre = Centre party - Veil list of UDF; FN = Front National; PCF = Communists; PS = Socialists; RE = Radical Energy group; UDF/RPR = Giscardian list of conservatives and Rally for the Republic  -------------------------------------------- ** Expected to join the PES grouping; for group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  -------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  -------------------------------------------- Proportional from national lists Compulsory voting: No  -------------------------------------------- MEPs  -------------------------------------------- UDF-RPR Union  -------------------------------------------- Dominique Baudis, Helene Carrere d'Encausse, Yves Galland, Christian Jacob, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Armelle Guinebertiere, Nicole Fontaine, Alain Pompidou, Yves Verwaerde, Marie-Therese Hermange, Jean-Louis Bourlanges, Jacques Donnay, Francoise Grosstete, Blaise Aldo, Robert Hersant, Anne-Marie Schaffner, Francis Decourriere, Christian Cabrol, Bernard Stasi, Jean-Claude Pasty, Andre Soulier, Jean-Pierre Bazin, Pierre Bernard-Reymond, Raymond Chesa, Georges de Bremond d'Ars, Jean Baggioni, Jean-Pierre Bebear, Gerard d'Aboville.  -------------------------------------------- PS  -------------------------------------------- Michel Rocard, Catherine Trautmann, Bernard Kouchner, Daniele Darras, Andre Laignel, Nicole Pery, Jack Lang, Frederique Bredin, Pierre Moscovici, Elisabeth Guigou, Jean-Pierre Cot, Pervenche Beres, Francois Bernardini, Michele Lindeperg, Gerard Caudron  -------------------------------------------- AN (Other Europe)  -------------------------------------------- Philippe de Villiers, James Goldsmith, Charles de Gaulle, Thierry Jean-Pierre, Philippe Martin, Francoise Seillier, Georges Berthu, Herve Fabre-Aubrespy, Dominique Souchet, Anne-Christine Poisson, Frederic Striby, Edouard Des Places, Mari-France de Rose  -------------------------------------------- National Front (Allez La France])  -------------------------------------------- Jean-Marie Le Pen, Bruno Megret, Bruno Gollnisch, Jean-Claude Martinez, Carl Lang, Marie-France Stirbois, Bernard Antony, Yvan Blot, Jean-Marie Le Chevalier, Fernard Le Chevalier, Jean-Yves Le Gallou  -------------------------------------------- RE (Tapie)  -------------------------------------------- Bernard Tapie, Jean-Francois Hory, Catherine Lalumiere, Christine Taubira-Delanon, Noel Mamere, Michel Dary, Adnmre Sainjon, Bernard Castagnede, Odile Verrier, Pierre Pradier, Christine Barthet-Mayer, Dominique Saint-Pierre, Antoinette Fouque  -------------------------------------------- PCF  -------------------------------------------- Francis Wurtz, Sylvaine Ainardi, Philippe Herzog, Gisele Moreau, Rene Piquet, Mireille Elmalan, Aline Pailler Based on preliminary results issued by the  -------------------------------------------- European Parliament.

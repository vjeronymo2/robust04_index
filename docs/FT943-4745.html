			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Depressed Europe leaves Scholl lower Shares in Scholl, the healthcare products group, fell more than 10 per cent yesterday as the company reported lower interim profits and the imminent completion of a business review. Pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 fell from Pounds 11.7m to Pounds 9.96m, hit by depressed trading in Europe, higher spending on promotion and interest payments. The shares closed at 164, off 20. Mr Neil Franchino, chief executive, said the group had been studying changes to its structure for the past 12 months, but had not fine-tuned the costs. Definitive plans would be announced within three months. There would be strong benefits from the restructuring in the medium term, he said. 'The changes won't cost a dramatic amount and will be financed internally.' They would be aimed at increasing efficiency and could involve closing some of the 150 shops. Total turnover improved from Pounds 94.1m to Pounds 100.1m, helped by growth in south east Asia and sales from Septivon in France and Scholl Japan, both acquired last year. However, sales in the UK and Europe were down by Pounds 2.7m, and currency movements cost a further Pounds 1.6m. In the UK, which accounts for about 20 per cent of turnover, sales to the trade were 3 per cent down following consolidation of distribution networks. Promotional spending increased from Pounds 6.9m to Pounds 9.5m in the half, mainly to give the two acquisitions a good start. Interest payable was Pounds 327,000, compared with previous interest receivable of Pounds 512,000. Earnings per share fell from 8.2p to 9.8p. The interim dividend is unchanged at 2.6p.</p>

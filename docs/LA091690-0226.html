			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN ACTOR'S OPINIONS  </P> <P> The Sept. 2 Outtakes column asks, "How far will publicists go to exploit the  current Mideast crisis?" and then notes that as a cast member of the movie  "Navy SEALS" I was asked for my opinions.  </P> <P> The author of the Outtakes item either purposefully omitted certain information  or did not adequately research my past.  </P> <P> If he had, he might have discovered that my grandfather was secretary of the  Council of Ministers in Iraq and later became the minister of justice and  education; further, that my father was an Iraqi diplomat for 20 years.  </P> <P> My mother, like myself, is American. We lived in Baghdad in the early '60s and  were present during the overthrow and subsequent assassination of Abdul Kareem  Kasem.  </P> <P> A friend felt this gave me a unique perspective of the current crisis and, sans  renumeration, made public my opinions about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.  </P> <P> Rather than exploitation, it was an honest effort to counteract the  vilification of Arabs in the American media. My portrayal of the terrorist in  "Navy SEALS" notwithstanding, I believe my background warrants an opinion.  </P> <P> NICHOLAS KADI  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

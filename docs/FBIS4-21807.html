			<p>BFN     [Text] The French Basque separatist organization,  Iparretarrak, announced in a communique on Wednesday evening  that it will continue the ``armed struggle'' for as long as  ``its essential aims have not been achieved.''    Iparretarrak has, however, said that it might be prepared to  reconsider its activist policy in the case of ``an unconditional  amnesty of all Basque prisoners and a dialogue.''    Iparretarrak has been blamed by police for setting an  explosive device against a military truck in Dax on Monday  evening.</p>

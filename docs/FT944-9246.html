			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Casket dips to Pounds 1m as demand falls Casket, the bicycle and clothing manufacturer, saw a 52 per cent drop in pre-tax profits for the six months to end-September, from Pounds 2.13m to Pounds 1.03m on turnover up from Pounds 51.8m to Pounds 60m. The profits fall was blamed on lower than anticipated demand for UK-produced bicycles and a Pounds 607,000 operating loss in the Heidemann Fahrrad German bicycle manufacturing operation, acquired last November. The pre-tax figure was also hit by increased interest charges of Pounds 1m (Pounds 730,000), partly attributable to Heidemann's additional working capital requirements. The reorganised clothing side more than doubled operating profits to Pounds 972,000 (Pounds 365,000). Earnings per share fell to 0.68p (1.89p), but the interim is maintained at 0.4p.</p>

			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RICK DU BROW: RADIO'S LIMBAUGH BRINGS HIS OPINIONS TO TV;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE CONTROVERSIAL TALK-SHOW STAR WILL HOST PAT SAJAK'S SHOW MARCH  30 ON CBS, THE SAME NETWORK THAT SUSPENDED ANDY ROONEY.  </P> <P> Rush Limbaugh, the controversial and outspoken radio talk show host, sees  nothing ironic in the fact that he is getting a big opportunity to make a TV  name for himself on CBS, the same network that suspended the outspoken Andy  Rooney amid proven and unproven remarks that enveloped him in controversy.  </P> <P> Because of their public statements, neither man is a favorite of gays. But,  curiously, Limbaugh, who will be the guest host of CBS' late-night "Pat Sajak  Show" March 30, may benefit from the arguments over freedom of expression that  emerged during the furor over Rooney, who returns to "60 Minutes" Sunday.  </P> <P> "I am not puzzled by CBS' decision to ask me to host," says Limbaugh. "It is, I  think, a business decision. They're hoping I will be able to draw viewers. I  am, too. I can tell you this: When I did the Sajak show as a guest, I'm  gathering that they enjoyed it. I think they got a little bit of a ratings bump  up the night I was on. And I bring a rather large radio audience to the show."  </P> <P> Freedom of expression became a central issue in the Rooney affair as debate  raged over remarks about blacks that he denied making to a gay publication, and  also over criticism of the gay lifestyle that he admittedly had tough words for  on TV and in print.  </P> <P> Because CBS News President David Burke never did make clear precisely what  Rooney was suspended for, and now has not made clear precisely why he is being  reinstated after three weeks of his three-month suspension -- which surely  everyone, including the newsman, had the right to know -- the freedom of  expression issue has seemed to grow more and more in importance.  </P> <P> From criticisms of CBS by other journalists to remarkable public support for  Rooney in phone calls and letters, it became clear that people wanted him to  have the freedom to speak his mind. One disturbing aspect of this is that we'll  never how many of these calls and letters came from people who hate blacks and  gays. Nonetheless, the clear distaste for censorship on TV was unmistakable.  </P> <P> And that's where Limbaugh comes in.  </P> <P> Even those who may vehemently disagree with his views on such matters as  liberals, gays and the homeless, delivered on more than 170 radio stations  including KFI-AM (640), may think a bit about the free-speech principle of the  Rooney case in contemplating Limbaugh's outing on the same network. For what  the boring arena of network TV needs is more, not fewer, strong opinions, to  liven it up like cable.  </P> <P> But Limbaugh says no one has to worry about him going off the deep end in his  March 30 hour on CBS -- which, incidentally, should provide fascinating head-on  competition for Johnny Carson. In a phone interview from his New York home,  Limbaugh first of all said he found nothing ironic in being tapped to appear on  CBS, the network that backed off on Rooney.  </P> <P> "I was asked to do this before this whole flap with Rooney happened," he said.  "If there is an irony here, they (CBS) would have to speak to it. But I think  you're dealing with the fact that one division's entertainment, one division's  news."  </P> <P> Anyway, says Limbaugh, "We've had some discussions on what the show's gonna be,  and there's not even gonna be a word mentioned about any of this -- the gay  situation, what my feelings about gays are. It has nothing to do with what  we're gonna do.  </P> <P> "To me, it's a golden opportunity, and I'm just flattered they have enough  confidence in me to give me the opportunity. I'm not worried about whatever  political point of view of mine they might be afraid of. I can tell you this  whole gay thing is not something which I lead with. I'm not in any way, shape,  matter or form planning to have it come up."  </P> <P> A CBS spokeswoman says there are "no ground rules" restricting Limbaugh on the  show.  </P> <P> But did the Rooney situation influence his decision to avoid the subject of  gays? "No," says Limbaugh, "because it was never in my mind to do it." And he  agrees with CBS that no one has told him to stay away from the topic.  </P> <P> "No. Never," he says. "It has not been said. Now, it might be said if I said,  'You know, I would like to talk about the gay situation.' But I don't want to.  </P> <P> "I'll tell you something. Television is something I'm trying to learn. And this  is a one-shot opportunity. You never know where these things lead. And the last  thing I want to do is come on so strong that people are saying, 'Who is this  guy?'  </P> <P> "On radio, you can be a little controversial. You can come back the next day  and explain what you mean to people who don't get it, might not understand. On  a one-shot television show, you have to, in my mind, start out at a pace where  you just don't totally blow people away.  </P> <P> "I think coming on with something as sensitive as the gay issue and the AIDS  issue and all the stuff that has now been hyped because of what happened to  Rooney would not be in my best interests to do, regardless of how passionate I  may be about it."  </P> <P> Limbaugh maintains repeatedly that "I don't think I am known for my anti-gay  comments. I have some outspoken opinions about the politics of the gay  movement. I have simply opposed the politics of them."  </P> <P> This may come as a remarkable view to those with a somewhat different  perspective of Limbaugh. In December, for instance, he unloaded on AIDS and  abortion activists who disrupted services at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New  York, commenting: "I say to those of you of the leftist, militant, homosexual  crowd: Take it somewhere else. Get out of our schools. Get out of our churches.  Take your deadly, sickly behavior and keep it to yourselves."  </P> <P> Asked about these comments, Limbaugh says they are accurate and that he stands  by them, but that the framework of what he was trying to get across was that  the activists should have been seeking the comfort of the church rather than  attacking it. That is hardly likely to satisfy his enemies and critics, but he  says viewers who watch his hour on CBS won't get a show heavy on social issues:  </P> <P> "I don't think people tune to late-night entertainment shows to listen to  serious discussions of social ills and consequences. They're gonna be watching  'Nightline' if they're interested in that kind of thing. I'd like to find a way  to mix issue-oriented discussions with humor."  </P> <P> Indeed he would. His CBS gig is vitally important to his attempt to crack into  TV on a much wider scale. In a November interview with The Times, Limbaugh  described himself as "a lovable little fuzz ball," "an entertainer first and a  conservative second" -- and said he'd like to do a TV talk show that mixed  topical issues with humor: "I'd like to be a comedian and I don't mind being a  serious talk-show host."  </P> <P> He's pursuing these TV goals actively, but says he's "written off" two recent  attempts -- one for a call-in talk show on Cable News Network, the other as a  panelist on a new version of "To Tell the Truth."  </P> <P> As a nationally known conservative, he speaks with amazement of what he says a  CNN executive told him: "Everybody here loves your tape. They just wish you  were a little more liberal." Limbaugh interprets this as meaning that CNN  thinks it is already well-stocked with such conservative commentators as Pat  Buchanan.  </P> <P> But now there's the upcoming job at CBS, where the news department may tell Dan  Rather or Andy Rooney to watch their step, but where network honchos tell Rush  Limbaugh to just go ahead and do his thing.  </P> <P> That's entertainment.  </P></p>

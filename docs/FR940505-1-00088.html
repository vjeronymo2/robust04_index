			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Aerosol coating manufacturers are expected to develop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliant products through propellant replacement, product  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulation, and improvements in packaging and delivery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems. Two promising propellent alternatives,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hydrofluorocarbon (HCFC) 152a and dimethyl ether, are potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacements for current hydrocarbon propellants. Reformulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to a lower VOC content could be achieved through increased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solids, lower VOC solvents and propellants, or a combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both. A further opportunity to reduce emissions lies in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> redesign of the packaging and delivery system such that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonhydrocarbon gas or mechanical device acts to displace the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> container's contents. Improvements in the transfer efficiency of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the delivery systems would result in reduced overspray, higher  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surface coating percentage per container, and cost savings to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed FIP aerosol coating regulation is to reduce VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emission by approximately 60 percent from 1990 levels. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions from 1990 levels equate to approximately 15 tpd in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California. FIP area attainment year reductions are estimated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 0.9 tpd in 1999 and 1.1 tpd in 2005 in the Sacramento area, 8.9  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tpd in 2010 for the South Coast, and 0.4 tpd in 2005 for Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Only limited data is available to estimate the cost of developing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliant products. The first phase of the regulation is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to have a minimal cost because compliant products are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already available to meet the BAAQMD rule. Costs of meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1999 limits will depend in part on the availability of HCFC 152a.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although a promising propellant substitute, HCFC 152a is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated to cost five to ten times more than current hydrocarbon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propellants. However, with increased demand for HCFC 152a, its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost is expected to decrease.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Alternative Reduction Approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB is currently developing an alternative compliance plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ACP) approach which would allow additional flexibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected consumer product manufacturers. The ACP would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to average a limited number of products when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining compliance. The ACP concept is under development and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is working with CARB to assure its consistency with EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Economic Incentive Program guidance. After the ACP program is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted by CARB, EPA will consider it for adoption as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FIP. Additional alternative reduction approaches as described in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> III.C.4. for architectural coatings could also be applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer products. Comments are requested on the use of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approaches to achieve additional emission reductions from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumer products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Need for Additional Reductions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because additional reductions from consumer products will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to attain the ozone standard in the South Coast, EPA will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to investigate strategies such as setting VOC limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fees, a manufacturers bubble, or a corporate average to further  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage reductions from these products. Because a fraction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the consumer products inventory (e.g., laundry detergents, hand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> washing detergents, lubricants) are not regulated by current CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations or the FIP proposal, EPA will investigate strategies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for reducing emission resulting from these unregulated products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA intends to use section 182(e)(5) commitments for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional reductions and to develop appropriate control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strategies based on continuing evaluation of new technologies and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance options.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pesticides <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Summary and Applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed 40 CFR 52.2960 is designed to reduce VOC emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from agricultural and structural pesticide application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

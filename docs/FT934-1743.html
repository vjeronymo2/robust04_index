			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Vacancy counting system may alter Department of Employment statisticians are considering a move to a more accurate measure for the number of job vacancies in the economy, which are substantially understated by the current method. The November vacancy figure announced yesterday was 140,900 - 6,500 up on the previous month, 24,000 up on a year before and the highest since October 1990. But most labour market analysts believe that the real figure could be three or four times more. The present figure counts vacancies notified to Jobcentres, but many vacancies are advertised in newspapers or through private employment agencies. The largest single way in which vacancies are communicated is by word of mouth. Mr Peter Stibbard, director of statistics at the employment department, said it would be difficult to capture vacancies that never enter the public domain, but information from newspapers and employment agencies could be used. The new system was likely to establish an index of the change in vacancies rather than a new number. Mr Stibbard added: 'We want to establish a rapidly available barometer of the vacancy position in the labour market.' Ministers have not yet discussed the proposal but are unlikely to oppose it. The department already does occasional spot checks of vacancies using a broader measure than Jobcentre notifications. It found that in some areas the number is up to three times higher. The seasonally adjusted official figure for the inflow of vacancies now stands at 199,500, the highest figure since June 1990. Jobcentre placings of 150,400 are also at the highest level since March 1990.</p>

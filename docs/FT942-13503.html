			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Electricity chiefs' chance to earn their wages: Why industry regulator Stephen Littlechild is likely to get tough in his review of prices The chairmen and chief executives of Britain's 14 electricity distribution companies will never have a better chance to prove they are worth their threefold pay rises many have enjoyed since privatisation four years ago. During the next three months they will lock horns with Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, in negotiations which will have more effect on their companies' profitability than perhaps any other single factor in the next five years. Last week Prof Littlechild was talking tough ahead of discussions which will determine how he regulates the companies' monopoly distribution businesses, which typically provide 85 per cent of their profits. The City took fright. Electricity share prices fell by up to 5 per cent on Friday as investors digested leaks of confidential letters from Prof Littlechild to the companies in which he suggested distribution price rises in future years should be limited to up to 4 per cent below the rate of inflation. The companies will have to take a much bigger hit in the first year of the new regulatory regime beginning next April. Prof Littlechild does not mention a specific figure in his letters, but analysts estimate that the stances he is taking on a variety of issues, including the cost of capital, could lead to distribution price cuts of 20 per cent. That could lead to a cut of 5 per cent to 7 per cent in pre-tax electricity prices paid by consumers, of which distribution costs form about a quarter, compensating in part for rises in the rate of value added tax. With several rounds of negotiations still to go, Prof Littlechild's letter is viewed as his opening shot, leaving plenty of room for compromise. But there are strong pressures on him to stand firm. Although he is likely later this year to be reappointed as regulator, his first five-year term of office has attracted mixed reviews. In recent months they have been mostly unfavourable. His decision in February to cap prices for two years in the electricity pool, the industry's wholesale trading market, is viewed increasingly in the industry, not least by the distribution companies, as a temporary fix which has weakened the image he seeks as a promoter of free markets. But most of the recent wrath has come from consumer organisations which say he has allowed distributors to make far too much money at the expense of electricity users. With this review Prof Littlechild has a chance to put that right. The companies say prices for all but the biggest consumers of electricity have fallen in real terms, a claim disputed by consumer groups who argue it depends on which date you choose for the start of privatisation. Even the power companies agree privately that a clampdown is both inevitable and justified. All have cut costs far more effectively than they persuaded the government was possible before privatisation. The result has been profit, dividend and share price rises few investors could have dreamed of when they bought into the companies in 1990. In curbing what consumer organisations describe as a bonanza, Prof Littlechild will devise a formula which will restrict directly the companies' prices rather than profits, although they too will almost certainly fall as a result. He believes that capping profits would encourage complacency. Capping prices forces companies to become more efficient since that becomes their route to increasing profitability. The existing regulatory regime allows companies to raise distribution charges annually by up to 2.5 percentage points above the rate of inflation. As well as revising this so that the companies will have to cut real prices by up to 4 per cent, Prof Littlechild has served notice that he intends to change the form of price control. The main task of the review, he says, is to assess what expenditure is needed in each company's distribution business, decide on an appropriate level of revenue and propose controls accordingly. The existing system relates allowed revenue to the number of electricity units sold. But Offer also intends to introduce allowances for the number of customers served, as well as a fixed element. This may be a better reflection of distribution costs, but it raises a series of questions about fair treatment. Some analysts believe that Prof Littlechild's suggestion in last week's letter to allow revenues of Pounds 30m for each regional company to cover the fixed element would penalise companies with relatively few customers such as Manweb and Swalec. Earlier indications were that he might allow Pounds 60m for the fixed amount. The fewer allowable revenues he allocates to the fixed element, the more he is likely to allow for the number of customers. So companies with fewer customers are likely to be penalised. In setting price caps, Prof Littlechild is also likely to attempt to penalise companies he believes have cut costs the least. But assessing efficiency is notoriously difficult, with each company tending to claim it is ahead of the rest. Perhaps the biggest arguments prior to July will surround Prof Littlechild's assumptions on appropriate rates of return on assets to help formulate price caps. The 6 per cent he suggested in last week's letters seems reasonable compared with similar industries such as gas and water. Throughout the discussions Prof Littlechild will be lobbied hard by consumer groups arguing that profits and dividends growth will remain high even if he takes the toughest approach possible. Most analysts believe that although profits will inevitably be affected by the review, particularly next year, the companies' dividend cover and their scope for further efficiency improvements are such that they can continue increasing dividend payments well above the market average in the next few years. The power companies will therefore have to think long and hard before going to the MMC. Nonetheless electricity company executives have shown time and again, not least in their pre-privatisation victories on price controls, that they are negotiators par excellence and can be relied upon to drive a hard bargain.</p>

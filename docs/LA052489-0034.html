			<p><P> May 24, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Just in time for the opening of the new Indiana Jones movie, actor Harrison  Ford, Paramount Pictures and Lucasfilm Ltd. will donate items Friday from the  film trilogy to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History.  Memorabilia to be donated include the trademark brown fedora and well-worn  leather jacket that Ford wore in all three films: "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"  "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and the latest, "Indiana Jones and the  Last Crusade." The hat and jacket, which a museum spokeswoman said have  "influenced men's fashion in the 1980s," will become part of the museum's  History of American Entertainment collection, but will not be on public  display.

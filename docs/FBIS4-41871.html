			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Andrey Kirillov] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 28 Jun -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said today after talks with his Chinese counterpart Qian  Qichen that at least six or seven agreements, including a "major  political document," will be signed during the forthcoming  Moscow summit between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and PRC  President Jiang Zemin.    An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from trustworthy sources  that the summit is planned for the first week in September.    Andrey Kozyrev described the forthcoming summit as a  "landmark" in Russo-Chinese relations which, in his words, are  now developing in a stable manner.    Qian Qichen agreed with this assessment. He noted, however,  that "certain issues have arisen" in what is, on the whole, a  dynamic trade exchange between the two countries, and overcoming  these would make it possible to increase business ties more  successfully.    In the words of the Russian minister, the sides discussed  the  Korean nuclear problem in quite some detail. "We are agreed on  ensuring the nonnuclear status of the Korean peninsula and on  seeking political solutions," Andrey Kozyrev said. He added  that the Russian proposal to hold a multilateral conference on  the Korean issue still stands.    Both China and Russia, Qian Qichen said, are very close  neighbors of the Korean peninsula, and both countries want a  settlement of the difficulties over Korea. As for the Russian  initiative, China regards this proposal "with understanding."  However, it believes that "the appropriate conditions are  required" for it to be put into practice.</p>

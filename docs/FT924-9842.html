			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fukutake seeks to renegotiate Berlitz purchase THE PRICE of Berlitz shares slumped by more than 10 per cent yesterday morning after the Princeton-based language school and publishing group disclosed that its prospective Japanese buyer was seeking to renegotiate terms. The request for a renegotiation came after Berlitz reported a sharp drop in third-quarter operating income. Berlitz shares fell by Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 19 5/8 yesterday after the company said that Fukutake Publishing of Japan was seeking to alter the financial terms of its planned acquisition. Under the original plan, Fukutake was to pay roughly Dollars 270m as part of a complex transaction that would have created a new Berlitz holding company, of which the Japanese buyer would own 67 per cent. Berlitz, meanwhile, said its operating income for the three months ended September 30 was Dollars 1.211m, down sharply from the Dollars 5.248m achieved in the same period a year earlier. Sales for the three months were Dollars 69.606m, against Dollars 62.537m in the same quarter of 1991. For the first nine months of 1992, Berlitz had operating income of Dollars 9.825m, compared with Dollars 18.484m. The Berlitz saga is complicated by the fact that some 56.5 per cent of the company's shares were pledged to banks last year as collateral for loans made to the late Mr Robert Maxwell. These shares had been nominally owned by Macmillan, which was at the time part of the Maxwell Communication Corporation (MCC). MCC is now operating under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law and the status of the Berlitz shares is the subject of various legal actions. The Fukutake deal involved cash payments to existing Berlitz shareholders; the setting up of a new holding company that would assume Dollars 160m of debt; a formula for Berlitz shareholders to eventually receive a total of 33 per cent of the new Berlitz company; and promises for payments to shareholders that would be based on certain MCC notes held by Berlitz.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Vekuii Rukoro, deputy minister of justice, has  vehemently denied a report in Friday's edition of THE NAMIBIAN  to the effect that he was ousted from Cabinet.    In a hard hitting statement on Friday, Rukoro also denied  that he had voiced criticism of lack of Government action  concerning the alleged involvement of Minister of Justice,  Ngarikutuke Tjiriange, and deputy Home Affairs minister, Nangolo  Ithete, in illegal ostrich dealing. He said that no such  subject had been discussed at Cabinet.    On the subject of his future attendance at Cabinet meetings,  Rukoro said that "following an amicable and comradely discussion  between the Right Honourable Prime Minister and myself it was  agreed that my regular attendance at Cabinet meetings was no  longer necessary in view of the following: as a rule Deputy  Ministers do not attend Cabinet meetings in their own right but  only in the absence of their substantive Ministers whom they are  deputising; His Excellency, the President, however, has the  power to invite any deputy minister to attend a particular  session or all sessions of Cabinet by way of a special  consideration.    "Since I was President of the NNF [Namibian National Front]  and SWANU [South-West African National Union] when I was  initially appointed as deputy minister, it was agreed between HE  [His Excellency] the President and myself that by virtue of my  leadership of NNF and SWANU, I shall be made a regular attendant  of Cabinet meetings.    I resigned the aforesaid positions last September and ever  since then, strictly speaking, I had no justification attending  Cabinet meetings in my own right.    "It is therefore clear that the decision mutually arrived at  between the Prime Minister and myself is nothing but a normal  regularisation of my position and status as ordinary deputy  minister in Government on a par with other deputy ministers."    Rukoro concluded by saying that both he and the Prime  Minister were "happy" with this arrangement.</p>

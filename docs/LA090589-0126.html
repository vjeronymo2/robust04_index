			<p><P> September 5, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BREWER TO FUND ALCOHOL AWARENESS  </P> <P> Stung by allegations that concerts sponsored by beer companies encourage minors  to drink, the nation's biggest brewer said it will donate $250,000 to Students  Against Driving Drunk in Texas.  </P> <P> The money will help provide SADD chapter start-up kits to all Texas junior and  senior high schools, Stephen J. Burrows, Anheuser-Busch vice president for  consumer awareness and education, said Monday.  </P> <P> Anheuser-Busch and Miller Brewing Co. were criticized for sponsoring large  outdoor music festivals in seven Texas cities over the Labor Day weekend. Both  brewers took precautions to prevent underage drinking and the events, which  drew 500,000 people, were without major problems, police said.  </P></p>

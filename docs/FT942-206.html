			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Former directors of BCCI sue Abu Dhabi Three former non-executive directors of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International yesterday launched a legal action in the US against Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholders, seeking damages of Dollars 100m (Pounds 65m). The suit marks a highly unusual attempt by directors to sue shareholders, and is an attempt to respond to the damage they believe has been done to their reputations by the collapse. The three directors - Mr Alfred Hartmann, Mr Yves Lamarche and Mr Johan van Oenen - have recently been sued in Luxembourg by BCCI's liquidators and in Paris by the liquidators to the bank's French arm. The action could give the directors access to millions of pages of internal bank documents which recently arrived in the US. Lawyers for the three claim these papers would give far more details of the BCCI fraud than have yet emerged and would reveal the role of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, the Gulf state's ruler, and of other officials in covering it up. The US action, filed in a New York state court yesterday, is based largely on published information. It alleges Sheikh Zayed - with his son, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, and other Abu Dhabi officials - knew of the fraud in spring 1990, but hid this from the banking regulators and from BCCI's auditors and non-executive directors. BCCI was not closed down until July 1991. Mr John Mitchell, a lawyer acting for the directors, conceded that the exercise amounted to 'a fishing expedition', but said this was allowed in US civil cases to give plaintiffs access to all the evidence they might need. The directors claimed that the auditors, Price Waterhouse, had been 'manipulated and controlled by the shareholders', and the directors were left uninformed for many months about the investigations into fraud that were taking place. Price Waterhouse rejected these claims. Abu Dhabi yesterday rejected the charges, many of which had been heard before, it said. The three directors taking the action are: Mr Alfred Hartmann, a resident of Herrliberg, Switzerland, who joined BCCI's board in 1982, having been general manager of the Union Bank of Switzerland, managing director and deputy chairman of Hoffman-La Roche, and a director of the Swiss operations of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of New York, Lavoro Bank, Rothschild Bank and Banca del Gottardo. Mr Yves Lamarche, a US citizen and resident of Paris, who joined BCCI's board in 1975. He was senior vice-president of the Middle East Area Office for the Bank of America, and then president and chief executive officer of Banque Arabe et Internationale d'Investissement from 1980. Mr Johan Diderik van Oenen, a Dutch citizen who lives in England and who joined BCCI's board in 1978. He was a senior officer with Bank of America in 1960-73 and became executive vice-president of the Bank of Montreal.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, April 27 (AFP) -- France "demands" the  immediate and unconditional release of 11 aid workers held by  Bosnian Serbs for more than two weeks on the outskirts of  Sarajevo, Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Wednesday [27 April].    The 11 French aid workers, members of the "Premiere urgence"  humanitarian group, were detained by Bosnian Serbs on April 8 on  charges of trying to smuggle arms to Bosnian Moslems.    The workers "did their humanitarian duty and nothing else,"  the minister told parliament, adding that they had been "set  up," with weapons purposefully put aboard their convoy.    Their arrest and detention in Bosnian Serb barracks followed  a warning by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation that it  would bomb Bosnian Serb forces if they did not remove their  heavy weapons from around Sarajevo.</p>

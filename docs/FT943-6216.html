			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Polls point to Parti Quebecois victory Quebec's Liberal premier, Mr Daniel Johnson, won on points in Monday night's televised debate with Mr Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, but failed to score the knock-out blow needed for election victory. The PQ's lead in the opinion polls has been narrowed significantly in several weeks of campaigning by Mr Johnson, who is more popular than Mr Parizeau. But Monday's lengthy and technical debate, on which the Liberals were resting great hopes, did little to further shift voter sentiment. Recent opinion polls give the PQ a lead of between four and seven points, ahead of Quebec's September 12 election. The staunchly federalist Liberals need to pick up about 10 points in the polls to win a majority in the 125-seat National Assembly. Among French speaking voters, the PQ leads by 20 points, and Francophones make up 80 per cent of Quebec's 7m population. However, polls suggest that around 27 per cent of voters are undecided.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Beckett says she offers continuity and stability Mrs Margaret Beckett yesterday claimed credit for Labour's decision to 'try to drive' the Tories into third place in this week's Eastleigh by-election, as she announced her intention to enter the contest to succeed John Smith as Labour leader. The MP for Derby South also made clear that she would enter the race for deputy leader - a post to which she was first elected some two years ago. She said that by declaring a vacancy from next month for the deputy leader's post, she was ensuring that all candidates could enter the contest 'on equal terms'. Mrs Beckett was in confident mood after the widespread praise for her performance as acting leader before this week's European elections and parliamentary by-elections. She emphasised her experience and said she could offer 'continuity and stability'. 'People don't have to guess what kind of leader I can be - they can see,' she said. 'I believe I have the measure of John Major and I believe I would have the measure of any of his successors.' Asking party members to judge her on her 'ability to manage and unify' the party and to 'communicate its ideals', Mrs Beckett sought to highlight her expected appeal to female voters - 'whose votes Labour needs to win'. Underlining the central role she has played in Labour's recent campaigns, Mrs Beckett said it was her decision to try to push the Conservatives into third place in this week's Eastleigh by-election - a result the party achieved by a margin of some 1,500 votes. 'I have led our campaigning through two successful local election campaigns, including the key London elections this year, a number of by-elections and this year's Euro-elections,' she said. 'In all of these campaigns I have played the key role behind the scenes as well as taking a full part on stage.' Women are likely to feature prominently among Mrs Beckett's key backers at Westminster, although it remained unclear last night who would be running her campaign. She appeared unaccompanied at yesterday's crowded press conference, saying she was still 'in the very early stages of my campaign'. Mrs Beckett, 51, may also get support from Labour's hard-left because of her radical and fervently Euro-sceptic past. Her vitriolic attack 13 years ago on Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, for his failure to back Mr Tony Benn, then running for deputy leader, is still remembered. But she has since built up a reputation as a tough-minded and unflappable pragmatist, first as shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, where she policed the spending instincts of her colleagues, and more recently as deputy leader. There was certainly no evidence of any hankering to return to her leftwing roots yesterday, although she did make an early attempt to outflank Mr John Prescott, one of her leadership rivals, on the issue of full employment that he is putting at the heart of his campaign. Mrs Beckett said that as well as aiming for 'the greatest possible level of employment', Labour should seek new ways of enhancing workers' job security. She said she did not believe that the implications for 'the financial structure of this country' of the growth in performance pay and short-term contracts had been properly thought through. Mrs Beckett called on all candidates for the leadership to run for the deputy leadership as well. She even said Mr Blair's name had been mentioned in connection with the deputy leadership 'on a previous occasion'.</p>

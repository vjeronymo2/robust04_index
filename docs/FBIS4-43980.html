			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Liberals" column: "Obliged to Say `No'"] </F>   [Text] We will doubtless find ourselves in front of painful  dilemmas, especially under the weight of great pressure. Events  have played a direct role as they have occurred, outlining  irreversible and ill-omened developments. These developments are  linked with the package of confidence-building measures as far  as we know it and are also associated with critical changes.  The result is:    The already one-sided content of the confidence-building  measures package is becoming even worse for our side; it is a  starting point for Turkish goals. As a result, it acts against  us in a dangerous and catalytic way. Something like this, and  especially with our own consent, will accelerate the crisis.    Everything that has happened and all the backstage and  visible efforts have come together. Things cannot be otherwise,  because instead of condemning the Turkish side after blaming it  for its intransigence (leading to measures to implement the UN  decisions), we finally see "clarifications" adopted to balance  the UN document! This was the document they asked us to accept.  Indecently, we accepted it.    In light of positions that tend toward a new framework that  overturns every condition laid down by the Security Council's  big powers, our side must search for the most preventive  strategy and tactic so that it will not find itself trapped in  irreversible processes and frameworks that will lead to  recognition [of the north of the island].    No matter how difficult our position and no matter if we are  the weak part in an oppressive and bad situation, we are obliged  to resist unorthodox solutions, even if they are adopted by the  United Nations. We are obliged to do that, even if these  attempts are promoted by the centers of power and decision,  simply because we have few options. But this does not mean we  are abandoning realistic approaches and awareness of the need to  compromise. On the contrary, we realize that, which is why our  side always stresses that it accepts the 21 March document.</p>

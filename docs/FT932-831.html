			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Yorks Electricity reorganisation plans YORKSHIRE ELECTRICITY yesterday announced a re-organisation of its core business as it disclosed a 10 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 156.3m and a 15 per cent rise in total dividends. The shake-up involves the break-up of the main business into three separate divisions - a system division or the 'true core' as the company calls it, and network engineering and energy management - with the aim of it making it more competitive. Network engineering and energy management will work on a contractual basis with the core, which will employ only about 330 people, against their combined 3,200. Mr Malcolm Chatwin, chief executive, said the company was preparing for increasing competition which the industry regulator is promoting in areas like meter reading. The aim was to ensure that the businesses had every opportunity to compete at market rates. 'It is about changing the culture,' he said. In the year to March 31, Yorkshire increased earnings per share by 11 per cent to 53.7p and the dividend to 20.42p from 17.76p, with a recommended 14.42p final. The dividend rise was at the higher end of recs which have reported so far for last year, but Mr John Tysoe, chairman, denied the company was in a dividend race. The company could not ignore sector norms, he said, but its policy always had been to match dividend rises to earnings rises over the five year period to 1995 and that remained in force. Distribution profits rose from Pounds 135.3m to Pounds 136.2m and supply, helped by a Pounds 36m cut in the value of debtors, from Pounds 8.9m to Pounds 10.6m. The company made provisions of Pounds 10m for the retailing joint venture with East Midlands and Pounds 7.6m for distribution re-organisation costs but, after write-backs for the previous year, total provisions were about Pounds 10m. Gearing fell from 15 to 7 per cent. COMMENT Long used to being one of the sector stars, Yorkshire has seen its rating slip in the last month or so. There is nothing in these results to explain the drop, one reason perhaps why the shares gained 5p yesterday to finish at 496p. Retailing profits stood still at about Pounds 1m, but that is considerably better than other companies and by forming a joint venture Yorkshire is better placed than others to pull out of stores if they do not perform. The benefits of being among the first recs to tackle contracting pay rates are showing through with a rise in profits from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 700,000. In the core business controllable costs, already down by 7.9 per cent in the last year, will benefit from the restructuring and further job losses can be expected on top of the 328 of last year. All of this should mean the shares, trading at a prospective yield of 5.9 per cent assuming a dividend of 23.4p from Pounds 170m of profits, will at least track the sector in the near future.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cairo, 28 Jun (MENA)--Ambassador Sa'id Rif'at,  assistant foreign minister for African affairs, has again denied  that Egypt supplied the Rwandan Government with arms.    Responding to claims by the Rwandan Patriotic Front that  Egypt is providing the government with weapons and that Egypt  has endorsed a Security Council resolution to send troops to  Rwanda to appease France, Rif'at made a statement today  affirming that Egypt favors no side to the conflict in Rwanda.    He said there is a question mark over the Rwandan Patriotic  Front's insistence on accusing Egypt of providing the government  there with weapons despite Egypt's assertion that it is not.    He added that Egypt supported Security Council Resolution  929  on the intervention of a UN force with a humanitarian task to  protect the refugees and the displaced in Rwanda relying on  practical and objective considerations, primarily Egypt's desire  to ensure protection and security for endangered civilians with  emphasis on the humanitarian nature of the mission.

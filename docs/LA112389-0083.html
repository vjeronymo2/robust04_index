The  agreement calls for the plaza to be completed in 22 months.  </P> <P> City officials said that, although the property is being sold at a discount,  the city expects to profit from sales and property taxes and business license  fees for the new stores and from increases in taxable sales at the existing  Price Club.  </P></p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Company News: State sells 70% of Air Jamaica The Jamaican government has sold 70 per cent of Air Jamaica to a consortium of local and Canadian investors for USDollars 26.5m. The disposal is the first of what is expected to be a series of sales of several of the Caribbean's loss-making carriers. A further 5 per cent of Air Jamaica will be offered to employees with the government retaining 25 per cent. The government will take responsibility for all liabilities which exceed the value of the current assets, said Mr P. J. Patterson, Jamaica's prime minister. 'Liabilities far outweigh assets and the government will be writing off a significant amount,' said a company official. The consortium taking control of Air Jamaica says the carrier will be capitalised at Dollars 52.5m, and that the funds will be raised from Jamaican and Canadian sources. The government has been trying to find a buyer for Air Jamaica for four years. The airline has recorded continuing losses, including a deficit of just over Dollars 20m last year. The deal coincides with a move by several other Caribbean governments to merge their airlines. They have invited British Airways to take a 25 per cent stake in the venture. Regional officials say that BA is carrying out a feasibility study of the scheme. The governments intend to start with the merger of the operations of Air Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago Airways Corporation, which runs BWIA International. The new regional company will later be expanded with the inclusion of Bahamasair, the Guyana Airways Corporation, and Leeward Islands Air Transport (LIAT), an island-hopping commuter airline which is owned by several governments. Regional governments will have a minority stake in the new company which will run the airlines. The plan is for large airlines and regional private business to hold a majority of the new company's equity. A study commissioned by the Caribbean Community indicated that a rationalisation of the region's air transport, with shared services and a single company running the five airlines, would lead to savings of Dollars 60m a year. None of the airlines has been an attractive proposition, mainly because they have no record of financial viability. There is little to indicate that their operational efficiency can be significantly improved. Air Jamaica has a fleet of eight. It plies routes between the island and several eastern and south-eastern US cities. BWIA has a fleet of 11. Its accumulated losses over the past six years have been put by company officials at 'about Dollars 165m'.</p>

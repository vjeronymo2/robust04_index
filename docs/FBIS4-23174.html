			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban May 30 SAPA -- Defence Minister Joe Modise  and Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi met  KwaZulu/Natal police and army chiefs in Durban on Monday [30  May] to discuss violence in the province. Government spokesman  Craig Kotze said in a statement "intensive talks" were held  between Mr Modise, Mr Mufamadi, legal adviser to the state  president's office Prof Fink Haysom and the province's police  and army leaders. He hinted the state of emergency in the  region might be lifted, saying the issue had been discussed and  recommendations would be made to the cabinet.    The talks with SA [South Africa] Police Services regional  commissioner Lt-Gen Colin Steyn; KwaZulu Police commissioner  Lt-Gen Roy During; SA National Defence Force commander Dion  Ferreria; and Provincial Peace Accord Chairman M C Pretorius,  were initiated by central government. Mr Kotze said they arose  out of concern about the levels of violence in the region, and  resolved that policing must be seen to be implemented without  fear of failure and impartially.</p>

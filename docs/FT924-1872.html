			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Myth of secularism comes to an end in Bombay : Shiraz Sidhva on why India's commercial capital was least prepared for the violence after Ayodhya TO HELL with your secularism if it is at the cost of Hindus,' says Mr Bal Thackeray, the founder of the Shiv Sena, Bombay's most militant political party, sitting in his plush suburban home. As rioting swept the city last week in the wake of the demolition of a mosque at Ayodhya in northern India, it was clear that the Sena, a political ally of the Hindu right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, was not about to let the city's Moslems get away with protesting against the destruction of the mosque. Calling a strike which paralysed the city on December 9, Sena supporters targeted Moslems, mostly in the slums, where half Bombay's 12m people live. The Hindu militants were spurred on by the indifference of the largely Hindu police force in some places and blatant connivance in others. 'The police have become the object of mistrust and hatred like never before in Bombay,' said Mr George Fernandes, a senior opposition Janata Dal MP who toured the riot-torn city. The Shiv Sena (literally, army of Shivaji, the 17th century warrior leader from the region, who fought the Mughal king Aurangzeb) was founded in Maharashtra state, of which Bombay is the capital, in the 1960s, primarily as an anti-communist movement, to combat the trade unions that controlled the city's textile mills, railways, and banks. Mr Thackeray, a former cartoonist and writer who changed his Indian name to use that of the English writer he admires, strokes his granddaughter's hair as he flatly denies responsibility for the violence in nearby Dharavi, Asia's largest slum, where members of his organisation threatened Moslems with daggers, forcing them to flee their homes. He insists his men are only responding to the provocation by Moslems. 'If you slap me, why should I not hit back?' he says. The Sena has an estimated strength of 200,000, about 20,000 of whom are actively militant, mostly unemployed youth. Sitting under the picture of a growling tiger which is his party's symbol, he says: 'Every Maharashtrian is a Shiv Sainik (soldier). Jai Maharashtra (Hail Maharashtra)]'. Bombay, India's commercial capital, was the city least prepared for and worst affected by the communal violence that swept India last week. The city, which had previously scorned religious intolerance in other parts of India and prided itself on being India's most cosmopolitan and secular, came to a grinding halt for four days last week, as bloody clashes between Moslems and Hindus left 215 dead and more than 1,000 injured, the highest toll for any place in India (the country-wide toll was more than 1,100). More than the business losses of an estimated Rs5bn (Pounds 110m) incurred in Bombay last week. The events shattered the myth that Bombay was aloof from politics and caste, unconcerned about anything but commerce. The city's stunned residents were forced to accept that under Bombay's cosmopolitan veneer lay a volatile mix of social tensions and communal polarisation. Reports that over 150 deaths had been the result of indiscriminate police firing, suggest a breakdown of the rule of law, with the police openly exhibiting their sympathy to the Shiv Sena cause. Eyewitnesses and the bodies of victims in morgues and hospitals testify that police shot people, mostly Moslems, in the head and chest, aiming to kill rather than disperse the mobs as they claimed. While much of the violence wasconfined to the slums, buses were burnt and windscreens smashed in affluent residential areas like the suburb of Bandra. 'Violence was something we'd only read about in the papers, it never happened to us on our way to work,' said Mr Ajit Dayal, an investment consultant. What frightened most citizens was the state machinery's failure to control the rioting, which police say started when Moslem processions began flooding the streets protesting at the destruction of the mosque. Mr Sudhakarrao Naik, the chief minister of the state ruled by the Congress (I), took over 40 hours to return to Bombay from a party meeting he was attending in Nagpur. Even Mr Sharad Pawar, the country's defence minister, who comes from the state, admitted after a visit to the worst-hit areas that confidence in the law and order machinery of the state had been badly shaken, and that twice as many Moslems had been killed as Hindus. Mr Shrikant Bapat, the Bombay commissioner of police, was unwilling to accept claims that Moslems were deliberately targeted by his force. He says the violence that broke out in the predominantly Moslem areas of Bhendi Bazaar, Kurla, Govandi, Deonar and Dharavi was more than a spontaneous reaction to the destruction of the shrine in Ayodhya, ascribing it to rivalries in the city's vast underworld network headquartered in these areas. All the Moslem families of a section of sprawling Dharavi (population over 500,000) have been evacuated to safer areas, while Moslems, sometimes with the help of their Hindu neighbours, keep guard in the slum's narrow streets, in the absence of help from the police. Another factor that has contributed to the rift between Hindus and Moslems is the shrinking of job opportunities in the Thane-Belapur-Pune belt, where 77 per cent of Maharashtra's industrial workforce is concentrated. Official estimates reveal that the number of registered educated unemployed youth in the region has grown by 250 per cent in the last decade, as the population continues to grow and industrial units have either closed (as in the case of several textile mills) or been relocated in other areas of the state where labour is cheaper. It is no coincidence that the Sena is strongest here. Sociologists and political analysts say unemployment has contributed to the growing criminalisation in the state. 'It is always easy to blame a member from another community or an outsider for depriving you of a job,' says Mr P Sainath, a Bombay-based newspaper editor. 'The truth is, there are no jobs.' Industrial workers have borne the brunt of the riots in several parts of Bombay. 'We have never seen Bombay going up in smoke like this, and I have lived here for over 50 years,' says Harish Bhau, a floor manager in a textile mill.</p>

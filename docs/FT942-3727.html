			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / World Trade News: New hope for clothes makers - A look at the Caribbean welcome for US tariff plans Caribbean garment producers have greeted with relief proposals by the US government to remove tariffs and quotas on their exports to the US, allowing them to compete freely with Mexican products. The announcement of the US plans by Mr Al Gore, the vice-president, follow a period of significant growth for the Caribbean industry, with the region now the largest single source of US clothing imports. The administration's proposals will be discussed by US legislators, and follow several months of appeals by Caribbean governments for measures to protect their US markets, not only for apparel, from Mexican competition. Most Caribbean Basin governments fear that the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), would enable Mexico to capture valuable markets which the less efficient Caribbean producers had developed in the US and Canada. In announcing the plans for Caribbean Basin clothing imports, Mr Gore said the administration would ask Congress to approve the removal of all tariffs and quotas on textile and clothing imports from the 24 countries which are beneficiaries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. This trade programme, implemented 10 years ago by the US government, allows designated countries to ship some products duty free to the US. However, garments and textiles were excluded from this after pressure from the US industry which feared a flood of cheap imports. 'I am convinced that this initiative will accelerate economic co-operation and growth in the Caribbean region as well as in the United States,' Mr Gore said. Caribbean producers whose exports are valued at Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) per year, and whose industries provide 400,000 jobs in a labour surplus region, have welcomed the US government's proposals. 'This is a very positive development,' said Mr Peter King, chairman of the Central American and Caribbean Textile and Apparel Council, a regional lobby group for the industry. Most of the region's apparel exports to the US are produced under the 807 offshore assembly programme. This allows garments to be assembled in the region from fabric made and cut in the US, and re-exported to the US with duty paid on the value added in assembly. The fears of losing US markets to Mexico led Caribbean Basin governments, with the support of some US legislators, to ask the Nafta partners for 'parity' with Mexico in accessing the US and Canadian markets. Regional trade officials say the US administration's proposals for the garment industry are a welcome indicator that other sectors of Caribbean industry may be treated similarly. Mr Paul Robertson, Jamaica's foreign trade minister, said: 'While this proposal on the garment industry does not constitute the Nafta parity for Caribbean Basin countries which the region had asked for, it represents an enhancement by expanding access to the US market for textile and apparel. 'This is a step in the right direction and we hope that the proposed programme is open-ended and represents a transition to full participation in Nafta.' The growing importance of the clothing sector to the Caribbean has been underscored by recent figures from the Textile and Apparel Council. In the year to March the Caribbean Basin countries overtook major producers such as China and Taiwan to become the leading source of US imports. Caribbean Basin exports to the US in the year were valued at Dollars 4.1bn, representing 14.1 per cent of all US imports, the council said. Hong Kong's share was 13.4 per cent, China's 12.1 per cent, and Taiwan's 7.6 per cent. The leading Caribbean Basin exporter to the US in the year to March was the Dominican Republic, with exports valued at Dollars 1.4bn. There is, however, one dark cloud on the horizon, said Mr King. Significant quantities of garments, mainly from Asia, are labelled as being of Caribbean origin, and are either being shipped through the region or sent directly to the US. 'This illegal trade can do more damage to the Caribbean Basin industry than can any high tariff wall,' said Mr King.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kunming, May 31 (XINHUA) -- Southwest China's Yunnan  Province, rich in hydropower and coal resources, is now engaged  in the construction of power plants and stations, aiming to  become a power base for south China and even the neighboring  countries.    It is estimated that the province has coal deposits of 22.9  billion tons and hydropower resources of 71.16 million kw,  ranking second in the country, and only five percent of these  resources have been explored.    At present, the province is building hydropower stations  along the Lancang and Jinsha Rivers.    By now, two generating units of 500,000 kw have been put  into  operation along the Lancang River. Eight other stations with a  total generating capacity of 15.2 million kw are now under  construction.    According to Yao Qunqin, an engineer at the Kunming  Hydropower Surveying and Design Institute, all eight power  stations along the Lancang River will be finished by 2020.    Along the Jinsha River, 19 cascade hydropower stations with  a  total generating capacity of 75 million kw are also planned to  be built in the next century.    The province also plans to build several new thermal power  plants and enlarge existing ones. Some German and Australian  investors have shown interest in cooperating with the province.    Yao said that the province will become the country's largest  electricity producer by 2020, supplying more than 80 billion kwh  of electricity every year to southern and eastern Chinese  provinces and cities.</p>

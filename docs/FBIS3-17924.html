"It is outrageous to be  trying to influence the developments in Chechnya from Moscow,  not knowing the actual situation and alignment of political  forces here," he told Interfax.    He said he was referring to Shakhray's recommendation  concerning the Russian leadership's contacts with forces  opposing President Dudayev.    "The Chechen leaders' attitude to such recommendations is  far  from positive. They believe that such a position may jeopardize  the recently established dialogue," he added.    "I wouldn't like to think that all this is being done  deliberately. I can say, however, that there is very much in  common between the demands of individual Chechen opposition  leaders and the recommendations of the Russian minister,"  Akbulatov said in conclusion.</p>

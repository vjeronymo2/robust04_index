			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CBS JOINS THE UCLA GAME BROADCAST LATE  </P> <P> Since the North Carolina State-Iowa game went into double overtime, CBS had  little chance of catching the start of the UCLA-North Carolina game. But was it  necessary to miss the first 12 1/2 minutes?  </P> <P> CBS went to a number of commercials and a report on Eddie Sutton quitting as  Kentucky's coach before switching to the UCLA game.  </P> <P> "We have business obligations," CBS spokeswoman Susan Kerr said in New York.  "Commercials are sold as pregame spots, and so they must run before we can go  to game action.  </P> <P> "I think if we would have left the North Carolina State-Iowa game, a lot more  people would have been upset."  </P> <P> A Channel 2 spokeswoman said the station received about two dozen complaints.

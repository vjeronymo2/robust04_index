			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / UK Company News: Two more directors resign from Next TWO MORE directorshave resigned from the board of Next, the fashion retailing group which recently sold its Grattan mail order business to stave off financial ruin. Mr Brian Marber, a non-executive director who runs his own foreign exchange consultancy, resigned because of his 'other business commitments'. However, no explanation was provided for the resignation of Mr John Roberts, the director listed in the company's annual report as being responsible for retail and property services. A short statement from the company said Mr Roberts would remainwith the company for two years in an advisory capacity. The departures follow the resignation of Mr Peter Lomas, finance director, earlier this month. Mr Lomas is to become Grattan's finance and computer services director. Following their departure the Next board will be left with two executive directors and four non-executive directors.</p>

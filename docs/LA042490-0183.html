			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> LIZ TAYLOR'S CONDITION IMPROVES  </P> <P> Elizabeth Taylor, battling her second serious bout with pneumonia in 30 years,  was improving today at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica but breathing with  the help of a ventilator after surgery to determine the cause of her illness.  </P> <P> "The doctors said this morning they are more optimistic about her. We are all  very happy about that," said Lisa Del Favaro of Chen Sam &amp; Associates  public relations in New York.  </P> <P> Del Favaro's reports have been upbeat throughout Taylor's three weeks of  hospitalization, however. The 58-year-old Oscar-winning actress' condition has  deteriorated markedly since what was initially described as a sinus infection.  </P></p>

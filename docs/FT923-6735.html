			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / US fears Bosnian fighting could spread THE US yesterday warned that the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina could soon spread to other parts of the former Yugoslavia, just hours before four people were killed in Sarajevo in the heaviest bombardment of the city in a month. In a veiled reference to the Serb-controlled province of Kosovo, Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the acting secretary of state, said: 'I think there's a real chance that this conflict can spread.' Mr Eagleburger, ambassador to Belgrade from 1977 to 1980, said he was pessimistic about the outcome of next week's London conference on the former Yugoslavia organised by the European Community and United Nations. 'I don't think this tragic situation is gong to end in any short period of time, no matter what we do to try to bring it to an end,' he told the Voice of America radio station. Hopes for peace were further dimmed, last night, by a flare up in fighting across Bosnia. The Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency reported fierce fighting in several districts of Sarajevo. Fighting was also reported in Posavina, the Serb-held enclave near Bosnia's river border with Croatia. Meanwhile, in an apparent attempt to improve Serbia's image in the run-up to the London Conference, Mr Radovan Karadzic, head of Bosnia's Serbs, yesterday admitted Serb forces had carried out ethnic cleansing and vowed to put an end to the policy which has driven hundreds of thousands of Moslem Slavs from their homes. At a press conference in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, Mr Karadzic insisted: 'We must put a stop to ethnic cleansing and punish all persons responsible.' Serb forces, who claim to control 70 per cent of Bosnia, have driven out, imprisoned or killed Moslems in an attempt to create purely Serb territory. Mr Karadzic, however, dismissed reports of forced deportation as 'resettlement which took place at the request of the population wishing to leave an area of high tension'. This was despite reports by western journalists who this week accompanied 1,500 Moslems on a harrowing journey after being expelled from north-western Bosnia by Serb militia. Mr Karadzic also repeated a promise to hand over all Serb-controlled detention camps to the Red Cross and to close all camps after an all-for-all prisoner exchange. Many Moslem refugees have told how Serb militia forced them to sign over their property. But Mr Karadzic said: 'Forceful measures taken against civilians are not part of our policies, although atrocities have taken place on all sides. All property handed over under duress will have to be returned. These documents are invalid.' Mr Karadzic offered a seven-point peace programme, which included the recognition of Bosnian frontiers and a ceasefire. This programme reflects close co-ordination between Serb leaders from Bosnia and the unrecognised Yugoslavia of Serbia and Montenegro. The pledge to recognise Bosnia's borders could enable the reconstituted Yugoslavia to meet one of the demands of the international community in order to lift United Nations sanctions. But recognition would have little meaning since Serb forces have already achieved their territorial goals.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 5 (XINHUA) -- South Korea expressed  regret Thursday [5 May] over the remarks by Japanese Justice  Minister Shigeto Nagano that his country was not an aggressor in  World War II and the war was aimed at liberation of colonies.    The South Korean Government is looking into a real intention  behind Nagano's remarks, a senior Foreign Ministry official said.    The official said that he felt sorry for a cabinet minister  of the Japanese Government intent on a reformist politics and  contribution to the international community to have such a  consciousness of history.    "The remarks might taint efforts by the Japanese people to  redress the past," he maintained.    Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 until Japan's World  War II defeat in 1945.    Nagano stirred the controversy in an interview with the  Japanese national newspaper MAINICHI Tuesday by claiming that  the Pacific war was not a war of aggression and was instead  designed for liberation of colonies and a Greater East Asia  Co-Prosperity Sphere.    He also asserted that the "rape of Nanking" by Japanese  soldiers in 1937 was a hoax. Nanking is presently spelled  Nanjing.    However, new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is on  a visit in France, Wednesday described as "inappropriate"  remarks made by his justice minister dismissing the killing of  an estimated 300,000 Chinese civilians by Japanese troops in  1937 in Nanjing, the Chinese capital then.    "My view on the past history is that our past actions,  including aggression and colonial rule, caused unbearable  suffering and sorrow for many people," Hata said in a brief  statement shortly after arriving in Paris for a two-day official  visit.    Nagano's remarks contrast sharply with the views of Japan's  previous administration, which left office last week. Former  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called World War II "a war of  aggression" and said it was wrong.    Hosokawa reiterated this recognition by Japan when he  visited  China earlier this year.</p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Chrysler up to Dollars 651m as demand soars Chrysler, the smallest of the three big US carmakers, reported a 54 per cent jump in profits for the latest quarter as demand for the company's most popular models in North America continued to outstrip supply. The company's after-tax earnings of Dollars 651m, or Dollars 1.60 a share fully diluted, compared with Dollars 423m, or Dollars 1.04, a year before, about Dollars 100m ahead of Wall Street estimates. The news raised optimism about the North American car market and lifted the shares of rivals General Motors and Ford. The three are expected to report total net income of about Dollars 2bn - more than three times the level of a year ago. Chrysler said it expected demand in the US and Canada to remain strong for the next two years, in spite of the potential dampening of consumer demand caused by the rise in US interest rates this year. Mr Thomas Capo, treasurer, said: 'We believe there has been a lot of pent-up demand in the North American car business over the past couple of years,' and that meeting this demand would sustain sales at higher levels for some time. The strong sales strengthened Chrysler's balance sheet, reinforcing its position as the most financially secure of the big three. 'It's the world turned upside down,' said Mr David Healy, analyst at SG Warburg in New York. 'Three or four years ago, they (Chrysler) were the weak one, and GM was the tower of strength.' The third-quarter jump in profits came on the back of Dollars 11.7bn in sales, up from Dollars 9.7bn a year before. Vehicles sold rose 15 per cent to 593,757. Due to demand, the incentives offered for each vehicle sold fell to Dollars 520, from about Dollars 600 in the second quarter and Dollars 775 a year ago. The advance stems in part from the fact that some of its newer models are category leaders. Its Jeep Grand Cherokee, one of the most sought-after four-wheel drive vehicles, is 'literally sold out', Mr Capo said. Chrysler is adding a third shift next month to lift production. Inventory levels of the Grand Cherokee had fallen to 23 days' supply by the end of September, with fewer in dealers' showrooms, he said. Inventory of the Jeep Wrangler fell to 27 days and the Neon, the company's biggest-selling small car, to 34 days. This compares with normal inventory levels at Chrysler of 60 days for cars and 70 days for trucks. The company said it would add capacity for a further 500,000 vehicles over the next year. However, since this will come mainly from adding additional shifts or retooling, it would add little to fixed costs and only 30,000 vehicles a year to the company's break-even level.

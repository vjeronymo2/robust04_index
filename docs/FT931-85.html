			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: Apple, Honeywell in cockpit deal APPLE Macintosh personal computers will find their way into the cockpits of commercial aircraft as a result of an agreement reached between Apple and Honeywell's Commercial Flight Systems Group. Under the deal, Honeywell will develop an 'electronic library' for use by flight crews, providing 'multi-media' versions of maintenance and operation manuals that incorporate video, graphics and sound as well as text. Honeywell will also make a 'ruggedised' version of Apple's recently-introduced Macintosh Quadra 800 high-performance PC for the cockpit information system. The agreement marks the first time that Apple has licensed its Macintosh computer technology under such an Original Equipment Manufacturer agreement and signals a new strategy by Apple to broaden the markets for its technology. Honeywell said it plans to provide its airline customers with an easy-to-use information system. The cockpit Macintosh computers will also be able to run standard PC software. 'This provides airborne software application compatibility with computer systems on the ground, and should help to incorporate more fully the aircraft into an airline's overall information management system,' said Mr Mark Anderson, Honeywell's lead engineer for the ELS project. The agreement with Honeywell is the first to be reached by a new group formed at Apple. Called 'New Media/New Markets,' the group will focus on opportunities created by the convergence of the publishing, entertainment, telecommunications, computing and consumer electronics businesses, Apple said. 'Apple believes Macintosh personal computing technology can add great value outside the realm of the traditional personal computer market,' said Mr Fred Forsyth, senior vice-president and general manager of the Macintosh Systems Division.' In particular, Apple is targeting areas such as retail, automotive, transportation, medical imaging and aviation.</p>

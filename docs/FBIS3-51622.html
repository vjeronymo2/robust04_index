			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Guillermo Morales] </F>   [Text] At this very moment, Communist Party of Cuba  officials and Havana businessmen are leaving the Cuban Workers  Federation Lazaro Pena Theater where a meeting was held. I could  describe the dialogue between Politburo member Jorge Lezcano and  the businessmen as rough; however, I do believe it will be  worthwhile. During the meeting, Lezcano said that efficiency is  a key factor in the process. Lezcano, first secretary of the  City of Havana Provincial Assembly, analyzed the operations of  the City of Havana enterprises in 1993. He said that of the 462  Havana enterprises, approximately 190 were profitable; however,  160 enterprises reported losses. Lezcano added that the money  owed the state by those enterprises amounts to 2.128 billion  pesos. This is truly a hair-raising figure. Lezcano added that  34 enterprises are facing serious problems. These 34 enterprises  owe 1.24 billion pesos and of this amount, it is quite possible  that 800 million pesos will never be paid back. If to this  inefficiency -- which I personally doubt is caused solely by the  special period -- we were to add the real problems we have,  then, as the commander in chief said, 1993 was truly one of the  most, if not the most difficult year.    We cannot deny we had a poor harvest in 1993, that 23,000  homes were damaged by the storm of the century, and that we were  affected by the neuropathy epidemic; but we must also add that  1,000 doctors joined the capital city work force and we now have  one doctor for every 132 residents of Havana. Please note that  countries like Japan have one doctor for every 660 inhabitants.  In 1993 we also provided daily lunches for 250,000 students.  This equals the daily lunches for a city like Ciego de Avila or  Sancti Spiritus.    Without raising false hopes, Lezcano said that 1994 will not  be like 1993. He said that some sectors will show slight  improvement. In late 1992, early 1993, the country had no oil  and factories had to be halted. We began 1994 with these  factories back in operation. We will continue to experience  power outages and certain limitations; but with the factories  now operating, things will be less difficult this year.    Please note that today we have more experience. I must  recall  and support our commander in chief's words: It is very important  for us to concentrate on economic efficiency. I say that I  support these words, even more so now after hearing what Lezcano  had to say to the Havana businessmen.</p>

			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> GROUP SAYS 2-PARTY SYSTEM IN U.S. CONTRIBUTES TO EROSION OF DEMOCRACY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: RAINBOW LOBBY BELIEVES THE CURE FOR LOW VOTER TURNOUT IS AN EASTERN  EUROPEAN-STYLE OPENING OF POLITICAL ACCESS.  </P> <P> Many Americans have watched the flowering of democracy in Eastern Europe with a  sense of pride. Nancy Ross looks on in frustration and envy.  </P> <P> The outbreak of free elections in Eastern Europe and the multitude of political  parties competing for support have only heightened Ross' conviction that  something is wrong in this country. She argues that the antidote to low voter  turnout, public disgust at negative campaigns and the absence of substantive  debate in campaigns is a little Eastern European-style politics.  </P> <P> Ross, the executive director of the Rainbow Lobby, a small, left-liberal,  grass-roots organization, believes that the two major political parties in this  country have a stranglehold on the process and that their collusion protects  incumbents and freezes candidates with radical or innovative ideas out of the  political dialogue.  </P> <P> Her group is trying to attract attention to a package of proposals that Ross  believes will stimulate interest in the political process. "Our main concern is  the erosion of democracy in this country," she said.  </P> <P> The Rainbow Lobby was organized in 1985 by a number of people who had worked  the year before on Jesse Jackson's presidential campaign (hence the similarity  of the name to the Rainbow Coalition, even though there is no connection).  </P> <P> So far, it has made little dent on the political process and is lightly  regarded on Capitol Hill. And there is nothing to suggest that the current  quest is anything other than quixotic. But for activists like Ross, a former  school board member in New York City and a founder of the New Alliance Party,  hope springs eternal.  </P> <P> Ross argues that the two political parties have "set up the rules to lock  third-party candidates out."  </P> <P> In 1988, for example, a third-party candidate for President had to obtain  674,495 valid petition signatures to be listed on the ballots in all 50 states  and the District of Columbia. Realistically, candidates need to collect twice  that number, because many signatures are ruled invalid. That is 26.5 times the  number needed by a Democratic candidate and 11 times the number needed by a  Republican candidate.  </P> <P> In Florida, third-party candidates not only need 56,000 valid signatures --  each on a separate postcard -- but also must pay 10 cents for each signature  they submit.  </P> <P> The solution, says Ross, is a bill sponsored by Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.)  that is designed to make it easier for independent candidates or third parties  to gain access to the ballot throughout the country by sharply reducing the  number of signatures needed to qualify.  </P> <P> Conyers got interested in the idea from his work on voter registration. He  introduced the bill in the last session of Congress but it got no hearings. The  same fate appears to await the bill this year.  </P> <P> But Julien Epstein, a Conyers aide who is staff director of the House  Government Operations Committee, said recent events in Eastern Europe put the  U.S. system in a new light. "There is a growing sense here that it is time for  imaginative forms of changes and opportunities," he said.  </P> <P> Conyers' bill has been referred to the House Administration Committee, but an  aide to Rep. Al Swift (D-Wash.), chairman of the elections subcommittee, said  no hearings are planned, in part because Swift is "hesitant" to mandate federal  election standards for the states.  </P> <P> Swift also comes from a state with relatively easy ballot access, and the aide  said that he believes the proliferation of candidates on the ballot in the race  to fill the Senate vacancy created by the death of Democrat Henry M. Jackson  led to considerable confusion among voters.  </P> <P> Many political analysts argue that the two-party system in America helps  provide stability to the electoral and governing process. Party primaries help  to filter out unacceptable candidates, and the parties provide checks against  one another's power without bringing about the kind of governmental paralysis  often seen in multiparty systems.  </P> <P> But with the decline of allegiance to the parties by voters and the increased  tendency of candidates to run on their own merits rather than their party's,  outsiders such as Ross see the two parties joining to defend a decaying system.  </P> <P> To encourage a livelier political dialogue, the group wants legislation that  would guarantee a spot in future presidential debates to legitimate independent  or third-party candidates who have qualified for the ballot in at least 40  states and raised at least $500,000.  </P> <P> In 1988, the debates were organized by a commission controlled by the two major  parties. Under the Rainbow Lobby's proposal, the debates would have included  Libertarian Party candidate Ron Paul and New Alliance Party candidate Lenora  Fulani.  </P> <P> Ross has heard many of the arguments against the proliferation of parties and  candidates, but she believes public apathy represents a rejection of the  system, a reality that politicians can no longer ignore.  </P> <P> What would these proposals produce? "You might see something like Eastern  Europe," Ross said. "You might see increased . . . participation. You might see  a greater discussion of issues. It's a scandal that so few people vote."  </P></p>

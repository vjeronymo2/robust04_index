			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE LINE IN THE SAND;  </P> <P> THE FATE OF KUWAIT AND BEYOND  </P> <P> The way the President sometimes comes across, he must think there is nothing  wrong in the Persian Gulf that a little war won't cure. To those at the  Langlois' table, George Bush at times seems a little trigger happy.  </P> <P> They hope he will be patient. Or at least send some of his own sons over there.  </P> <P> Didn't America learn anything during the Cold War? Donna asked: "We won that  one with our endurance. If that one took 40 years, I don't see why we have to  win this one in four months."  </P> <P> Donna's friend Sue Bini had come by for the Thanksgiving meal. She is a parent,  too. The whole crisis reminds her of the way children play in a sandbox.  </P> <P> "You have to teach them," Sue said. "You tell them, 'C'mon, don't fight. You  have to learn to share.'  </P> <P> "Why can't the world be like that?"  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> WARMING: CENTURY'S HOTTEST TOPIC  </P> <P> Global Warming: Are We Entering the Greenhouse Century? by Stephen H. Schneider  (Sierra Club Books: $18.95; 336 pages; illustrated).  </P> <P> If you are in the natural sciences, "global climate change" is just about the  most exciting jingle -- and perhaps the hottest meal ticket -- to hit the  catch-phrase circuit since "survival of the fittest."  </P> <P> And well it should be. For once, a distinct majority of climatologists are in  agreement about the weather prediction: It is -- as you well know unless you  have been off the planet the last couple of years -- a warming trend. A rather  quick one, with no end in sight. And with consequences for humanity and the  remainder of the Earth's fellow travelers that threaten to be rather  interesting.  </P> <P> If I were forced to select but one chronicler for this new adventure we are  undertaking, it would be Stephen Schneider. For a scientist he is too glib; for  a journalist he is too technical. He has a leg firmly insinuated into each camp  -- and that's no pedestrian accomplishment.  </P> <P> Schneider is head of "Interdisciplinary Climate Systems" at the National Center  for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., a National Science  Foundation-sponsored institution that has consistently been at the cutting edge  of research and policy.  </P> <P> A few years back, Schneider co-authored a book -- also published by the Sierra  Club -- entitled "The Co-Evolution of Climate and Life" that offered a  thrilling reconstruction of the Earth's past climates and the newly emerging  science of global future climate modeling for those sufficiently brave to  tackle a little chemistry and some complex graphs. Schneider wasn't afraid to  say to his non-scientific readers, "Come on, work a little and I'll make it  worth your while." And he was right. For serious fans of weather who have  graduated from cumulus and occluded front, it's the best thing in print.  </P> <P> The modest-appearing predicted increases of 3 to 5 degrees (Celsius) over the  next century would be unprecedented in human history. The average increases  obscure the way we will perceive climatic change: more heat waves, more  droughts, more floods, more extreme weather.  </P> <P> Today, scientific, public and -- belatedly -- governmental concern about the  nature and consequences of "the greenhouse effect" is beginning to drive myriad  research programs: If you are a climatologist, you are examining polar ice  cores for evidence of past climates and the gas concentrations that accompanied  them. You are using supercomputers to run increasingly complex models of ocean  and atmospheric circulation and evaporation/condensation cycles that attempt to  factor in changes in the Earth's potential for retaining the sun's heat. And  you are looking at other anthropogenic greenhouse gases -- CFCs, ozone, oxides  of nitrogen -- to try to figure how these may contribute to the equation in the  future.  </P> <P> If you are an agricultural scientist, you may well be using the first uncertain  maps predicting temperature zones and precipitation to estimate changes in the  kinds of crops and their production that will take place in each region.  Meanwhile, foresters are conducting parallel exercises for timber.  </P> <P> If you are an ecologist, you are predicting the distribution of future natural  plant communities, perhaps borrowing data that paleontologists are extracting  from fossil pollen in lake bottoms on the kinds of vegetation that accompanied  past climates, and how fast it could migrate with climatic change.  </P> <P> Plant physiologists are attempting to calculate what stimulating effect  increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may have on plant growth, and the degree  to which increased growth could then transfer carbon from the atmosphere to  plant tissue reservoirs -- a negative-feedback or homeostatic loop.  </P> <P> Conservation biologists, meanwhile, remind their colleagues that the biggest  such carbon pool lies in the tropical rain forests, which are rapidly being  converted back to CO2 (carbon dioxide) themselves, and wonder what the  extinction price of global warming may be as thousands or millions of species  discover their habitats are becoming less habitable and there is no place left  to move.  </P> <P> Oceanographers ponder what dimensions the oceans will assume as they expand  with increasing temperature, and what additional volume may be added by melting  polar ice caps. On the other hand, the enormous mass of the world's oceans may  well absorb some of the greenhouse gases, and may act as a thermal ballast to  slow atmospheric warming.  </P> <P> Regional planners in some places are contemplating the redistribution of  available water through changes in precipitation patterns, while those in  places like San Francisco, New York, Calcutta, Holland or Indonesia nervously  study the oceanographers' estimates of sea-level rise.  </P> <P> The economists, of course, are beginning to add all of the potential costs and  benefits together for each regional and national economy. And they are likewise  starting to weigh the costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which come  mostly from the burning of coal, oil and wood, against the burden of global  climate change. Sociologists wonder what these changes portend for people's  lives, and the political scientists ponder future conflicts arising from  economic or social dislocations.  </P> <P> That's a taste of "Global Warming." Schneider is not certain of the greenhouse  effect, but he's sufficiently convinced -- he provides the evidence that  convinces him -- that he argues forcefully for investing in more research and  better planning. And he is less than kindly toward bureaucrats and politicians  who resisted such efforts during much of the past Administration.  </P> <P> There are plenty of puzzles he leaves unresolved. For example, there is an  excellent correlation in climatic record between past temperatures and levels  of methane and carbon dioxide, but there are also mechanisms by which these  gases could have been the product, rather than the cause, of higher  temperatures. We are almost certainly in between periods of glacial advance and  retreat. There is a link between global activity, but Schneider does not fully  explain this as he summarizes the most popular theories of "intrinsic"  (Earth-bound) and "extrinsic" (solar or orbital fluctuations) forcing of  climatic change.  </P> <P> Granted, this is an exceedingly complex-albeit fasinating-topic. The hottest  years of the century have occurred in the 1980s. Are they the beginnings of the  greenhouse or some other climatic process?  </P> <P> Schneider tantalizes, but remembers his scientific credentials. He does observe  that the best available analyses of global records dating back many decades do  show a regular rise in temperature, but at only half the rate predicted by  levels of the greenhouse gases. Does this invalidate the model?  </P> <P> There is more. A little backpatting history of research and politics provides  levening. A modest chapter suggests how we may mitigate and cope with the  greenhouse century-chiefly by becoming more energy-efficient.  </P> <P> And there are good footnotes and a good index. This is a complex book, but  because Schneider clearly has the gift of gab and a touch of the prophet, it  works and works well.  </P></p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Figures fail to hold D-Mark DEALERS called a halt to Monday's profit-taking against the D-Mark yesterday, pushing the German currency back up against the dollar and most European currencies, writes James Blitz. Few had interpreted Monday's sharp fall in the value of the D-Mark as anything more than position squaring after a sustained rise. Yesterday, the German currency's power was reasserted. It gained  1/2 pfennig against the dollar to close at DM1.6065. In New York the dollar ended at DM1.6097. The D-Mark's rise came in spite of US data which might have suggested that the Federal Reserve was leaning towards a tightening of policy. In particular, US consumer price inflation rose 0.3 per cent in August, against expectations of a 0.1 per cent increase. The story of D-Mark strength dominated an otherwise untidy European session. The German currency was stronger against the French franc, ending at FFr3.487 from a previous FFr3.482. This was in spite of reduced optimism in French money markets about lower rates. Sterling closed unchanged at DM2.4850. Money market dealers increasingly assume that there will be no cut in sterling base rates before the end of this year. But the pound may have been hindered yesterday by slightly disappointing manufacturing output figures. The yen was higher at the start of trading amid signs that Japanese life insurance companies were selling huge quantities of Australian dollars for Japan's currency. The selling pushed the Australian currency down to a new all-time low against its trade weighted index. But the yen's strength did not last long. The currency slipped back against the dollar in Europe as dealers braced themselves for tomorrow's announcement of a fiscal stimulus package by the Japanese authorities. The US dollar closed at Y105.80 from a previous Y106.25. It finished New York trading at Y105.85. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International in London, said currency dealers would be looking for a number of key pointers in the Japanese package. The first was the size of the stimulus. In his view, the market is anticipating a fiscal boost of some 5 trillion yen, with plenty of scope for tax cuts. An announcement of a cut of  1/2 percentage point in the official discount rate is also anticipated, although Mr Hannah thinks this might not take immediate effect. A third key issue will be whether the Japanese authorities set a concrete target for the reduction in the trade surplus. Japanese officials have contradicted each other when asked if this is being considered. Tomorrow's announcements will be a milestone in the medium term outlook for the yen. The recent sharp downturn in the yen has been predicated on the belief that Japan will offer something concrete to President Clinton in Washington next week.</p>

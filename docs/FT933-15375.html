			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Leaders spotlight migrants, nuclear arms and local conflicts Extracts from the text of the Group of Seven political declaration adopted yesterday at the Tokyo Summit: THE PROTECTION of human rights is the obligation of all nations, as affirmed at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna. The increased number of refugees and displaced persons as well as the problems of uncontrolled migration and difficulties confronted by national minorities require urgent attention by the international community, and should be tackled taking account of their root causes. Terrorism, particularly when sponsored by states, poses a grave danger which we will oppose energetically. IN PROMOTING our partnership of co-operation, reforms in the former centralised economies should be further encouraged. We look forward to democratic, stable and economically strong societies in those countries. We firmly support the determined reform efforts by Russia under President Yeltsin and his government. We also look to Russia to promote its diplomacy based on the principle of law and justice and to continue to play constructive and responsible roles in the international community. We also support the reform process in Ukraine and hope that the recent meeting between Presidents Yeltsin and Kravchuk will provide a basis for further improvement of relations between the two countries. ENHANCED co-operation is necessary in combating the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. In particular we: Urge North Korea to retract immediately its decision to withdraw from the NPT, and to fully comply with its non-proliferation obligations, including the implementation of IAEA safeguards agreement and the Joint Declaration on Denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula; Encourage the countries concerned of the former Soviet Union to ensure rapid, safe and secure elimination of nuclear weapons in accordance with current agreements, providing effective assistance to this end; Urge Ukraine to ratify the START Treaty, and Ukraine and Kazakhstan to accede to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states. We also continue our efforts to strengthen the non-proliferation regimes, including the Missile Technology Control Regime, and to establish effective export controls. We reiterate the objectives of universal adherence to the NPT as well as the Treaty's indefinite extension in 1995 and nuclear arms reduction. We also call on those countries that have not done so to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention and to accede to the Biological Weapons Convention. FACED with the rapidly deteriorating situation in former Yugoslavia, we reaffirm our commitment to the territorial integrity of Bosnia-Hercegovina and to a negotiated settlement based on the principles of the London Conference. We cannot agree to a solution dictated by the Serbs and the Croats at the expense of the Bosnian Moslems. We will not accept any territorial solution unless it has the agreement of the three parties. If the Serbs and Croats persist in dismembering Bosnia through changes of border by force or ethnic cleansing, they will place themselves beyond the pale of the international community and cannot expect any economic or commercial assistance, especially reconstruction aid. The UN Security Council Resolutions on safe areas must be implemented fully and immediately to protect the civilian population. We commit ourselves to assist the Secretary-General of the United Nations to implement UN Security Council Resolution 836 by sending troops, by air protection of the UNPROFOR, by financial and logistical contributions or by appropriate diplomatic action. Sanctions should be upheld until the conditions in the relevant Security Council Resolutions are met. Stronger measures are not excluded. The flow of humanitarian aid to Bosnia must be increased. Deeply concerned about the situation in Kosovo, we call on the Serbian government to reverse its decision to expel the CSCE monitors from Kosovo and elsewhere in Serbia and to agree to a significant increase in their numbers. WE FULLY support the efforts to achieve a comprehensive, lasting peace settlement in the Middle East, and call on Israel and the Arab states to take further steps for confidence-building. We reiterate that the Arab boycott should end. We call on Israel to respect its obligations with regard to the occupied territories. We support the efforts of reconstruction in Lebanon. We are determined to keep up the pressure on Iraq and Libya to implement all relevant UN Security Council Resolutions in full.</p>

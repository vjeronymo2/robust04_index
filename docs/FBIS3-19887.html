			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Recorded statement by Ambassador Inal Batu, permanent </F> representative to the United Nations]    [Text] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali today  finally reached the decision we have been waiting for. He has  decided to recommend to the UN Security Council that it approve  Turkey's proposal to send troops to UNPROFOR, [UN Protection  Forces] the peace force in former Yugoslavia.    Naturally, this is a satisfactory development for us. We  have always claimed the following: UN officials themselves have  been stating that there is a shortage of troops in that region.  We, in turn, have proposed sending a force with the aim of  contributing to peace. Our proposal is now deemed appropriate.  We believe that the UN Security Council endorsement of the UN  secretary general's recommendation is a mere formality. We do  not foresee any difficulties in this regard.    This is not the first time Turkey has participated in UN  peace forces. The Turkish Armed Forces have served with  disciple, self-sacrifice, and honor in all previous UN  operations. Those who doubt that the same sense of  responsibility will prevail in former Yugoslavia as well are  mistaken and prejudiced.</p>

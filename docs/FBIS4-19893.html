			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Political Diary" column by Derya Sazak: "Green </F> Siege"]    [Excerpts] The mass "rage" displayed on 10 April by  radical Islamic groups, which used the Gorazde massacre as an  excuse to turn the "Bosnian cause" into antisecular  demonstrations in Ankara and Istanbul, is not a routine  phenomenon.    It is true that Europe and the United States have remained  spectators to the "crimes against humanity" perpetrated for the  past two years against the Bosnian Muslims in the former  Yugoslavia. The Western world, which attempted to absolve the  sins of the "genocide" undertaken by the Nazis during World War  II through films it has been producing since then, is  unfortunately displaying the same indifference now with regard  to Bosnia as well.    Expressing other intentions under the guise of showing  "reaction" on the basis of "humanitarian" reasons, however, is a  deception that goes beyond defending Bosnia. [passage omitted]    The anti-imperialist winds created using the excuse of  Bosnia  and raids against embassies inevitably bring the Iranian example  to mind. The excuse for the occupation of the U.S. Embassy in  Tehran in November 1979 was the "commemoration of the students  who fell during the Shah's rule." The meeting held in front of  the university turned in one moment into an anti-American  demonstration, leading to the occupation of the U.S. Embassy,  which in turn played a pivotal role in the establishment of the  Khomeyni regime. Intellectuals who witnessed the 4 November  demonstrations grasped the significance of the demonstrations  only later, saying that "the appearance of mullahs and their  supporters in the streets for martyred students, who were mostly  leftists, was very surprising." Probably, a large majority of  the people in Turkey, who associated the calls -- issued by  certain television stations to the effect that "all parties are  participating; our people are rushing into Taksim Square in  their masses" -- with the massacre in Bosnia, only realized that  they were deceived by the radicals when they watched the  television news in the evening. If this trend continues, it is  clear that the Prosperity Party will no longer be able to  control such events.    The people of Algeria are now suffering the bitter  consequences of the politicization process brought about by the  Islamic movements by using force whenever necessary. Algeria  has been dragged into a civil war in the hands of fanatics.  [passage omitted]    To be able to uphold the social peace and the democratic  system in the face of the "green siege" around it, in addition  to "stability," Turkey should also display an interest in new  overtures and political formations. State of emergency rules  and military formulas cannot constitute a solution.    Above all, the country's need for a powerful social  democratic platform should be discussed. It is a fact that  radical movements that develop within democracies eliminate the  atmosphere of tolerance when they come to office and put an end  to the freedom of expression. The fanaticism manifested in the  big cities using the excuse of Bosnia -- which thankfully did  not cost the lives of innocent people as in the case of the  Sivas massacre -- should never be forgotten.</p>

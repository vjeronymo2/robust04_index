			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Dispute over Kashmir drags on: Farhan Bokhari charts the impasse between India and Pakistan India and Pakistan have made little progress towards resolving their protracted and often fractious dispute over Kashmir during high-level talks which concluded earlier this week. Mr Sheharyar Khan, the Pakistani foreign secretary, and Mr JN Dixit, his Indian counterpart, met in Islamabad at the weekend after months of prodding and encouragement from western governments, including the Clinton administration. Their intention was to restart their dialogue which was broken off 18 months ago. The meeting was the seventh of its kind since the process of secretary-level talks began over three years ago. However, it was also the most important meeting since it was the first time that India agreed formally to discuss the Kashmir dispute, despite their long-standing argument that the Kashmir issue was a domestic matter. The new approach from both sides not only reflects the changing realities in the region but also the mood of an international community, increasingly concerned over the possibility of an intense and possibly nuclear conflict between the two south Asian countries. Battle-ready troops remain on guard along the disputed Kashmir border, the scene of many protests and incidents during the 46-year conflict between the two countries. Indian officials claim that they could continue the military operation for years without facing pressure to retreat. However, a four-year continuing insurgency of Moslem fighters in Kashmir, where a quarter of a million troops remain deployed, has increasingly become the source of criticism based on claims of human rights violations. The conflict has so far claimed between 7,000 and 10,000 lives, while at least 30,000 people are estimated to have been injured in the fighting. In addition, at least 10,000 Kashmiris are in detention for their alleged involvement in separatist activities. For Pakistan, a country which devotes almost a third of its annual budget to national defence, maintaining such a level of expenditure has become unsustainable due to concerns from many of its leading donors. The newly-elected government of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has publicly stated that it will not compromise the country's vital defence needs. But privately, many officials know that equally vital is the need to reduce expenditure if the country is ever to recover from its chronic deficits. There has also been increasing pressure for the government to allocate more resources to social services, health and welfare. Despite the failure of the latest talks to resolve the Kashmir dispute, both sides have tried to keep open the possibility of future dialogue without any specific timeframe. The breaking point in the talks apparently came after Pakistan said that there could be no further progress unless key Kashmiri leaders who have been imprisoned are released and allowed free access to the international media and diplomats. Furthermore, Pakistan also demanded an easing of repression in Kashmir before any further discussions take place. For his part, Mr Dixit expressed confidence that the fact the two countries decided to discuss the issue was progress. 'It is not necessary that when you are dealing with a complex problem that accomplishments should emerge immediately. It takes time.' In response, Mr Khan said: 'The people of Kashmir should be allowed to breathe and be allowed to put across their point of view.' He reiterated Pakistan's longstanding demand that the only way to resolve the dispute is through a plebiscite which would allow the people of Kashmir to decide if they want to remain within India or rejoin Pakistan. Despite the break-off without a timetable for the resumption of talks, officials and western diplomats are hopeful that the meeting may prove to be a turning point in the dialogue. 'The biggest difference is that there are fresh compulsions on both sides to try to do something,' said one senior Pakistani official. Although there are grounds for optimism, there are equally good reasons to argue against the possibility of substantive progress. Nationalists in both countries are almost certain to resist their governments if there are any signs of a compromise. 'Progress will only come if our leaders say to hell with politics and getting re-elected. We should settle this dispute because that would be the most important contribution to peace,' one Pakistani official said.</p>

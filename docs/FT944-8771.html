			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / People: National Power NATIONAL POWER yesterday announced the first of what will be a growing list of board changes as the bulk of its executive directors move towards retirement. Keith Henry has been appointed chief executive of the electricity generation company. He is chief executive and a long-time employee of Brown &amp; Root, the US-owned engineering, project management and construction group, and will fill the vacuum left by John Baker's appointment as chairman when Sir Trevor Holdsworth retires next April after five years in the position. National Power had little choice but to recruit externally for the job of chief executive, since three of its five executive directors will retire within the next 18 months. Only the finance director, Brian Birkenhead, and the managing director of its international business development operations, Graham Hadley, will remain. John Baker's switch to non-executive chairman will leave him more time to devote to other directorships and to his new post of chairman of the World Energy Council. He will play a strategic role and devote two days a week to National Power. His replacement is an experienced civil engineer. He landed the top job at Brown &amp; Root in 1990, taking responsibility for the group's operations in the UK, Europe, Africa and the former Soviet Union. He has worked for the group for 23 years. The company has also announced that non-executive director Sir David Walker would stand down as a result of his move to become chairman of Morgan Stanley in Europe.</p>

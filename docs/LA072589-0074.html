			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> Oil companies: Amerada Hess said second-quarter profit was $133.5 million,  contrasted with a loss of $23.5 million a year ago. Revenue was $1.5 billion,  up from $883 million a year ago. The New York-based company said refining and  marketing operations recovered, earning $125.5 million for the period,  contrasted with a loss of $6.5 million a year ago. Chicago-based Amoco posted  second-quarter earnings of $497 million, down 26% from last year's results,  which included $136 million in one-time gains. Revenue advanced 11% to $6.8  billion. The results include special charges of $36 million for the period and  noted that a big decline in chemical earnings offset gains in exploration,  production, refining and marketing. Los Angeles-based Arco reported  second-quarter profit of $467 million, up 17% over a year ago. Sales and other  operating revenue totaled $4.3 billion, down 7%. The results reflected strong  worldwide crude markets, record coal production, increased domestic natural gas  production and higher margins for refining and marketing, which offset the  firm's reduced ownership in Lyondell Petrochemical Co. and several planned  maintenance projects. Ashland, Ky.-based Ashland Oil Inc. said third-quarter  earnings were down 23% to $44 million. Sales rose 5% to $57 million. The  company said the decline in profit was largely because of disappointing results  from its engineering and construction segment, which posted a $4-million loss  in the period.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Easier day in the ERM STRAINS in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism eased yesterday, as the French franc rallied against the D-Mark and overnight rates in Ireland came down to substantially lower levels, writes James Blitz. However, dealers continued to question the future of the fixed exchange rate system, amidst growing convictions that the Irish punt will have to be devalued this weekend. The relaxation in tensions was best reflected by the French franc's performance. Dealers had expected Tuesday's plunge through FFr3.40 to the D-Mark to be continued yesterday, but the franc rose to a close of FFr3.388 from a previous FFr3.402. Overnight rates in Ireland also came down to around 30 per cent having been at 75 per cent the previous day, although this level is hardly comfortable for the incumbent Irish government. After two days of acute tension in Europe, several factors combined yesterday to strengthen European currencies against the D-Mark. Although the Bundesbank left the lower rate at which it deals in its money market unchanged at 8.75 per cent, the central bank added more liquidity than expected in its weekly repo. There was profit taking after the French franc's 2 1/2 centime fall in the few days of trading. The approach of the Thanksgiving Day holiday in the US was widely cited as a reason for less market activity. How was yesterday's lull in tensions interpreted? The most pessimistic view was that a new storm could brew soon. One dealer said that nobody should forget how September's run on the Italian lira was preceded by days on which the Bank of Italy was cutting rates and confidently selling its currency. However, according to Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International in London, the volume of selling of French francs in the September crisis was five times what the market has seen this week. And the seasonal timing of these strains leads dealers to think that, at worst, another crisis can be postponed till the New Year. As one analyst put it: 'Foreign exchange traders never hold open positions for long as the end of a year approaches. And far less reason if it is a year in which they have made vast profits.' Dealers believe that a devaluation of the Irish punt is still possible this weekend. According to Mr Mark Brett, an economist at BZW in London, the Irish punt should not, by rights, be a candidate for devaluation because of the economy's intrinsic strength. But sterling's devaluation in September has made the country's exporters uncompetitive compared to its biggest trading partner. Mr Brett also points out that the currency remained below its ERM floor against the Belgian franc of BFr54.025 to the punt yesterday. 'Once a currency is in that position, only a flash of blinding light can save it,' he said.</p>

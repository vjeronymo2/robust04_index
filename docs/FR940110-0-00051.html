			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters opposed the criterion that encouraged applicants to state how partners plan to establish a program of workplace literacy services that can continue after Federal funding ends. Many of these commenters believed this criterion would adversely affect small businesses since they might not have the resources needed to continue a workplace literacy project. Other commenters pointed out that some businesses, especially small businesses, have short-term training needs that can be met during the course of the project and, therefore, would not need to continue the project. Still other commenters thought that because small businesses would not be able to continue a project, this criterion would nullify the five-point preference given for partnerships that include a small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters supported the inclusion of the criterion on commitment and indicated past success with this concept, but suggested that small businesses be exempted. Other commenters believed that expecting business partners to make a commitment to continue a project that is unproven is unreasonable and could scare away potential business partners. These commenters thought that commitment is best sought and obtained during a successful project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters suggested such alternative methods of demonstrating commitment as release time for assessment and training, strategic planning for capacity-building, training business partners to provide workplace literacy, active participation of all partners, or gradual assumption of costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Secretary acknowledges the many helpful comments on this topic. Although proposed &sect;472.22(h)(2) did not involve a commitment to any unforeseeable or unnecessary post-project activities, the Secretary wishes to avoid any implication that this is the case. The Secretary also desires to preserve the competitive preference for partnerships involving small businesses. Accordingly, the selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed &sect;472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in &sect;472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in &sect;472.22(i). Moreover, &sect;472.22(i) makes it clear that plans for continuing workplace literacy after Federal funding ends should be based on realistic forecasts of the literacy needs of partners and should take into consideration a partner's capacity to continue services. To emphasize this point, the criterion now provides a range of examples of practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy, many of which can be carried out by small businesses. The criterion also recognizes the importance of an applicant's commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace specifically during the project itself. These changes are intended to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the commenters while preserving the overall purpose of a selection criterion on commitment. The recently published study Adult Literacy in America points out that some 90 million adults demonstrate low levels of literacy and depicts a society in which the vast majority of Americans do not have the skills needed to earn a living in our increasingly technological society and international marketplace. The Secretary believes that a commitment to institutionalize learning will naturally lead to continuing efforts to promote workplace literacy after Federal funding ends and will assist in transforming American workplaces to meet the challenges of a world market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The selection criterion ``Demonstration and commitment'' in proposed &sect;472.22(h) has been separated into a criterion on ``Demonstration'' in &sect;472.22(h) and a criterion on ``Commitment'' in &sect;472.22(i). The criterion on ``Commitment'' clarifies that applicants are to develop practical strategies for institutionalizing workplace literacy that are based on realistic forecasts of literacy needs and the capacity of partners. The criterion also encourages applicants to demonstrate a commitment to institutionalizing learning in the workplace during the project.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Reporting (&sect;472.30(b))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters expressed the view that a two-page semi-annual performance and financial report would not be overly burdensome. These commenters felt that the data would be a good planning tool, would help projects monitor their progress, and would contribute to the standardization of the workplace literacy program nationwide. Other commenters suggested that the reports be made available at the time of award so that data bases could be designed to facilitate collection. Some commenters strongly advocated quarterly reports that include, in addition to the information the Secretary proposed collecting, a brief update on the success of the project in achieving its objectives. Two commenters recommended annual reporting, one because of the project's cycle for collecting evaluative data and the other because of the possibility that the Department might not have adequate staff resources to use the performance and financial data as intended.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary considered requiring quarterly reports for the National Workplace Literacy Program, but determined that they would be burdensome for grantees. However, the Secretary believes that annual reports would not provide sufficient information to ensure program accountability and ready access to information that is comparable across projects. Grantees will be required to submit brief continuation applications annually in order to receive funding for the second and third year of their projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes that the continuation application and a two-page semi-annual report on progress and total spending for the reporting period will be adequate. The reports will be made available to grantees at the start of their projects to enable them to set up appropriate recordkeeping procedures, and the Department will work with grantees to ensure that reports are used appropriately both to monitor and to improve projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Evaluation (&sect;472.31)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters thought that the requirement for projects to have a third-party evaluator would be expensive, burdensome, or too costly. Several other commenters supported the evaluation requirement because a rigorous evaluation design is essential to demonstrating impact and replicable results and would strengthen projects. One commenter was concerned that tying student learning gains to higher job productivity and performance would not result in reliable or valid measures of the effectiveness of projects because learning gains are not the only conditions affecting these factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Program experience over the life of the National Workplace Literacy Program indicates that a third-party evaluation enhances the quality of a project without being expensive, burdensome, or too costly. The Secretary agrees with the comment that multiple conditions, including learning gains, may contribute to measured improvements in job productivity and performance. This comment supports the need for a rigorous evaluation design that includes, insofar as possible, controls for other variables that may also contribute to the improvements measured. Evaluations of this rigor require highly trained research and evaluation personnel who cannot always be found among staff persons employed within funded projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Start-up Period (&sect;472.32(b))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Numerous commenters supported lengthening the grant period to three years and extending the start-up period. However, one commenter questioned the necessity of a six-month start-up period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The heightened emphasis on demonstration and dissemination activities requires lengthening the grant period to three years, and, as necessary, lengthening the time needed to establish a project before services are provided to adult workers. Although &sect;472.32(b)(1) permits applicants to take up to a six-month start-up period, &sect;472.32(b)(2) requires applicants to ``minimize the start-up period, if any, proposed for their projects.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Changes:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> None.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Continuation of a Project After a Partner Withdraws (&sect;472.34)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter suggested that the regulations specifically apply to business partners. Another commenter thought the regulations favored projects with more than two partners, and requested greater flexibility in the renegotiation of the scope of work of a grant. A commenter suggested that a project be allowed to continue despite the withdrawal of a partner, even if the conditions of &sect;472.34 are not satisfied. One commenter inquired whether all, or only one, of the conditions outlined in &sect;472.34 must be met by withdrawing partners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Discussion:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although each partnership is required to designate one partner as its applicant and grantee, an award is made on the basis of the partnership agreement that is signed by all members of the partnership and that binds the partners to every statement and assurance made in the application, in addition to carrying out their respective roles. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the approved scope of work will continue to be carried out if a partner withdraws, regardless of the type of partner withdrawing or the number of partners in the original partnership. The regulations do not favor projects with more than two partners. Section 472.34(b)(1) allows for the full substitution of a partner even in the case of a two-party partnership so long as the partnership continues to meet the requirement in &sect;472.2(b) that there be at least one education partner and one business or labor partner. The Secretary wishes to point out that the conditions in &sect;472.34 are to be met by the remaining partners. They are not conditions to be met by the withdrawing partners as suggested by the commenter. Moreover, all of the conditions described in &sect;472.34 must be met before the Secretary will allow a project to continue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

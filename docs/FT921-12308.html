			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Small firms get clubbed to death - Is another business network is really necessary? Does Britain need yet another network of business organisations to advise and comfort its struggling small firms community? Tom Moffat, the energetic chairman of the Durham Small Business Club,* is convinced it does. Moffat last week launched a plan for a nationwide network of professionally managed, commercially run small business clubs. He hopes to have 20 member clubs by start-up date on April 1 but he is prepared to go ahead with a dozen. The idea for Small Business Clubs Nationwide is based on the model of the Durham club. Established 11 years ago it now has 400 members, a staff of 20 and turnover in its last year of nearly Pounds 1.2m. There are already several hundred business clubs dotted around the country but most are voluntary, part-time organisations dependent on the enthusiasm and spare time of their managing committees. Some have the backing of local professional firms. Grant Thornton, a medium-sized firm of accountants, supports 16 business clubs. But most of the local clubs wax and wane depending on the level of amateur, local support. Moffat's plan is to put in place a more professionally organised group of clubs which can pay their own way by providing advice and training services to small firms. They would employ full-time staff and would not be subject to the pressures on voluntary organisations. This plan has not met with unbounded enthusiasm from some of the existing organisations in this field. The chambers of commerce, which are to beef up their own national network, have reacted cautiously and are 'watching' developments, says Moffat. The chambers currently have problems enough bringing their own organisation into the 1990s and establishing a working relationship with the newly formed Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) without an additional challenge from an aggressive business club movement. Moffat, who runs a publishing and printing business employing eight people, believes many small firms find the chambers too formal or too expensive to meet their needs. 'Mrs Cannybody making cuddly toys is not catered for,' says Moffat. But the club network he envisages is not just intended to provide a home for the micro-business. Moffat sees their role as providing vital support for the 96 per cent of growing businesses employing fewer than 20 people. He envisages the clubs ultimately forming part of a three-tier support network with start-ups helped by the enterprise agencies, smaller established businesses belonging to a club and larger businesses belonging to a chamber. The chambers reject Moffat's charge that they do not meet the needs of the smaller business. 'Well over 70 per cent of our membership employ fewer than 50 people,' says Ronnie Jacobson, marketing manager at the London Chamber of Commerce. The London chamber charges a minimum annual subscription of Pounds 295 compared with the Pounds 30-Pounds 35 Moffat envisages for businesses which belong to a club in his organisation. But Jacobson says this fee represents good value for money for the chamber's range of services, including a library, help with exports and trade. The Moffat plan would involve founder member clubs paying Pounds 2,500 for a shareholding in Small Business Clubs Nationwide plc. Twenty members are needed to raise the Pounds 50,000 start-up capital required to obtain plc status. The organisation could start on an unincorporated basis with fewer members. Member clubs would also pay Pounds 5 a year for each business member to the central organisation. In return they would share in any profits. Moffat believes the idea will appeal to councils, universities and colleges, TECs chambers of commerce and banks or accountants keen to foster small business networks in their area. The idea for a national network received a mixed response from more than 70 representatives of small business organisations at meetings held in London and Durham last week. About 25 participants said they were interested in the idea in principle. Mike Duckett, business enterprise manager of Shropshire TEC, said he could see few benefits for the end user - the small business  - from the creation of a nationwide network. Shropshire TEC sees its priority as supporting the six business clubs set up in the county by providing backing to the start-up businesses which are club members. Letchworth Business Club, a voluntary organisation with nearly 400 members, was also not convinced that there were sufficient benefits from a nationwide scheme. Regional groupings of clubs might be more appropriate and respond to the local preoccupations of many small firms, said Philip Harkness, chairman. Moffat's plan is ambitious and runs counter to recent trends in small business thinking which have favoured a simplification of the small business support network. Too many competing organisations merely confuse small business owners, this argument goes. But Moffat, an electrical engineer by training, is a determined man. He likes to cite the parallel of Durham County Cricket club, for which he once played and of which he is now a director. Apart from local enthusiasts few people gave much chance of Durham, for its 108 years a minor cricketing county, winning promotion to the first-class county league. But a carefully managed campaign in which Moffat was involved saw Durham win acceptance to first-class cricket in 1990 and its first match at the top level against Lancashire next April. 'People said that was an impossible dream too,' he says. *West Pelton House, West Pelton, Co. Durham, DH9 6SG. Tel. 091 370 2266.</p>

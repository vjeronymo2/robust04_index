			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / BAe leads Pounds 300m satellite contract The government yesterday awarded a Pounds 300m contract for two military communications satellites, with British Aerospace the main contractor. The main sub-contractors are Matra Marconi Space (UK) for the satellite communications equipment, and McDonnell Douglas of the US and Europe's Arianespace for the launch rockets. Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said the Skynet 4 Stage 2 satellites would replace the existing satellites as they approached the end of their operational lives. The satellites will become operational in 1998 and will be for the sole use of the UK's military forces.</p>

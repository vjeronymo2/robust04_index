			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Ducking the price wars Price wars are growing so common in businesses from grocery retailing to personal computers and telecommunications that, for many companies, joining in has become a pre-requisite of survival. However, an article in the current McKinsey Quarterly argues that price wars should - and often can - be avoided. Indeed, it says, preventing them should be a cardinal rule of marketing. Almost invariably, the resulting losses outweigh any gains. For a typical, publicly quoted US company, McKinsey says, a one percentage point cut in prices translates into a 12.3 per cent drop in profit. That fall can be reversed only if sales volumes rise 4 per cent. Yet in most businesses, a 1 per cent price reduction is unlikely to generate more than a 2 per cent increase in sales. Furthermore, price wars rarely squeeze competitors out of the market or discourage new entrants. Instead, they undermine premium pricing structures and discourage consumers from paying a premium for higher quality. McKinsey says most price wars result from misjudgments, not from deliberate strategy. Most are over-hasty reactions to flawed information about what competitors are up to, or a mis-reading of their motives. For instance, an unnamed US food manufacturer recently triggered a price war which destroyed all this year's industry profits because it assumed that a 10 per cent price cut by a competitor was intended to win market share. In fact, the competitor was simply selling off a discontinued line cheaply. As well as ensuring that their commercial intelligence and competitive analysis are sound, companies can avoid price wars by emphasising product benefits to customers. If a price war starts, companies should seek quickly to lock big customers into long-term contracts. If that fails, McKinsey says, the last resort is to match competitors' tactics with aggressive tit-for-tat retaliation.</p>

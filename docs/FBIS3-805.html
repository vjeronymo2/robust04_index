			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  WEEKEND STAR </H6>   Right-Wing Intervention in Bophuthatswana -- "Not one of the  images coming out of Bophuthatswana in this week of mayhem has  been pretty," begins the Johannesburg WEEKEND STAR in English in  its 12-13 March edition in a page-10 editorial. "One element of  the drama which stands out as particularly odious, alongside the  looting and anarchy, is the involvement of the armed right  wing....which took it upon itself to descend, bristling with  weaponry, on Mmabatho and Mafikeng when the Bophuthatswana  crisis was at its height." "Men with rights and duties no  greater than ordinary civilians acted as an arrogant and  dangerous vigilante gang -- a pack of Boere Bronsons," who have  "delusions of military grandeur quite out of kilter with the  realities of South Africa's power balances. There is no moral  basis for their perception of themselves as gun-toting guardians  of a higher cause."  <H6>  SUNDAY TIMES </H6>   Bophuthatswana Crisis, Election -- "South Africa has emerged  from a nerve-stretching week somewhat shaken, but in better  shape to conduct elections," claims the Johannesburg SUNDAY  TIMES in English on 13 March in a page-28 editorial. "The way  has been cleared, apart from some mopping up, for the elections  to be extended into Mr Mangope's erstwhile fiefdom." The South  African Defense Force restored Mangope to power once before and  will not do it again. The SUNDAY TIMES is thankful that  "fortunately, the registration of political parties has closed,  and that ends the negotiation phase of the transition. There is  no longer any need to woo intransigent, tinpot dictators." "As  for the much-touted right-wing threat, it has been halved by the  sorry performance of the white irregular forces, and halved  again by the resignation of Gen Viljoen from the Volksfront  [National Front]."  <H6>  SUNDAY NATION </H6>   `Lesson' From Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg SUNDAY NATION  in  English on 13 March in a page-6 editorial states that "first,  shall we pass our condolences to ALL families and the business  community who lost their beloved ones and property, during the  Bophuthatswana debacle. But we would be failing in our duties  if we did not indicate who is to blame for this saga. It is the  Bophuthatswana Christian Democratic Party (CDP) leader Lucas  Mangope, Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweeging's [Resistance Movement]  (AWB) Eugene Terreblanche, Afrikaner Volksfront's [National  Front] (AVF) General Constand Viljoen and Inkatha Freedom  Party's (IFP) Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi."  <H6>  RAPPORT </H6>   Death of AWB Members in Bophuthatswana -- Johannesburg  RAPPORT in Afrikaans on 13 March in a page-20 editorial condemns  the Afrikaner Resistance Movement's senseless action in  Mmabatho, Bophuthatswana, in which three of its members were  killed recently. The editorial says the AWB action did not only  do that organization harm, but also those whose case it pretends  to be serving. "The corpses in the street were not yet cold  when President Lucas Mangope announced that he had all along  been planning to participate in the elections. The AWB men had  been sent to help in upholding his government." "Have the three  in Mmabatho died in vain? Perhaps not, provided their death has  brought far right factions and their supporters to their  senses." However, "the accusing finger for the Bophuthatswana  debacle also points at the ANC [African National Congress], its  leaders, and its unchecked supporters." In Cape Town, General  Bantu Holomisa enthusiastically announced that Bophuthatswana  has been given a stiff dose of "vitamin ANC," with kwaZulu's  turn next. "Concerned South Africans now have reason to believe  that dishing out `vitamins' is part and parcel of the ANC's  election strategy for the rest of the country." "In such a  climate, if calmness is not restored soon, another din -- a  catastrophe perhaps -- is waiting in every street at any place."  If the AWB is guilty of "hotheaded stupidity," the ANC's  "plundering hordes" are just as guilty. "May all political  parties read the writing of the warning finger of Mmabatho and  take heed."</p>

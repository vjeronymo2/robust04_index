			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Bush rejects Gulf war book 'nit-picking' PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday attacked a book that claims General Colin Powell counselled him against going to war against Iraq, saying it contained made-up quotes and inaccuracies, Peter Riddell writes. 'They are not going to divide (Gen Powell and me),' Mr Bush said in response to questions about the book by Bob Woodward of the Washington Post, The Commanders, which alleges that Gen Powell, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, had serious reservations about the Bush administration's shift last October towards an offensive military strategy against Iraq and favoured a policy of long-term containment through economic and military pressures. Mr Bush said he had not read the book, but some of the incidents described in it were not true. He called it a 'little nit-picking analysis after the fact.' 'I called (Gen Powell) up today and I said, 'If you have any angst, forget about it.' He said, 'I don't',' Mr Bush said. Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said of the Woodward book: 'We're not going to get involved in second-guessing or reviewing the decision-making process here. It went well. We won the war. People are going to write books, people are going to talk to them. We've got the mother of all spin here in 800 pages. We'll probably get more of them.' The White House is determined to maintain Mr Bush's image as a successful war leader and commander-in-chief ahead of next year's presidential re-election campaign. Mr Woodward says Gen Powell was concerned both about Mr Bush's decision, without consultation, to state in early August that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait 'will not stand', and his move in November to order a doubling of US troops in the region. The Washington Post said yesterday the book portrays Mr Bush and his senior advisers as secretive, sometimes indecisive, occasionally impulsive and often at odds with each other.</p>

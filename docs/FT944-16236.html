			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Management: Trying to keep it in the family / A look at the steps taken by a Brazilian company determined not to become a takeover victim When Brazilian pension funds recently snapped up Perdigao, a family-owned meat and poultry company, its main rival Sadia Concordata could afford to look on with more than a hint of self satisfaction. While Perdigao's owners, the Brandalise family, were forced to sell their company in August after running up a large debt, Sadia has pushed through important changes in an attempt to professionalise the relationship between the family owners and the company's management. As in many other Brazilian family companies, Sadia's reforms were prompted by the death of its founder. Attilio Fontana, the son of an Italian immigrant, died in 1989 leaving the company in the hands of nine different family groups but without a clear power structure. This has become a common problem as many Brazilian companies were founded by European immigrants or their offspring - mainly Italian, Portuguese or German - during the country's rapid industrial growth of the 1950s and 1960s. In recent years many of those founders have died, provoking bitter rows among heirs that sometimes end up in long-running legal battles for control. At the same time, the cosy world of many Brazilian companies has ended with falling import duties leading to increased foreign competition. These two trends have resulted in a growing number of family companies being sold to investment banks or multinationals. Last year some 330 of them were taken over, compared with just 35 a decade ago, according to management consultant Renato Bernhoeft, who expects the number to reach 400 this year. The changes at Sao Paulo-based Sadia, which has sales of Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.13bn) and 32,000 workers, began to take shape after Attilio Fontana's death. Fontana created Sadia during the second world war and when he died 85 per cent of the firm's shares went to some 50 heirs in nine family groups. Company bosses realised that frictions between the different families combined with low profitability and the firm's top heavy management structure were threatening to undermine the business. The problem was that traditionally only a few family members with senior management jobs had influence on company strategy. With the death of the founder that situation could not continue and old resentments surfaced as some relatives complained about being excluded from company affairs. According to chairman Luiz Furlan, a grandson of Attilio Fontana, what was needed was a shareholding structure that would allow all the family groups to feel involved. The system should also create a clear separation between the status of shareholder and manager as well as lay the foundations for a management restructuring. 'We were determined to turn Sadia into a highly professional and international company that could take advantage of growing export opportunities in Argentina and the Mercosur free-trade area,' says Furlan. The company called in Bernhoeft to advise on changes. After discussion among the various family groups a shareholders' agreement was signed and from the beginning of last year a new shareholders board, a kind of family council, began meeting. A representative from each of the nine family groups attends fortnightly council meetings that discuss company strategy. The council acts as a two-way communication channel between the families and the company. The council is also responsible for relations with the media and the important role, in Brazil's highly regulated environment, of relations with the federal and state governments. Under Fontana the board of directors had been made up of sons, nephews and other relatives holding executive positions in Sadia. Bernhoeft says the council idea is drawn from some developments in family companies in continental Europe, from where many founders of Brazilian companies emigrated, but is not based on any specific model. 'The idea is that the council initially serves as a forum for resolving family problems and then evolves more into a board supervising the company's operations,' he says. It took a year of discussions to create the new council and shareholders' agreement as a lot of suspicions between family groups had to be overcome, Furlan claims. The shareholders' agreement is the rulebook underpinning the new structure. It attempts to defuse potential problems by detailing the process for family members that want to sell their stake, as well as laying down rules intended to prevent family executives taking advantage of their position as shareholders by, for example, using company chauffeurs for non-business activities. These reforms have been accompanied by a gradual replacement of family members in senior positions and, earlier this year, by a broad management restructuring that reduced the number of executive hierarchies and turned Sadia's 19 subsidiaries, scattered throughout Brazil, into four business units representing the company's main areas of meat, processed products, cereals and international operations. Like many Brazilian family companies, until recently Sadia's senior management positions were staffed mostly by relatives of the founder. But today only 10 per cent of the 40-50 senior manages are shareholders and only one of the four business units is headed by a family member. 'When we introduced the changes it was decided that in the interests of performance the shareholders should no longer be entitled to employment,' says Furlan, a graduate of the Insead business school. He gives the example of Sadia's new finance director, a Stanford-educated executive brought in from Brazil's pulp company Suzano. The appointment, though not the first finance director from outside the family, was approved unanimously by the council, says Furlan. According to Paulo Vanka, a partner at consultants Price Waterhouse in Sao Paulo, appointing a financial director from outside the family is often the hardest decision for companies: 'With Brazil's extremely high inflation, financial director has traditionally been perhaps the most important post'. However, the Fontana family maintains control of the top two positions, with Furlan as chairman and his cousin Walter Fontana as chief executive of the new management structure, which was introduced in April after a report by McKinsey consultants. The management changes were brought in to speed up decisions and increase efficiency. Previously, the semi-autonomous subsidiaries had created layers of bureaucracy that slowed decision making and the company hopes that their fusion into four business units, as well as the abolition of the seven vice-presidential positions, will create a leaner and more operationally-efficient company ready to expand. Sadia's strategy of reforming the shareholder structure, introducing clear rules for the separation of shareholder and management responsibilities and keeping family members in the chairman and chief executive positions is a model that has been adopted by other companies. Some firms, however, have made the mistake of introducing radical management changes without first establishing the responsibilities and duties of family shareholders and management. Renato Bernhoeft describes a company controlled by three families in the state of Sao Paulo that, faced with falling profits, brought in an executive from a multinational as president. 'The guy resigned after three months because the families kept interfering and there was no structure designating responsibilities,' says Bernhoeft. Furlan notes that Sadia never considered removing the family entirely from the company's management. 'We are proud to be a family company. Relatives, if they are competent, can be a motor and not a millstone,' he declares.</p>

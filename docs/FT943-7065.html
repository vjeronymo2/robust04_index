			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / W H Smith confident on book law change: Charges reduce annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 83m WH Smith, the retailing group, said yesterday it was confident it could withstand the possible removal of the net book agreement, which keeps book prices at fixed levels in the UK. It also reported a fall in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 113.8m to Pounds 83.4m. Sir Malcolm Field, chief executive, said last week's decision by the Office of Fair Trading to refer the net book agreement to the restrictive practices court was not a cause for concern. 'We have not got hard figures as to what life would be like without the agreement. What we have got is a strategy for prospering without it,' he said. WH Smith had experience of a price-competitive book market in the US, and was confident of recouping lost gross margin by increasing UK market share, if price-cutting were legalised. The full-year results were hit by exceptional costs of Pounds 36.6m for rationalisation of Do It All, the DIY joint venture with Boots, denting an otherwise encouraging performance. Adding back those costs and Pounds 6m of restructuring charges for the WH Smith chain - offset by Pounds 1.2m profits on disposals - underlying pre-tax profits were up 13 per cent at Pounds 124.8m. Sir Malcolm said capital expenditure would be a record Pounds 140m this year. Some Pounds 50m would be spent on adding 230,000 sq ft of selling space to the existing 3.5m sq ft. Group sales for the 52 weeks to May 28 increased 5.6 per cent to Pounds 2.44bn. Since then sales and profits were 'marginally ahead', in spite of consumer caution. Sales in the UK retail division, including WH Smith, Waterstones, Our Price and Virgin, increased 4.8 per cent to Pounds 1.35bn, with operating profits up 9.1 per cent to Pounds 93.8m. Losses at Do It All fell from Pounds 14.3m to Pounds 10.5m. The chain is being reduced to a 'core' of 137 stores and is expected to return to profit next year. Profits in the distribution business rose 13.6 per cent to Pounds 37.7m, on sales up 5.9 per cent at Pounds 1.02bn. In the US, sales grew 11.3 per cent to Pounds 223m, and profits 7.3 per cent to Pounds 11.8m. The group plans to expand Waterstones in the US. A final dividend of 10.4p lifts the total payout 8.5 per cent to 15.4p. Earnings per share, after exceptional items, fell from 31.1p to 20.2p. Lex, Page 14</p>

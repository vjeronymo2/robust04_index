			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Italian Northern League ideologue Gianfranco </F> Miglio by Mario Avagliano in Como; date not given: "Miglio:  The Italian Popular Party Must Decide" -- first paragraph is  L'INFORMAZIONE introduction]    [Text] And now Palazzo Chigi [prime minister's seat]? "Of  course." Will [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi get the job?  "It is extremely likely. There are no problems as far as we  are concerned." Senator Gianfranco Miglio, the ideologue of the  Northern League, comfortably relaxed in a velvet armchair in his  beautiful house in Como, answers the questions in a friendly  way. He returned to Lombardy yesterday morning, after the long  marathon of electing the Chamber of Deputies speaker.    [Avagliano] Were you excited to see a member of the Northern  League elected speaker?    [Miglio] No. I have studied politics for 50 years. I have  become so absorbed in it that I can participate without ever  getting excited.    [Avagliano] You were not even excited over the confrontation  between [outgoing Senate speaker] Spadolini and [newly-elected  Forza Italia Senate speaker] Scognamiglio?    [Miglio] I enjoyed the Senate votevery much. It was  thrilling. Probably not for Spadolini.    [Avagliano] What do you think of the new speaker  Scognamiglio?    [Miglio] He is a well-balanced person. He has experience in  the field of economics and could be a very tactful speaker at  the Senate. Above all, it has been revealed that Spadolini is  not the only person in Italy who could possibly be Senate  speaker. It was a legend. In a democracy a high turnover rate  is the basis of good health.    [Avagliano] What about the new lower house speaker, Irene  Pivetti?    [Miglio] She has a strong character. She will play her part  well, having an elevated ethical conception of her role.  [Northern League Secretary] Bossi made a good choice. He is  always the one who chooses, with absolute authority And then it  is a nice way to patch up the old hostilities between the church  and the League.    [Avagliano] Both the new speakers come from Lombardy. Are  you getting ready to "storm" the institutions, given that  Berlusconi is also from Milan?    [Miglio] Since the League started, it has been evident that  there would be a lot of people from the North. Forza Italia is  also basically a northern movement.    [Avagliano] Do you think that this is positive?    [Miglio] Of course. The strong protest against the First  Republic, which was Roman, came from the North. It is natural  for Roman centralism to be swept away by a wave coming from the  North.    [Avagliano] Berlusconi has opened up to the center. Do you  agree with him?    [Miglio] Some of the former Christian democrats at the  center  have ideas that are similar enough to those of Forza Italia and  the League. However, the current political situation is  anomalous. Christian Democrats embracing Social Communists.    [Avagliano] Why anomalous?    [Miglio] It is a mortal embrace for the PPI [Italian Popular  Party] members. And since there are two poles, they will soon  gravitate into the pole that welcomes them best. We need their  votes to make up a solid majority in the Senate.    [Avagliano] Should [President] Scalfaro resign when the  government has been formed?    [Miglio] The moment will soon come. The SISDE [Intelligence  and Democratic Security Service] judicial proceedings should  reach a turning point before the end of the month and this will  create a very difficult situation. However, it is important  that he first gets everything completed before the new  government starts working.</p>

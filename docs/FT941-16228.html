			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hong Leong gains banking respectability - Quek Leng Chan and the Malaysian conglomerate he heads Mr Quek Leng Chan, head of Malaysia's Hong Leong group of companies, is a renowned gambler. He has been known to wager thousands of dollars on the casino tables. Every Christmas, he is said to take his one holiday of the year - in Las Vegas. But in business, Mr Quek, a lawyer by training and one of Malaysia's most powerful but reclusive corporate leaders, is regarded as a shrewd and patient planner, interested more in long-term strategy than short-term gains. From modest beginnings in the late 1960s, Hong Leong (HL) has grown into one of the biggest conglomerates in Malaysia. It is involved in virtually every aspect of the country's economy, from the manufacture of roofing tiles and semiconductors to newspapers and property. HL's 10 companies, listed on the Kuala Lumpur stock market, have an annual turnover of more than MDollars 3.4bn (USDollars 1.3bn). Mr Quek also heads a spreading regional empire involved, among other things, in motorcycle manufacturing in China, mining in the Philippines and property and stockbroking in Britain. Now the final touches have been put on a MDollars 1.1bn deal which will make Mr Quek a main force in Malaysia's fast-expanding financial services sector. After protracted negotiations HL has gained control of MUI Bank, a Malaysian bank with 35 retail branches within Malaysia and one in Singapore. An associated finance company, MUI Finance, is also being brought under HL control. 'The acquisition of MUI Bank and Finance is the last piece in HL's corporate structure,' says an analyst. 'HL has gained the respectability associated with retail banking operations and now has the financial muscle to rival any 'hong' in the region.' HL's expansion has been closely associated with the political rise of Mr Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's finance minister. In Malaysia, as with most countries in south-east Asia, politics and business are often closely related. Analysts say Mr Quek backed the finance minister's successful bid late last year for the deputy leadership of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant political party in the country. Mr Anwar is seen as the leader of a new generation of Malays, and the man most likely to succeed Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister for the past 12 years. Last January, HL helped four supporters of Mr Anwar in a MDollars 800m management buy-out of both the New Straits Times, Malaysia's main newspaper and publishing group, and the country's only privately-held TV station. Analysts say Mr Anwar, who would have the final say on a transaction like the MUI deal, has given a big fillip to HL's expansion plans; banking licences are hard to come by in Malaysia. Mr Anwar has denied any favouritism. 'I don't favour any group. As long as everything is in order and it benefits the economy, business proposals will be approved,' he said. Like many of his fellow multi-millionaire Chinese businessmen in south-east Asia, Mr Quek's ancestors were poor immigrants from southern China. The clan first settled in Singapore, where one branch of the family, with the surname Kwek, runs a separate HL group. The bigger, more diversified HL group is headquartered in Kuala Lumpur, under the control of 50-year-old Mr Quek. 'HL is a very Chinese company in that Quek and his family keep tight control on all operations, but the group has highly professional managers at its centre,' says a fellow Chinese businessman. HL's Malaysian operations are divided into three main parts. Construction is headed by Hume Industries, one of Malaysia's biggest building companies. Hume is expanding rapidly in tandem with a massive infrastructure development programme now being undertaken Malaysia. Hume also recently bought an 85 per cent stake in Nanyang press, publishers of Malaysia's highest circulation daily Chinese newspaper. Hong Leong Industries (HLI) manufactures building materials and is also involved in the motorcycle industry, with a 50 per cent share of the Malaysian market. Associated companies are involved in steel production, electronics and packaging. With the acquisition of MUI Bank and Finance, market attention in the coming months is likely to focus on HL Credit (HLC), the financial arm of Mr Quek's empire. Analysts say Mr Quek is likely to use HLC's estimated asset base of MDollars 5bn to become a market leader in Malaysia's fast expanding financial services sector. Most of HL's overseas operations are believed to be held under the Hong Kong-listed Guoco group of companies, with assets estimated at USDollars 3bn. Through Guoco, Mr Quek is a controlling shareholder in the Dao Heng Bank and Overseas Trust Bank in Hong Kong. Associated activities in Hong Kong include insurance and stockbroking. Mr Quek is known as one of biggest players on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange. Analysts say that with the Kuala Lumpur market going up 98 per cent last year, Mr Quek has become considerably richer in recent months - though they hesitate to put a figure on his personal wealth. Meanwhile, HL companies are making handsome profits - Hume's pre-tax profit was MDollars 134m in the year to June 1993 compared to MDollars 103m in the previous period. '1993 was quite a year for Quek Leng Chan,' said a fellow Malaysian businessman. 'He backed the right politician, he became head of a banking empire and shares in his companies raced ahead on the stockmarket. He probably won at the tables as well.'</p>

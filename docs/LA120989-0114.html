			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> $50,000 GRANT GIVES FRESH LIFE TO MARSHLAND  </P> <P> The state Coastal Conservancy on Friday approved a $50,000 grant for studies  aimed at developing a long-range plan for preserving the San Joaquin Marsh, one  of a handful of freshwater wetlands remaining in Southern California.  </P> <P> The grant will be matched by $50,000 from the city of Irvine and $25,000 from  UC Irvine, which owns 202 acres of the 588-acre marshland next to San Diego  Creek in Irvine.  </P> <P> "We are of course very excited about the approval," conservancy project manager  Lisa Ames said. "We are hoping to get started with the studies and plans as  soon as possible, and begin implementing actions in the next few months."  </P> <P> Heightened concern about the fate of the marshland was precipitated by a recent  decision to ban duck hunters from the area.  </P> <P> For years, both UC Irvine and the Irvine Co. leased sections of the wetlands to  hunting clubs, which in turn spent thousands of dollars each year to maintain  the marshland and flood its ponds, allowing vegetation and wildlife to thrive.  </P> <P> But, under pressure from animal welfare activists and residents concerned about  the close proximity of hunting, the city of Irvine decided not to renew the  hunting permits. UC Irvine officials followed suit.  </P> <P> "It left the university in the position of feeling that it would be in the  community's interest that we eliminate hunting on our land as well," said  William Bretz, manager of UC Irvine's reserve land.  </P> <P> The city voted to cover the water bill for two years or until a long-term  solution could be found. But UC Irvine officials have been unable to foot their  portion of the water replacement costs, estimated at about $15,000.  </P> <P> As a result, Bretz said the marsh has suffered this year, with fewer acres of  waterfowl nesting and feeding habitat.  </P> <P> In addition to functioning as a wetlands area, the reserve is one of the few  remaining freshwater marshes along the Pacific Flyway and a stopping place for  migratory waterfowl. The marsh is also home to about 200 species of wildlife.  </P> <P> Before approving the grant, board members of the Coastal Conservancy, a state  agency engaged in coastal restoration, development of urban waterfronts and  agricultural preservation, toured the marsh area Thursday.  </P> <P> The Irvine Co., which owns 300 acres of the wetlands, is expected to deed to  the city its portion. The UC Irvine land is part of a statewide network of  wildlife areas managed by the University of California.  </P> <P> The area is surrounded by Michelson Drive, MacArthur Boulevard, Carlson Avenue  and the San Diego Creek Channel. Although the Irvine Co. will release its  ownership of the marsh, the company plans to spend more than $2.5 million in  the next year for upkeep.  </P> <P> "We hope to begin by the next year or the middle of the year on various upkeep  projects," Irvine Co. spokeswoman Kathleen Campini said. "We have plans that  include making sure that material is removed out the wetlands, that there is an  adequate water supply and that there be a viable drainage system in the area."  </P></p>

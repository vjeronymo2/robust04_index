			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Evening News Panorama" newscast] </F>   [Text] Interior Secretary Jorge Carpizo McGregor has  unexpectedly resigned from the post he assumed on 10 January.  In a letter addressed to the president of the republic, Dr.  Carpizo McGregor explained that his decision to resign was  prompted by a political party's unrelenting attempts to tarnish  the 21 August federal elections.    The Presidency of the republic reported that President  Carlos  Salinas asked Interior Secretary Carpizo McGregor to reconsider  his resignation. They talked for several hours in President  Salinas' office, but no agreement was reached. The president of  Mexico said he hopes Dr. Carpizo reconsiders his decision, and  Dr. Carpizo responded: "Give me some time, Mr. President. We  will discuss this issue again this weekend." This is the  current state of affairs.    There have been reactions from several officials following  Carpizo's resignation. The National Executive Committee of the  National Action Party [PAN] regretted Dr. Carpizo's decision and  asked him to reconsider his decision. PAN Mexican presidential  candidate Diego Fernandez de Zevallos echoed this request.    [Begin Fernandez de Zevallos recording] As a citizen and as  PAN Mexican presidential candidate, I ask Dr. Carpizo McGregor  to withdraw his resignation for the good of Mexico. I make this  request considering my perception of Dr. Carpizo McGregor as an  exemplary citizen and an honest official who must continue at  the Interior Secretariat for Mexico's well-being. Thank you,  that is all. [end recording]    PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] presidential  candidate Cuahutemoc Cardenas Solorzano also spoke about  Carpizo's resignation. Cardenas is currently in Tuxtla  Gutierrez, Chiapas State. He demanded that Jorge Carpizo  McGregor explain his reasons for resigning from his post of  interior secretary, which includes his post as president of the  General Council of the Federal Electoral Institute.</p>

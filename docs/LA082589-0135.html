			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> A Vista man pleaded guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge related to two  anti-abortion demonstrations at medical offices last spring.  </P> <P> William R. Lehman Jr. pleaded guilty to one count of violating a federal court  order that forbids illegal demonstrations by anti-abortion protesters.  </P> <P> In the plea bargain, which was accepted by Municipal Judge Gale E. Kaneshiro,  Lehman will be placed on probation for three years and receive a suspended  sentence of 90 days in jail if he follows guidelines similar to those outlined  in a federal court order issued in March.  </P> <P> Lehman is ordered not to trespass, blockade, or direct others to participate in  these activities, according Deputy City Atty. Lauri Stock, the prosecutor.  </P> <P> "It should be very clear to Mr. Lehman what he should and should not do," Stock  said.  </P> <P> Lehman will also be required to complete 180 hours of community service.  </P> <P> In exchange for his plea, the city attorney's office will drop conspiracy  charges against Lehman, and it will not file a charge of resisting arrest.  </P> <P> "I'm pleased with the result of the negotiations with Mr. Lehman," said Stock,  who emphasized that Lehman's right to free speech was not being compromised.  </P> <P> Lehman, who was acting as his own attorney, refused to comment on the matter.  </P> <P> The defendant, who in court this week disavowed any affiliation with Operation  Rescue, was one of eight demonstrators being charged with conspiracy by the  city. In this case and the others, prosecutors allege that the eight conspired  April 7 to break laws, one day before a demonstration at a Hillcrest Medical  Center.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, jury selection began Thursday in Municipal Court for two of Lehman's  co-defendants charged with conspiracy. Their trial is expected to last about  one month.  </P></p>

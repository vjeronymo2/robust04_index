			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent registers a progressive recovery BOURSES showed a modestly progressive recovery yesterday, measured by half-hourly gains on the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index which an improved start for Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT recovered nearly all of Monday's losses as domestic institutions and officialdom reconsidered the implications of the CDU's Rhineland Palatinate election defeat on Sunday, and as the market digested results from Daimler and Siemens (on Monday) and Hoechst yesterday. There was also some speculation in industrials after Germany's constitutional court ruled that compensation should be paid to former owners of east German property seized under 1945-49 Soviet military occupation. Reversing the pattern of Monday's declines, a modest rise in the FAZ index, 5.73 to 676.76, was followed by a 25.14, or 1.6 per cent gain in the DAX to 1,597.05 at the close. Volume rose from DM5bn to DM6bn, reflecting domestic institutional buying. Daimler led carmakers up with a DM15 rise to DM695.50. Ms Barbara Altmann, of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said buyers were more interested in the higher dollar, and the big exporter's recovery prospects, than last year's fall in profits. Siemens rose DM14.20 to DM597.50 although some pundits were forecasting lower profits for the current year on Monday. Hoechst held its DM13 dividend, and rose DM7.80 to DM264.50. Its former parent, IG Farben, the shell of the giant which grouped Germany's chemical industry before and during World War II, rose DM3.20 or 12.4 per cent to DM29 on the land compensation court ruling. PARIS started the new account on a firm footing but turnover showed no significant improvement, which raised doubts that the recovery would persist. The CAC-40 index rose 14.63 or 0.8 per cent to close at 1,781.83 on volume estimated at around FFr2bn. Alcatel, which lost ground towards the close of the previous account, recovered FFr9 to FFr577 with 322,515 shares traded, and Peugeot added FFr7 to FFr550 with 152,925 shares exchanged. Among the second-liners, Moulinex, which is thought to have a rights issue in prospect, jumped FFr8 or 6.8 per cent to FFr125.50 with 76,400 shares traded. Carrefour went against the market, losing FFr6 to FFr3,720 following its unconvincing general meeting on Monday. MILAN had a repeat performance of the previous day, with continued profit-taking in the insurance and banking sectors and further gains in shares controlled by Mr Carlo de Benedetti. The Comit index fell 2.82 to 593.17 in volume estimated at slightly above Monday's meagre L138bn. Mediobanca fell L25 to L16,190 and Generali lost L200 to L37,900. Cir, Mr De Benedetti's holding company, gained L50 to L2,660 in spite of a one-day delay in the talks with Mr Silvio Berlusconi on resolving their dispute for control of Mondadori. Olivetti, the computer manufacturer, advanced L25 to L3,870. ZURICH moved on the Frankfurt market, the Credit Suisse index closing 4.8 higher at 554.8. There was some foreign buying but volume, overall, held at a modest level, reflecting the lack of movement in interest rates, and gyrations in the dollar after central bank intervention. Among chemicals, Ciba-Geigy registered rose SFr70 to SFr2,510. The company said that the effects of the strong dollar will not show until the second half of this year. STOCKHOLM recovered from a weak opening to close mostly unchanged after a choppy session. Share prices rose, and domestic interest rates eased, on relief that the revised national 1991/92 budget did not contain any surprises. The Affarsvarlden general index advanced 8.6 to 1,066.7 and volume rose to SKr379m from SKr264m. Ericsson was the most active share. Its free B shares rose SKr6 to SKr198 in volume of SKr55m. SKF free B's were SKr0.50 lower at SKr92.50 after the company reported a 92 per cent decline in pre-tax profit in the first quarter to SKr59m, at the low end of expectations. MADRID rose and the stronger dollar gave an extra lift to issues with ADR facilities. Repsol closed Pta45 higher at Pta2,600, Endesa gained Pta25 to Pta2,435 but Telefonica put on a mere Pta3 to Pta996. The general index closed 1.92 higher at 281.50 in low volume of Pta9.9bn, after Monday's Pta15.4bn. AMSTERDAM was led higher by Royal Dutch which briefly hit an all-time high of Fl 159.10 before closing Fl 2.30 better at Fl 158.40. The equity market was also boosted by the good reception of the new 15-year government bond. The CBS tendency index closed 1.3 or 1.4 per cent firmer at 95.4. OSLO continued its slide in moderate trading, with shipping the weakest sector as the all-share index fell 2.41 to 472.53.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10 am    11 am    Noon     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     Close 1117.75  1118.25  1120.30  1120.45  1121.82  1123.18  1123.29  1122.04  -----------------------------------------------------------------------          Day's High   1124.09         Day's Low   1117.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Apr 22         Apr 19        Apr 18        Apr 17        Apr 16  1112.13        1122.00       1124.98       1126.20       1113.65 Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

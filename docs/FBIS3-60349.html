			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Complete text of article obtained through NIKKEI BIZ </F> DATABASE]    [Text] Beginning in FY94, the Environment Agency will add  seven acid rain monitoring stations over a two-year period to  reinforce its network. Even though it is believed that serious  effects of acid rain have not occurred in Japan, the acid rain  recorded in Japan has been detected to have acidity equivalent  to that in Europe, where serious effects of acid rain have been  reported. The agency expects to monitor the conditions in detail  by strengthening its monitoring system.    Although the locations of the new stations have not been  finalized, they are expected to be established to improve the  monitoring network in some urban areas, some mountainous areas,  and areas on the coastline of the Sea of Japan and the East  China Sea to monitor the effects from China. At the moment,  there are 30 monitoring stations in major cities, on distant  islands, etc., with 10 additional stations to be established  during the current fiscal year. The increase of 7 more stations  beginning in FY94 will make a total of 47 monitoring stations  across Japan.</p>

			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Swiss plan to ease home-buying rules Buying and selling Swiss property will become much easier for foreigners if a plan approved by the cabinet wins acceptance. It would enlarge the number of holiday homes which can be sold to non-nationals and eliminate curbs on foreign residents buying property for their own use. There is no plan to ease restrictions on property purchases by foreigners for investment. This means that some Swiss companies, such as insurance companies, which invest widely in property, will want to continue regulating the number of their shares held by non-Swiss. The plan calls for replacing the criterion of nationality with that of place of residence. A foreigner living in Switzerland or one who had lived in Switzerland in the past for at least five years would no longer face restrictions. For others, the principle of a continually declining national quota for sales of holiday homes would be abolished, and the annual quota would rise to 2,000 permits.</p>

			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Brussels discord on drug price controls Mr Martin Bangemann, European Union industry commissioner, is coming under increasing pressure from Commission colleagues to tone down a long-awaited report calling for the phasing out of direct price controls on pharmaceuticals. In its draft report on the industry, the Commission's industry directorate suggests that EU governments should do away with such controls, and look for alternative ways of limiting health expenditure. But some other commissioners - notably Mr Padraig Flynn, health commissioner  -have asked for further internal discussions on the issue. The report, now unlikely to be tabled until the end of next month, would not tie the hands of governments, but opponents believe it could be used as a weapon by an industry fighting to escape controls. It concludes that price controls have hampered innovation, and thus the long-term growth of the industry. In recent months, big drug companies have dismissed European governments' efforts to curb drugs bills as ineffective and counter-productive. In November, the president of Elf-Sanofi, France's second largest drugs group, warned that drug prices in France had been too low for too long. He urged the government to pay higher prices for innovative products, offset by lower prices for older drugs.</p>

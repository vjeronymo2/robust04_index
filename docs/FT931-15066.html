			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / International Company News: Judge revokes Santander order AN INVESTIGATING judge at Spain's senior monetary court yesterday revoked an order that had forced Banco Santander to post a Pta8bn (Dollars 70.7m) bond as surety against possible fraud charges. Judge Miguel Moreiras, who ordered the bond on December 23, upheld an appeal issued by the bank against the surety but said he would continue investigating an alleged tax avoidance instrument promoted by Santander between 1986 and 1989 called loan assignments. A key element in Santander's appeal had been that the bank could not be investigated over any possible irregularities, and much less post a bond, unless prior charges had been brought against persons who by using the bank's services had sought to avoid taxes. The bank had claimed that the loans assignments were not bound by normal fiscal guidelines on deposits until a government decree specifically made them so in July 1989. Judge Moreiras said he had asked the internal revenue service of the Finance Ministry to define what tributary responsibilities might have been incurred by Santander's customers when they contracted loan assignments with the bank. Since more than 45,000 such assignments took place in the three-year period, the task facing the tax authorities appears to be a lengthy one. Santander said the judge's request to the Finance Ministry was reasonable and the bank expressed its willingness to collaborate in clarifying this matter.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cultural trends in German equity markets Sir, David Waller's report misses two aspects when he lists actions required for overcoming the lack of an 'equity culture' in Germany. First, the leading German banks, including Mr Rolf Breuer's Deutsche Bank, must create incentives for young people to become involved in stock exchanges. For decades, these banks have erected ever higher barriers for young newcomers to these exciting markets. I guess the bankers consider the short-term costs for such programmes too high and they have failed to recognise their primary long-term responsibility. Without a broadly based participation, starting with the young, I cannot see an 'equity culture' developing in Germany. Second, several decades ago, the German government created the 'Volksaktie' when selling, for example, Volkswagen. If the government finally decides again to sell off state enterprises such as Lufthansa, Telekom, etc, I hope it looks to the UK and learns from the series of successful privatisation programmes. Sid could be useful in helping the German government and banks to develop an 'equity culture'. E H Clausson, The Penthouse, 176 Leigham Court Road, London SW16 2RF</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lilley offers Maxwell pensioners Pounds 100m loan THE government yesterday announced measures, including a Pounds 100m interest free loan to pension schemes, to aid pensioners defrauded by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, made the announcement in response to a parliamentary question about steps the government is taking to ease the plight of pensioners. So far, a voluntary trust set up by the government to solicit donations from the individuals and companies who had dealings with Mr Maxwell has collected just under Pounds 6m, far short of the missing Pounds 440m. Mr Lilley said: 'This measure will not close the gap between the Maxwell schemes' assets and liabilities. For that, we still need substantial contributions to the trust.' The government will also defer indefinitely its obligation to collect from the various Maxwell company pension schemes reimbursements for payments to pensioners for the Guaranteed Minimum Pension portion of their individual pensions. The government is paying the GMP portions of pensions for Maxwell pensioners, an amount equal to no more than 20 per cent of each individual's pension entitlement. In announcing its loan the government noted that so far liquidators for the Common Investment Fund operated by Maxwell-controlled Bishopsgate Investment Management have isolated Pounds 136m in assets belonging to pensioners. Yesterday Mr Neil Cooper, partner at Robson Rhodes and liquidator of BIM, gave detailed evidence to a parliamentary select committee about how assets were diverted from the pension schemes. Mr Cooper provided the clearest insight to date about how BIM, under two agreements which it described as 'stock lending', sent assets to securities firms and banks which were then treated as collateral for loans to Mr Maxwell's private interests. He said that Pounds 150m disappeared from the schemes in this way, Pounds 58m of it sent to Credit Suisse and an additional Pounds 51.3m sent to Lehman Brothers International. Mr Cooper told the committee: 'I do not accept that these are stock lending agreements nor that BIM is bound by them.' While he declined to be drawn on the agreements, he noted that BIM was effectively a borrower of Treasury bills from Lehman Brothers under the agreement. BIM, as a fund manager, was not a market maker entitled to borrow stock under conventional stock lending agreements. Mr Cooper also said that an analysis of property investments of the combined pension schemes showed that 21 out of 23 properties were 'inappropriate' for pension fund investment.</p>

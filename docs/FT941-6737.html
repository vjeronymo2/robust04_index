			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Western military alliance fires its first shots in anger: Nato's changing role with the end of the cold war The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is universally regarded as the world's most powerful and best organised military alliance, and is credited with having won the cold war by its successful defence of western Europe against the overwhelming military power of the Soviet bloc. Yet the extraordinary fact is that its strength and resolve had never been tested in actual combat - until yesterday Serb aircraft rushed in where Soviet leaders from Stalin to Gorbachev had feared to tread. The cold war is in fact a classic instance of the old Roman adage, 'if you want peace, prepare for war'. For 40 years Nato filled the north German plain with heavily armed combat units, patrolled the skies and sea lanes of Europe and the north Atlantic with innumerable aircraft and ships, and deployed nuclear weapons of various ranges aimed at Soviet and east European targets. All these forces and equipment were honed with constant exercises, but none of them were actually used, because the Soviet Union never attacked. Of course, individual members of Nato have been involved in military action in various parts of the world, and sometimes several of them together - the most spectacular example in recent times being the Gulf war. But those were not Nato operations. The long experience of training and exercising together in Nato came in very useful: forces were diverted from Nato duties, and various Nato logistical assets such as pipelines or communications equipment were used. But the alliance as such was not involved. Only in the past two years has Nato begun to envisage collective action 'out of area', that is outside the territory, waters and airspace of its member states which it is pledged to defend. It has done so partly in search of a post-cold war role, partly out of awareness that European security is now threatened much more by conflicts within or between the former communist states than by any directly hostile intentions towards Nato members. At Oslo, in June 1992, the alliance offered its services for peacekeeping duties to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which was supposed to become the main regional collective security organisation in Europe under the UN. But events in the Balkans moved too fast for the CSCE to get its act together, and Nato soon found itself dealing directly with the UN, as an instrument through which various Security Council resolutions could be implemented. Since July 1992 a combined Nato-Western European Union taskforce has been policing UN sanctions in the Adriatic, and since November 1992 it has had powers to stop and search ships for this purpose. Nato has also provided the headquarters unit of the UN protection force (Unprofor) in Bosnia. When the Security Council imposed the no-fly zone (NFZ) in Bosnia in October 1992, Nato provided Awacs air surveillance aircraft to monitor it. On March 31, 1993, the Security Council authorised use of force against aircraft violating the NFZ, and on April 2 the North Atlantic Council (Nato's governing body) agreed to provide that force. As Mr Manfred Worner, Nato's secretary-general, said at the time: 'It is the first time that this alliance will run a military operation in practice, not in exercise. It is the first time that this will take place out of our area. It is the first time that it happens in support of a United Nations resolution.' Last June Nato went further, offering 'protective air power in case of attack against Unprofor in the performance of its overall mandate'. In August, and again in January and February, it issued specific threats of air strikes against Serb positions. Although these threats were subject to UN request, they were regarded by many, and notably by the Russians, as going beyond what the Security Council had authorised. But the shooting down, after warning, of aircraft violating the NFZ is clearly within the letter as well as the spirit of Security Council resolutions.</p>

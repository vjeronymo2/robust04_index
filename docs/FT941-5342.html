			<p>940307 FT  07 MAR 94 / International Company News: Bronfman shares lifted by stake speculation Share prices of companies controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family jumped late last week in the wake of reports that Anglo American of South Africa was negotiating to acquire a large stake in the Canadian resources, real estate and financial services empire. Anglo American and the Bronfman group declined to comment, which suggested that the South African conglomerate might invest an initial CDollars 300m (USDollars 227m) in one of the Bronfmans' top holding companies. Anglo, through Minorco, its international resources arm, is said to be interested in Noranda, the Toronto-based mining, forestry and energy group. Noranda shares gained CDollars 1.25 last week to CDollars 26.25. Mr Alf Powis, Noranda's chairman, said that 'there have been conversations between the (Bronfman) group and Anglo American.' However, Mr Powis said he was under the impression that the contacts had been terminated.</p>

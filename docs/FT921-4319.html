			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Living Under The Tories: The state gives to those who have . . . - Budget 92 VOTERS have been living under the Tories for nearly 13 years. But are enough people really better off than they were in 1979 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher swept to power? When her successor fires the starting gun the 'feel-good' factor will play a central role in determining the outcome of the election. If Mr Major is to win he must persuade the voters to lift their heads above the current recessionary gloom and conclude that they are better off now than they have ever been. In today's Budget speech the chancellor must not only promise lower taxes and greater prosperity in the future, he must also persuade the voters that he can deliver on these promises on the basis of his government's record. So what are the facts? Has this been a good decade to live in Britain; and who have been the winners and the losers? The figures on this page provide a simplified snapshot of a far more complex reality. But it does seem that, on average, British households saw their disposable incomes rise faster in the 1980s than elsewhere in Europe. Real household incomes rose by 3 per cent a year, outstripping those in Germany, France, Italy and Spain. In part this was because the pre-tax incomes of British workers grew faster. But the UK government has also shifted the tax system away from taxing income to taxing spending, leaving more money in the pockets of British workers. Value added tax has more than doubled to 17.5 per cent since 1979. But the basic rate of income tax has fallen from 33 per cent to 25 per cent, while the top tax rate is now 40 per cent for earned and unearned alike. That compares with 83 per cent and 98 per cent respectively in 1979. These gains have not been evenly shared. The pre-tax nominal earnings of the richest 10 per cent of male workers rose by 264 per cent between 1979 and 1991 compared with 162 per cent for the lowest-paid 10 per cent. Moreover, official unemployment has doubled from 1.3m in 1979 to 2.6m today. The real living standards of employed people may have risen by 4 per cent last year, but rising unemployment has also meant that average living standards of the population as a whole have declined. Changes to the tax and benefit system have also benefited the rich and not the poor. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculates that the top 50 per cent of households were made better off in real terms in the 11 Tory budgets between 1979 and 1990, while the poorest half of households lost out. The average British household is Pounds 11 a week better off in 1991 prices as a result of tax an benefit changes. The richest 10 per cent have gained Pounds 95 a week while a single unemployed man has lost Pounds 6 a week. For those still in work, however, the 1980s has been a decade of rising real incomes, especially for those on high incomes. Politically, the Tories' calculation must be that the gainers and not the losers will turn the election in their favour. Below we show how four families, all of whom earn above-average incomes, have fared since 1979. For those families the past 12 years have been unambiguously good. The highest-earning family is the clear winner. Its real pre-tax income has risen by 25 per cent since 1979. But the effect of top-rate tax cuts has been to raise its post-tax income, net of mortgage interest payments, by 103 per cent. The percentage of this family's income that is taken in direct taxation has fallen from 47 per cent in 1979 to 38 per cent today. For our two-earner family, post-tax income has risen by 31 per cent since 1979. The pensioner couple's pre-tax income has risen by a mere 5.1 per cent. But tax cuts have boosted their real post-tax income by a healthy 18 per cent. The regional pattern of living-standard gains across Britain are similarly uneven. The wider the shaded area, the greater the gain in real purchasing power - the difference between actual pre-tax income and that required to maintain a fixed living standard. Average nominal incomes have risen fastest in south-east England, but real living standards in the 1980s have risen faster in northern England and Scotland. The south-east was hit earlier by rising house prices. Living costs have risen slowest in Scotland, where the house price boom was more moderate. All of which paints a mixed picture for the Tories. The painful side-effects of the Lawson boom and the subsequent rise in unemployment have been concentrated in Tory marginals in the south and Midlands. Over the past 18 months the sharp fall in southern house prices and in interest rates has boosted the living standards of employed southerners relative to the rest of the country. But try telling that to nervous south-east householders.</p>

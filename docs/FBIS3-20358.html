			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Isaias Gomes Teixeira: "European Marches" -- </F> first paragraph is O INDEPENDENTE introduction]    [Text] Portugal is, finally, going to integrate military  forces within the WEU [Western European Union]. The political  decision has been made; it remains to be seen what means will be  used. Marines, the BMI [Mixed Independent Brigade], and a  warship are the greatest probabilities.    The Portuguese Armed Forces could soon integrate with some  existing European forces within the Western European Union  (WEU). At least this is the political intent of the Ministry of  Defense and should be communicated shortly to our partners in  that alliance. The indication of the specific units which  Portugal intends to make available will be reserved for a later  phase.    For now, three types of means are being considered: the  marines, a warship (essentially a frigate), and the Mixed  Independent Brigade (BMI). The marines would join the  Anglo-Dutch amphibious brigade; the ship would be assigned to  the nonpermanent air-sea force in the Mediterranean; and the BMI  would join the land unit which Italy made available for the  above-mentioned air-sea force. According to the same studies,  the Air Force is the only branch that is not included in the  Defense Ministry's international plans.  <H5>  We Are Present </H5>   Although our Armed Forces have not yet acquired the  financial  and operational capacity to join with these three European  forces, the Portuguese Government wants to immediately establish  a political position within the WEU. At this time, Portugal is  one of the few countries, such as Luxembourg, which are not  participating or have not yet manifested a political will to  participate in these new international forces. Given this  situation, Portugal has practically no influence on the  destinies of the WEU.    Hence the strategy of the Defense Ministry is to state that  it wishes to be present. The means by which it will do so will  be discussed later. Incidentally, many other countries have  followed the same strategy: First state a position and then  negotiate calmly. According to a source in the Defense Ministry,  "when one compares the political statements of the various  European governments with what happens in practice, one is  always surprised." There is the case, for example, of Spain,  which announced some months ago, with pomp and circumstance,  that it would send a brigade to the Eurocorps, but in practice  has only made a battalion available.  <H5>  Explanation </H5>   Meanwhile, it might be asked if Portugal is interested in  the  establishment of a real European defense identity, since this is  what is being created with the appearance of the aforementioned  multinational forces. To better understand this question, let us  see how this said European defense identity was actually born.    With the fall of the Berlin Wall and the consequent  reunification of Germany, the weight of the new country in  Europe became a source of concern for numerous commentators and  also, privately, for many politicians. Would Germany now go its  own way? This was the question everyone was asking.    Naturally, for historical reasons, the country most troubled  by the new strategic situation was France. In a strategy of  "flight to the front," Francois Mitterrand sought to find a way  to bind Germany to its former allies. Within this strategy, the  idea emerged to turn the Franco-German brigade into a real army  corps of 35,000 to 40,000 men, "a large unit with a European  vocation, which would aid in giving the European Union its own  military capacity" and which would be open to other West  European countries. And this came to pass at the La Rochelle  summit, on 21 and 22 May 1992, which brought together Francois  Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl.    The creation of this embryo of the future European army did  not sit at all well with some partners in the Atlantic Alliance:  the United States, England, and the Netherlands, all Atlantic  countries. To these countries, said army corps constituted a  threat to the preservation of trans-Atlantic ties, considering  that France, the godfather of the idea, had always argued that,  in matters of defense, Europe should be truly independent of the  United States.  <H5>  Between Nato and the WEU </H5>   Under pressure from their partners, which included  discussions between Washington and Bonn, France and Germany felt  an obligation to offer an explanation. In their understanding,  the Eurocorps was simply a way for Europe to publicly manifest  its willingness to make a greater contribution to the security  and defense of the Old Continent -- which the United States had  long advocated.    However, the political explanation was not sufficient to put  the Atlantic countries at ease. In December of the same year,  during a NATO summit, the countries of the Eurocorps announced  that the joint army would be under the operational tutelage of  the Saceur [Supreme Allied Commander Europe] (NATO's European  ground command) in the event of a crisis. This was sufficient to  clear the air.    But the danger of the growing hegemony of the continental  countries in matters of European defense was not yet completely  allayed. Hence England and the Netherlands decided to place  their amphibious brigade in the military structure of the WEU,  in an attempt to downgrade the importance of the Eurocorps,  which until then was the only adequately organized force.    From that moment on, other multinational forces began to be  integrated within the WEU. This is the case of the multinational  division formed by Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and  France, and the air-sea force, comprising naval and air  components from France, Italy, and Spain.  <H5>  Portugal on Sidelines </H5>   In all this, Portugal remained on the sidelines. In the  first  phase of the process, the position of Cavaco Silva's government  was understandable. As an Atlantic country, Portugal should make  every effort to see that, in matters of European defense, the  transatlantic ties would not be broken. And, obviously, the  isolated existence of the Eurocorps in the military structure of  the WEU was contributing to bring that about.    But when other military entities with a strong Atlantic  component began to appear within the WEU, it became necessary  for Portugal to take a position, particularly considering that,  at the last NATO summit meeting, the United States itself had  encouraged the Europeans to create those forces.    Accordingly, Portugal has made a political decision: Our  Armed Forces will join some of the already existing European  forces. By what means, it remains to be seen.    And this is where the problems start to arise. Let us begin  with the marines.    As O INDEPENDENTE learned, the Portuguese military have  already had contacts with their British counterparts regarding  the possible integration of our marines in the Anglo-Dutch  amphibious brigade. Although there had been preliminary  discussions, it soon appeared that the British were not too  enthusiastic about the Portuguese offer. The reason is simple.  Portugal has only men to offer. Our marines do not have landing  craft, much less launching platforms, which means that the  "fuzos" [marines] would have to hitch a ride with the British.    There is also a problem with regard to the naval craft for  the Mediterranean air-sea force. According to our sources, the  Navy does not have the financial capacity to maintain two  frigates in operation in international fleets. It is noted that  Portugal already makes a frigate available to the Stanavforlant  [Standing Naval Force Atlantic] fleet.    The same can be said with regard to the BMI. Considering the  Army budget in recent years, it is almost unbelievable that this  branch has the financial capacity to permit its brigade to take  part in exercises in Italy.    In other words, there are "small details" which could make  it  difficult to carry out the Defense Ministry politics -- for  example, to seek to turn the Armed Forces into an instrument of  the foreign policy of the state -- with the means which the  government makes available to the military. Not to say that the  emperor has no clothes.</p>

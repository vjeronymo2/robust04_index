			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / Survey of Aerospace (19): Unprecedented turmoil - Fare wars blight the scene for airlines in the US More than 15 years have passed since deregulation opened the skies above the US to the unrestrained forces of enterprise and competition. By now, the airline industry should have settled down into some kind of equilibrium. Instead, it is in unprecedented turmoil. Barely a week passes without news of another fare war breaking out, an airline delivering a warning of impending losses, or thousands of jobs being cut. In the past four years, the US airline industry has lost nearly Dollars 13bn - more than all the money it has ever made since the invention of powered flight. So what has gone wrong? It is not as though the airlines are short of passengers: last year the number of people carried by US airlines on domestic and international flights rose by 2.6 per cent to a record 487.2m. The trouble is, the big airlines cannot charge a fare high enough to carry them at a profit - and that is because a new breed of low-cost airlines has emerged. Competition from upstart operators is nothing new to the US. When air deregulation came in 1978, many entrepreneurs thought they saw an opportunity to make a profit by starting new services or undercutting fares on existing routes. But almost as many were wrong: as the big carriers fought back and the competition intensified, scores of airlines went bankrupt, most of them small. The economic boom of the late 1980s brought respite for the industry, but it was not to last. With the onset of the Gulf War at the beginning of 1991, passenger demand sagged, and airlines were burdened with surplus capacity. This provided entrepreneurs with an opportunity to pick up assets and staff on the cheap and make another onslaught on the established carriers. This time, however, the entrepreneurs were better prepared. For one thing, they had learned from the mistakes of their predecessors; for another, many were experienced airline employees pensioned off by the big carriers. Still more important, they had a successful model from which to work - that of Southwest Airlines, the phenomenally successful Texas-based carrier. Today, Southwest is by far the most profitable airline in the US and the one that all carriers, big and small, seek to emulate. It succeeds because its costs are so much lower than those of the established airlines. The result is that it can charge permanently low fares on every flight and win more passengers - not just from other airlines, but by encouraging people to fly instead of driving, and by generating demand for travel that would not otherwise exist. How does Southwest do it? Unlike the big airlines with their hub-and-spoke operations, Southwest specialises in short-haul, point-to-point services with frequent flights and fast turnarounds that make intensive use of its staff and aircraft. Its hard-working and enthusiastic employees are much more flexible than those working for the big carriers: flight attendants, for example, clean the passenger cabin while people disembark. And there are few frills: accommodation is all economy class, there are no pre-assigned seats, and the in-flight meal is a soft drink and a bag of nuts. Translated into financial terms, the result is that Southwest, and airlines like it, have operating costs of little more than 7 cents per available seat mile, while the big carriers have operating costs averaging rather more than 9 cents a seat mile - nearly 30 per cent higher. So when the big carriers have to lower fares to compete with smaller carriers muscling in on their routes, they lose money. Faced with the certainty that the small carriers are not going to go away, the big carriers have been left with no choice but to bring their own cost structures down. The effect has been a rash of radical restructurings. Perhaps the most spectacular is the one now being implemented by United Airlines, the biggest US carrier. In July, its shareholders voted to accept a plan thrashed out by its management and workforce under which employees will be given a 55 per cent controlling stake in the airline in exchange for wage cuts and changes in working practices worth Dollars 4.9bn to the company over the next 12 years. United is not the only big US airline to have offered employees a stake in the company in return for labour concessions. Northwest Airlines narrowly avoided bankruptcy in the middle of last year by persuading employees to yield Dollars 886m worth of concessions over three years in return for 33 per cent of its equity (now 26 per cent following a stock offering in March). And last year Trans World Airlines emerged from bankruptcy after trading 45 per cent of its shares for Dollars 660m worth of employee concessions over three years. The advantage of employee buy-outs like these is that, in heavily unionised airlines, they produce labour savings without the strife that might accompany swingeing job cuts. The largely non-union Delta Air Lines, however, has adopted a different strategy: in April it announced that it was cutting up to 15,000 jobs from its world-wide workforce of 73,000 as part of a plan to cut Dollars 2bn a year from operating costs by mid-1997. Soon after Delta's announcement, USAir announced that it was seeking to cut costs by Dollars 1bn a year over the next three years, with half the costs coming from efficiency improvements and the other half coming out of labour costs. USAir, however, is unionised, and it is still in talks with its unions about how the labour cost savings are to be achieved. Meanwhile, Continental Airlines, which last year emerged from its second bankruptcy with a largely non-union workforce, has reacted to the competition by setting up its own low-cost, low-fare operation - nicknamed CALite within the industry. United, with its new cost structure now in place, is planning to do the same with the launch of United Shuttle next month. If one thing is certain about these changes, it is that they not over yet. Indeed, it seems probable that worse is to come. The big carriers cannot continue indefinitely to absorb the losses they are suffering in the fare wars afflicting the market. As the competitive pressures intensify, only those that succeed in adapting to the low-cost environment will survive.</p>

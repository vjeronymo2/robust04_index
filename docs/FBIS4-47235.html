			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. Neyburg: "Joint Ventures in Economy of </F> Southern Part of Republic"]    [Text] As the Republic of Uzbekistan enters the broad  international arena, foreign entrepreneurs have begun showing  great interest in the economy of the southern part of the  republic. Almost 50 joint ventures are now operating in  Surkhandarya Oblast.    One of them is at the Namuna Kolkhoz, which is not far from  the oblast capital. The local confectionery factory that an  Afghan firm is helping establish and operate produces products  of excellent quality.    A chain of stores selling food products to the public has  been opened through the joint efforts of an Iranian  export-import firm under the Buned Foundation and the  Surkhandarya firm Turon. This same route has been taken in  Altynsaye, renowned for its vineyards. Uzbek and American  businessmen have set up a winery there that will produce and  bottle 1 million decaliters annually.    A tannery is being built in Denau in conjunction with  Finnish  entrepreneurs. A medicine plant at the Surkhan factory is also  under construction. The latter project is being carried out in  conjunction with an Indian firm.    Joint enterprises are now producing a very broad mix of  goods  for the consumer market: knitwear, shoes, furniture, and much  more. Even more goods will be produced in the future, as joint  ventures are currently being established with firms from China,  Spain, France, and other countries. Special attention is being  devoted to restoring business ties with the Commonwealth  countries. One confirmation of this is the construction in  Termez, in conjunction with Russia's Radiozavod Production  Association in the city of Aleksandrovsk, of an enterprise that  will produce black-and-white and color Rekord televisions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Military Courier"" program: Video report by </F> Viktor Tkachenko, Gennadiy Makarychev, and Nikolay Zhukov,  identified by caption; figures in brackets denote broadcast time  in GMT in hours, minutes, and seconds]    [Text] [131416] Tkachenko over aerial view of  truck-mounted SS-25 missiles on the move: The Strategic  Missile Forces are Russia's main deterrent. In accordance with  Army reform, they will be allowed to comprise only 1,300  lauchers, all with single warheads, by the year 2005. At  present fourth-generation strategic missiles are used for alert  duty in the Russian Army. Will there be fifth-generation  missiles? What will the missile of the 21st century be like?    Our country's military scientists have carried out a study  of  possible scenarios of strategic nuclear forces' operations and  came to the conclusion that the missile of the 21st century will  be the RS-12M Topol ballistic missile, or SS-25 as it is known  in the West. It is produced in Votkinsk [Udmurtia]. The  autonomous launcher weighs 80 tonnes, the weight of the nose  section is one tonne. The Topol has been used for alert duty  since 1985.    Yu. Fedin, commander of autonomous launch installation,  identified by caption, against the backdrop of an SS-25  missile: Tests of this hardware have been carried out. I  have been involved in testing this hardware since 1983. It is  very, very reliable.    Krondo: Since 1984 600 combat training launches  have been carried out at the Plesetsk test range. In recent  years tests have become much more infrequent in the absence of  funds.    A. Polukhin, deputy commander of the division's duty  forces, identified by caption: It hurts, of course.  Elsewhere people are working flat out, so to speak, and they  are being fully funded. Meanwhile we have been put on starvation  rations. There is no doubt about it, it hurts.    Krondo: How will this reflect on Russia's combat  readiness?    Polukhin: Very badly, there is no other way.    Krondo: Since Russia and its allies in the CIS  have always had and always will have their own regional and  global interests to look after, only the nuclear missile status  can ensure the Russian Federation equitable participation in the  solution of worldwide and regional problems.

			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MSC takes Peel back into the black PEEL HOLDINGS, the property company, yesterday reported a return to profits after taking in a 10 months contribution from the 68 per cent stake in the Manchester Ship Canal Company, which it bought in May last year. Mr John Whittaker, chairman, said the property recession had been deeper and longer than could ever have been expected. Nevertheless, the group sold properties worth Pounds 88.2m at a profit of Pounds 1.3m over book value before expenses. Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31 turned round to Pounds 7m, from losses of Pounds 8.48m which included exceptional provisions of Pounds 6.21m. Earnings per share were 8.12p (losses 5.7p) and the dividend is held at 3p with a final of 2p. Fully diluted assets per share rose from 289p to 306p. Mr Whittaker said that when the property market was approaching its peak in 1989, Peel had taken two steps that recognised the market was overheating. It desisted from new speculative development and started a property sales programme. 'Both these decisions were, as events unfolded, extremely well timed as the failure of so many companies in the last two years has been caused by the evaporation of cashflow,' said Mr Whittaker. Net debt at the year end was Pounds 335.1m, giving gearing of 110.7 per cent, down from 132.7 per cent. The group intends to sell properties to reduce net debt to about Pounds 310m but, in view of the relative strength of the retail investment market, a selective sales approach was to be adopted. Manchester Ship announced that a professional valuation of its lands near Ellesmere Port and Warrington, which might be used as dredging deposit grounds, had given rise to a surplus of Pounds 11.6m over book values. That would be incorporated into the group's accounts at end-December 1992. It also said that Cawoods Container Services, which currently operated at the Ellesmere Port container terminal, had given notice of its wish to withdraw. Manchester Ship received net income of Pounds 640,000 from this operation in 1991. Negotiations for the early termination of the agreement had resulted in exceptional net income of Pounds 2.43m being included in the group's revenue account for the 1992 first quarter. This had the effect of increasing shareholders' funds at March 31 to Pounds 153.9m, against Pounds 137.3m at end-December.</p>

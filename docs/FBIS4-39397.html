			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow June 8 ITAR-TASS -- A monthly poll conducted  by the Association of Political and Economic Experts on order  from "THE NEW DAILY" has revealed that President Boris Yeltsin,  Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov, and First Vice-Premier Oleg  Soskovets are at top of the list of the most influential  politicians in Russia in May.    These leaders scored 54.5, 52.625, and 50.25 points  respectively. They are closely followed by Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin (49.75), Central Bank Governor Viktor Gerashchenko  (48.125), Yeltsin's body-guard chief Aleksandr Korzhakov  (47.75), State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin (47.625), National  Security Council Secretary Oleg Lobov (46.75), Federation  Council Chairman Vladimir Shumeyko (44.5), and the president's  first aide Viktor Ilyushin (44.125).    The list published in today's issue of THE NEW DAILY  comprises 50 names. The newspaper explains that they are the  names of the leading politicians, including the leaders of  parties and political movements, executive and legislative  bodies of power, information and commercial structures in  command of considerable resources and opportunities for making  political and state decisions and ensuring their realization.    According to experts, regional leaders and officials of the  military-industrial complex "are now on the offensive".    "The modest and quiet Rybkin is today's real alternative to  the president," they say. "Unless, of course, the left-wingers  and the patriots agree to support a common candidate, as  proposed by the Communist Party leader Gennadiy Zyuganov. The  largest faction in the State Duma is controlled not by the  Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia (50 deputies), and not by  Russia's Choice (70), but by the coalition of Communists and  Agrarians (100 deputies).    "Sergey Shakhray's rating has not declined as expected"  after  his dismissal from the post of the minister of nationalities and  regional policy, the newspaper says. "Shakhray is an  independent figure and his time is not past," the newspaper  concludes.</p>

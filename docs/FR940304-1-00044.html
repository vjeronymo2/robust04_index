Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On January 16, 1981, as part of its final and interim final regulations implementing section 3001 of RCRA, EPA published an amended list of hazardous wastes from non-specific and specific sources. This list has been amended several times, and is published in &sect;261.31 and &sect;261.32. These wastes are listed as hazardous because they typically and frequently exhibit one or more of the characteristics of hazardous wastes identified in Subpart C of part 261 ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity) or meet the criteria for listing contained in &sect;&sect;261.11(a)(2) or (a)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Individual waste streams may vary, however, depending on raw materials, industrial processes, and other factors. Thus, while a waste that is described in these regulations generally is hazardous, a specific waste from an individual facility meeting the listing description may not be. For this reason, &sect;260.20 and &sect;260.22 provide an exclusion procedure, allowing persons to demonstrate that a specific waste from a particular generating facility should not be regulated as a hazardous waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To have their wastes excluded, petitioners must show that wastes generated at their facilities do not meet any of the criteria for which the wastes were listed. See &sect;260.22(a) and the background documents for the listed wastes. In addition, the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA) of 1984 require the Agency to consider any factors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the waste was listed, if there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous. Accordingly, a petitioner also must demonstrate that the waste does not exhibit any of the hazardous waste characteristics ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , ignitability, reactivity, corrosivity, and toxicity), and must present sufficient information for the Agency to determine whether the waste contains any other toxicants at hazardous levels. See &sect;260.22(a), 42 U.S.C. 6921(f), and the background documents for the listed wastes. Although wastes which are ``delisted'' ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , excluded) have been evaluated to determine whether or not they exhibit any of the characteristics of hazardous waste, generators remain obligated under RCRA to determine whether or not their waste remains non-hazardous based on the hazardous waste characteristics.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, residues from the treatment, storage, or disposal of listed hazardous wastes and mixtures containing listed hazardous wastes are also considered hazardous wastes. See &sect;&sect;261.3 (a)(2)(iv) and (c)(2)(i), referred to as the ``mixture'' and ``derived-from'' rules, respectively. Such wastes are also eligible for exclusion and remain hazardous wastes until excluded. On December 6, 1991, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated the ``mixture/derived from'' rules and remanded them to the Agency on procedural grounds ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Shell Oil Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 950 F.2d 741 (D.C. Cir. 1991)). On March 3, 1992, EPA reinstated the mixture and derived-from rules, and solicited comments on other ways to regulate waste mixtures and residues (57 FR 7628). The Agency plans to address issues related to waste mixtures and residues in a future rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Approach Used To Evaluate This Petition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This petition requests a delisting for a listed hazardous waste. In making the initial delisting determination, the Agency evaluated the petitioned waste against the listing criteria and factors cited in &sect;&sect;261.11(a)(2) and (a)(3). Based on this review, the Agency agreed with the petitioner that the waste is non-hazardous with respect to the original listing criteria. (If the Agency had found, based on this review, that the waste remained hazardous based on the factors for which the waste was originally listed, EPA would have proposed to deny the petition.) EPA then evaluated the waste with respect to other factors or criteria to assess whether there is a reasonable basis to believe that such additional factors could cause the waste to be hazardous. The Agency considered whether the waste is acutely toxic, and considered the toxicity of the constituents, the concentration of the constituents in the waste, their tendency to migrate and to bioaccumulate, their persistence in the environment once released from the waste, plausible and specific types of management of the petitioned waste, the quantities of waste generated, and waste variability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

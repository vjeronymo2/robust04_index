			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Trade News: Germany blocks Astra ulcer drug German drug regulators yesterday decided to ban for a year injectable versions of Losec, the top-selling anti-ulcer drug of the Swedish pharmaceuticals group Astra, despite endorsement of the drug's safety by a European Union expert committee last week. It was the latest move in a six-month battle which has caused sharp fluctuations in the share price of Sweden's biggest company by market capitalisation. Losec is one of the world's top-selling drugs, with 1993 sales of more than Dollars 1.6bn. The German federal regulatory authority, the BAM, has imposed the ban because of worries that Losec can cause blindness. It does not apply to tablet or drip (infusion) versions of Losec. Astra said it was disappointed with the ruling, but noted that German doctors would still be able to give critically ill patients intravenous versions of Losec. The BAM believes infusion treatment by Losec carries less risk of an overdose than injected forms. The company gave figures for injectable sales of Losec in Germany last year at SKr50m (Dollars 6.4m), against total German Losec sales of nearly SKr1bn, and worldwide sales of SKr12.7bn. Germany is Astra's single largest market. Astra said German sales of Losec had not been affected by the scare, which first came to the fore in March. The injectable version of the drug is given only to extremely sick patients unable to take the drug by any other means. This adds to the difficulty of ascertaining whether a patient whose condition worsens is being affected by the drug or by the illness. According to Astra, no other regulatory authority had expressed any concern about the drug. 'We will stand behind the very firm opinion issued by the EU's committee for proprietary medicinal products last week,' it said. The CPMP said no causal link between the intravenous use of Losec and the reported side-effects had been established and there was no case for recommending restrictions on the drug's use. Losec has been the subject of scrutiny by regulatory authorities around the world as a result of evidence suggesting there might be some problems with it. In the UK, for example, it has a 'black triangle' warning doctors to be especially alert for adverse reactions to the drug from patients.</p>

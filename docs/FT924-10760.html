			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: BCCI conclusions leave audit questions unanswered - Andrew Jack examines the lessons to be drawn in the light of the Bingham and Kerry reports IF THERE is one thing which unites the contents of the two reports published this month into the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, it is their lack of completeness. Nowhere is that more the case than on the role of the auditors. The two reports could not be more different. The US Senate sub-committee investigation into BCCI, chaired by John Kerry, offers little not previously reported, and is written in highly inflammatory terms. Some of its conclusions based on the evidence presented are extremely tenuous. Overall, it appears to be soft on those who co-operated with the inquiry and sympathetic to their views, while being fiercely critical of those - such as the Bank of England and Price Waterhouse - which refused to help for whatever reason. For example, much of the chapter on BCCI's accountants bemoans the lack of help offered by Price Waterhouse in London - in contrast to the greater co-operation from the US firm, which said it was party to very little information on the bank. PW in London did not appear before the committee, principally because it is required to maintain confidentiality under UK banking laws. It did offer to meet Kerry's staff in the UK, but apparently Senate rules prevented anyone from travelling abroad. The report's conclusions are correspondingly side-tracked to concentrate on how to force improved disclosure by international accountancy firms to US regulators and investigators. By contrast, one section uncritically refers to the role of Mr Masihur Rahman, BCCI's chief financial officer in London. In testimony to the Kerry committee, he said he did not have access to any of the underlying loan information and related files at BCCI's field offices, and therefore relied on the work of the external auditors to review its records and ensure their truth and accuracy. That says more about the nature of lines of internal control and responsibility within the bank than it does about the role of the auditors. That auditors' responsibilities should be extended is certainly open to debate; that they should know more than the internal management of the company on which they are reporting seems at the very least bizarre. These very issues are raised by the Institute of Internal Auditors in the UK this week, which called for tougher, more independent internal audit controls in response to BCCI. Kerry's report provides tantalising information for those attempting to understand the roles of Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney in the audit of BCCI, if only by virtue of its kitchen-sink approach: it is 780 pages long. The result is unfocused and highly fragmentary, but it does include a number of extracts from auditors' internal working papers not before publicly disclosed. They highlight a series of concerns being raised by PW at least as far back as 1983, including a high concentration of risk in substantial loans to clients, no documentation to support security against loans, and inadequate information on both the nature of the loans and the credit-worthiness and identity of the borrowers. Kerry claims that these comments led to little reform by BCCI's management. Mr Graham Stacy, the technical partner at Price Waterhouse now co-ordinating the firm's BCCI work, indignantly dismisses the significance of these details. 'Of course we knew there were weaknesses. They are found in many banks. It is irresponsible to take a few documents and try to reconstruct the audit from them. We are still absolutely satisfied that we issued proper audit reports.' Readers might expect to find a more sober and informed assessment in the report by Lord Justice Bingham, given the less overtly political operation of the inquiry and its far greater access to documents and individuals. Those looking for comprehensiveness in the Bingham report will still be disappointed. That is not a reflection on the conduct of the inquiry so much as on its limited terms, which were to examine the supervision of BCCI. That meant focusing primarily on the Bank of England, with less emphasis on the auditors. There are certainly some thought-provoking conclusions for auditors. Bingham suggests that use of a single well-qualified audit firm for a complex international banking group would normally be best; that existing professional guidelines need to be tightened with legislation requiring auditors detecting fraud to notify the supervisory bodies of regulated industries; and that there is no difficulty over the existing guidelines on conflicts of interest when appointing the auditor as investigator. One of the most significant passages in Bingham focuses on the vexed question of whether the 1989 BCCI audit report should have been qualified. He says the Bank of England and the Institut Monetaire Luxembourgeois - the Luxembourg bank supervisors - wanted the accounts to be published 'with an unqualified opinion as soon as possible'. The regulators were keen for the firm to remain as auditors. There was concern that resignation or a qualified opinion would inevitably cause the bank to collapse. PW, says Bingham, believed the accounts did show a true and fair view and that BCCI would be a going concern with a Dollars 400m subscription of shares by the government of Abu Dhabi and a series of assurances about management improvements. Mr Stacy adds that the majority shareholder's knowledge of the position of the bank far exceeded the information shown in the accounts, and was a factor in preparing the unqualified audit opinion. Bingham says the the firm made reference to the capital injection in a footnote to the accounts, and drafted an audit opinion which said the accounts had been drawn up on the basis described in the note. The next paragraph began: 'On this basis the consolidated accounts give a true and fair view . . .' Under pressure from BCCI management, 'on this basis' was changed to 'in our opinion'. Bingham says the picture 'was in reality even worse' than that painted by the accounts. He says it seems 'undesirable' that ordinary readers of accounts should not have had known of information such as the continuing uncertainty of some of the major BCCI loans, and that the adverse consequences of disclosure cannot be a reason for not making it. Yet he is unconvinced that existing principles and practice cover the situation of BCCI, and concludes: 'I rather doubt if other auditors, similarly placed, would have acted very differently'. Bingham's comment is not repeated in the conclusion to the report. Instead, he raises the wider question of whether an auditor should report and owe a duty directly to depositors. He argues that such a duty would would not necessarily make auditors more diligent. But he hints that while BCCI does not provide him with the material to recommend any change, there may be a case for it, which would allow compensation to depositors who have lost money as a result of carelessness. This is intriguing given he was one of the House of Lords judges in the Caparo case in 1990, which ruled that an auditor's responsibilities are limited to a client company and to the whole body of shareholders. He does not directly address how greater information should be provided to ordinary readers of accounts. Nor does he discuss whether there is a tension or conflict of interest between audit guidelines and the demands of bank regulators in the preparation of audit opinions. It will be several years before the BCCI legal action gets to court, if it gets that far. Meanwhile, there is certainly a case for re-addressing whether auditors' responsibilities should extend beyond those laid down in Caparo, and the extent to which bank audit guidelines should be revised.</p>

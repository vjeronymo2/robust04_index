NMFS will bill each processor of Research Plan fisheries for bimonthly fee assessments, based on the best available information on retained catches processed during that bimonthly period. Bimonthly fee assessment payments must be in the form of certified check, draft, or money order payable in U.S. currency to ``NOAA-NMFS.'' The Regional Director must receive payment in full within 30 calendar days from the date of issuance of each bimonthly fee assessment bill. Payments will be deposited in the North Pacific Fishery Observer Fund within the U.S. Treasury.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disputed fee assessments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A processor must notify the Regional Director, in writing, within 30 days of issuance of the bimonthly fee assessment bill, if any portion of the bimonthly fee assessment bill is disputed. The processor must pay the undisputed amount of the bimonthly fee assessment bill within 30 days of its issuance, and provide documentation supporting the disputed portion claimed to be under- or over-billed. The Regional Director will review the disputed bimonthly fee assessment bill and the documentation provided by the processor, and will notify the processor of his determination within 60 days of the date of issuance of the disputed bimonthly fee assessment bill. If the Regional Director determines a billing error had occurred, the processor's account will be rectified by credit or issuance of a corrected bimonthly fee assessment bill. If the Regional Director determines that a billing error had not occurred, the balance of the disputed bimonthly fee assessment bill is due within 15 days of issuance of the determination. Late charges will be assessed for payments not received within 15 days. If the processor does not dispute the amount of the bimonthly fee assessment bill within 30 days of its issuance, the bimonthly fee assessment will be final, and will be due to the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Late charges.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NOAA Office of the Comptroller shall assess late charges in the form of interest and administrative charges for late payment of fee assessments. Interest will accrue on the unpaid amount at a percentage rate established by the Federal Reserve Board and applied to funds held by the U.S. Treasury for each 30-day period, or portion thereof, that the payment is overdue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

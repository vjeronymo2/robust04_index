			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BTP calls for Pounds 28m to help complete European jigsaw BTP, the specialist chemicals and industrial group, yesterday announced a Pounds 28.3m rights issue, part of which will be spent on two French adhesives businesses. The 1-for-6 issue at 205p was launched with the group's share price of 252p virtually at an all-time high after outperforming the market by more than 40 per cent in the past year. It closed down 8p. The Pounds 8.8m purchase of Lambiotte and TRL, from Borden France and Sofragraf respectively, will continue the continental expansion of the Mydrin adhesives and textile coatings businesses that was first pushed forward via a rights issue 20 months ago. That funded the Pounds 15.5m purchase of Cerestar, the west German-based adhesives concern. Mr Frank Buckley, chairman and chief executive, said continental activities already extended to Scandinavia and Italy. France was 'the last hole in the European jigsaw'. With an annual operating profit in the new subsidiaries of Pounds 1.41m on sales of Pounds 23m, there was scope to improve margins towards the 9 per cent average for the chemicals division. They would take the continental share of group turnover up to 34 per cent. However, Mr Buckley said the most exciting project, which would take up Pounds 4.5m of the issue proceeds, was the building of a factory near Blackburn to produce preservatives for water-based industrial products. Environmental concerns were pushing many of these products away from solvents, but the water-based alternatives 'have to be preserved because bugs grow in water'. BTP had 60 per cent of the world market for preservatives for cosmetics and toiletries, but this field was tiny compared with industrial applications, he said. The new factory, part of the biocides division, would be additional to the group's normal annual capital spending of about Pounds 5.5m. Another Pounds 9.8m is earmarked for further deals, including a joint venture in India costing about Pounds 4m. Initially the proceeds will wipe out debt of between Pounds 12m and Pounds 13m - gearing of 20 per cent. Mr Buckley said the group would have Pounds 8m to Pounds 9m cash at its March year-end. Analysts are forecasting a rise of less than Pounds 1m in pre-tax profit from last year's Pounds 18m, with earnings per share reduced to about 15.2p (15.81p) by extra shares in issue. The company intends to raise the final dividend to 5.75p, giving an expected total of 8.85p, a 5 per cent rise.</p>

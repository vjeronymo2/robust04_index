			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / International Company News: News Corp lifts dividend 20% as earnings surge NEWS Corporation, the international media group controlled by Mr Rupert Murdoch, has announced a 20 per cent increase in its dividend following continued earnings resurgence for the six months ended December 1992. Net earnings before abnormals almost doubled, to ADollars 490.1m (USDollars 328.7m) from ADollars 252.2m on turnover little changed at ADollars 5.33bn, against ADollars 5.27bn in the same six months a year earlier. News Corp also plans a three-for-one bonus issue and has declared a 1.5 cent a share interim dividend, payable on the bonus shares. That represents a 20 per cent increase on the 5 cents a share interim paid on pre-bonus capital last year. Central to the profits performance was a 22 per cent reduction in interest expenses to ADollars 387.4m and a ADollars 155.8m turnround to a surplus in the contribution from equity investments. Equity-accounted investments - principally British Sky Broadcasting, the UK satellite television venture; Ansett, the Australian airline; and Pacific Magazines and Printing - turned a ADollars 62.7m loss into a ADollars 93.1m profit. News Corp earned higher profits from its newspaper, magazine and inserts and television businesses, but contributions from both film and book publishing operations were weaker. Newspapers remained the largest contributor, with operating income rising 21.7 per cent to ADollars 349.1m. Magazines and inserts lifted income from ADollars 170.7m to ADollars 208.4m, while television rose 29.6 per cent from ADollars 124.4m to ADollars 161.2m. However, income from films more than halved from ADollars 67.7m to ADollars 33.3m and book publishing was down 27.5 per cent at ADollars 113.6m. On a geographic basis, the US remained the company's biggest earnings centre, lifting operating income 4.4 per cent to ADollars 492.7m. News said profits from Fox Broadcasting and Fox Television rose almost 20 per cent, but earnings at Twentieth Century Fox fell 55 per cent. In the UK, operating income rose by 19.1 per cent from Dollars A471.8m to ADollars 207.2m following newspaper cost reductions and circulation increases. Weekly revenues of BSkyB's 50 per cent-owned satellite company were up by 79 per cent. Operating income from Australia and the Pacific Basin region fell by 16.8 per cent to ADollars 167.5m, but operating profits rose 15 per cent at the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post and 28 per cent in Australian metropolitan newspapers. The group's six-month net earnings are arrived at after tax of ADollars 53.5m (against ADollars 12.5m) and depreciation of ADollars 115.1m (ADollars 115.2m). This excluded an abnormal loss of ADollars 37.3m (Dollars 103.1m profit).</p>

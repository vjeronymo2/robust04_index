			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / UK Company News: CIA to sign Italian equity-linking deal CIA GROUP, the USM-quoted London-based media buying and planning group, plans to sign by March an equity-linking deal with the privately-owned Italian media company Medianetwork, joining the two for the purposes of pan-European media buying. CIA intends to issue shares to cover the deal. The initial consideration, worth about Pounds 3m, will give shareholders of Blufin, parent of Medianetwork, about 10 per cent of the enlarged share capital of CIA. That stake could increase to a maximum of 18 per cent, depending on the future profitability of Blufin. Under the agreed terms, Blufin shareholders must keep the shares for a minimum of 2 years; thereafter it will be allowed to sell 20 per cent of its holdings a year. CIA already works informally with other media-buying companies in Europe; this is its first equity-linking deal. CIA's subsidiary, CIA International, was specifically set up to handle accounts of multi-national clients, such as Nike, Shell, Dunhill and Wrigleys. CIA International now does all Nike's pan-European media buying. Nike has increased its business with CIA to billings of Pounds 40m this year. Blufin's pre-tax profits for the year ended December 31 1992 are expected to be in the region of L1.5bn (Pounds 660,000). Analysts are forecasting a 22 per cent rise in CIA's 1992 pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.5m, with turnover increased 30 per cent. Earnings per share are expected to grow 13 per cent to 15.34p. CIA currently has cash reserves of about Pounds 10m.</p>

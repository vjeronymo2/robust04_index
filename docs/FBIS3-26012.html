			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Kuang Tianpu (6782 3944 0944): "Abiding By Law To </F> Manage Ground Equipment for Receiving Satellite Television  Broadcasts"]    [Text] On 5 October 1993, the State Council promulgated  the "Regulations on Managing Ground Equipment for Receiving  Satellite Television Broadcasts" (the "Regulations"). This is  an important law governing the management of satellite  television broadcasts in our country and it has great  significance to the healthy and orderly development of our  country's satellite television broadcasts, to the protection of  the Chinese nation's fine cultural traditions, to the promotion  of socialist spiritual civilization, and to the maintenance of  social stability.  <H3>  I. Our Country's Satellite Television Broadcasts Develop  Rapidly and Must Be Managed According to Law </H3>   Since August 1985, our country has been using satellite  television broadcasting technology to transmit television  programs and to expand the areas covered by television  broadcasts. Before that, we mainly relied on building ground  microwave transmission networks for transmitting television  programs, to increase the coverage rate of the population  receiving television. Our country is vast and has a varied  topography, over 70 percent of the land is hilly and mountainous  areas and microwave transmission technology is affected and  hindered by terrain and landscape. For this reason, the  coverage rate of the population receiving television did not  increase rapidly. By 1985, after efforts for over 20 years, the  coverage rate of the population receiving television had not  reached 50 percent. After using satellites to transmit  television programs, because it saves on investment, involves  less transmission links, has a wide coverage area, and is free  from the restrictions of terrain and landscape, it has developed  very rapidly. By 1992, in just seven years, the coverage rate  of the population receiving television in the whole country  swiftly rose to 81.3 percent and satellite television  broadcasting has already become an important means of solving  the problem of television covering areas in our country.    At present, the Central Television Station transmits four  television programs through satellites, whereas the five  provincial television stations in Xinjiang, Tibet, Yunnan,  Guizhou, and Sichuan also use satellites to transmit their  programs; an educational television program is also transmitted  through satellite. It is estimated that this year, some other  provincial television stations will also use satellites to  transmit their programs. We can say that satellite television  broadcasting is now in the ascendancy in our country.    Along with the development of satellite television  broadcasts  in our country, the demand for group equipment for receiving  satellite television has rapidly swelled. By the end of 1992,  the country had 39,000 satellite television receivers and  transmitters. At the same time, the satellite television  programs which are transmitted from outside our borders but can  be received inside the country have continuously increased, and  there is an increasing number of people who have produced, sold,  installed, and used ground equipment to receive television  programs from outside our borders, thus, serious chaos has  emerged. Various types of enterprises have opened factories and  workshops without restrictions or planning and the equipment  they produce varies in quality, whereas some sales units forget  about obligations when lured by benefits and sell low-quality  equipment, or smuggle in products to evade tariffs, causing  serious harm to the interests of consumers and the country.  This not only endangers the healthy development of our new  industry producing equipment to receive satellite television but  is also unfavorable to socialist spiritual civilization  construction. It was precisely under such conditions that the  "Regulations" were formulated, promulgated, and implemented, to  enable the healthy development of the satellite television  undertaking to have legal protection.  <H3>  II. Managing Reception of Satellite Television Broadcasts  According to Law, Is an Important Means of Exercising and  Safeguarding State Sovereignty </H3>   Since 15 November 1983 when the United States for the first  time transmitted a direct-broadcast satellite television  program, satellite television undertakings have sprung up like  mushrooms in various parts of the world. In particular, since  the 1990's, satellite television undertakings in various  countries have entered a period of great development. Although  the International Telecommunications Union has produced an  agreement which says that the television programs of various  countries should be directed to the areas of the countries  concerned, for technical and political reasons, the "spill over"  phenomenon whereby a country's satellite television  intentionally surpasses national boundaries to cover other  countries and areas has become more serious and the "electric  wave battle" in the air has become more intensified. Many  countries have expressed worries at the increasing number of  trespassing television programs and a lot of these countries  have restricted the reception of satellite television and  carried out management according to their own national and  public interests. For example, Malaysia views management of  foreign satellite television as a political issue which has a  bearing on national security, clearly stipulating that no  individual or family should receive foreign satellite  television. Japan's Electric Wave Law stipulates that the  wireless and cable television stations in the country cannot  relay television programs from outside the border; at the same  time, Japanese law stipulates that residents can only receive  the directly broadcast satellite television programs transmitted  by NHK and Nippon Satellite Broadcasting Corporation. Britain's  New Broadcasting Ordinance clearly stipulates that the  Independent Commission for Television has the power to cancel  any "unacceptable" foreign satellite television programs  scheduled for the television channels under its jurisdiction.    In fact, managing satellite television broadcasts according  to law is the undisputable authority of any sovereign country.  The reason is simply that no sovereign country would allow  other countries to establish television stations or other news  agencies on its soil without any restrictions. Whereas  satellite television programs trespass the borders and cover  areas in other countries and would it not be equal to allowing  other countries to establish television stations on the soil of  a sovereign country if nothing is done to restrict them? At the  same time, when a sovereign nation, proceeding from the need to  safeguard and develop the nation's own cultural patterns,  values, morals, and social stability, carries out management of  the trespassing satellite television according to the law of the  country, it is completely a matter of sovereignty. As early as  1972, the 17th meeting of the UN Educational, Scientific and  Cultural Organization stipulated that a country has absolute  power to select and criticize the information (news) coming from  any other channels.    What must be further pointed out is that, at present, our  country is covered by about a dozen satellite television  channels from outside our borders. According to an estimate, in  the next 10 years, some 120 television broadcasting satellites  will be launched by various countries and about half of these  satellites will be in Asia, where most areas of our country will  be able to receive programs. If we do not give management but  let units and individuals receive those programs, then it is no  different from establishing inside our country several dozen  television stations which are run from outside the border.  Setting aside what kind of subtle influence the values, morals,  and cultural patterns publicized by these television programs  will have on our country's audience, especially young people,  speaking just in terms of safeguarding the country's  sovereignty, it is absolutely necessary for us to manage  according to law the reception of satellite television programs,  especially the television programs beamed from outside our  borders. This is also an important measure for exercising and  safeguarding state sovereignty.  <H3>  III. The Contents of the "Regulations" Accord With the  Actual Situation of Development of Television Undertakings in  Our Country and Is Identical to the Policy of Opening Up to the  Outside World </H3>   Since the birth of television undertakings in our country  some 30 years ago, we have been using the method of collectively  relaying and transmitting television signals to households and  individuals for them to watch. That is, television program  signals are provided by the wireless television stations,  television transmitting stations, and satellite ground stations  set up by the broadcasting and television departments at various  levels.    This method is very practical and is in accordance with our  country's actual situation in terms of solving the problem of  the rate of population covered by television in a developing  country like us, with 1.2 billion people, a relatively low per  capita income, and a comparatively backward economy. With this  method, some 800 million people in the country have been able to  watch television programs and in many places they can even watch  several programs, while in the places with cable television,  they can watch nearly 10 programs. As the problem of television  coverage rate was being solved, television programs became  increasingly abundant. In particular, since reform and opening  up, our country's television departments have worked hard to  improve the quality and increase the quantity of programs made  by themselves and, at the same time, also established relations  on exchanging and trading of programs with the television  organizations in many countries and regions in the world. They  have imported a large quantity of television programs of various  kinds that can be beamed outside our borders. In recent years,  the Ministry of Radio, Film and Television has signed 82  agreements or memoranda of agreement on cooperation with 41  countries such as France, Britain, and Italy, as well as with  two international organizations. The Central Television Station  signed cooperation agreements on providing news to United  Independent Television News Agency which is a U.S.-British joint  venture, Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), Cable News Network  (CNN), Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK), East European Broadcasting  Union, and Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union.    Since realizing round-the-clock operations for broadcasting  news 11 times every day last year, the Central Television  Station has been able to immediately broadcast important  international news. Apart from this, the television programs --  including cultural, sports, scientific, technological, and  cartoon programs -- which are made outside our borders and  acquired through trading, buying, or exchanging of copyright by  various television stations, have been broadcast in large  numbers. In particular, the international film festival which  is organized in turn by Sichuan and Shanghai every year,  provides a stable opportunity for exchanges of programs between  our country's television circles and the television  organizations in various countries in the world. Along with the  deepening of the reform and opening up, our country's television  undertaking will further develop and television programs will  become richer to satisfy, as much as possible, the people's  demands for obtaining important international and domestic news  as well as meeting their cultural and recreational needs.    Carrying out the necessary restriction and management of  reception of satellite television beamed from outside our  borders does not contradict the open-door policy in our country.  As we have mentioned before, our country's television circles  have established many kinds of relations of exchanging  television programs with many countries, to introduce to the  people in the whole country the outstanding cultures from  various places in the world through television. This is also to  let the Chinese people know the world better and learn and  borrow from the outstanding foreign cultures.    In order to satisfy the special needs of some units and  venues when implementing the "Regulations," the relevant  departments will, after examination and approval, allow  financial, economic, and trade units, foreigner-admitting  three-star hotels and the second-class hotels judged by state  standards, and the offices and apartments used by foreigners and  the people from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, to install  equipment to directly receive the satellite television programs  beamed from outside the border.    When we stress management according to law, our basic  purpose  is to enable satellite television to better serve our country's  economic construction, reform, and opening up, and to serve  socialist spiritual civilization construction as well.</p>

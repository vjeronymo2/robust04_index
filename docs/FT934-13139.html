			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (3): Check what you lose for years not worked - Going early, The pension choice / And before taking a cash sum, consider carefully whether your reduced pension will be adequate AS MORE employees, particularly men, stop work early, either voluntarily or through redundancy, they inevitably wonder whether their pension will be adequate. The early-retirement benefits available from occupational schemes are set out in the trust deed and rules. In final-salary schemes, the early-retirement pension is usually based on a formula which takes account of the number of years' service to retirement and the employee's earnings at or near retirement, less a reduction which is related to the number of years between the early and normal retirement dates. The reduction may be made on an actuarial basis, to allow for the pension's being taken early and for a longer period on average, and because fewer contributions will have been paid and fewer years will have been available to build up the fund. The reduction could be as high as 6 per cent in respect of each year  - a 30 per cent reduction for an employee with a normal retirement age of 65 but who retires at 60. Many schemes make a less severe reduction  - 3 or 4 per cent for each year year  - even though this means that each early retirement will cost the scheme a substantial amount of money. Some may even make nil or nominal reductions for retirement taken within two or three years of normal retirement, usually to encourage early departure. But, as a typical example, an employee in a scheme that provides a pension of 1/60th of final earnings for each year of service, and who would attain 30 years' service by age 65, would receive a pension of half (30/60ths) his final earnings at 65. But if he takes early retirement at 60, then his pension would be 25/60ths of his earnings at 60, less a reduction which could vary between 5 per cent and 30 per cent of the pension. If employees take early retirement as a result of being made redundant, then many schemes provide more favourable benefits through lower reductions and the crediting of additional years of service. Employees have the option to convert part of their pension to a tax-free cash sum, up to the limits set by the Inland Revenue. The benefit statement, available on request for early retirement, would set out the alternatives of a full pension or a cash sum plus reduced pension. Employees need to consider carefully whether the reduced pension will be adequate before they take the cash sum; or, if they do take it, they must be prepared to invest the money to boost their income. Remember that there are no provisions for state pensions to be paid on early retirement before the state pension age, though employees taking early retirement may no longer need to pay National Insurance contributions. This has financial implications for those who take early retirement under schemes which integrate their benefits with state pensions  - that is, the pension is based on earnings less a deduction in recognition of the fact that they will also receive a state pension. Consequently employees in schemes with integrated benefits, and who retire before reaching state pension age, face a pension shortfall until they do reach that age and receive the state pension. This shortfall is more likely to affect men, who have to wait until they are 65 to receive their state pension, than women who receive it at 60. However, many schemes now provide an additional 'bridging' pension, generally based on the single person's state pension, for employees affected by this shortfall, until the state pension becomes payable. Bridging pensions are usually paid only if retirement is taken on or after the employee reaches 60. Therefore women in these schemes do not receive a bridging pension  - a fact which has led to complaints about discrimination. However, the Advocate General's opinion, on a case before the European Court of Justice, is that schemes could pay bridging pensions to men and not women, because the combined pensions would be equivalent. If an employee is taking early retirement because of ill health, then the benefits, set out in the trust deed, are likely to be more favourable than normal early retirement benefits. Meanwhile, employees who take early retirement do have an alternative course of action. They can opt for a deferred pension (the benefit available when an employee leaves the scheme), and, if there is more than a year to normal pension age, take a transfer value to another, personal pension, arrangement. Some schemes may be willing to pay a transfer value during the year before normal retirement. There is no normal pension age with personal pensions. The benefits can be taken at any time between the 50th and 75th birthdays (both inclusive), and between the 60th and 75th birthday on retirement annuity contracts. However, the earlier that benefits are taken, the smaller will be the cash sum and the lower the annuity rates (which are related to age) at which a pension is bought. Individuals taking the benefits have to decide what type of annuity to buy: level; increasing; on the individual's own life, or with a spouses's benefit? Provision of a spouse's benefit or an increasing annuity means that the annuitant must accept a starting value lower than that provided by a single-life level annuity. He must compromise between the initial payment from the annuity, the level of future increases and provision of a spouse's pension. However, an alternative approach is available: it is known as 'staggered vesting', or a phased annuity. The individual uses the flexibility of cash-in on personal pensions and the facility to take tax-free cash sums. He decides on the level of net income that he will require in the first year, then cashes in enough of the personal pension to ensure that some of the tax-free cash, together with the after-tax value of an annuity purchased with the balance, provides that income. In this way, the tax-free cash sum provides part of the income requirements. This process is repeated each year, with the income from an increasing number of annuities, plus the tax-free cash sum and the new annuity, providing the target income. If investment conditions and annuity rates have been favourable, by the time the individual reaches 75 and has to cash in what is left in the personal pension, there should be sufficient value to provide a substantial cash sum and annuity. However, staggered vesting needs to be operated on an individual basis each year, with financial advisers taking a fresh look at clients' requirements, rather than used as a package, which is the present method of marketing the concept. Employees who take early retirement from an occupational scheme can make use of staggered vesting by taking the transfer option and investing in a personal pension. The protected-rights element of the personal pension will have to be taken at normal pension age. But the individual can apply staggered vesting to the remainder.</p>

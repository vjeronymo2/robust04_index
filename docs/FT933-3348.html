			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / International Company News: IBM chief names new executive team MR LOU Gerstner, IBM chairman since April, yesterday announced the creation of an 11-person executive committee to make the computer company's businesses work more effectively together, and advise him on group strategy. The new team, which seems to comprise Mr Gerstner's inner circle, is much larger than the management committee of Mr John Akers, who resigned as chairman this year because of IBM's poor results. And in a memo to staff, Mr Gerstner underscored the fact that he was drawing back from Mr Akers' plan to decentralise the business to the point where units could be spun off as separate companies. 'I have reached the firm conclusion that decentralisation versus centralisation is not our most important organisational dilemma,' he says. 'Rather, it is the working relationships across our operating units - product unit to product unit, geographic unit to product unit, geographic unit to geographic unit.' The committee is meant to overcome this. Its members will focus mainly on overall corporate results, rather than the performance of individual units. Their pay will be based on company-wide results, rather than the performance of their own operations. The members include Mr James Cannavino, head of personal computers; Ms Ellen Hancock, head of networking, who takes on additional responsibility for programming; Mr Bob Lebant, group executive for North America; Mr Ned Lautenbach, group executive for international operations; and Mr Pat Toole, head of the storage, printer and chips business. It also includes Mr John Thompson, head of mini- computers, who now also takes on overall responsibility for the group's key mainframe computer business. Analysts welcomed this move as likely to spur more creative solutions to computing problems. Mr Nick Donofrio remains in charge of mainframe operations. The committee also includes Mr Paul Rizzo, vice-chairman, a former IBM executive who came out of retirement early this year to help the company; Mr Bernard Puckett, Mr Gerstner's strategy chief; Mr Jerry York, chief financial officer; and Mr Gerry Czarnecki, head of human resources.</p>

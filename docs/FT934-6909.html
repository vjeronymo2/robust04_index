			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Nissan seat supplier to shed jobs Ikeda Hoover, the supplier of car seats to Nissan's Pounds 900m Sunderland plant, is to make redundancies among its 490 Wearside employees. The job cuts, discussed yesterday between Ikeda Hoover management and the company council, the workforce negotiating body, are in response to Nissan's decision to halve production from Sunderland until March because of the downturn in sales of new cars in continental Europe. A spokesman for Ikeda Hoover, a joint venture between Johnson Controls and Ikeda Busan, said the number of jobs to go was still under discussion. The company hoped the redundancies would be voluntary. Ikeda Hoover was set up on Nissan's 800-acre site in 1986 to supply the car plant. It is one of a number of suppliers located near the plant which constantly feed components to the car production line. Another of these suppliers, exhaust system and catalytic converter producer Calsonic, made 37 employees redundant last week because of Nissan's production downturn. Its Washington plant's production has been halved until March, but the remaining 108 employees are being kept on full pay.</p>

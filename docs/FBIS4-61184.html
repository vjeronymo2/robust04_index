			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 84 (574) for 3 </F> May 1994 compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy,  edited by Vladimir Shishlin]    [Text] "The experience of the past few years has  demonstrated that it is impossible at this stage to form a truly  national Georgian army that would become a guarantor of  independence without friendship and cooperation with Russia."  The statement was made in a Monday interview with local radio  by the Georgian head of state Eduard Shevardnadze.    He said that the appointment of Lieutenant-General Vardiko  Nadibaidze to the post of Defence Minister last week began a new  stage in the life of the army. Nadibaidze used to be deputy  commander of the Russian army group in Transcaucasia. In the  interview the Georgian leader said new professional approaches  are necessary and that was the reason for proposing Nadibaidze  to the post of minister. According to Shevardnadze, the general  is an experienced specialist and good organizer who is perfectly  familiar with the principles of forming an army as well as with  weaponry.    Independent experts in Tbilisi see a link between  Shevardnadze's statements about the need to build an efficient  army and his recent declarations that though giving preference  to peaceful political methods of settling the Abkhazian problem  the leadership of the country does not rule out a military  solution.    During his recent visit to west Georgia Shevardnadze  expressed hope that the painful problem would be settled finally  within two or three months. He accounted the possibility to the  improvement of relations with Russia and to help from the  international community. IF Note: Meanwhile, a personal envoy  of the Georgian head of state Aleksandr Kavsadze has  categorically denied the charges of the Abkhazian authorities  that the Georgian government connives with provocative actions  of Georgian saboteurs in Gali region. He declared that Georgia  remains a supporter of a peaceful and honorable settlement of  the conflict in Abkhazia.</p>

Supporters of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [PFLP], the largest opposition faction, which is based  in Damascus and shares internal opposition influence with Hamas,  say that the process of gradually shifting the leadership to the  occupied territory actually began last year in implementation of  the PFLP's fifth general congress resolutions. But the  al-Asad-Clinton meeting came as a warning that the conclusion of  a peace treaty between Israel and Syria would occur sooner than  the PFLP leaders had originally expected.    The branches of the Damascus-based Palestinian opposition  factions in the occupied territory were worried when al-Asad and  Clinton met in Geneva in mid-January. Some of them admitted  that the opposition card would have a price and that the Syrian  president would demand that price, particularly as the request  for muzzling that opposition is primarily an Israeli request.  Representatives of the various Palestinian factions in the  occupied territory have jokingly wondered about the next  station, and some suggested Yemen while others mentioned "even  Iran."    One of them said that "it is natural for any Arab leader to  put his interests before any other interests, and nobody can  claim that Syria has carried the Palestinian opposition on its  shoulders or that it has defended that opposition."  Representatives of these trends rule out the possibility of any  future confrontation with Damascus for signing an agreement with  Israel, and they believe that the natural choice would be to  look for another host state "where there are no Israeli  representatives and no threat to our lives."    A PFLP official added: "Our options are very limited. The  first priority is having the command headquarters in the cordon  states, but as these states are now leaning toward signing an  agreement with Israel, that would leave only the second tier of  cordon states, namely Sudan and Iraq, which is out of the  question at the present time."    The first warning the Damascus-based factions had since the  Palestinian resistance left Lebanon in 1982 was the 1991 Madrid  conference, when the cordon states -- that is Syria, Lebanon,  and Jordan -- and the Palestinians met face to face with Israeli  representatives. It took some of these factions, such as the  PFLP led by George Habash, two years to acknowledge the need to  reverse the equation it had applied until then and to recognize  the importance of shifting its centrifugal political and  leadership weight to the occupied territory, particularly as the  burden of the opposition there would increase with the [PLO]  Tunis leadership moving to the occupied territory.    Riyad al-Maliki, considered to be the PFLP's official  spokesman in the occupied territory, says: "If Syria signed an  agreement with Israel within a short period of time, that would  surprise us, but if that did occur and the process of  transferring the leadership had reached an advanced stage, there  would be no problems."    The talk about moving the leadership to the occupied  territory does not include Front officials moving from Damascus  or other Arab capitals to Gaza, Jericho, or other parts of the  West Bank. It rather means that the size of the responsibility  falling on the shoulders of those in the occupied territory and  their duties would increase in the next phase, in which a  Palestinian national autonomy authority would emerge, and these  responsibilities and duties would outweigh the tasks of the  leadership abroad.    The PFLP in the occupied territory is still maintaining  secrecy regarding the names and ranks of its leaders in the  occupied territory, particularly those still unknown to the  occupation authorities, unlike Fatah which has revealed all its  cards since the signing of the Declaration of Principles with  Israel.    A PFLP official says: "We will not become a public party,  nor will we reveal our organizational structure, not even after  the implementation of the Palestinian-Israeli agreement. That  is, first, because we have to take into consideration the  possibility that the agreement might fail and, second, because  we still do not know what position the future authority would  take regarding the opposition and to what extent its  coordination with the occupation authorities would have a  bearing on the repressive measures used."    Al-Maliki, who was the PFLP's spokesman during the occupied  territory's intifadah, which began in 1987, and got automatic  immunity on the basis of his meetings with diplomats  representing Western states (not Americans), says that the  mechanism of the opposition's work will change as the  Palestinians enter the new phase of implementation. He points  out that "we now see nothing except negotiations under  occupation. That is why we have to address public opinion and  expose the danger of the agreement signed with Israel, but we  cannot prevent anyone from negotiating or arriving at a formula  of some kind." He adds: "When the implementation begins there  will emerge a reality that we would have to confront and we will  not be content with just writing articles in the press or  addressing the masses but will use the direct method."</p>

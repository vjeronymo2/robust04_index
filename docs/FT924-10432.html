			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / International Company News: Macy plans reorganisation RH MACY, the bankrupt New York-based department store group, yesterday posted a net operating loss of Dollars 330m for the year ended August 1, compared with operating profits of Dollars 274m a year earlier and said it would unveil details of a five-year reorganisation plan on Thursday. The company's net loss for the year was Dollars 1.25bn, including Dollars 989m in extraordinary items, against a net loss of Dollars 150m, including an extraordinary gain of Dollars 113m. Sales in the year fell to Dollars 6.45bn from Dollars 6.76bn. Macy attributed the decline to the disruption caused by its Chapter 11 filing in January, and to the California riots earlier this year. Macy said that its reorganisation plan included '21 specific merchandising, expense and organisation initiatives aimed at strengthening our business. 'Among other things, the plan will change the way we buy, allocate and sell merchandise. It will also detail the steps we are taking to reduce costs , which will result in significant annual savings.' For the month of September, Macy's comparable store sales fell 4.7 per cent. The company said the results were an improvement over earlier months.</p>

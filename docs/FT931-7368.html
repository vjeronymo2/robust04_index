			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Heseltine clears travel merger against advice: OFT over-ruled twice in two weeks MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday over-ruled Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, for the second time in two weeks, and approved a proposal which would create a travel company with 30 per cent of the UK market. Mr Heseltine's surprise decision to dismiss Sir Bryan's recommendation that the Pounds 225m bid by Airtours' for its rival holiday company, Owners Abroad, be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission was attacked by recession-hit independent operators which said it could force them out of business. The decision was also criticised by consumer groups, competition specialists and Labour, which said the case for a referral to the MMC was overwhelming. Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, described the decision as 'astonishing'. He said: 'For Mr Heseltine to disagree with the director-general is a slap in the face and little short of a vote of no confidence in Sir Bryan Carsberg.' He called for an inquiry into 'behind-the-scenes activities' concerning the bid in the Department of Trade and Industry. 'It is clear that the DTI interfered with the Office of Fair Trading's pre-bid guidance as far back as December,' he said. 'The public has a right to know why the DTI ignored the pre-bid advice the OFT gave.' Earlier this month, Mr Heseltine overturned a recommendation from Sir Bryan that a merger of the infra-red defence components businesses of GEC and Philips Electronics be examined by the MMC. Before that, the director-general's advice to refer a merger had been over-ridden only 11 times in 20 years. However, the OFT said that since Sir Bryan was appointed in June last year Mr Heseltine had waved through 91 recommendations. Mr Heseltine said the competition issues raised by the Airtours takeover were not sufficient to justify a reference. Last Friday, he received a report from the OFT saying that the proposed takeover warranted examination by the MMC. Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said: 'We are delighted by this decision. We remain firmly of the view that the combination of Airtours and Owners Abroad will prove beneficial to both consumers and shareholders alike.' Mr Noel Josephides, chairman of the Association of Independent Tour Operators, said: 'The Office of Fair Trading have investigated the situation thoroughly and advised that the MMC be involved. We are extremely disturbed that the views of those experienced in and knowledgeable about the industry have been totally ignored by Mr Heseltine.' Mr Heseltine's decision throws the spotlight back on to Owners Abroad, which must produce its final defence against Airtours' bid this week. The all-share offer currently values Owners Abroad at 114p and its partial cash alternative at 110p, below the 129p level at which its shares closed yesterday, up 13p on the day. Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, yesterday repeated his claim that the Airtours offer undervalued his company. It emerged last night that Mr Neil Hamilton, the minister at the DTI with responsibility for competition issues, stepped aside from looking at the bid on February 15, after receiving a letter from Mr Crossland, who is one of his constituents in Tatton, Cheshire. The DTI said Mr Hamilton stepped aside to prevent people 'misinterpreting the situation'. Mr Griffiths questioned the part played by Mr Hamilton. 'There must be an investigation into the role of the minister and what part he played during December, January and the first week of February,' he said. 'I understand he did not declare the interest formally, but his withdrawal was the honourable thing to do. However, he will want to explain why no conflict of interest was formally declared to parliament or made public.'

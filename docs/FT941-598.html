			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Gold Fields debates a deep-level problem - The group's Northam platinum mine needs new funds by June Northam Platinum, the R1.7bn (Dollars 494m) South African platinum mine, is fast becoming an expensive and embarrassing mistake for parent Gold Fields of South Africa, the mining house renowned for its deep-level mining expertise. Gold Fields raised R1.5bn in equity to finance development at Northam between 1986 and 1993. The mine ran out of cash last June, secured R200m in bridging finance, but continues to make operating losses of nearly R10m a month and will need new funds by June this year if it is to survive. Gold Fields would appear to have three options: sell Northam, raise more money, or close the mine. In mid-1993, Mr Alan Wright, Northam's chairman until last year, approached Rustenburg Platinum, the world's leading platinum producer, to look at a closer relationship between Northam and Rusplat's neighbouring Amandelbult mine. Rusplat's management investigated and walked away. The company was unenthused about acquiring extra high-cost capacity, with platinum and rhodium prices near historic lows due to overcapacity at South African mines and slack demand for the metals from European and Japanese carmakers, which need them for catalytic converters. Northam is the world's deepest platinum mine, with shafts sunk to more than 2,000 metres. The temperature of the virgin rock underground can exceed 70`C, requiring extensive cooling, while the depth at which the ore is being mined pushes up production costs compared with rival South African producers, some of which are open-cast operations. Gold Fields introduced water-powered rock drills at Northam, which have proved mechanically efficient - with the bonus that the water they use for power helps cool the underground working environment to about 20 degrees. Management insisted in the past that the relatively high cost of extracting platinum would be more than offset by the richness of the ore, originally estimated to have an average in situ grade of 10.1 grammes a tonne. Northam's production costs 'should be the lowest in the industry', Mr Wright said in July 1992. That estimate has proved the mine's Achilles' heel. The in situ grade at neighbouring Amandelbult is only 7.5 grammes, and suspicion that Northam's would be no better gained weight when Northam announced it would widen underground stopes, inevitably leading to the extraction of more low-grade ore. Northam achieved average grades of only 5.4 grammes in 1993. Poor grades have been been aggravated by difficult mining conditions, ranging from large volumes of underground water to faulting on the reef, which left Northam a year behind its production target of 150,000 tonnes of ore a month. Northam's poor performance dented incentive bonuses employees were expecting in December. That led to an exodus of skilled and semi-skilled workers and an influx of new staff, just as pressure to meet production targets intensified. Mr John Hopwood, Northam's new chairman, says better metal prices would help but are not a solution to the mine's problems. 'I cannot put a percentage on the chances of Northam's survival. Even if we get the tonnage up to 150,000, the mine's future is critically dependent on achieving better grades. Increased stope widths, more development work and other mining factors are all diluting the in situ grades we thought we would achieve.' 'Northam has reached make or break,' says Mr Philip Marillier, mining analyst at stockbrokers Edey Rogers. While management can be forgiven for not predicting how low the platinum price would fall - the price averaged Dollars 466 an ounce the year the mine was launched, rising to more than Dollars 560 in the late 1980s, but yesterday stood at Dollars 412 - Gold Fields underestimated the difficulty of mining a platinum-bearing reef compared with the gold-bearing reefs it was used to, Mr Marillier says. He agrees selling Northam is unlikely, but closure may be unthinkable too, because of the investment Gold Fields has made. However, raising new funds is far from simple. New loan finance, assuming Northam's bankers were willing, would further compromise the mine's chances of showing a profit by adding to its interest burden. A fourth rights offer would take place in a bear-market for platinum. Northam shares are trading at R6.50 compared with their most recent high of R19.50. Sceptics point out there is little public interest in the share, so Gold Fields would have to take up most of the new scrip, perhaps requiring a rights issue of its own to foot the bill. The success of that would depend on the goodwill of the mining house's institutional shareholders, the Rembrandt group and assurer Liberty Life, who might be tiring of throwing good money after bad. However, Mr Donald Gordon, chairman of Liberty Life, notes that the group, which has assets of more than R83bn, acquired its stake in Gold Fields in 1989, after Minorco's abortive take-over bid for Consolidated Gold Fields. Mr Gordon says: 'The reason we invest in Gold Fields is for gold mining, and we are confident that the gold market will go from strength to strength in the years ahead. 'We did not invest in Gold Fields because of Northam, and, in any case, we get paid for underwriting.'</p>

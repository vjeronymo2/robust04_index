			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / The Nature of Things: Solitons on the crest of a wave John Scott Russell, a young Scottish engineer, was riding along the towpath of the Forth-Clyde canal one day in 1834. The horse-drawn barge he had been watching stopped suddenly but, to his amazement, its bow wave continued travelling down the canal. It took the form of 'a large solitary elevation, a rounded, smooth and well defined heap of water, which continued its course without change of form or diminution of speed'. Russell followed the solitary wave - about 1 1/2 ft high - for more than a mile down the canal before it lost its shape and disappeared. He was the first scientist to describe this extraordinary wave form, known now as a soliton, which maintains its shape and speed without widening and dispersing in the usual way. The soliton is an intriguing natural phenomenon. The best known example is a tidal bore rushing up a river estuary, though satellite pictures have occasionally shown solitary waves travelling for hundreds of miles across the Pacific Ocean. Today solitons are the subject of intensive research worldwide, not by scientists interested in the natural world but by engineers who want to send as much information as possible down optical fibres - the hair-thin glass strands which will make up the global communications network of the 21st century. For optical communications, of course, the soliton consists of light instead of water but the mathematical requirements are the same: the forces tending to compress the wave must balance exactly those tending to disperse it. Too much compression destroys the soliton as surely as too much dispersion; you can see the effect in water by looking at incoming waves 'breaking' on a beach. By transmitting the zeros and ones of digital data as solitons instead of the ordinary pulses of laser light used in current optical systems, engineers hope to squeeze 10 to 100 times more information down the line. It is impossible without using some technical jargon - and fiercely oversimplifying the physics - to explain how the soliton keeps its shape as it moves down the fibre. Any pulse of light, even one created by laser, has a slight spread of wavelengths travelling at slightly different speeds. The effect is gradually to smear out the pulse with time. The compensating factor, which keeps the soliton together, is 'non-linearity': the presence of the light itself produces a slight temporary increase in the speed of light in the fibre. This enables the back of the wave to keep pace with the front. Opto-electronic engineers at telecoms research centres such as Bell Labs in the US and BT Laboratories in the UK have already achieved impressive test results. They have made solitons carry data over the equivalent of intercontinental distances at a rate of 15bn digital 'bits' per second down a single fibre, without any errors. That is enough to carry more than 1m simultaneous telephone calls. Over short distances - equivalent to a local network around a building - engineers have achieved soliton transmission at 100bn bits per second. However a huge development effort is still required by telecoms companies and the manufacturers of optical fibres, lasers and associated equipment, before soliton systems can be put into practical service. One challenge is to control the timing; the lasers have to generate bursts of light lasting no more than 10 picoseconds (10 million-millionths of a second). Another is to overcome the unwanted 'noise on the line' that will be generated by optical amplifiers on long-distance cables carrying intense soliton traffic. And new computerised exchanges will be required to handle the torrents of data. But Richard de la Rue of Glasgow University, who heads one of the leading academic research groups in the field, believes practical applications will be under way before the end of the century and perhaps as soon as 1997. The next transatlantic fibre optic cable, to be installed next year, will not use solitons but the one after it might. The introduction of soliton-based systems depends not only on technical progress but also on continued rapid growth in demand for global communications capacity. If the multimedia revolution lives up to its advance billing, we will need not only solitons but also other capacity-expanding innovations such as 'wavelength division multiplexing' (adding new channels by sending solitons of different wavelengths simultaneously down the same fibre). If so, the transition from an inquisitive engineer observing the sedate progress of a solitary wave along a Scottish canal to billions of solitons a second streaming at the speed of light down an optical fibre will provide a perfect image of scientific progress from the 19th to the 21st century.</p>

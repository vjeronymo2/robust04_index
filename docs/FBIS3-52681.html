Security forces have arrested Attia's father-in-law, named  only as Bouchakor in the report, charging him with sheltering  the armed gang after the December 15 killings, and have  recovered stolen goods.    Attia was reported to have led an armed band for more than a  year and to be responsible for more than 200 attacks. He has  been implicated in an assault on the Boughezoul barracks, 150  kilometres (90 miles) south of here, which left 19 soldiers  dead, EL WATAN said.    The 12 Croatian expatriate workers, employed by the Croatian  company Hydro-Elektra, had their throats cut by a gang of about  30 people, near the dam they were helping build 50 kilometres  (30 miles) south of Algiers.    Last year, foreigners accused of cooperating with the  Algerian government became the target of Moslem extremists  waging war against the regime since the cancellation in January  1992 of elections the now outlawed Islamic Salvation Front was  poised to win.</p>

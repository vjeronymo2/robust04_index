			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / The Lex Column: Cable's Chinese puzzle Cable and Wireless has pearls scattered around the world, but somehow lacks a thread to pull them all together. Hong Kong Telecom is a great property, despite the tightening of price regulation and the advent of competition in 1995. Last year, international call volumes grew by 26 per cent. Longer term prospects for Asian telephony growth are remarkable, with China alone aiming to install capacity equivalent to three times that of BT by the turn of the century. Mercury is now attacking the UK market on several fronts with the 'one-two-one' cellular service a threat to both Vodafone's profit margins and BT's domestic customer base. Combined with cable tv, easy access to Mercury via the BT network and direct connection of larger customers, Mercury's market share will grow despite increasing competition for premium customers. Other franchises such as Telecommunications of Jamaica are valuable niches. That said, Cable's stated ambition of using the Caribbean as a hub for operations in the western hemisphere looks a little fanciful. The company wants to take minority equity stakes in businesses around its hubs and provide value-added services to customers worldwide. Yet it is a relatively small player in the global telecoms market and needs to focus its efforts carefully. The management has yet to convince that it can do so. And if the 12 per cent dividend rise is a guide to expected long-term earnings prospects, the market will have to decide what sort of premium rating that prospect can command.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> CELLIST CARLOS PRIETO AT PLAZA DE LA RAZA  </P> <P> As a generous encore to his formal appearance on the Chamber Music in Historic  Sites series over the weekend, cellist Carlos Prieto on Monday night gave an  informal performance at Plaza de la Raza in Lincoln Park. In the airy but  intimate Margo Albert Theater, it was a mini-version of the recital he had  offered at the Doheny Mansion on Sunday afternoon.  </P> <P> The veteran musician, colleague of Stravinsky and Shostakovich and devotee of  works by Villa-Lobos, gave this outreach program under auspices of the Da  Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College, sponsor of the Historic Sites  series..  </P> <P> Plaza de la Raza may not yet be an historic site, but it turned out to be an  amenable place for this concert by Prieto and his splendid pianistic partner,  Doris Stevenson.  </P> <P> Their performance proved brief but potent.  </P> <P> Rachmaninoff's famous "Vocalise" immediately established the duo's intensity  and musical communicativeness. Two movements from Shostakovich's Sonata, Opus  40, exhibited their colorful virtuosity in tight, mordant readings.  </P> <P> They served the causes of variety and lyric tautness in Carlos Chavez's  "Madrigal" (1921), then capped this display with mercurial but deeply probing  accounts of works by Ginastera and Tchaikovsky.  </P> <P> Throughout, the cellist produced a consistent stream of pure and articulate  sounds in support of stylish music making; in this, he was assisted  wholeheartedly by Stevenson. They make an exceptional team. DANIEL CARIAGA  </P></p>

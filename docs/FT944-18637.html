			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Thai flood alert Local authorities in Thailand's capital Bangkok have issued a flood warning for October 6-11, when a combination of heavy rainfall and high tides in the Gulf of Thailand could cause the Chao Phraya river to overflow. Six months ago Bangkok was threatened by a severe water shortage, but exceptionally heavy monsoon rains have more than remedied the drought. Flooding caused by heavy rain sometimes brings Bangkok's already slow-moving traffic to a complete stop for hours at a time.</p>

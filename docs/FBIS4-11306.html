			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 22 Apr (PL) -- Cuban parliament President  Ricardo Alarcon has described changes in the country's state  organizations that were announced today as "measures to revive  the economy without adopting neoliberal models that would hurt  countless workers."    In statements to the media during a recess at the Nation and  the Emigrants Conference, which started this morning, Alarcon  noted that such changes had been discussed for some time, and he  added that they are designed to adjust the structure of the  island's central government to the current situation.    He stressed that the idea is to do at the government level  what the people have already been doing to reduce expenses, to  rationalize by way of austerity, and to make the best use of  resources. "We cannot, however, throw anyone into the streets,"  he stressed.    "The idea is to simplify structures and, in turn, reduce  excess payrolls without affecting workers," Alarcon said. He  added that this is precisely what makes Cuba's situation  complex. There is a need to overcome this difficult phase, to  clean up the nation's finances, and to revive the economy  without adopting capitalist models.    In the United States, for example, there are a lot of  unemployed people in the streets looking for jobs, medical  attention, and something to eat, although that country is not  facing a blockade and a special period (the name given here to  the years of economic crisis), "but this is not and will never  be the case in Cuba," Alarcon added.    Today, the Cuban Government announced the creation of a new  structure that eliminates several ministries and central  government organizations and creates new ones, such as the  Ministries of the Economy, Foreign Investment, and Tourism.    Decree-Law No. 147, which was issued by the Cuban State  Council and was published in GRANMA, explains that the goal is  to reduce the size and adjust the duties of the government  apparatus through measures already under way to confront the  crisis prompted by the disappearance of the socialist bloc.    Alarcon added that the decree is designed to better adjust  the government structure in accordance with the trade relations  and cooperation the island is developing within today's  international situation.</p>

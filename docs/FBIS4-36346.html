			<p>CSO     [Text] 11 Ordibehesht [1 May] -- Sixty percent of the  current publications in Iran were added to the nation's  publications market after the triumph of the Islamic revolution.    The First Press Festival News Staff reports that studies  show  that 40 percent of the nation's publications were born after the  year 1368 [21 March 1989-20 March 1990].    In Iran about 80 percent of the publications are published  in  the Persian language and the other 20 percent are published in  other languages, mostly English and Arabic. This study shows  that science, research, and the social humanities, with 19.2  percent, is the largest group of publications in terms of area  of activity. Ranking next are general magazines, with a  13.9-percent share of the total.    The number of publications has increased dramatically at  several points in the nation's history, including the period of  the Constitutional Revolution, the era of the peak of the  triumph of the Islamic revolution and the current period.    The year 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994] is unprecedented  in the 157-year history of the nation's press in terms of the  number and variety of its publications, and also in terms of the  number of individuals employed in this profession. In this year,  550 different publication titles were published.    Based on studies that have been done, the audience for about  36 percent of Iran's press is the general public. Ranking next  is publications targeted at various social groups. The women and  children's group, with 29 percent of the total, ranks first  among the targeted groups. In the area of specialist  publications, statistics show that those with university  specialties are the intended audience for 9 percent of  publications.    Likewise, research on levels of education and the  correspondence between fields of study and occupation shows that  68.5 percent of Iran's newspaper journalists have university  educations, and that 1.6 percent of them studied journalism.  Most of those with higher education in the journalism fields are  working as journalists in high-circulation newspapers. It is  worth mentioning that about 13 percent of Iran's newspaper  journalists are women.</p>

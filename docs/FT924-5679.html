			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (4): Newcomers needed - Inward investment Toyota's huge investment in a Pounds 700m car plant in Burnaston, south Derbyshire, has so dominated inward investment in the county that there has been little examination of other re-locations and start-ups. Toyota is often assumed to have brought in fresh investment on its coat tails. There has been some interest among Japanese companies in being close to Toyota's new venture. But there have been few significant investments, at least in Derbyshire. Since it first announced its plans in 1989, Toyota has never fully spelt out why it chose Burnaston. The availability of a 400-acre airfield which was effectively a greenfield site - and cheap to buy - was one reason. Another was the proximity to the traditional automotive heartland of the West Midlands. The company made it clear from the start that because of sensitivities in the European Community - the French tried to insist on at least 70 per cent locally-manufactured components in Japanese cars built in Britain - it would, where possible, be using local manufacturers. This has meant that so far the spin-offs from Toyota have been in Derby itself and also in neighbouring Staffordshire and Leicestershire. Parts of these counties are closer to Burnaston than Chesterfield, the second-largest town in the Derbyshire, and they have a greater concentration of motor component manufacturers. Derbyshire has a north-south divide both physically and psychologically. The Peak District split it and the people of Chesterfield and Buxton tend to look north to Sheffield and Manchester as main centres rather than south to Derby and Nottingham. Moreover, the beneficiaries of Toyota so far have tended to be existing manufacturers. In these recessionary times, they usually have spare capacity. There has been little demand for new companies to invade the area, even in Derby. Mr Gordon Wilding, economic development manager to the Derbyshire Enterprise Board, says: 'Leaving aside expansions or contractions in the well-known companies like Rolls-Royce, British Rail Engineering, Thorntons and Nestle, and apart from one or two investments in Derby like Scholls the footwear people, I am bound to say there have been no significant, totally new, greenfield-type investments in the county, outside of Toyota, in the past few years.' This is not to say there has been no new investment at all. Mr Wilding quickly produces a list which shows that apart from Toyota and its related companies 11 other Japanese concerns have set up in Derbyshire since 1989. They are companies such as Japanese Aero Engines Corporation which has established a presence in Derby and Chiyoda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance (Europe)  -also in Derby. A second list produces the names of 20 German companies which have set up in Derbyshire in recent years . Local press cuttings give examples of local companies which are expanding. Dove Valley Poultry has opened a new Pounds 1.5m factory extension in Ashbourne. Northern Food Transport, which supplies food across the country, has applied for planning permission for a new Pounds 2m base in South Normanton, Bolsover. This would employ 200 workers. None of these cases, however, could be deemed significant new investments either in capital or employment terms. Mr Wilding says: 'These figures are notoriously difficult to arrive at but I would guess that in terms of completely fresh investment you are talking about a total of tens of millions of pounds rather than hundreds - and hundreds of new jobs rather than thousands.' One reason that Derbyshire has not attracted significant new investment, notwithstanding Toyota, is that it has not been helped by the government to promote itself as a re-location centre. Small parts of the north-east of the county are classified as intermediate area. Businesses there can apply for regional selective assistance, and regional enterprise grants. Parts of the county also qualify as Objective 2 regions under the European Regional Development Fund and can receive infrastructural aid. Within the Objective 2 region some areas qualify for assistance aimed at helping old coal mining areas. There is also limited assistance available under the Rural Development Scheme and from British Coal Enterprise for various parts of the county. However, none of this help begins to match the amounts and scope of assistance thrown at south Wales, the north-east of England, or the former steel towns such as Consett and Corby. And it does not remotely mirror the sums channelled through the former new town corporations for economic regeneration. Specifically, most of Derbyshire is not an assisted area. Mr David Stone, of the planning department of the Chesterfield District Council, says: 'An area like ours needs assisted area status because it is the key to unlocking private sector investment. Assistance and subsidy are not the only reasons a company will move to an area. By themselves they probably would not swing the decision. Others factors are equally, if not more, important. But assistance certainly helps.' Derbyshire has some similarities with Lancashire. Both counties suffered from the decline of textiles and engineering in the recession of the 1980s, but both counties held up well in employment terms through the rest of the 1980s because single, large employers continued to do comparatively well. In Lancashire's case, aerospace and defence held up, and in Derbyshire, mining - despite contraction - continued to supply jobs. Lancashire is now anxious to gain assisted area status because of the threat hanging over the aerospace industry; Derbyshire because of the cloud over mining. Mr Stone says: 'Given the severity of the recession, we have done relatively well. Unemployment is 11.4 per cent; higher then the national average, but not greatly so. This is why we have not received assisted area status.' The situation may now be about to change. The three coal pits in Derbyshire are not those due for immediate closure. They are among the 21 mines due for reappraisal in three months' time. Some 3,000 are employed in the Derbyshire pits. Thousands of others live in the county but work in pits in Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. Mr Stone says: 'The pit closures, if they happen, will be devastating for this area of north-east Derbyshire. Unemployment will immediate shoot up to 17 per cent.' Derbyshire wants to secure assisted area status as well as any special help that comes specifically for the mines. But it is also stressing other factors in its drive to secure new investment. It is pointing out the good communications, with easy access to the country's motorways including the M1 and M6. It is stressing that it is surrounded with former industrial cities so there is an available supply of cheap, skilled labour. It is trying to bring forward industrial land which is also cheap at Pounds 100,000 an acre. Chesterfield has a business park of seven acres, an industrial park of 23 acres and a further 17 acres of development land on offer. Derby has just been successful in its 'city challenge' bid for funds to spend over five years. Some of this will be used to develop 200 acres for office and industrial use. It is early days in the renewed attempt to attract inward investment. But Mr Wilding says a US concern which does not want to be named is close to finalising a Pounds 20m deal which would provide 600 jobs. This would be a start in demonstrating that it is not just Toyota which finds Derbyshire the place to be.</p>

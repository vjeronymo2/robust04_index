			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Further housing price fall forecast HOUSE PRICES will continue to fall at least until the middle of next year and delay economic recovery, according to a report by Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank. Falls in house prices will continue to be concentrated in the southern regions, Morgan Grenfell says. It expects house prices over the whole of the UK to fall by 2.5 per cent next year but by 4.5 per cent in the south-east. Scotland and the north may see a rise in nominal prices next year. Housing turnover will remain low until prices stabilise, depressing spending on consumer durables, the report argues. Housing turnover has fallen to 80,000 a month this year, down from a peak of 200,000 a month in August 1987. The number of first-time buyers entering the market this year has fallen by a third since 1987 to 300,000. Mr James Barty, economist at Morgan Grenfell, said: 'The weak housing market is a major drag on the economy and it will hamper economic recovery.' Morgan Grenfell says further falls in house prices will compound the burdens of heavy debts and high interest rates facing many homeowners. Lower house values will increase the number of homeowners with a mortgage debt that exceeds the value of their house. It estimates the number of households in that position will increase by 500,000 this year to 1.5m. The number of households that cannot meet mortgage payments at current interest rates is expected to rise with a further 70,000 house repossessions this year against an estimated 75,000 last year.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sejm Deputy Marian Krol, Polish Peasant </F> Party activist, by correspondent Leszek Luczak; place and date  not given]    [Text] [Luczak] Was Waldemar Pawlak right to recall Vice  Minister Stefan Kawalec from his post?    [Krol] The prime minister's decision was correct. Vice  Minister Kawalec was largely responsible for the fact that  certain reforms in Poland were not carried out as they should  have been--for example, the reform of the insurance and banking  systems, and, of course, privatization. Polish Peasant Party  [PSL] and Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] voters expected to see  dynamic changes: They hoped that all the factors leading to  pathological changes in our economic life would be firmly and  energetically identified and eliminated. Unfortunately, they  suffered bitter and rather extensive disappointment, and now  they view the apparent continuation of the damage done by the  previous teams with mounting irritation. For example,  privatization of the Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy [Wielkopolski  Credit Bank, WBK] has demonstrated clearly that not all  solutions are equally acceptable. The bank's share prices were  artificially depressed when they were offered for sale on the  Stock Exchange, and as a result they rose considerably more than  tenfold in a very short time. Those who profited most from this  operation were the Western strategic investor and the WBK's own  employees, especially its management cadre, who had been offered  the opportunity to buy many more shares, and on vastly more  preferential terms, than ordinary outside investors. It was not  through their own work aimed at improving the WBK financial  situation but through an unearned privilege that those people  became very wealthy virtually from one day to the next. And now  we have just seen the same maneuver being applied, under the  rule of, of all things, a left-wing government team, in the  privatization of the Bank Slaski [Silesian Bank]. Forgive me,  but we must neither condone nor permit such practices.    [Luczak] I understand you are making your statement in the  interest of so-called social justice?    [Krol] Precisely. We do not interpret that social justice,  of which you speak with ever so slight irony, as the principle  of distributing goods to everyone on a rigidly equal basis. We  believe that the differentiation of material circumstances  within society is a perfectly natural thing. We support  development of the free market economy, privatization, and  reprivatization. However, the differences we have just mentioned  should be first and foremost the result of the hard work,  enterprise, inventiveness, and talent shown by people, rather  than administrative decisions which give tremendous material  advantages to some while forcing others downward into even  greater poverty. Even in the capitalist system we should  observe certain principles of social justice and fair play.  Both the past and present history of Western states can show us  clearly what happens when these principles are violated. Social  peace in every country and in every sociopolitical system is  based on general public acceptance of a certain minimum of rules  and solutions. The reserves of such acceptance are dwindling  very fast in Poland now, and that is precisely why we have been  calling for changes. To go back to the Bank Slaski affair, I  believe that all the circumstances of its privatization should  be very thoroughly clarified in the public interest.    [Luczak] Recent opinion poll findings demonstrate clearly  and unequivocally that the public, in particular the left-voting  electorate, is not prepared to approve privatization of state  enterprises. Consequently, you should put a stop to the  privatization process at once.    [Krol] No, we should not. We understand that  privatization is vitally necessary. The antiprivatization  stance of our voters is not the result of any ideological  considerations but the conclusion drawn from observation of the  consequences of the privatization process as it has been  executed to date. The ordinary man in the street notes very  well how some become very wealthy in the process, through being  able to buy our public assets not because they like the offer  and have the money but because they can pull strings, have  access to those in charge of the operations, or know how to push  and shove. Such people end up grabbing all kinds of  preferential chances not accessible to others. Then your  ordinary man in the street is bound to draw the wrong  conclusion: Privatization is something evil. That is why, in  order to defend the case for privatization, we must restore it  to health. There is no justification for repeating old mistakes  over and over again.    For example, I valued highly the professional expertise  shown  by the former minister of ownership transformations Janusz  Lewandowski, and I appreciated the very hard work he did for the  cause of privatization in Poland. Many of his errors and  mistakes could be explained by the fact that he was a pioneer in  that field, and a liberal in his economic thinking. However, by  now we have gained much more experience in privatization, and if  ministers from our current ruling government coalition persist  in continuing the same mistakes, we can only attribute them to  ill will. And that, among other things, was probabaly why it  was necessary to recall Kawalec.    [Luczak] Was it also because Kawalec refused to approve the  project of pouring central capital into the Food Economy Bank  [BGZ], which is, after all, associated with the PSL?    [Krol] The PSL does not own the BGZ. The BGZ is one of  Poland's largest banks offering financial services to the rural  sector. Admittedly, it has financial problems, but who has  caused them? Not the bank itself but the policies pursued by  the previous governments. They dismantled the system of state  farms for political reasons, but they did so in a way which  destroyed the viability of those large farms. And the state  farms were, after all, the BGZ's main borrowers, so inevitably  their financial troubles were bound to hurt the bank. State  banks have received 10 trillion zlotys [Z] for so-called  restructuring, which in practical terms was tantamount to  assistance in covering their losses resulting from the high  proportion of unrecoverable loans. The state decided that it was  not the banks' fault, since they were simply obliged to give  those credits in the past. So far so good. However, why should  the BGZ, which is a joint state-and-cooperative bank, be treated  differently? The BGZ works in cooperation with a great many  other cooperative banks, and if they were all to join forces  together, they could create a bank with a dominant proportion of  cooperative capital. That would change its profile and at the  same time restore it to health very effectively. We cannot have  situations in which people like Mr. Kawalec keep throwing a  wrench in just because they happen to have taken an exception to  Chairman Cichosz. It is in Polish agriculture's best interest  to assist the BGZ in getting back on its feet.    [Luczak] Let us assume that Prime Minister Pawlak had very  strong arguments in favor of dismissing Vice Minister Kawalec.  But would it not have been both easier and politically safer to  present these arguments fist to the SLD leadership and to Deputy  Prime Minister Borowski? Instead, Pawlak recalled Kawalec very  quickly, as if in an emergency. It looked as if every minute's  delay could heighten the danger of Kawalec's grabbing the  state's cash box under his coat and making off with it.    [Krol] According to my information, the prime minister could  not count on getting Deputy Prime Minister Borowski to agree to  his vice minister's dismissal, so he was forced to act as he did.    [Luczak] But in this way he risked a split in the coalition  and an eventual profound political crisis in Poland, did he not?    [Krol] I do not believe that the government coalition was or  is likely to fall apart. It is far more probable that the SLD  group will disintegrate first. Very many SLD deputies agree  with us, either openly or covertly, in disapproving strongly of  the activities of the group of liberals within the SLD who are  gathered around Aleksander Kwasniewski.</p>

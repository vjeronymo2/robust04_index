			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> MAN COLLAPSES AS WARRANT IS SERVED  </P> <P> A 25-year-old man, apparently shocked when he saw police, collapsed and  reportedly suffered a seizure during a drug bust in Ventura, during which seven  Ventura residents were arrested, authorities said Monday.  </P> <P> Michael Todd Trisler, 25, was hospitalized after Ventura police and the Ventura  County district attorney's office served a search warrant about 1 a.m. Saturday  at the Country Inn at Ventura at 298 S. Chestnut St., police said.  </P> <P> A friend of Trisler said the man had been taking drugs, drinking and had  asthma, Police Sgt. Steve Bowman said.  </P> <P> The bust, which netted about five ounces of methamphetamine worth about $6,000,  occurred after detectives learned that Trisler and his brother, Eugene, were  selling drugs at the hotel, Bowman said. Police obtained a search warrant for  the hotel room and for Eugene Trisler's cars, Bowman said.  </P> <P> When the warrant was served, Michael Trisler and Kevin Scott Izer, 24, were in  the room, where police found a half-ounce of methamphetamine, he said.  </P> <P> After Michael Trisler collapsed, he was taken to Ventura County Medical Center  for observation. He was released that afternoon and arrested on outstanding  warrants and on suspicion of possessing methamphetamine for sale and of being  under the influence of drugs, Bowman said. He was being held in the Ventura  County Jail on $25,500 bail.  </P> <P> Izer gave several false names before telling officers his identity, Bowman  said. He was arrested on suspicion of possessing drugs for sale and on  outstanding warrants, and was being held in the Ventura County Jail on $11,452  bail.  </P> <P> Eugene Trisler returned to the room just after Michael was taken to the  hospital. A search of his car revealed four ounces of methamphetamine, and he  was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence of drugs and of  possessing methamphetamine for sale, Bowman said. He was being held in the  County Jail on $10,000 bail, a jail spokesman said.  </P> <P> Eugene Trisler's wife, Shelly, 26; Zachary Donald Lee, 20; Marcy Lynn Ramsdell,  23, and Candace Marie Leith, 30, returned to the hotel room after Eugene was  arrested, Bowman said. A small amount of methamphetamine was found in the  purses of Leith and Shelly Trisler, and they were arrested on suspicion of  possessing methamphetamine and of being under the influence of drugs, Bowman  said. Shelly Trisler was being held in the Ventura County Jail on $5,000 bail  and Leith was released from jail, a jail spokesman said.  </P> <P> Lee and Ramsdell were arrested on suspicion of being under the influence.

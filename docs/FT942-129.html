			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Healthy effect of league tables Two striking results emerge from the publication yesterday of hospital performance league tables for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first is the marked improvement over the last year in average performance against many of the 23 indicators used. The second is the enormous variation that remains between the performance of individual hospitals. The discipline of league tables must have played a significant role in the first achievement and should spur progress on the second by encouraging the worst performers to raise their standards to the level of the best. It is the variations between different hospitals that should give the most cause for concern. There are often good reasons why some hospitals do worse than others in, for example, reducing waiting times for operations. The distribution of resources is never perfect, and some hospitals have inherited years of neglect that will take time to remedy. But it is hard to see any reason why some hospitals should be able to treat virtually all patients within a year - and most within three months - while others find it hard to treat more than half their patients in a year. Raising all hospitals to the average of the top quartile would mean a significant improvement in the standard of the health service in many parts of the country. Day surgery Similar variations can be seen in the use of day surgery. Day surgery is not the right approach in all cases, since some patients will need to stay in hospital to recuperate from even the most sophisticated of modern surgical procedures. But it is hard to fathom why one hospital should be able to extract all cataracts without an overnight stay while another requires all such patients to be hospitalised. Prima facie, this suggests an unacceptable waste of scarce resources in the form of hospital beds. Even the much criticised punctuality targets are revealing in their variations. Hospitals that see barely half their outpatients within 30 minutes of the appointed time are still organising themselves for the benefit of their staff rather than their customers. The best performers are able to see all or nearly all their outpatients within the 30-minute target time. Those that cannot achieve this need to put a higher premium on meeting their patients' needs. Undesirable outcomes There is, however, a danger that needs to be guarded against in focusing on a narrow range of performance indicators. Almost any target can be met if it is pursued single-mindedly, though the result may be to produce undesirable outcomes. At the most absurd level, a hospital could score well in the league tables by discharging patients earlier than is good for their health. To that extent, those who oppose the publication of league tables have a point when they say that there are no targets on clinical performance. That is not an argument against league tables, however, but one for more appropriate performance indicators. Information on clinical matters such as death rates while under the scalpel and reinfection rates among discharged patients is available. In the US, such data are routinely published in comparable form and highlight unacceptable variations. A priority for the UK health service is to complement the existing service targets with equally robust clinical targets to illuminate quality of treatment. However, the best should not be allowed to become the enemy of the good. Positive results from publishing comparative information can be seen already in the improvement in hospital performance since last year. Similar improvements have also been recorded in school performance, where league tables are now into their third year. In that context, the Labour party needs to be more explicit about its plans for using such information to improve public services. Party spokesmen say that they are in favour of providing much more data on performance, but are cagey about whether they would compile league tables. This sounds like a recipe for a deluge of data that will swamp the customer and offer no basis for comparison. The greatest improvement in performance will come by publishing a limited range of indicators in tables that allow easy comparisons and then making managers accountable for the results.</p>

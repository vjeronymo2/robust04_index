			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nelson Murillo] </F>   [Text] Puntarenas -- Finance Minister Carlos Munoz said  yesterday that the country will face difficulties in servicing  the foreign debt and a reduction in available credit if the  future administration decides to replace the PAE III [Economic  Adjustment Program] with loans to specific sectors.    After saying it was inadvisable to continue "patching up the  economy," the official asserted that opting for loans to  specific sectors instead of the PAE III would entail at least 18  months of negotiations. Thus, the official stated, the loan  option is "ineffective."    Munoz was one of the main speakers at a economics seminar  attended by 30 journalists at the Hotel Fiesta in Puntarenas.  The seminar ended yesterday.    At that event, Munoz said the country should continue on the  path to economic modernization, commercial opening, and smaller  government. The finance minister emphasized that the Jose  Maria Figueres Olsen administration, which will take office on 8  May, could renegotiate PAE III with the World Bank. The  minister pointed out, however, that the government would loose  its ability to pay the foreign debt and, in this case,  international creditors would probably withdraw our credit.    Central Bank President Jorge Corrales emphasized that the  negotiation of separate loans to certain sectors as an  alternative to the PAE III would lead to high payments by Costa  Rica and -- in his opinion -- there are not enough resources for  that.    President-elect Jose Maria Figueres said the debate on PAE  III "had been overcome" when he met with President Rafael Angel  Calderon Fournier.    The current government insists that this program, which will  provide the country with $180 million, should be approved by the  Legislative Assembly, while the future administration rejects  the program because it believes that it was not negotiated "in a  Costa Rican manner [a la tica]."    Minister Munoz asserted that the PAE III would integrate the  Costa Rican economy into the new international commerce currents  because it will increase productivity, reorganize the financial  sector, promote savings, and guarantee more funds for social  programs. He added that it would reduce poverty and  unemployment and would allow the private sector to receive a  flow of resources that would encourage production.    Commenting on the economic reforms by the Calderon Fournier  administration, Munoz said: "This process cannot be a reversed.  I don't believe the PLN [National Liberation Party] is thinking  of canceling it because that would create serious problems for  the country. The PAE III is necessary to maintain economic  stability and foreign financing."</p>

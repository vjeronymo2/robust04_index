			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 6 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry is to  partially lift the ban on off-exchange forward contract dealings  on interest and currency rates by banks as early as July,  ministry officials said Monday.    The ministry plans to include the deregulatory steps in  Japan's second market-opening package to be launched in late  June in line with strong international demands, especially from  the United States, to allow the hedging tools commonly used  overseas, said the officials, who requested anonymity.    Japan promised in a first package adopted in March to offer  detailed deregulatory measures on financial services in June.    The hedging tool on interest rates, called a forward rate  agreement (FRA), involves a contract agreed upon by negotiation  between two parties -- either between banks or between banks and  customers -- on the interest rate to be paid at future  settlement.    With the principal amount agreed on but never exchanged, FRA  contracts are settled in cash, with risk limited to the gap  between the contracted and actual rates at settlement.    The same dealings used for currency rates are called forward  exchange agreements.    Unlike futures contracts traded on exchanges, the forward  agreements are made under negotiations by two parties, and the  Ministry of Justice has strongly opposed the dealing's gambling  nature.    But citing the FRA's increasing role in the U.S. and Europe  to hedge interest rate fluctuations, the Finance Ministry  decided to lift the ban with certain limits in a bid to secure  Japan's position in the international financial market, the  officials said.    Banking industry officials said the industry has not yet  received any notice from the ministry, but noted that the  negotiated transactions will allow banks to meet needs by  individual customers through free setting of contract amounts  and starting and settlement dates.    In this sense, they said, futures contracts are fixed, with  yen- based interest rates, for example, traded on the Tokyo  international financial futures exchange under three-month and  one-year contracts on euroyen deposit rates.    FRA also helps banks maintain the capital adequacy ratio  required by the Swiss-based Bank for International Settlements  because dealings are made off the book without changing their  assets and liabilities.</p>

			<p><P> December 31, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRITAIN'S 'GONG SHOW' IS BOTH PRAISED, DAMNED;  </P> <P> AWARDS: THE ESTABLISHMENT LOVES THE HONORS SYSTEM. CRITICS ARGUE THEY ARE RANK  POLITICAL PATRONAGE.  </P> <P> Insiders call them "gongs." The Establishment says they are recognition for  service. Critics argue they are rank political patronage. The Times of London  writes that they are "a regular British farce."  </P> <P> Whatever the view, the venerable British honors system is still going strong --  and controversially. It is praised by some as rewarding endeavor for the  nation; damned by others as a corruption at the heart of government.  </P> <P> Outgoing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refueled the running argument in her  Resignation Honors List in December by naming to the House of Lords people  whose chief virtue was the size of their monetary contributions to the  Conservative Party.  </P> <P> She also recommended for honors Fleet Street editors whose newspapers are  distinguished solely by the fervor with which they supported the prime minister  when she was in power.  </P> <P> As the Times described the Thatcher list: "It was an odd mixture of financial  and media backers and cronies, together with hard-working assistants, the  'honor' done to the former tainting that was done to the latter."  </P> <P> Still, Thatcher (who can be addressed as Lady Thatcher since her husband was  made a baronet), apparently avoided a scandal like that which attended the  infamous 1976 resignation honors list of Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson,  who ennobled and knighted men later indicted for various crimes.  </P> <P> British honors are regularly awarded twice a year by the monarch, with the vast  majority of nominees made by the prime minister and at the New Year and on the  queen's official birthday. The lists sometimes number more than 2,000 names.  </P> <P> The most recent, announced late Sunday, included a life peerage for mystery  novelist P. D. James and a knighthood for actor Ian McKellen. Romance novelist  Barbara Cartland was made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight.  </P> <P> Additional honors lists come when a prime minister resigns or Parliament is  dissolved. Most honors are accompanied by medals, hence the nickname "gongs."  </P> <P> People are nominated for honors through a complicated system of civil service  committees, which act before the names reach the prime minister's office and  ultimately the palace.  </P> <P> Britain, of course, is not unique in dispensing honors and gongs to deserving  (or undeserving) citizens: Most countries have such sought-after baubles.  </P> <P> The United States, for instance, has the Medal of Freedom and lesser awards for  recipients, who range from former Presidents to Nobel scientists to  entertainers.  </P> <P> The French have varying degrees of the Legion of Honor, created by Napoleon,  who said that men would fight and die for bits of ribbon. Germany has replaced  the famed Iron Cross with the Federal Service Cross, in several degrees.  </P> <P> Yet no country has quite the array of honors that a British queen can bestow  upon her subjects -- and also upon nationals of other nations, people like  former President Ronald Reagan and Ireland's Bob Geldof, a rock musician and  famine-fund raiser, who were awarded honorary knighthoods.  </P> <P> Honors range from peerages and knighthoods at the top of the scale to MBEs  (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) and BEMs (British  Empire Medal) at the lower level.  </P> <P> When the Beatles received MBEs in 1965, other recipients of the award sent back  their gongs in protest.  </P> <P> Peerages (usually life barons) and knighthoods (known as a "K") generally go to  retiring political, government, and military officials as well as heavy  contributors to the ruling party.  </P> <P> From a certain British point of view, one virtue of a peerage (Lord Smyth) or  knighthood (Sir John Smyth) is that the wife of the recipient may formally be  addressed as Lady Smyth instead of Mrs. Smyth.  </P> <P> Somewhere in between orders of knighthoods come those awards more truly  concerned with achievement: the Order of Merit, limited to 24 members, and the  Companion of Honor.  </P> <P> Towards the lower end of the scale, awards are given to sports figures like  snooker champ Steve Davis and England soccer coach Bobby Robson, and to  government retainers for a lifetime of dedicated service: a doorman at No. 10  Downing Street or a personal maid at Buckingham Palace.  </P> <P> By far the most numerous awards in the Queen's List go to middle-level  government employees: heads of city government, assistant ministers in  departments, serving officers and diplomats, postmasters, police officers,  senior teachers and those involved in charitable work.  </P> <P> All recipients of awards are entitled to put the initials after their names in  descending order of precedence. Hence, former Foreign Secretary Lord  Carrington, KG (Knight of the Garter), CH (Companion of Honor), KCMG (Knight  Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George), MC (Military Cross), PC  (Privy Counselor).  </P> <P> Most royal orders have several degrees: The Order of the British Empire, for  instance, has Knight (or Dame) Grand Cross, Knight Commander, Commander,  Officer, and Member.  </P> <P> When author Nancy Mitford was given a CBE, she remarked: "I didn't think there  was a BE any longer."  </P> <P> The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George is generally  reserved for foreign service officers. The degrees are referred to around the  Foreign Office, in ascending order, as CMG (Call Me God); KCMG (Kindly Call Me  God); GCMG (God Calls Me God).  </P> <P> The top order of knighthood is The Most Noble Order of the Garter, founded in  1348, whose 24 members are personally selected by the queen, and include former  Labor Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan.  </P> <P> One gruff old duffer who was a friend of the Royal Family, on being named a KG,  reportedly remarked: "What I like about it is there's no bloody nonsense about  merit."  </P> <P> Most recipient of honors receive them personally from the queen in an  investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace that may come several weeks after the  announcement, depending on the numbers of the awards and her schedule.  </P> <P> Though egalitarian critics may deplore it, the honors system follows a hallowed  British tradition: The aristocracy itself is based on the fact that monarchs  have always rewarded favorites -- competent or not -- with titles, lands and  privileges.  </P> <P> In fact, the custom of awarding knighthoods can be traced back to the 9th  Century under King Albert the Great. On inheriting the crown in 1603, James VI  of Scotland created 906 knights within four months, dubbing 46 before breakfast  on one morning alone.  </P> <P> Earlier this century, Prime Minister David Lloyd George openly sold honors as a  way of raising funds for his Liberal Party. His bagman, Maundy Gregory,  flagrantly listed the going rate for peerages at 100,000 pounds, then about  $500,000; baronetcies (heredity knighthoods) at 30,000 pounds, and knighthoods  at 10,000 pounds.  </P> <P> The resulting uproar led King George V to declare Lloyd George's freewheeling  style with honors an insult to the monarchy, and a Political Honors Scrutiny  Committee was set up to evaluate submissions.  </P> <P> The Labor governments also did not award heredity peerages but created only  barons for life; the title does not pass through the male line as is customary  for lords.  </P> <P> Peers sit in the House of Lords and range from dukes, through marquesses,  earls, viscounts and barons. Sir Winston Churchill, KG, was reportedly offered  a dukedom but declined in order to sit in his beloved House of Commons.  </P> <P> Thatcher restored the practice of granting honors for political service to  faithful Tory party retainers and contributors, and she also recommended three  heredity peerages: the traditional earldom for former Prime Minister Harold  Macmillan (Wilson and Callaghan accepted only life peerages) and viscountcies  for former Deputy Prime Minister William Whitelaw and former Speaker of the  House George Thomas.  </P></p>

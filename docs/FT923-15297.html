			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Growth fears depress dollar THE DOLLAR yesterday cont-inued its run of weakness amid fears about the pace of the US economic recovery, writes Peter Marsh. While some international investors switched money out of dollars on speculation that the US Federal Reserve might soon sanction a cut in borrowing rates, the D-Mark was relatively strong due to unease in financial markets about progress towards European currency union. The US currency's weakness was triggered mainly by news of an unexpectedly sharp drop in an index of economic activity compiled by the National Association of Purchasing Management. This fell to 52.8 last month from 56.3 in May, indicating relative gloom about economic prospects. After President George Bush's comments last week that he would like to see lower US interest rates, this led to some bullishness about imminent action by the Fed. But a contrasting argument is that the US central bank may refrain from changing borrowing costs, if only to show its unwillingness to bow to political rhetoric. The dollar ended in London at DM1.517, down more than  1/2 pfennig from Tuesday's DM1.5235 close. It had fallen to DM1.51 earlier in the day, within striking distance of this year's low point of DM1.5045. In New York the dollar rallied to finish at DM1.5236. The US unit also declined against sterling, which finished at Dollars 1.911, compared with Dollars 1.904 previously, while against the yen, the dollar slipped to Y124.9 from Y125.85. The dollar improved in New York to end at Y125.35, with the UK currency at Dollars 1.9045. The pound was finally quoted in London unchanged against the D-Mark at DM2.9, but many dealers are unenthusiastic about the possibilities of gains by the UK currency in the coming weeks. It is still the weakest unit in the European exchange rate mechanism. A combination of worrying news about the UK economy and fears that the Maastricht deal on European union might unravel has unsettled many sterling investors. 'The pound is going to be vulnerable to jitters in the short term,' said Mr Ifty Islam, a currency specialist at UK investment house Barclays de Zoete Wedd. The French franc ended at FFr3.364 to the D-Mark, from FFr3.365 the previous night, while the Italian lira, second weakest member of the ERM, eased to L756.6 against the D-Mark from L756.2. Fourteen banks, including Barclays, Commerzbank, Midland, and Hongkong Bank, have set up a foreign exchange clearing house in London. In Budapest, Hungary's first interbank foreign exchange market made a cautious start. Less than Dollars 10m changed hands but the National Bank of Hungary said it was pleased.</p>

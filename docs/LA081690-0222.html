			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOW TO ADOPT A BEACH  </P> <P> Caution! Walking along Orange County's coastline can be hazardous to your  health.  </P> <P> Shards of glass jut out from the shoreline, poised to puncture an unsuspecting  instep. Sharp slivers of metal, hidden beneath sand, await a heel digging in to  chase a volleyball, Frisbee or smash ball. Plastic debris -- including six-pack  holders, garbage bags and sandwich baggies -- is everywhere, despite the hazard  it poses to ocean animals mistaking plastic for food.  </P> <P> To combat the forces of garbage overtaking the California coastline, the  California Coastal Commission has created a statewide Adopt-A-Beach Program,  which relies on volunteers pitching in to remove trash from the beaches. Any  person or group can adopt a section of the beach to clean three times a year.  </P> <P> Last year, 31,332 items of garbage were collected from Orange County beaches,  according to Lisa Hybarger, spokeswoman for the Coastal Commission. Only about  10% of the trash gathered was recyclable glass and aluminum cans. Another 75%  of the beach debris that volunteers dredged from the sand was plastic.  Cigarette butts and other miscellaneous trash made up the rest.  </P> <P> A statewide Coastal Cleanup Day is planned for next Saturday. On that day,  everyone who has adopted a beach and anyone else who is interested is invited  to get together for a day of cleaning up and enjoying one of Orange County's  most valuable natural resources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> To adopt a beach:  </P> <P> * Contact the public information office of the state Coastal Commission in  Sacramento and request an Adopt-A-Beach application and adoption agreement. The  phone number is (415) 543-8555.  </P> <P> * The Coastal Commission will verify that the beach you (or your group) has  chosen is adoptable, or the commission may suggest another beach that needs  adopting.  </P> <P> * Upon receiving the completed adoption agreements, the Coastal Commission will  register your group as the adopter of that beach.  </P> <P> * Contact the beach manager at your adopted beach listed below. All future  cleanup dates, location and logistics for beach cleanups will be coordinated  with the beach manager.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adoptable beaches:  </P> <P> MAIN BEACH, LAGUNA BEACH  </P> <P> Beach Manager: Terry Brandt  </P> <P> Phone: (714) 497-3311  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON, BOLSA CHICA AND CRYSTAL COVE STATE BEACHES  </P> <P> Beach Manager: Ken Smith  </P> <P> Phone: (714) 536-1454  </P> <P> DANA POINT, CAPISTRANO, ALISO AND SUNSET BEACHES, SALT CREEK BEACH PARK AND  SANTA ANA RIVER JETTY COUNTY BEACH  </P> <P> Beach Manager: Michael Gaughan  </P> <P> Phone: (714) 497-8287  </P> <P> DOHENY, SAN CLEMENTE AND SAN ONOFRE STATE BEACHES  </P> <P> Beach Manager: Ginny McVickar  </P> <P> Phone: (714) 496-6172  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON CITY BEACH  </P> <P> Beach Manager: Jim Way  </P> <P> Phone: (714) 536-5287  </P> <P> Source: California Coastal Commission and 1989 Beach Cleanup Results compiled  by the Center for Marine Conservation APRIL JACKSON  </P></p>

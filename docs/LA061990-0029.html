			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE SAYS CITIES CAN'T BAN MALATHION  MISSIONS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Superior Court Judge David Yaffe issued a court order Monday  stopping the cities of Azusa, Lynwood and Pasadena from enforcing ordinances  designed to stop aerial malathion spraying by banning low-altitude formation  flying.  </P> <P> Yaffe granted a request from the state for a preliminary injunction, saying  that local ordinances cannot restrict the state during emergency eradication  programs, such as the one developed for the 11-month-old Medfly infestation in  Southern California.  </P> <P> The ordinances led to a series of polite aerial confrontations earlier this  year between local police helicopters and the state's squadron of helicopters,  which need to fly low and in formation to conduct malathion spraying. Pasadena  police issued two citations against the state's pilots for violating a city  ordinance. The cases are pending.  </P></p>

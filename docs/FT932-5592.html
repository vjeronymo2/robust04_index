			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / OECD Ministerial Meeting: Asia-Pacific nations find new champion in Japan JAPAN is using its influence in the OECD to press for greater international support for developing nations, and is pushing itself forward as the champion of other Asia-Pacific nations. Japanese officials said they expected Tokyo to increase its development aid budget for the next five years from the Dollars 50bn (Pounds 32.4bn) for the five years ended April this year. The officials said the Japanese delegation at this week's annual ministerial meeting of the OECD planned to promote the interests of Asian developing nations and urge the OECD, when relations between the organisation and non-member countries are discussed today, to become more involved in the region's economic development. Tokyo is expected to support South Korea's application for full membership of the OECD, which was submitted last month. According to officials, Mr Kabun Muto, Japanese foreign minister, will also urge the OECD to: Conduct an analysis of economic developments in China. Support Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in their transition from communism to a free market economy. Develop further the supply of know-how and other assistance to the Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. Japan is also expected to voice support for the so-called dynamic Asian economies of south-east Asia in talks on the OECD's links with non-member countries. Tokyo's decision to champion the region at the talks indicates it will stress its role as the region's premier economic power at the Group of Seven's Tokyo summit next month.</p>

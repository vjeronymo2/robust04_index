			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Low activity puts AH Ball in loss Low activity levels in the early part of the current year meant AH Ball Group, the civil engineer, turned in a pre-tax loss of Pounds 40,000 for the six months to September 30, against a Pounds 407,000 profit last time. An inflow of orders in June helped the AH Ball subsidiary to raise turnover by 48 per cent to Pounds 2.98m in a group total of Pounds 4.15m (Pounds 2.89m). The subsidiary's margins, however, were reduced from 33.3 per cent to 22.7 per cent and pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 360,000 to Pounds 233,000, which Mr Tom Austin, chairman, said reflected a lack of volume in the early months. Setting up costs associated with beginning five new contracts and tighter margins due to increased competition also contributed to the decline. Mr Austin expected an improvement in second-half turnover, but margins would continue to be depressed by poor work mix and competitive factors. KD Process International incurred a Pounds 157,000 loss (Pounds 142,000 profit for two months), on sales of Pounds 1.16m (Pounds 874,000). Mr Austin said that early in the current year a review of this operation was taken, which resulted in lower direct and administrative costs. However, in view of continuing low sales volumes, a second review in the current quarter has further reduced KD's costs and Mr Austin said he believed that 'we have the correct size of organisation to successfully compete within the company's market.' Overall, he expected the group to perform better in the second six months. With losses per share at 0.2p (3.48p earnings), the company is paying an interim dividend of 1p (2.2p) from reserves.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Israel told to start withdrawal by April 13 or risk peace talks The Middle East peace process could collapse if Israel does not begin its withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by April 13, the original date for completing the pullout, a senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation warned yesterday. But Mr Ahmad Quorieh, one of the chief Palestinian architects of the PLO-Israeli declaration of principles, said he believed the PLO could not resume negotiations on implementing the declaration unless Israel agreed to discuss the future of Jewish settlements in the occupied territories. The PLO also wanted further guarantees by Israel for the protection of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The assessment of Mr Quorieh, a senior member of the PLO executive committee, came as Israel began freeing 500 Palestinian prisoners yesterday in a further attempt to win back the PLO to peace talks after last Friday's Hebron mosque massacre. The government also offered compensation to Palestinian victims and said up to 100 Jewish settlers would be disarmed. PLO leaders in the occupied territories said the gestures were insufficient. They added that Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, would have to stay away from direct peace talks with Israel for at least two to four weeks to assuage Palestinian outrage at the Hebron killings. The PLO demands for peace talks to resume include the disarmament of all 120,000 settlers and the dismantling of some of the more extremist ideological settlements such as Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong Jewish community just outside Hebron where Dr Baruch Goldstein, who carried out last Friday's massacre of 43 moslems, lived. Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, said Israel could meet demands such as disarming extremist settlers and preventing their movement into some sensitive areas, allowing the deployment of an unarmed international force in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for a short period and increasing the Palestinian police force for Gaza-Jericho from 8,000 to 10,000. However, he said the government rejected PLO demands for disarming all settlers and dismantling some settlements. One or more PLO leaders are expected to fly to Washington within days to discuss with the US administration the PLO's demands. The PLO was, meanwhile, hoping the United Nations Security Council would call on Israel to accept an 'international presence' in the territories. As the release of Palestinian prisoners got underway, clashes erupted for a fourth day throughout the occupied territories. And in a possible sign of reprisals spreading to the west, a man described as an Arab shot three ultra-orthodox Jewish youths in New York. Although he was heard to shout 'Kill the Jews,' police said a traffic dispute may have sparked the incident. No fatalaties were immediately confirmed.

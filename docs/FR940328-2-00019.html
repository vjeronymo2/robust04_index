			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> September 21, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=26 g=1 f=1 --> For the Record: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> From: MIC/AM WSFO PHI/MT. HOLLY_Chet Henricksen <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subject: The NWSFO PHL move to Mt. Holly <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> On August 23, 1993, the forecast office moved from center city Philadelphia to Mt. Holly, New Jersey. The move was approximately 21 miles. This is a summary of the move and the things that we've learned. Each move is different, with separate problems. We can all learn from each individual move scenario. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The equipment and furniture move_Significant damage occurred to our SWIS and AFOS system due to improper handling during the move. We estimate approximately 10 thousand dollars in damages due to dropped and damaged equipment. A more experienced computer equipment mover should have been used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations: The area manager should have an active role in the selection of the equipment mover with EASC oversight. The mover should have a history of successful computer moves. The computer equipment should be loaded last and off loaded first. The delivery of non-computer equipment to the new sight should be delayed to allow for setup of moved computer systems. The placement and handling of office and computer equipment requires at least two dedicated NWS oversight personnel. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Communications_All AFOS lines and telephone lines were laid prior to the move. The AFOS DEMARC from the center city WSFO was hand carried to the new office, and put in place in a couple of hours. The new lines already in place in the office had to be connected to the AFOS DEMARC. There was a circuit routing change required by SMCC in addition to normal re-connection. This effected all asynchronous circuits. An attempt was made to reroute all asynchronous circuits in the DEMARC. This was only partially successful. The end result was a significant delay in asynchronous service. The RDC and SDC could not be checked prior to the move other than to confirm that the new lines were active. Problems arose in data distribution checks after AFOS was reconnected. This further delayed return from full service backup. NWWS and NU IFLOWS saw significant delays. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations: Standardized new DEMARC boxes should be available prior to a move, with all cables and wiring accomplished prior to the move. All required changes in the DEMARC should be done well in advance, and available to the office for installation to the new location prior to the physical move. Assistance from person(s) at another management area, which has accomplished a similar move should be  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> required <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> . Expertise and experience of NWS personnel should be fully utilized. We need a design review of the satellite antenna plot to stabilize the system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Telephone Systems_The switch over from the old telephone line numbers to the new was not smooth. The old telephone numbers were still active for over one week following the move. The public ring through answering machine failed, probably due to an internal power supply failure. This occurred on power up at the new location. Additionally, the ring through telephone number did not properly switch over to the New Jersey number as planned. It was more than two weeks after the move, when we discovered that Bell Atlantic had not passed the work request on to Bell of Pennsylvania to accomplish a ``roll over'' number for Pennsylvania callers. The three 800 telephone numbers failed to ``roll over'' to the New Jersey numbers as designed. In an attempt to keep the 800 numbers and ring through number changes transparent to the user, unforeseen delays occurred in incoming calls to the new office. Numerous public complaints were filed due to telephones not being answered (due to the numerous switch over problems). The learning curve on the NorthStar telephone system was slow. This lead to an added irritant during and shortly following the move. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations: If the new lines are connected and operational, the old FTS 2000 lines should be disconnected by GSA within twenty-four hours of the move. A voice intercept should be used for approximately thirty days on the old telephone numbers announcing the new telephone number. With at least four telephone companies involved in an interstate move, you can be assured of delays and errors in timing, and implementation of telephone numbers. A comparable spare answering machine should be available for on site use in the event of the primary system failure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Environmental Systems_The condenser units on two of the three air conditioners flooded the ceiling and hallway of the new office on four separate occasions. The problem turned out to be a defect under recall by the manufacturer that had to be accomplished by the local service installers. The humidifier unit flooded the ceiling tiles twice. This appears to be an engineering problem with the circulation system in the humidifier. we have a temporary fix in place, but no permanent solution is available. The thermostatic control for the three air handlers is a computer. A password and system training is necessary to operate and control the temperature environment in all but the equipment room. The password was not made available until two weeks after the move. Training is still not accomplished. The computer control unit failed due to a near by lightning strike. This caused the entire environmental system to fail. A telephone line was installed three weeks after the move. This established contractor remote access to the computer control. The environmental controller was placed on UPS three weeks after the move. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Recommendations: Communications of recalls and equipment modification lists must be improved. Facility problems experienced at this location, are likely to be repeated at other NWS facilities. All environmental computer control units should be placed on UPS in all NWS facilities. Passwords and training for the control units should be supplied within 48 hours of building occupancy. Remote access to the control unit via telephone lines should be completed prior to the move. A permanent fixed needs to be found for the humidifier problem. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many things did go well with the move. I have listed the problem areas. This was done in an attempt to help other offices in their move. I am open for questions and clarifications of these and other issues at anytime. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> cc: Susan F.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature] </F>   [Text] The visit of the head of the Greek Foreign Ministry  Karolas Papoulias to Moscow scheduled for May 3-5 "has been  postponed for an indefinite term." The new date is to be  coordinated via diplomatic channels, a top-ranking Russian  diplomat in charge for Greece reported to Interfax.    He does not rule out that the contact between Russian  Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Karolas Papoulias can take place in  Cairo.    As it is known, on Tuesday Kozyrev came to Cairo, the  Egyptian capital, to participate in signing of the agreement on  Gaza Strip and Jericho between Israel and Palestine as a  representative of the country-co-sponsor of the peaceful process  in the Middle East. "As far as Papoulias is concerned, his  presence in Cairo is also obligatory because at present Greece  chairs the European Union," said Interfax interlocutor.</p>

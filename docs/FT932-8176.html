			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Equality body faces staff protest EQUAL Opportunities Com-mission staff are to stage a protest today over staffing levels. The demonstration outside the commission's Manchester headquarters has been timed to coincide with the first visit by Ms Kamlesh Bahl, the commission's new chair. The NUCPS and CPSA Civil Service unions are objecting to the loss of some low-paid support jobs at the same time as the creation of what are claimed to be new jobs at senior management level.</p>

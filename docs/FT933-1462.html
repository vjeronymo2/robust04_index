			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / International Company News: US group buys east German paper maker DRESDEN Papier, one of eastern Germany's largest paper manufacturers, has been bought by Mercer International, of the US, to establish a foothold in Germany's expanding market for paper recycling and production, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The sale of Dresdner Papier, which last year recorded a turnover of DM141m (Dollars 87m), and produced more than 200,000 tons of paper, also means that the eastern state of Saxony is set to become one of the major centres for pulp, paper, and recycling production in the region. Mercer International will invest more than DM80m over the next three years. The purchase price was not disclosed.</p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The creative department is brought to account - French media agencies are fuming over efforts to clean them up 'This is the most ludicrous piece of legislation I've ever seen,' said the head of one leading Paris advertising agency. 'It's a scandal,' snarled another. 'If this thing actually becomes law, it'll be a disaster, the industry will never survive,' said a third. The object of their scorn is the apparently laudable attempt of the French government to crack down on business corruption, one of the first initiatives announced by Pierre Beregovoy when he became prime minister in the spring. The first fruits of Beregovoy's campaign were unveiled last week when Michel Sapin, his successor as finance minister, produced la loi Sapin, his proposals to stamp out dubious practices in a number of industries - including advertising. Sapin's aim is to clean up the ad industry by making sure that advertising agencies and media buyers are thoroughly accountable for the money they spend on their clients' behalf. One target of la loi Sapin is 'undisclosed discounting', whereby large French agencies and media buyers use their power to negotiate bulk buying discounts - anything from 20 to 50 per cent of the full price - from media owners and do not pass all, or any, of the money on to their clients. Another is 'double invoicing', whereby the agencies ask the media owner for two invoices - one for the client, which does not reveal the discount, and a second showing the real value of the deal. The government's solution is to try to eliminate both practices by insisting that media owners are paid directly by the clients and separating the functions of the media buyers, who book space for ad campaigns, and media brokers, who buy space and sell it on to their own clients. To an objective observer this all seems eminently sensible. The French advertising industry has, after all, always had a slightly risque reputation. Undisclosed discounting and double invoicing have long been common industry practice. To some extent they are the predictable product of any self-regulated industry where large sums of money change hands. The big US and UK agencies are wont to be snooty about business standards in France, but similar practices are rife in New York and London. Until recently, the French government was prepared to turn a blind eye. But the advertising industry has expanded so fast in the past decade and the scale of media buying deals is now so much bigger, that the authorities have been forced to act. France is the world's fifth largest advertising market, worth just under FFr48bn (Pounds 5bn) last year. The market has been transformed since the late 1980s, mainly due to the government's television deregulation drive which has included the privatisation of TF1, the biggest single station, the creation of three new private channels, as well as the development of a cable and pay-TV network. The press has also been expanding. This has made media buying more complex and more competitive, thereby enhancing the potential to play one media owner off against another through negotiation. A new breed of specialist media buyers has emerged, notably Carat, which has built on its original base in France to become Europe's biggest single buying group. Other large agencies have responded by joining forces to pool their media buying. French media buying is now dominated by four players - Carat, the Euro:RSCG agencies and two agency consortia, PMS and The Media Partnership - with a collective market share of 70 per cent. The emergence of these big buying groups has intensified the pressure on smaller agencies, as well as on the media owners. The government's first response was to initiate an inquiry into the media buying system by the Conseil de la Concurrence, the competition authority. The conseil delivered its preliminary report earlier this summer and is expected to produce final proposals within the next few months. La loi Sapin is an unexpected addition to the legislative changes facing the industry. The large agencies and media buying groups are furious. Delegations of fuming advertising executives have already complained to the finance ministry. Publicly the agencies refuse to comment on la loi Sapin. Privately they accuse the finance ministry's proposals of everything from failing to understand the mechanics of their business, to being an unwarranted intrusion into their affairs. Some of the complaints are justified. The division between media broking and buying, for instance, may be difficult to implement. It is not clear how the government proposes to structure the new system - whether broking and buying would be conducted by completely separate companies, or if they could be executed by different subsidiaries within the same group. Sapin's proposals are similarly ambiguous in the details of implementing other measures. In other respects the advertising industry appears to be attempting to defend the indefensible. It remains to be seen whether the government will heed the industry's objections. La loi Sapin enters its second stage on Wednesday when it will be discussed by the French cabinet, followed by a full parliamentary debate next month.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report by V.S.: "Too Little By Far"] </F>   [Text] The question of how much light per day the  population is entitled to has clearly required clarification  lately, and on the official level at that. Over the past few  days the editorial offices have been inundated with rumors of an  energy ration increase.    Armenergo chief controller Mr. Martirosyan told a RESPUBLIKA  ARMENIA correspondent absolutely officially that the limit on  electric power supplied to the capital city residents remains  two hours. To the question as to whether an increase in the  power supply is expected in the near future, he offered no  comment--either positive or negative. Although we have to admit  that this would be of little help to those who do not get even  the allotted two hours a day.</p>

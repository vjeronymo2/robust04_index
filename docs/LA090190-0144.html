			<p><P> September 1, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> SCHOOLS TO BEEF UP BILINGUAL PROGRAMS  </P> <P> In an effort to better address the needs of Latino and Asian students, the  Ocean View School District plans to spend more money on bilingual programs and  desegregate a school with a predominantly Latino population.  </P> <P> The district is spending an additional $138,000 to increase the number of  bilingual teachers and expand programs aimed at helping students with a limited  knowledge of English. The extra spending boosts the district's bilingual  education budget from $255,000 to $393,000.  </P> <P> And earlier this month, the school board appointed a 42-member committee to  devise a plan for desegregating Oak View School, which is about 75% Latino. The  committee of parents, teachers, community representatives, administrators and  other school officials, will propose a plan to the board in December that could  include busing and boundary changes.  </P> <P> The two-pronged approach aims to ease pressure from state education agencies  and local activists who say the district needs to do more to meet the needs of  limited-English students. By the end of the 1989-90 school year, Ocean View was  the only district in Orange County that had not satisfied state requirements to  recruit and train more bilingual teachers. The district has since devised a  plan that complies with state mandates.  </P> <P> Ocean View, which last year had only nine instructors qualified to teach more  than 1,100 limited-English students, has doubled its bilingual teaching staff  for 1990-91, Assistant Supt. Joseph Condon said. In November, four more  teachers will attempt to become certified.  </P> <P> More than one-third of the additional spending will be used to add five  bilingual teacher's aides to classrooms. The rest of the new money will be used  to expand bilingual programs, buy about $20,000 in materials for  limited-English speaking students, and train more bilingual teachers.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the newly appointed Oak View Integration Advisory Committee will  begin meeting this month to study the racial imbalance among the school's  student population. At the beginning of last school year, Oak View Elementary,  near Beach Boulevard and Slater Avenue, had 618 students. The population was  70% Latino, 14% Asian, 14% white and 2% black, according to district figures.  JOHN PENNER  </P></p>

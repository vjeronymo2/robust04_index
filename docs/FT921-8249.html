			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / International Company News: Bow Valley posts CDollars 258m deficit after write-down LOWER OIL and gas prices combined with a large write-down to push Bow Valley Industries, the Canadian energy producer controlled by British Gas, into the red last year . The Calgary-based company's net loss was CDollars 258.7m (USDollars 219.2m), or CDollars 3.31 a share, compared with 1990 earnings of CDollars 49.7m, or 47 cents. Before a fourth-quarter write-down of CDollars 268.8m, last year's net income was CDollars 10.1m. The write-down stems from an annual comparison between the book value of Bow Valley's Canadian assets and expected future revenues based on constant prices. The company said the book value of its interests in Indonesia and the UK, centred on the Brae Field in the North Sea, remained unimpaired. Operating revenues fell by 24 per cent to CDollars 267m, due to lower production and prices. Oil output declined to 29,400 from 34,100 barrels a day, partly as a result of fourth-quarter maintenance work at Brae and disappointing drilling results at South Brae. Natural gas production slipped to 166.1m cu ft a day from 173.7m cu ft, while the average price was down to CDollars 1.46 per metric cubic foot from CDollars 1.51. British Gas has a 54 per cent stake in Bow Valley. The UK company announced earlier this month that it would soon spin off to the public 15 per cent of its Canadian distribution utility, Consumers Gas.</p>

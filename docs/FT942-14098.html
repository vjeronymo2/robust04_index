			<p>940421 FT  21 APR 94 / International Company News: Canadian assurers may link Great-West Life and Confederation Life, Canada's third and fourth-biggest life assurers, are negotiating an alliance under which Great-West could end up with a substantial stake in Confederation. Confederation, hit in recent years by heavy losses on its mortgage portfolio, said the talks were aimed at strengthening its capital base and creating a 'strategic alliance'. No details have been disclosed. The talks underline the upheaval in Canada's insurance sector, which has been caused by competition from other financial institutions. Recent regulatory reforms allow insurance companies to move into other sectors. Great-West is 86 per cent owned by Power Financial, the Montreal-based financial services group controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais. It posted a 72 per cent rise in net income last year to CDollars 196m (USDollars 142m). Great-West has assets of about CDollars 23bn. Confederation has assets of about CDollars 20bn, but profits fell to CDollars 1.9m in 1992 from CDollars 105.7m in 1990.</p>

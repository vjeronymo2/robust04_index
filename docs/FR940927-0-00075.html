			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With the exceptions listed below, the Director finds the proposed amendment as augmented by the administrative record information submitted with this amendment, and as clarified by Virginia by letter dated May 12, 1994, is no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816/817.116(c)(4). This finding is made with the understanding that the policy statement to be issued by Virginia concerning normal husbandry practices will be identical in meaning to the draft language of that policy statement submitted to OSM by letter dated May 12, 1994. The Director is not approving as normal husbandry practice the reseeding of large blocks of areas made barren by poor reclamation, or where the reestablished vegetation has not been in place for a sufficient length of time for Virginia to make a valid determination of the success of the reclamation at the time of bond release. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4. VR &sect;480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.151(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virginia proposes to revise this section by changing the title from ``Embankments'' to ``Safety factor,'' and by changing the language in (b)(1) to (1) reference ``organic material'' rather than ``vegetative material,'' and (2) add the phrase ``or other unsuitable material.'' These changes were proposed by Virginia in response to an issue letter from OSM dated March 20, 1991 (Administrative Record No. VA&hyph;792). The issue letter refers to the proposed program amendment submitted by Virginia on October 1, 1990, as discussed herein at II. Submission of Amendment. In that letter, OSM also asked Virginia to amend this rule to reflect that keyway cuts extend a minimum of two feet below the toe of the fill and that material placed in road embankments will be within acceptable moisture content levels. In its current submission, Virginia did not make the suggested changes, but provided clarification intended to show that its current regulations adequately address OSM's concerns. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Virginia's Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME) interprets its existing regulations to require keyway cuts beneath embankments on steep slopes to provide for stability of road embankments. The design of the keyway will be prepared by, or under the direction of, the applicant's registered professional engineer and will be reviewed by a DMME engineer. A minimum width of ten feet is specified and the keyway must be sloped inward in all cases. While other specifications may be proposed by the applicant or required by DMME, taking into account the conditions of the site, DMME believes the general requirement that keyway cuts be constructed at the toe of the road fills on steep slopes and the specific width and slope standards provide sufficient detail to ensure road embankment stability in most site specific cases. However, DMME interprets its regulations to require appropriate design given unusual site specific conditions. DMME retains the authority to require a keyway that has a two foot minimum depth below the toe of a road fill embankment as necessary when the foundations of the embankment is located in bedrock. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DMME also feels that its current regulations adequately address OSM's concerns regarding moisture content of materials placed in road embankments on steep slopes. According to DMME, its regulations require such road embankments to be constructed in uniform compacted layers. In order to achieve a desired degree of compaction, materials must be placed within the acceptable range of moisture content. The DMME interprets its rule to embody the requirement that materials must be within the acceptable range of moisture content if the larger performance standard, that of placement in compacted layers, is to be achieved. DMME believes that its existing regulation is as effective as the Federal regulation. The Director finds that based upon the March 20, 1991, letter and the clarification provided by Virginia, that VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.151(b)(1) through (4) as set forth in Virginia's October 22, 1993, submission is consistent with the Federal rules set forth at 30 CFR 816/817.151, 780.37(c) and 784.24(c). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 5. VR &sect;480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.152 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Virginia proposes to revise the language of this rule relating to the waiver of design standards for existing roads. As originally submitted on October 22, 1993, the proposed language could be read to imply that existing roads do not have to meet the performance standards of VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.150 and 816/817/151. In its issue letter dated February 23, 1994, OSM suggested new language which would resolve the controversy. In its March 16, 1994, response to the issue letter, Virginia revised the proposed language consistent with OSM's suggestion. The current proposal provides that where existing roads that are to be used meet the performance standards of 816/817.150 and 816/817.151 and it can be demonstrated that reconstruction to meet the design standards of those provisions would result in greater environmental harm, the Division may waive the design requirements. Therefore, the Director finds that the provisions of VR 480&hyph;03&hyph;19.816/817.152, as revised on March 16, 1994, are not inconsistent with the requirements of 30 CFR 701.11(e) which allow existing structures that meet the performance standards but not the design requirements to be exempt from meeting the design requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> MCI Reduces Rates: MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance carrier, is  trimming its rates 1.5%, effective immediately. The company said it made the  move to maintain a pricing advantage over American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.  AT&amp;T recently lowered some of its rates under a new federal government  policy that gives the dominant carrier some flexibility in setting its own  rates.  </P></p>

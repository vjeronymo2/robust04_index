			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH : TWO CITIES WOO ODYSSEY IN HUNT FOR SPACE; ANOTHER CHAPTER IN  ACTORS' WAIVER LAWSUIT  </P> <P> On the move:  </P> <P> The Odyssey Theatre Ensemble must leave its quarters in West Los Angeles by the  end of June. The new owner of the building at Santa Monica Boulevard and Bundy  Drive reportedly plans to lease it to a tenant who will convert it into a video  rental emporium.  </P> <P> A total triumph for canned entertainment over live theater?  </P> <P> Not quite. The Odyssey, moving into its 20th anniversary season, will relocate,  although its next address is still unknown.  </P> <P> "We're madly scampering about for an interim site," said Odyssey artistic  director Ron Sossi. The company has been looking for a new permanent site for  some time, but now "we've got to get something locked in by March 15," said  Sossi. "We want to re-open in July, so we want to get in (to the new space) by  May 1. That will give us two months to convert it."  </P> <P> The conversion will be a big job, for none of the sites currently under  consideration is an existing theater -- and the Odyssey "will try to cram in  three theaters (the number of spaces in the Odyssey's present building)  wherever we go."  </P> <P> Sossi's loyalties are divided between Santa Monica and Los Angeles. Santa  Monica has been aggressively pursuing the Odyssey -- to the extent that Dennis  Zane, the city's mayor, has personally driven around town, searching for a  site. "The community and the Odyssey have a nice fit," said Zane.  </P> <P> Los Angeles offers the lure of the new Los Angeles Endowment for the Arts as a  potential funding source. "We require some sort of community subsidy," said  Odyssey board president Dan Attias. Several Los Angeles city council members  are assisting the Odyssey's search for a Los Angeles site.  </P> <P> Two possible sites are in each city. One of the Los Angeles sites -- a  warehouse at Westgate and Mississippi, just north of Olympic Blvd. -- isn't far  from where the theater is now. It would require a rent increase (over the  $6,000 the Odyssey pays now) "for considerably less space," said Sossi -- but  at least it's immediately available.  </P> <P> The other Los Angeles site, a garage at 2055 Sepulveda Blvd., would not be  available until mid-summer -- and would therefore necessitate the rental of a  temporary home while conversion to a theater took place. But it's a likelier  permanent site than the warehouse. Because the garage is currently owned by the  city, it would open up opportunities for a subsidy.  </P> <P> In Santa Monica, Sossi's favorite site is the Santa Monica Airport, where an  old hangar is a possibility. The city would arrange a low-rent deal for the  airport site, if it becomes available.  </P> <P> Another possibility would be the incorporation of the theater into several of  the new developments along the Santa Monica Mall. But these buildings aren't  large enough to accommodate three theaters plus support facilities, so the  Odyssey operations would have to be split among several locations.  </P> <P> Sossi said the Odyssey will not leave the West Side, where most of its audience  lives. However, Attias added that the theater might move to temporary quarters  in Hollywood while a new permanent home is being arranged or converted.  </P> <P>  -- The Padua Hills Playwrights Festival has found a new home. The encampment  of playwrights and students, who have recently migrated to a new venue each  year, will dig in at Cal State Northridge this summer.  </P> <P> The base of operations will be Cal State Northridge's Art and Design Center, on  the north side of the campus, though the theater department facilities on the  south side of the campus may be used for student readings. The university will  provide "a minimal amount of housing, enough to accommodate the staff people  from out of town," said Padua Hills artistic director Murray Mednick. Several  university students will study with the Padua Hills faculty and/or be hired as  technical assistants.  </P> <P> The program will begin in late June, with alfresco public performances of six  to eight plays in late July and early August. The Art and Design Center "has an  interesting look, especially at night," said Mednick. "Modernist but not  concrete. It's a tempting look."  </P> <P> The Padua Hills faculty this year will include Jon Robin Baitz, Eduardo  Machado, David Henry Hwang, John Steppling, John O'Keefe, Julie Hebert, Martin  Epstein, Leon Martell and Lin Hixson.  </P> <P>  -- As previously reported, the Ensemble Studio Theatre is leaving its  two-theater home, the former Los Angeles Actors' Theatre near Santa Monica and  Western Avenue. Part of the group now plans to reconstitute at another  location, a former Equity Waiver theater on the West Side. Facing mounting  debts, the group may have to declare bankruptcy and re-organize under a new  name, but no definite decision has been made, said general manager Sean Orcutt.  </P> <P> RUMBLINGS: That lawsuit instigated against Actors' Equity last year by 15 actor  members dissatisfied with the manner in which the union went about modifying  the Waiver won't go away.  </P> <P> Plaintiffs George Ball, Barbara Beckley, Maria Gobetti, Adam Carl, Gary  Grossman, Salome Jens, Valerie Landsburg, Dorothy Lyman, Amanda McBroom, Allan  Miller, Greg Mullavey, Tom Ormeny, Linda Purl, Joseph Stern and Michael Wadler  recently made an offer to settle out of court. They outlined conditions mostly  designed to give some control over the new 99-Seat Theater Plan to local union  members. According to Jerome Birn, the plaintiffs' pro bono attorney, Equity  found "virtually all" of the proposal unacceptable, but officials offered to  "meet in person with the plaintiffs in the near future to discuss a  settlement."  </P> <P> "(What's disturbing is that) the union can unilaterally do whatever (it wants  to the plan) and never go back to the membership," Birn said. "Its position is  that the L.A. vote is informational and has no constitutional validity. Only  (Equity council in) New York decides."  </P> <P> Edward Weston, Equity's Western Regional Director, refused to comment. Union  attorney Leo Geffner is in Hawaii and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> In addition, "the union has taken the position that they want all (subpoenaed)  documents to be subject to a confidentiality agreement," Birn said. "I don't  see why."  </P> <P> A hearing with a magistrate on the confidentiality issue has been set for the  third week in March.  </P> <P> SUCH A DEAL: How much would you pay to see "Dutch Landscape" at the Mark Taper  Forum if you could name your price? On the first night of the Taper's new  "pay-what-you-want" policy Tuesday, 23 people paid as little as three cents and  as much as $10. Regular ticket prices are $20-$26.  </P> <P> Sylvie Drake also contributed to this column.  </P></p>

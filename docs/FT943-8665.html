			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Life on the edge as Confed collapse shakes up insurers: Bernard Simon sees nervousness in a Canadian industry A shiver has rippled through Canada's life insurance industry after last week's collapse of Confederation Life, the fourth biggest domestic insurer. Since regulators decided to take over Confederation last Thursday, pending the winding-up and liquidation of the Toronto-based company, other companies have rushed to reassure employees and policyholders that Confed is a special case and that its problems are not typical of the industry. Confed's businesses were relatively sound, but it was dragged down by a 1980s foray into property development and lending, with property making up more than 60 per cent of its investments. The concern remains, however, that the biggest failure of a life insurer in North America, involving a company with CDollars 19bn (Pounds 8.9bn) in balance sheet assets and CDollars 33bn in assets under management, could set off a chain of events. Canada's life insurance industry has for long enjoyed a solid reputation. The biggest companies, Manulife Financial (formerly Manufacturers Life), Sun Life of Canada and Canada Life, are strongly capitalised and have blue-chip credit ratings. The biggest companies are also diversified. More than two-thirds of Sun Life's assets under management are in the US. Manulife is the third biggest life underwriter in Hong Kong, and writes more business in Asia than in Canada. But pressures on the industry have been building. About 150 life companies compete in a stagnant market. Underwriting margins have narrowed so that many companies rely on investment income and diversification - into mutual funds, for instance - to keep them in the black. Standard &amp; Poor's said this month that while the nine biggest companies 'continue offering a high level of financial security', it expects to downgrade some credit ratings over the next few years. Although Confed was heavily exposed to property, the slump in North American property values has hit the entire industry. Even Sun Life suffered investment losses, mainly from its property portfolio, of CDollars 255m last year - a 66 per cent jump from 1992. The diminishing rewards of the Canadian insurance market are apparent in a spate of deals. New York Life earlier this year ended a 136-year presence in Canada by selling its operations to Canada Life. Sun Alliance sold its Canadian unit to North American Life at the end of May. More recently, the UK's Prudential group has sold its Canadian group life and health business, as well as its group pension-plan operations, to Sun Life. Several other foreign companies are rumoured to be struggling to find buyers. Regulatory curbs, such as a 25 per cent limit on foreign shareholdings, have also discouraged mergers and takeovers. Mr Mark Daniels, president of the Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association, says the Confed failure could speed rationalisation and predicts 'significantly fewer players' over the next five to 10 years. Confed's collapse may encourage Canada's six big banks to accelerate their drive into insurance, he adds. Several have bought insurance operations since the lifting of restrictions in mid-1992, but have yet to make an impact on the market. Meanwhile the industry is braced for a 'flight to quality'. Companies seen to be vulnerable could find it difficult to sell policies or attract savings and there is concern that some may have difficulty raising funds. Insurers also face a costly call for contributions to CompCorp, the industry's consumer-protection fund of which membership is compulsory. Unlike most deposit-insurance schemes, members are assessed for funds only after a member has been declared insolvent. The industry coughed up CDollars 180m in 1992-93 to pay policyholders of Les Cooperants, a Montreal-based company. Another CDollars 75m or so will be required to meet the obligations of Sovereign Life of Calgary, which failed in late 1992. These sums are likely to pale against CompCorp's obligations to Confed policyholders. What is especially galling to insurers is that depositors in the rash of Canadian trust companies which have failed have been compensated by the government, through the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation. Insurers now face a period of similar turmoil. But while taxpayers footed much of the trust industry's bill, insurers themselves will have to carry the burden for those who fall by the wayside. That prospect may provide a powerful incentive for stepping up the pace of mergers and acquisitions before more companies go the way of Confederation Life. Lex, Page 16; Credit ratings, Page 23</p>

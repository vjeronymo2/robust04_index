			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> United Technologies Carrier proposed a separate product class for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined space and water heater. Electricity-using design options are viable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for combination appliances, but would cause substantial increases in prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for gas water heater installations, and would inconvenience many customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (United Technologies Carrier, No. 84 at 1). The Florida Governor's Office and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Northwest Power Planning Council proposed a product class for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> desuperheater water heaters. These are popular in Florida and use waste heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from air conditioners. Therefore, they operate only during the cooling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> season. (Florida Governor's Office, No. 42 at 6, and Northwest Power Planning  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission, No. 32 at 2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Before the Department can consider combination space and water heating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appliances and desuperheating water heaters for regulation, test procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to be developed and adopted by DOE for such appliances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, appliances that provide combined services will be examined during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a forthcoming rulemaking on amended standards for central air conditioners and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> central air conditioning heat pumps.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Design options.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There were many comments on the design options for water heaters. A discussion of these comments follows below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Southern Gas Association and other gas companies provided price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimates of more efficient water heater designs. For water heaters with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy factors of 0.63, 0.74, and 0.54, the American Gas Association estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uninstalled prices of $667, $729, and $195, respectively. (Southern Gas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association No. 4 at 4; Energen Corp. and Alabama Gas Corp., No. 12 at 6;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> South Carolina Electric and Gas Co., No. 34 at 3; Montana-Dakota Utilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Co., No. 54 at 3; Oklahoma Natural Gas Company, No. 57 at 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Columbia Gas provided a comparison of design options, energy factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and retail prices for four designs of efficiencies of gas water heaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These were atmospheric draft/underfired (energy factor .54, $150-$350),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> atmospheric draft/subchamber (energy factor .62, $250-$500), forced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> draft/subchamber (energy factor .72, $600-$900), forced draft/immersed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chamber (energy factor .82, $1300-$1800). (Columbia Gas, No. 45 at 3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department used a retail price of $155.48 for the baseline model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with an energy factor of .54. This is based on a factory cost of $95.63  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. The 63 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> markup from factory cost to retail price was provided by the Lawrence Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model. Installation expense used in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis for the baseline model was $126.12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department included a standard venting, submerged combustion chamber  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heater with heat traps, reduced heat leaks and R&hyph;16 insulation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, with an estimated energy factor of .57. At large-scale production,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the submerged combustion chamber will not increase the factory cost. <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heat traps, reduced heat leaks, and R&hyph;16 insulation added $18.19 to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factory cost, for a total factory cost of $113.82. The Lawrence Berkeley  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model estimated a markup of about 57 percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a total retail price of $179.22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> This information was from Robert Cook who cited a study on projected costs done by A.O. Smith. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A model with an energy factor of .74 (calculated to have an energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factor of .71 using the proposed test procedure) was also included in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. This unit has 2 inches of foam insulation surrounding a plastic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tank, heat traps, indirect heating of the water, and electronic ignition. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department estimated the factory cost of this unit at large-volume production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be $344.41. This estimate was based on an estimated 16 percent reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in factory costs due to large-scale production. The retail price predicted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by Manufacturer Impact Model was $612.96, with a 78 percent markup.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A water heater with forced draft and submerged combustion chamber was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not analyzed. However, the Department did consider forced draft with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased baffling. An estimated incremental manufacturing cost of $312.50  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was supplied by the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association. Heat traps,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduced heat leaks, and R&hyph;16 insulation were also included on this unit for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> energy factor of .67 (calculated to have an energy factor of .66 using the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed test procedure). A total factory cost of $426.32 was used. A markup  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 40 percent from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory-Manufacturer Impact Model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was applied to arrive at a retail price of $596.83.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department was not aware of any existing designs or prototypes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water heaters with forced draft and immersed chambers. No analysis was done  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for this design option.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> CASHIERED CANDIDATE PLANNING COMEBACK  </P> <P> A week after being disqualified as a candidate for Canyon High School student  body president because he distributed condoms to classmates along with his  campaign literature, Patrick Lee is determined to make a political comeback.  </P> <P> Lee, 17, of Anaheim Hills, said Saturday that he will run for senior class  president in this month's school elections.  </P> <P> Ray Dunne, Canyon assistant principal, confirmed that Lee is eligible to run  for the office and said that the junior has already put his name on a  candidates sign-up list. Class elections are held separately from the student  body elections.  </P> <P> Lee was kicked off the ballot for student body president last week after he  passed out about 100 condoms, along with a flyer saying that a vote for him was  a "safe" vote. School officials said Lee violated an election oath he and the  other candidates made to run their campaigns in a tasteful and appropriate  manner.  </P> <P> While he decried the punishment as too extreme, Lee said he won't use condoms  in his upcoming campaign.  </P> <P> "I'm going to be more conservative but just as creative this time," Lee said.  "I have to go back to the Puritan days, according to my school."  </P> <P> Lee said the one-day condom handout was not in poor taste because Canyon High  School presented an assembly about safe sex and contraception just a month  earlier.  </P> <P> "I thought it was a brand new idea, and the school just stopped it," he said.  </P> <P> Perhaps the controversy did have a positive side for Lee. He admits that all  the publicity made him more popular around campus -- and perhaps more  electable.  </P> <P> "Most people at school know me now," Lee said. "I may run a more basic campaign  this time and just hand out candy." SHELBY GRAD  </P></p>

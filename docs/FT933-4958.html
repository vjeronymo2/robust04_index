			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Mostar evacuation delayed THE evacuation of some 50 wounded Moslems from the south-west Bosnian city of Mostar was postponed yesterday for the second day running, Bosnian radio reported, Reuter reports from Sarajevo. The radio reported yesterday evening that a general alert had been called in Mostar, where it said the besieged Moslem sector on the east bank of the Neretva river was being attacked by Croatian forces using multiple-rocket launchers. Croatian radio said the evacuation from Mostar had been postponed until today because of weather conditions. However, a Reuter journalist in Medjugorje, near Mostar, quoted members of the United Nations Spanish battalion deployed in the area as saying UN troops were awaiting the arrival of Bosnian helicopters that would fly the wounded to Moslem-held towns. The evacuation from Mostar was arranged between Moslems and Croats in exchange for the airlifting of wounded Croat soldiers and civilians from Nova Bila in central Bosnia, where fierce fighting is raging between the two former allies.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Berlin June 19 TASS -- A delegation of the Russian  State Duma led by the Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin ended its visit  to Germany on Sunday.    During the four-day visit Rybkin met with the German  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and German President Richard von  Weizacker, Bundestag Chairman Rita Suessmuth, government  officials, leaders of parliamentary factions and different  political parties.    Russian parliamentarians reached an agreement with their  German colleagues to develop close cooperation, primarily at the  level of the Duma committees and commissions of the German  Bundestag dealing with economic issues.    On the final day of the visit Russian lawmakers visited  Russian servicemen from the Berlin Brigade of Western Troops.  Addressing soldiers and officers of the Russian military  contingent who will be the last to abandon the German territory  in August, 1994, Rybkin declared that "their motherland would  welcome them with a generous heart." Rybkin pointed out that  looking into the state budget, lawmakers found "inner reserves"  for the Army's needs worth 3.5 trillion roubles. Apart from  that, funds are expected to be raised during the second stage of  privatisation beginning in July, which, according to experts'  estimates, will amount to 15-20 trillion roubles. The State  Duma has decided to use these funds, in particular, for the  construction of housing for servicemen and conversion projects,  Rybkin said.    Late on Sunday the delegation of the Russian parliament left  Berlin for Moscow.</p>

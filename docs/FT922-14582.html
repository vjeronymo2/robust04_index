			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Arts: Epsom Downs Bristol Old Vic until 25 April (0272) 250250. All are equal above, under and on the turf: discuss. That is what Howard Brenton's Epsom Downs sets out to do, testing the sentiment that the Derby belongs to everyone. The Bristol Old Vic energetically rekindles the jubilee flames of Brenton's 1977 social drama: this is a busy, fizzy evening, long on social comment and short on plot. Brenton has always leaned on contemporary events for dramatic matter. In 1980, A Short, Sharp, Shock was a kick at Tory misery; in 1985 came Pravda, a two-armed jab at Fleet Street with David Hare; and 1990 brought Moscow Gold and the trials of Mikhail Gorbachev. Brenton writes counter to the natural state of affairs in society. His dissident snap-shots of England tend to fade. But the Derby Day milieu for Epsom Downs does not date, only the participants. Behind Brenton's canvas stands that great Victorian picture by WP Frith. One of Brenton's characters says: 'England at peace on Derby Day, it's just a picture'. Through the frame, representatives of rooted English classes parade, bred to their station in life, at war with themselves and each other: gypsies, middle-class families, horse owners, aristocrats, life peers, tinkers, drunks, and the ghost of that 1913 Derby, the suffragette Emily Davison (run down on Tattenham corner by George V's colt, Anmer). Emily Davison's spirit presides over the brawling, betting and boozing like a national conscience. Hers is the only guiding voice. Elsewhere, Brenton touches on racing politics with a paean to Lord Wigg ('yanking the balls off the Jockey Club'), who established the Levy Board in 1962-63. Brenton's strength is caricature rather than debate: he never fears the obvious. The simple set supports this clear vision. Elgar's cello concerto drifts over a green sward; people and litter arrive, telling of a despoiled environment. The cast of nine under Ian Hastings' direction performs with zest and wit. Each takes several roles; Lesley Nicol as a worried mother, revivalist preacher, drunk and lunatic is consistently engaging, as is Nigel Betts as a grandfather, owner, bookmaker and horse. The Derby is a riot of incident, and the effects - simple and apt. Lester Piggott wins after a taxing run on The Minstrel.</p>

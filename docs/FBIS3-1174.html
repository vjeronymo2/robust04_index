Oelofse] </F>   [Text] Mmabatho March 21 SAPA -- The recently-appointed  joint administrators of Bophuthatswana released a report at the  weekend detailing their progress in the territory since the  violence which toppled President Lucas Mangope. Signed by  administrators Dr Job Mokgoro and Dr Tjaart van der Walt, the  report states the "administration is now in the process of  creating interim structures and mechanisms to address grievances  presented by existing structures".    On the heated issue of pension funds, the administrators  said: "for those who prefer to opt out, the office of the  administrators has briefed pension experts to advise on the  feasibility of, and mechanisms of, effecting pay-out."    Amid widespread claims of mismanagement and corruption of  the  Sefalana Employee Benefits Organisation (SEBO), the  administrators have authorised an investigation into all SEBO's  affairs. The investigating structure includes both employer and  employee representatives.    Unfair dismissals under Mr Mangope are also being  considered.  The administrators stated they were aware "of a number of  actions taken against employees, in particular in the public and  and parastatal sectors, which were based on the so-called  security laws of the former Bophuthatswana government. There is  no doubt that in a normal democracy such laws have no place". A  commitment is made to "reverse all dismissals and suspensions  motivated by political considerations".    On the issue of "expatriate staff" the administrators said  there were indications that some expatriates "have been  excessively remunerated and many have allegedly been placed in  positions for which they lack appropriate qualifications". This  also would be redressed.    On security, the administrators would make "every effort" to  revamp the security forces and immediately start the process of  integrating them into appropriate forces within South Africa.    Employers in Bophuthatswana are urged to "handle cases of  absenteeism with the greatest sympathy and sensitivity".  However, the administrators appealed to all employees to return  to work as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE FERGUSON-BADHAM RACE FOR THE ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> It is very interesting to read that the Orange County Republican Party  questions candidate Phyllis Badham's not signing the Pledge when Assemblyman  Gil Ferguson has attacked Badham several times -- one time calling her an  airhead and, quoting from the Feb. 8 Times, saying: "Some of these daughters  don't have enough to do so daddy helps them get into politics."  </P> <P> It so happens that Badham has a very responsible job and has and is doing very  well on her own.  </P> <P> Ferguson so far has refused to attend any meeting Badham will attend. I believe  it is the right of all voters to be able to be exposed to all candidates to ask  questions, to get straight answers and to learn both sides.  </P> <P> Badham is giving us a choice and is willing to be questioned at all meetings.  Do you believe Ferguson should hide from exposure with Badham?  </P> <P> I thank Badham for giving us a choice not controlled by a small group that does  not want more than one candidate or one view.  </P> <P> RICHARD CARROLL  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

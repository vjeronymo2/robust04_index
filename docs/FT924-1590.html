			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Europe isn't working: As the single market approaches, rising unemployment has pushed inflation out of the limelight In the run-up to next year's single European market, many of the continent's biggest employers are shedding tens of thousands of employees. IBM, British Petroleum and Ford joined the list this week, and the UK government will today unveil figures showing more than 30,000 joined the dole queues in November. Unemployment in the European Community, consistently higher than elsewhere in the industrial world and rising rapidly again, is rudely elbowing its way back into the limelight. Between 1985 and 1991 it was tempting to believe that unemployment rates could return to the low single figures of the 1960s as, led by the UK, the EC created 11.4m jobs. That performance was better than the US, Japan and non-EC Europe, but still not good enough to bring EC unemployment rates down to their levels. One reason is that only a third of the 11.4m jobs went to the registered unemployed, resulting in a disappointingly small fall in the EC's unemployment rate, from 10.9 per cent at the end of 1985 to 8.4 per cent at the end of 1990. About 30 per cent of the new jobs went to part-timers and 70 per cent to women. Many of the women, according to European Commission officials, now form a reserve army of the semi-employed who come on to the jobs market when jobs are plentiful and disappear again when they are scarce. Thanks to the rising level of female participation in the EC workforce, a static, or slightly falling, EC birth rate will not lead to a shortage of workers or the disappearance of unemployment by the end of the century. Indeed, the Commission expects the labour force to grow 15 per cent, requiring 25m jobs, by 2010, largely because female participation will catch up with the rest of the industrialised world. But the medium-term prospects are not good. Industrialists point out that, on top of the unemployment arising from slower growth, is the extra loss of jobs that will arise because of the single market. Companies' profit margins in the new competitive environment are coming under pressure so they are cutting overheads in the form of jobs. The combined result is that for the past year unemployment has been rising in almost all countries, with the exception of the Netherlands, and EC-wide unemployment is now edging back up towards 10 per cent - about 16m people. The UK, where labour-market deregulation has made it easier to hire and fire, is the leader in the loss of jobs just as it was in job creation, and accounted for almost 50 per cent of the increase in EC joblessness in the year to August 1992. The continuing rapid increase in the UK will help to propel the EC-wide unemployment rate to a new peak of more than 11 per cent later in 1993, where the Commission expects it to remain until 1996. The total should fall after that, but the continuing underlying upward trend, which began with the first oil shock of the early 1970s, will leave joblessness at the end of the 1990s six times higher than it was in the 1960s. The Commission estimates that 10m new jobs will be needed by 2000 merely to cut the unemployment rate to 7 per cent, something the tough economic convergence criteria of the Maastricht treaty will almost certainly rule out. EC labour markets were not always such international laggards. Indeed it was only in the early 1980s that EC unemployment overtook that of the US, but academics and policymakers seem at a loss to find a convincing explanation for what has gone wrong over the past 20 years. Mr Charles Bean, of the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, concluded a recent survey of European unemployment thus: 'The reader may feel that we are not much further on in understanding the causes of high unemployment than 10 years ago. There are plenty of plausible suspects, quite a few smoking guns, but little really definite proof.' The basic pattern of EC unemployment has remained similar for 20 years, although the problem is now spreading beyond the unskilled, the young and the old to affect better-qualified, middle-aged workers. But the current wave differs in one important respect from the early 1980s - there is no surge in youth unemployment, which accounted for 45 per cent of total EC unemployment in the early 1980s and now accounts for less than 30 per cent. There remain large differences between countries within the EC - particularly between northern and southern member states. As Mr John Morley, head of employment policy at the European Commission, points out: 'Unlike the United States we do have some very undeveloped parts of the EC with low participation rates and a large black market.' EC unemployment can be divided into three groups: the high-unemployment countries (Ireland and Spain); the medium-unemployment countries (the UK, Italy, France, Denmark, Belgium and Greece); and the low-unemployment countries (the Netherlands, west Germany, Portugal and Luxembourg). In some countries, such as France, Italy and Greece, unemployment has remained relatively static for almost a decade; others such as the UK have ridden the rollercoaster up, down and now up again. A virtuous trio of Portugal, the Netherlands and west Germany have seen a consistent downward trend since 1985, although Germany, following reunification, is now starting to shed jobs rapidly. Southern states such as Spain, Greece and Italy tend to have lower participation rates, higher youth and female unemployment, and higher self-employment rates. But Spain's very high unemployment rate stems from its slow growth between 1975 and 1985; inflexible employment rules for employers plus capital-intensive investment have done little to dent this. Portugal, on the other hand, enjoys low unemployment because it has low productivity. There are other regional differences, such as high graduate unemployment in Spain and Greece which results from people queueing for the better-paid jobs in the public sector. But there is no single explanation for the EC's poor employment performance which would help policymakers bring the rate down to the low single figures that prevails in Japan, the US and non-EC Europe. The EC's failures compared with other leading industrial countries (see chart) cannot simply be attributed to slower growth. Though growth has been below Japanese levels since the early 1970s it has been comparable with the US and non-EC Europe. Neither, as the UK government believes, can the failure be attributed to the over-regulation of EC labour markets. Britain's own laisser-faire hire and fire system is hardly a model - with the third-highest unemployment in the EC - while two of the most regulated EC labour markets, the Netherlands and west Germany, have relatively low unemployment. Related arguments about high unionisation or generous benefit systems are disproved by the Nordic countries, which have both, as well as historically low unemployment. So was labour market deregulation and the reduction in union influence pursued by some EC countries in the 1980s misconceived? Mr Robert Lindley, of the Institute for Employment Research at the University of Warwick, believes that the strategy hit the wrong target. Instead of forcing full-time, well-paid 'insiders', from skilled manual workers to the professions, to share out some of their job security and high pay, it has merely made 'already weak workers even weaker and divided up the same amount of work into smaller, part-time, parcels'. The percentage of French workers in part-time employment has increased by 50 per cent over the past decade and one-fifth of UK employment is now part-time. The dominance of the insiders also helps explain the failure of EC wage rates to respond first to the external shocks of the 1970s oil price rises and then to the high unemployment of the early 1980s. Japanese workers took a sharp drop in real wages in the 1970s and, at least for the past 10 years, US workers have had static real wages. By contrast the EC saw a significant increase in real wages in the 1980s. In Britain, for example, they rose by 39 per cent and in Italy by 31 per cent. One reason that the insiders have remained so well-placed in the EC is the high incidence of people out of work for more than one year who cease to function as an effective pressure on the employed. The long-term unemployed make up about 50 per cent of the EC unemployed, compared with only 6 per cent in the US and 18 per cent in Japan. The Commission wants a more 'integrated' labour market to accommodate the longer-term unemployed but is unlikely to get it. EC employers are fragmenting the labour market and, where regulations allow, increasing the number of part-time, or temporary, service-sector jobs, which are often insecure and low-paid. To overcome the mismatch between the skills and aptitudes of the long-term unemployed and the sort of jobs increasingly on offer, the unemployed will have to adapt to the job market. Mr Morley says governments must help them by adjusting their social security and taxation systems to encourage the outsiders back into the labour market, making it easier for people to combine two part-time jobs for example. Governments should also spend less on 'passive' benefits - currently more than two-thirds of the 2.25 per cent of EC gross domestic product spent on the unemployed - and more on retraining, counselling and other active labour market measures. Such reforms could take years to yield benefits. In the meantime it would be unrealistic to expect greater labour mobility in the EC to help reduce strains - only 2m EC citizens currently work permanently in another EC country, fewer than the number 10 years ago. There are, however, two grounds for optimism about EC unemployment. First, thanks to lower productivity and the growth of labour-intensive services, it now requires EC growth of only about 1.5 per cent to create jobs, compared with 3 to 4 per cent 10 years ago. Second, a growing number of politicians in the EC are starting to focus on high unemployment as a structural, not just a cyclical, problem. As Mr Morley says: 'It's not much, but at least it's a start.'</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / People: Non-executive directors for Johnson Matthey Pat Retief, chairman of Johannesburg Consolidated Investment Company, and Minorco director Peter Burnell, have been appointed non-executive directors of Johnson Matthey, the world's leading platinum refiner. The appointments, which follow the recent restructuring of the ownership of JM, underlines the increasingly close relations between South Africa's Anglo American Corporation and JM. Anglo owns 39.8 per cent of JCI, another South African mining finance house, and 39.1 per cent of Minorco. Retief is a non-executive director of Anglo and Burnell, who joined the Minorco board last year, spent nine years as managing director of Anglo's South American operations. JM and JCI have links that go back to the last century and platinum metals are the key to both companies' businesses. At the end of last year JM signed an extension of its marketing agreement with the JCI-controlled Rustenburg Platinum Mines. the world's biggest platinum producer.</p>

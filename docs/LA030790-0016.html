			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOT GOING TO TAKE IT ANYMORE  </P> <P> Results are still dribbling in from the regional and local elections held  across the Soviet Union's vast Slavic heartland last Sunday, but the returns so  far can only cheer supporters of reform.  </P> <P> Whether they ran as members of the Communist Party or outsiders, candidates in  the Russian Federation, the Ukraine and Byelorussia who want to speed the pace  of economic and political change fared well, particularly in big cities.  Moreover, the elections provided further evidence of a decisive trend toward  political pluralism and, perhaps soon, even a genuine multiparty system. Last  month the Communist Party agreed to end its monopoly on political power. Free  elections are now working to turn that pledge into a reality.  </P> <P> President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has reason to feel both vindicated and uplifted.  Openly frustrated by Old Guard obstructionists within the party and government  bureaucracy, he can now point to the poor showing of many apparatchiks as proof  that he grasps the public's mood far better than do local party functionaries.  If runoffs later this month lead to the ouster of still more party  conservatives, as expected, Gorbachev's efforts to widen and hasten reform  would be bolstered.  </P> <P> A steadily worsening economy daily adds greater urgency to those efforts.  Gorbachev's advisers aren't lacking in insights about what must be done to  rescue the country from further stagnation and even -- the word is now openly  spoken -- collapse. But clearing the arena of political deadwood won't by  itself usher in an era of essential structural reforms. As Poland's  forced-draft shift from a centralized to a market economy so vividly is  showing, the process of change can exact a painful toll.  </P> <P> Nobody, including the Kremlin, knows whether Soviet citizens are ready to  tolerate that pain. At least, though, they are being consulted through the  mechanism of elections. Those elections aren't yet wide-open. But they do offer  Soviet citizens a free choice, something that few have ever known.  </P></p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (26): Unaccustomed as I am . . . - Management THE FEAR of speaking in public can turn otherwise sensible people into quivering lumps of jelly. Worse still, attempting to help people overcome their fears can turn otherwise rational publishers and writers into promoters of quack remedies. Few areas of human activity can have produced quite as much wishful thinking masquerading as serious advice as the field of presentation skills. The unfortunate result is that even half-way sensible suggestions for overcoming stage fright provoke mistrust and scepticism in the reader. High Impact Business Presentations (by Lee Bowman with Andrew Crofts. Century Business Pounds 9.99, 245 pages) makes a serious attempt to address the problems created by presentation nerves. At its core is an essentially simple technique on which the author has built an apparently successful consultancy advising top executives. The Bowman technique allows the speaker to read from a prepared text yet give the impression, by the naturalness of his or her delivery, to suggest that he is only making use of notes. The trick lies in slowing down the speed of delivery to a point where effective use can be made of the text and in sticking to natural speech. Natural conversation does not consist of perfect grammar and immaculate syntax but of broken sentences and incomplete clauses. The closer the speaker delivery can approximate to normal conversation the better it will come over and the more likely the audience will be to remember the message. By attempting to polish natural speech otherwise witty people can appear wooden and dull. Mastering this technique allows the speaker to be much more natural than the other artificial techniques propounded for public speaking, Bowman asserts. He dismisses the idea that the would-be public speaker should learn to breathe properly. This merely introduces a further distraction. He suggests that speakers forget about the techniques adopted by actors, since the actor is trying to pretend to be someone else. The whole essence of the Bowman technique is to allow the speaker to remain himself. There appears to be a lot of good sense in the Bowman technique though the reader may well be irritated by the underlying sales pitch for the consultancy. For the reader fresh from the Bowman book, The Perfect Presentation (by Andrew Leigh and Michael Maynard. Century Business. Pounds 5.99, 102 pages) may appear to offer a somewhat low-impact alternative. Leigh and Maynard, who run a management development and consultancy service, cling doggedly to the traditional techniques - deep breathing, practising in front of a mirror - which Bowman has dismissed as impossible naive. They do not strengthen their case by their fondness for aphorisms such as 'Everyone has butterflies - it's the professional who gets them to fly in formation.' Leigh and Maynard's suggestions on the techniques of presentation are not their strongest suit. 'Emotions are an amazing resource and are usually the key to making a real impact,' does not sound the most helpful of suggestions for the nervous platform speaker. Fortunately, they make up only a part of this pocket-sized guide which makes some otherwise useful comments on the mechanics of speaking to an audience. On practical matters such as handling visual aids and assessing venues they offer commendably practical advice which far too many public speakers ignore. Do not let your slides and your overheads dominate your presentation; make sure people at the back can read your visuals, and keep them simple. Spontaneity needs to be prepared well in advance, they suggest, and speakers should only use jokes or humour if they feel comfortable with them. Anecdotes drawn from the speaker's own personal experience are more telling than a string of unconnected one-liners. For all but a gifted minority, mastering the art of public speaking depends on practice. A careful selection from the ideas contained in some of the guide books may shorten this process.</p>

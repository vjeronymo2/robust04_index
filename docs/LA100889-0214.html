			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HUD LOAN IN LAGUNA SCRUTINIZED;  </P> <P> WEINBERGER, FRIEND MAY HAVE PUSHED FOR VISTA ALISO FUNDS  </P> <P> At the urging of then-Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, former Housing  and Urban Development Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. overruled his staff to  approve a $4-million housing project for the elderly in Laguna Beach, according  to the Newsday newspaper in Long Island, N.Y.  </P> <P> Newsday reported that the 71-unit project -- called Vista Aliso -- was ranked a  low priority by Department of Housing and Urban Development staff and was not  in line for program funding, according to a handwritten memo by Pierce  assistant Silvio deBartolomeis dated Sept. 1, 1983.  </P> <P> But the aide, noting that Weinberger had written to Pierce endorsing the  project, recommended that Pierce skirt the low ranking by using his  discretionary fund for the project, according to HUD records. The records  included another handwritten memo to Pierce from his top aide, Lance Wilson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rocked by Scandal  </P> <P> For several months, HUD has been rocked by a scandal that includes charges of  influence peddling and has raised the question of whether Pierce has approved  projects because of politics, not merits.  </P> <P> Pierce gave the Visa Aliso elderly housing project -- which opened in April,  1988 -- an initial loan of $2.9 million, which later swelled to about $4  million, according to Reed Flory, the consultant who won HUD's backing for the  project. Flory is president of Shelter Ventures in Laguna Beach.  </P> <P> As part of the application process, Flory told The Times, the sponsor of the  project -- St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Laguna Beach -- was required to  obtain reference letters from as many prominent officials as possible. In  addition to Weinberger's letter, he said, the church's application included  letters from both of California's U.S senators as well as former Rep. Robert E.  Badham (R-Newport Beach) and Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley.  </P> <P> Flory said he believed that Robert Morse, a member of the church, knew  Weinberger and when the project was proposed, asked that he write a letter in  support.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Comment  </P> <P> Morse, who lives in Laguna Niguel, declined to comment to The Times on  Saturday. "He is my friend, and I have no comment," he said.  </P> <P> Weinberger, who worked in Ronald Reagan's gubernatorial administration in  California in 1968 and 1969, is a former treasurer of the state's Episcopalian  Diocese.  </P> <P> Flory told The Times that he has no knowledge of Weinberger's letter making any  difference in the church obtaining funding for the project.  </P> <P> But Flory credited Weinberger's helping hand with getting the project unstuck.  "It was going nowhere when we first proposed it in 1981," he told Newsday. "So  I instructed every person involved to get support wherever they could. It  turned out one of the members of St. Mary's Episcopal Church either worked or  went to school with Cap (Weinberger), wrote to him, said this was a good  project, and Cap responded."  </P> <P> Wilson and Pierce have used their Fifth Amendment right against  self-incrimination in refusing to answer all questions put to them in recent  weeks by the House panel investigating the scandal at HUD, where fraud, waste  and influence-peddling to win HUD money allegedly ran rampant during the Reagan  Administration. Neither Pierce nor Wilson could be reached for comment on the  Laguna Beach project, which came to light in documents from the files of Pierce  assistant Deborah Gore Dean.  </P> <P> Pierce's attorney, Paul Perito, refused to comment "specifically on actions  that the secretary (Weinberger) may or may not have taken."  </P> <P> St. Mary's was listed as a project sponsor, according to HUD documents, but a  church spokeswoman said that only the former rector, who could not be reached,  was involved.  </P> <P> Among the HUD reforms being considered is the abolition of the secretary of  housing's discretionary fund, from which grants or loans can be made without  having to run the normal gantlet of review.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SURF &amp; TURF;  </P> <P> PLAIN-WRAP THREADS AT 'SURFERS' SCREENING; DRESSED TO THE NINES AT SANTA ANITA  </P> <P> Surfing's elite met at the movies over the weekend and, of course, the movie  was about their favorite sport. "Surfers" is the $400,000 brainchild of Michael  Tomson, the president of Gotcha Sportswear.  </P> <P> His company and Surfer magazine sponsored the San Diego preview of the film,  which will be in theaters in April. He got the idea while watching the "Rolling  Stone -- 20 Years of Rock 'n' Roll" television special in 1987. The fashion  look was generic this night. Surfers wore their usual ethnic threads and sea  jewelry -- objects from the beach, tied to silk cords. Adventure-film makers  dressed like Indiana Jones in plaid shirts and leather bomber jackets. Orange  County hipsters wore jeans with stylish black blazers. The rowdy crowd, many of  whom were surf-industry stars, hooted their way through some of Tomson's  introductory remarks. Once the film started, however, the catcalls turned to  cheers and, at the end, loud applause. It may be another Endless Summer after  all. NEIL FEINEMAN  </P></p>

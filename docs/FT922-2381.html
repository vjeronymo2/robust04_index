			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / EC central bankers try to put on a brave face: A committee to design a Euro-banknote is set up IT was brave faces all round this week among Europe's central bank governors. Threatened with the premature demise of their pet project - European economic and monetary union - they responded by sowing the seeds for future Euro squabbles of undreamed dimensions by establishing a working group to consider the design of future Pan European bank notes. The highly emotive subject of whose faces should appear on the notes - to be used assuming that Europe moves as planned to a single currency by the end of the century - is likely to be considered by the group. That could lead to grave differences among member states on whether, for example, Marie Curie, Goethe or Isambard Kingdom Brunel should be given pride of place. One official of the Basle based Committee of EC Central Bank Governors stressed yesterday ) that the initial task would be to examine technical questions, such as anti-counterfeiting measures and their potential use in automatic cash teller machines. Also under examination by the group will be whether the notes would be printed by private companies or by the central banks themselves. But this business-as-usual approach could not disguise the difficulties ahead for Emu. In a forthright speech Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, governor of the Danish Central Bank described how the entire project could easily draw to a close. Another banker said: 'We don't know where to go from here.' Others closed ranks, noting the difficulties but deciding to carry on as before with technical preparations - chiefly for the European Monetary Institute, due to start up in 1994 with the job of overseeing the move to full union. Mr Lamberto Dino, deputy governor at the Bank of Italy, said: 'Emu will not be born out of a clear sky. I am confident it will be refurbished with a new treaty.' Mr Wim Duisenberg, governor of the Netherlands Central Bank, said he thought Emu in its planned form would probably still go ahead, though perhaps with only a small number of countries. But another central banker said: 'I don't see how Emu can work without political union as well. Before the Danish decision, I would have given Emu a 50 per cent chance of coming off in a majority of EC nations by the end of the century - now I'd put the probability at 10 per cent.' Mr Horst Bockelmann, economic adviser at the BIS and a former Bundesbank official, said: 'It seems to me you just can't proceed as though nothing has happened. It (Emu) is too big an undertaking to force it on people. If you push too strongly, you may make things worse and have a less, rather than a more, united Europe.' For the moment, the central bankers can only console themselves with the thought that if Emu is scuppered then some of their work will have strengthened the system of pegged currencies fixed by the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.</p>

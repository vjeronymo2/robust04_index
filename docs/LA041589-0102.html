			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEEKEND HIGHLIGHTS FOR L.A. INTERNATIONAL FILM FESTIVAL  </P> <P> The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival continues  at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas this weekend. Highlights from  today's and Sunday's program follow.  </P> <P> TODAY  </P> <P> 'Letters From the Park'  </P> <P> Cuba, 1988, 87 minutes  </P> <P>  Noon  </P> <P>  Cuban director Tomas Gutierrez Alea has shimmering period decor and a lovely  Gabriel Garcia Marquez script, as a sad, voyeuristic professional letter-writer  composes the love-epistles for both members of an impassioned couple, even as  he falls helplessly in love with the woman. Of all AFI/LA FilmFest's Marquez  films, this is the simplest and gentlest: a touching idea, exquisitely  realized. RECOMMENDED. MICHAEL WILMINGTON  </P></p>

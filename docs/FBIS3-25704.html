He said that Nigeria remains committed to  peace in the West African sub-region.    The defence spokesman, who was commenting on Wednesday's  visit by a Cameroonian Government delegation to Nigeria's  military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha on the disputed Bakassi  Peninsula, said Nigeria "was happy at this initiative."  "Nigeria has no desire to go to war with Cameroon", he said  adding: "With this visit, the Cameroonian Government has seen  that the path of peace is preferable to that of war". Chijuka  said Nigeria's military strength and preparedness should not be  underestimated in spite of the fact that some 12,000 of its  troops are currently serving in ECOMOG [Economic Community of  West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group], the West  African peace-keeping force in Liberia.    A meeting between Gen. Abacha and President Paul Biya of  Cameroon is in the pipeline, in an attempt to find a peaceful  solution to the differences between the two countries. No date  has been set for Biya's visit, seen as the highest level of  diplomatic efforts aimed at resolving the long-standing dispute  over the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula in south-eastern part of  Nigeria.    Cameroon alleged last weekend that its troops were attacked  by Nigerian troops in the disputed territory, a claim which  Nigeria denied. Cameroon also claimed that Nigeria has been  occupying parts of the disputed land illegally since 21  December. Nigeria alleged that 30 of its villages had been  burnt, many villagers killed or maimed and women raped.</p>

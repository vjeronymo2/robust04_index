			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Survey of Emerging Markets (15): Great expectations reinforced - The markets are viewed as being less frothy than they were a couple of years ago If 1993 was the year of Asia's emerging stock markets, many investment analysts believe the attention of international investors will swing more towards Latin America in 1994. These expectations were reinforced in January, when many investors apparently took profits on their sizeable gains in Asia last year, to build up their exposure to Latin America. Mr Michael Howell, investment strategist at Baring Securities in London, estimates that close to Dollars 40bn in new funds swept into the emerging stock markets last year. Of this 60 per cent went to Asia and 20 per cent to Latin America. The Latin American share of the total fell from about 60 per cent in 1992 and 80 per cent in 1991. Mr Howell believes that international investors will allocate a higher percentage in 1994 to Latin America, which - along with rising commodity prices - should support the region's markets. What happened in 1993 was that US institutional investors - whose interest in the emerging markets had been almost exclusively concentrated on Latin America - woke up to the Asian markets and rapidly increased their exposure. In 1994, some strategists are expecting UK institutional investors to wake up to Latin America. Susanne Carrington, manager of Latin American funds at Flemings Investment Management, says that the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in November last year triggered an important change in UK investor attitudes. 'Nafta has been incredibly important for focusing people's attention on the whole region,' she said. Furthermore, the continuation and deepening of economic reform have impressed investors, and markets are viewed now as being less frothy than they were a couple of years ago. Growth in the region should average 3 per cent this year (3.4 per cent excluding Brazil), according to the latest forecasts from the London-based Consensus Economics, compared with 3.5 per cent last year. Still, investors have their problems across the region. Front-running - where brokers fulfil their own orders before those of clients and insider dealing - is common. 'It's a real problem,' said one equity analyst, who also said there was a perception that the Mexican market had improved in this respect over the past year. Many companies in the region are run by families who remain unwilling to cede control to outside investors. This means some companies are positively unhelpful about providing information. This is changing in Mexico, where disclosure is improving all the time, but in many other markets remains an important issue. The Venezuelan market gets the wooden spoon for being the most difficult market in which to deal: settlement and custody are usually problems. Of Venezuela, Ms Carrington of Flemings says: 'There's only one stock that I'll buy in the local market.' Such difficulties - and other factors, such as Chile's restrictions on sale of stock and a 35 per cent withholding tax - drive many investors into the New York market for ADRs. Nonetheless, some investors think these ADRs show a strong correlation with the New York market and are therefore not completely satisfactory for the purpose of diversification. The biggest question about Latin American stock markets is: how long can the current inflows continue? More specifically: what will happen when US interest rates - the low levels of which have had a big impact in encouraging the flows of funds to emerging markets - take a decisive turn upwards? Many strategists think the flow of funds - assuming continued economic and political stability in the region's key markets - will continue, though perhaps at a lower level, while investors build up their holdings to desired levels. There has, say some analysts, been a step-change in institutional investor attitudes to the region's stock markets which should sustain flows. Mr Roger Palmer, director of emerging markets at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London, says the money flowing into mutual funds in the US - currently important investors in Latin America - would not slow the moment that US interest rates turned upwards. Furthermore, even if interest rates turned high enough to tempt holders of mutual funds back into bank deposits, certificates of deposits and the like, the growing interest of pension funds and other institutional investors should help to sustain a continued flow of funds for some time.</p>

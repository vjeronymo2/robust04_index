			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMEN ATHLETES RUN BEHIND MEN  </P> <P> As remarkable as women's athletic gains have been in recent years -- what with  their records and achievements inching closer to those of their male  counterparts -- experts believe that there will always be a gap between the  sexes in this area.  </P> <P> "Everything else being equal, say a woman had inherited the same genetic stuff  and trained as much, there would still be a 5% to 10% difference in her  performance," says Rudy Dressendorfer, professor of human performance and sport  at New Mexico Highlands University.  </P> <P> The difference stems mainly from two factors: muscle mass and cardiovascular  capacity. And those two factors underlie the speed, strength and endurance so  many sports require.  </P> <P> Women are generally smaller than men. But even a woman who is the same size as  a man most likely will have less muscle mass because she has a higher  percentage of body fat.  </P> <P> "The quality of muscle is the same," says Robert Stauffer, director of  physiological research at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point (N.Y.). "If  you look at a muscle fiber under a microscope, you can't say, this belongs to a  woman, this belongs to a man. The difference has to do with muscle mass."  </P> <P> Less muscle mass means less strength, he says. This is true even among cadets,  who rank in the top 2% for their age group as far as physical fitness, he says.  The academy has found that female cadets have 30% to 35% less upper body  strength than their male counterparts.  </P></p>

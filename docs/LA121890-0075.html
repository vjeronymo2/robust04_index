			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THOMPSON: DEFENDING AGAINST RACIST CHARGES 'IDIOTIC'  </P> <P> Georgetown basketball Coach John Thompson said in an interview released Monday  it would be "idiotic" for him to defend himself against accusations that he is  anti-white, and added blacks sometimes question whether he is "black enough."  </P> <P> Thompson also addressed in the Gentlemen's Quarterly interview his players'  contact with drug kingpin Rayful Edmond and his own battle with illiteracy.  </P> <P> Race-related accusations against Thompson stem from the fact nearly all his  players at Georgetown have been black. Blacks question Thompson because of his  19-year association with a school that is nearly all white.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get down on my knees and say 'I'm not a racist,' " Thompson  said. " . . . That's the most idiotic and degrading thing I could do."  </P> <P> Thompson, 49, said that when he was a teen-ager, people told him he was  mentally retarded.  </P> <P> "When I was 14 years old, I still couldn't read," he said. "That was the most  degrading, humiliating experience of my life."  </P> <P> Thompson has compiled a 429-143 record at Georgetown with a national title in  1984.  </P> <P> The key to that championship was Patrick Ewing, whom Thompson protected from  reporters.  </P> <P> "I caused that problem by putting myself in a situation where we were  restrictive (in allowing media access)," Thompson said.  </P> <P> On the meeting in which he told Edmond to stay away from his players, Thompson  said, "Rayful didn't want any harm to come to any of my players. And I wanted  to make sure no harm came to them -- including guilt by association."  </P> <P> Edmond, sentenced in February to life without parole for his drug distribution  activities, met socially with center Alonzo Mourning and at least one other  Hoya.  </P> <P> "Rayful understood me and I understood him because there is honor in guys like  Rayful," Thompson said. "At least I know what his rules are. It's the guys in  suits and ties that give me problems sometimes. I have a hell of a lot more  trouble figuring out what rules they play by."  </P></p>

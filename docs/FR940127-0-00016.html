At present, such loans are assigned to the 100 percent risk weight category. This amendment also satisfies a requirement contained in section 305 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) concerning the application of the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines to multifamily housing loans. The final rule also addresses the section 618(b) requirement that the FDIC's risk-based capital guidelines take into account loss sharing arrangements in connection with sales of multifamily housing loans. The final rule is intended to facilitate prudent lending for multifamily housing purposes.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule is effective January 27, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Robert F. Storch, Chief, Accounting Section, Division of Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429, (202) 898&hyph;8906.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 14, 1989, the Board of Directors of the FDIC adopted a Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital (12 CFR part 325, appendix A, later redesignated as appendix A to subpart A of part 325) which is applicable to all insured state nonmember banks supervised by the FDIC (54 FR 11500). The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) have also adopted similar risk-based capital standards for the banks under their supervision. The three agencies based their risk-based capital standards on the report on ``International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards'' (the Basle Accord) issued by the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision in July 1988. In addition, the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) has implemented risk-based capital rules for savings associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the FDIC's risk-based capital framework, a bank's balance sheet assets and the credit equivalent amounts of its off-balance sheet items are assigned to one of four broad risk categories_0, 20, 50, or 100 percent_according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. At present, absent qualifying collateral or guarantees, claims on private sector obligors (other than depository institutions) are generally assigned to the 100 percent risk weight category under the risk-based capital guidelines issued by the FDIC, the FRB, the OCC, and the OTS (collectively, the federal banking agencies). Thus, multifamily (five or more dwelling units) housing loans and privately-issued securities collateralized by multifamily housing loans are normally accorded a 100 percent risk weight by the FDIC. <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Multifamily housing loans are also normally accorded a 100 percent risk weight under the risk-based capital guidelines of the FRB and OCC. However, OTS regulations accord a 50 percent risk weight to ``qualifying multifamily mortgage loans.'' This type of loan is defined as a ``loan on an existing property consisting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5&hyph;36 dwelling units with an initial loan-to-value ratio of not more than 80% where an average annual occupancy rate of 80% or more of total units has existed for at least one year.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Survey of Georgia and Atlanta (10): Three reasons given for move / Relocation Profile of Holiday Inn FEW companies have a closer historical association with Memphis than Holiday Inn, pioneer of the standardised family motel. But there, on the north side of Atlanta and surrounded with a mass of foliage and flowers, is a sparkling new office block. 'Holiday Inn Worldwide,' it declares. The Holiday Inn headquarters shifted from Memphis to Atlanta last year - although the move was months in the planning. The last executives only switched offices at the beginning of 1992. The corporate relocation was intrinsically linked to a change in ownership. Holiday Inn, the world's largest hotel franchise operation, had been progressively acquired by Bass, the British brewing and hotels group. Having bought the brand name outside the US, Bass purchased rights to the franchise system within the domestic US via a Dollars 2bn deal in 1989. At that stage, Holiday Inns' headquarters were in Memphis, home town of the chain's founder, Mr Kemmons Wilson. Mr Wilson, a builder/property entrepreneur, had devised the Holiday Inn's notion out of frustration with the service he received on a motoring trip. The first Holiday Inn opened in the Tennessee city in 1952 and, by the time Bass moved in, about 2,400 people were employed at the group's HQ. Bass said it made the decision to move almost immediately after acquiring the US Holiday Inn business. Today, it gives three clear reasons for picking Atlanta. The first was communications. Holiday Inn, an international brand name, is likely to become an increasingly global. It is already owned by a British company, has outlets across Europe and is looking to expand aggressively in the Far East. Easy access to international travel was a must for executives. Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, the world's fourth largest in terms of take-offs and landings, was clearly good news The largest operator at the airport is Delta Air Lines, one of the the three US 'mega-carriers' with a comprehensive domestic route network. Delta, like all the big US carriers, was actively looking to expand its international presence: in mid-1991, it bought Pan Am's European route authorities and became the largest transatlantic carrier. Meanwhile, according to airport officials, British Airways is the second largest international operator at Hartsfield and other scheduled airlines functioning there include Japan Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Sabena and Swissair. Memphis, it should be noted, is also a hub city - but for Northwest Airlines, which is smaller than Delta and financially troubled. Northwest boasts a better route network in Far East, but has far less to offer in terms of flights to Europe. A second reason for selecting Atlanta, says the hotel franchise operator, was the quality and availability of employees in the hospitality industry. In reality, the position may have been a shade more complicated. In the process of moving the Holiday Inn headquarters, Bass reassessed its functions, with the result that the office today employs just over 1,000 people, less than half the figure at the Memphis office. Despite the fairly close proximity of Memphis and Atlanta, only 300 employees moved with the headquarters. Finally, the new owners say the 'quality of life' issue played a significant part in the decision. Housing was affordable, the environment pleasant and the cultural facilities good. Holiday Inn admits looking closely at three other cities - Washington DC, New York and Chicago - but Atlanta proved the winner.</p>

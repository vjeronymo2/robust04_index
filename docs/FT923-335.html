			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (3): Where image counts most - France FRANCE is not best known as a nation of small shopkeepers, but the traditional spread of local retailers is one of the main reasons why it became the largest franchising market in Europe and the second largest in the world. The number of operators may have slipped in the past two years to 500 franchisors at the beginning of 1992 from 600 in 1990, and to 30,000 franchisees from 33,000, but this is partly because the definition of the sector has been tightened up here. Despite the economic slowdown, annual turnover rose over the same period to FFr145bn from FFr143bn and still represents about half of such sales throughout Europe. Even so, franchising is suffering from the slowdown like the rest of the economy and is unlikely to repeat for a while the brisk expansion of 15 per cent a year reported among franchisors until 1988. Meanwhile, the mix of sectors has shifted. Until a couple of years ago, property and non-specialised food retailing were the two big growth areas. But property is suffering from the economic downturn, and small non-specialist food outlets have been squeezed by supermarket groups. Nonetheless, the gap is closing between retailing and services. The split now stands at about 55/45 per cent, having narrowed from 60/40 in 1990. Fast food, printing, theme restaurants and quick car exhaust change outlets have led the way. US chain MacDonalds is still the main exponent of fast food, and now has about 100 outlets throughout the country. It is one of only a handful of American groups. In France, about 95 per cent of franchisors are French, whereas in the UK about 70 per cent are American. 'This was a logical first target for US groups in Europe,' commented Chantal Zimmer-Helou, director of the French Franchising Federation (FFF) and general secretary of the European Franchising Federation. She explains Macdonalds' success here by 'its great professionalism and ability to create a new market'. Other factors distinguishing France from its neighbours are the importance of image for practitioners in France, and a financial management approach which differentiates between assets and operations. 'It is impossible to calculate the return on investment without breaking down the two,' Ms Zimmer-Helou said. The federation has been promoting the approach since last year, but of the two main banks that finance franchising, Societe Generale has embraced the principles and Credit Lyonnais has not, she explained. It is not surprising that image is so important. prominent. Big brand names have always been more important in France than in either Germany or the UK, she pointed out. The business world does not always hand out accolades to governments, but Michel Micmacher, chairman of the Pronuptia bridalwear group and FFF president, points out that the French authorities were the first in Europe to recognise the role of franchising in healthy commercial competition, and to back the demands for exemption for the sector from some of the European Community competition regulations. On the distribution side, the economic ills of recent times have had an impact on the type of new entrants to the franchising industry. In the past, most were new to retailing, but now many are already in the business and are finding life as an independent too tough, Mr Micmacher said. 'In the past two or three years, we have seen more and more retailers in difficulty joining franchise groups,' he added. As for bridalwear, the Pronuptia group, which is now in 17 countries, is holding up to the crisis in Belgium and Germany. Surprisingly it is also doing well in Poland, because, Mr Micmacher points out, France has long been a cultural role model for the Poles, and that includes young 25-year-old women preparing for marriage. In France, small ready-to-wear seeking to diversify have nibbled away at the bridalwear specialists, but many of them have not succeeded, he said.</p>

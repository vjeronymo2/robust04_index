			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Mars advert is cleared 'A Mars a day helps you work, rest and play' - does not mislead consumers, the Independent Television Commission has ruled. It rejected a complaint by Action and Information on Sugars, a pressure group concerned at the amount of sugar in the UK diet. The slogan has been used for 35 years. The commission said: 'To uphold the complaint would be to carry literalism beyond any reasonable bounds justified by the needs of consumer protection. There was no doubt the product offered at least fuel for work and play. We are satisfied consumers would not be misled by the 'rest' component of the slogan which, on analysis, was the only part open to some question, if taken as a nutritional claim.'</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Fowler link to prison escorts 'not improper' CONSERVATIVE party officials were last night at pains to distance Sir Norman Fowler, the party's chairman, from embarrassment surrounding Britain's first private prisoner escort service, after it emerged that he is a director of a company that shares the same ultimate parent. Officials said that the board on which Sir Norman sits has no responsibility for any of the work carried out by Group 4 Escort Services, which has experienced three escapes since starting work last week on a five-year contract covering the east midlands, South and North Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and Humberside. For the past three years Sir Norman has been a non-executive director of Group 4 Securitas, a subsidiary of Dutch-based Group 4 Securitas International. Group 4 Securitas is the parent company of all Group 4 companies operating in Britain, with the exception of those - such as Group 4 Escort Services - which offer remand and court services. Mr Alun Michael, a Labour home affairs spokesman, said that the directorship illustrated the 'unhealthy' relationship between the Conservative party and that part of the private sector which has a specific interest in the process of privatisation. Group 4 said last night there was 'absolutely nothing improper' in Sir Norman's involvement with the group. The latest escape came when a 20-year-old man facing traffic charges in Derby broke out of the van taking him to court. Mr David Evans, general secretary of the Prison Officers Association, said yesterday he was not surprised at what had happened and he predicted further escapes: 'This recurring nightmare will go on as long as this government continues with its dogmatic policy of contracting out prison escorting.' The prison service acknowledged 'significant difficulties' had been experienced in the first few days. Group 4 claimed that two of the escapes were due to failures in the special vehicles used to transport prisoners. It insisted that its staff were properly trained to carry out the tasks.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn -- German and Russian military units are  planning joint exercises. A Defense Ministry spokesman said in  Bonn on Thursday [26 May] that a German-Russian staff exercise  is scheduled to be held in Russia next year. There will be no  combat units involved, just military staff units. German and  Russian warships will meet for a joint exercise in the Baltic  Sea before the end of this year.    Defense Minister Volker Ruehe plans to hold a joint exercise  of Bundeswehr units and the Russian Army on German soil in 1996.  The legal framework to enable this still has to be created, the  spokesman said.    There are presently no laws regulating maneuvers of eastern  troops in Germany. Details on exercises of NATO partners are  laid down in the annex to the NATO troops charter.    According to the Defense Ministry, an exercise of German,  Polish, and Danish engineering troops will be held in Denmark  this October under the code name "Carbon Gap." Prior to that,  in September, the German Navy will conduct exercises together  with Polish and Danish ships in Mecklenburg Bay.    In 1995, an exercise involving Hungarian, German, and  British  units is to take place in Hungary. Polish, Danish, and German  military units will be conducting an exercise in Poland next  year. Once the necessary legal framework has been created,  Danish, Polish, and German troops will hold maneuvers in Germany  in 1996. All exercises held together with Poland and Hungary  will be conducted within NATO's Partnership for Peace program.</p>

After his arrival, which is expected at around 4:00 PM [1500  GMT], Clinton is to go to Prague Castle where, after a welcoming  ceremony, he will meet with Havel in the Brozik Hall. They will  later be joined by Klaus, likely after moving into the Hall of  Mirrors.    According to the original programme, Clinton is to begin his  visit to the Old Town at 6:30 PM. There he wants to take a walk  across the Charles Bridge and possibly stop into a typical  Prague pub. Clinton is to spend the night at the Hotel Atrium,  but there is also speculation that he might stay at the  presidential apartment in Prague Castle.    On Wednesday morning, the president is to tour the Jewish  Cemetery and meet individually with the presidents of the other  Visegrad Group countries -- Arpad Goncz of Hungary, Lech Walesa  of Poland and Michal Kovac of Slovakia. The meetings are to be  held at the U.S. ambassador's residence and culminate with a  joint briefing. A working lunch is planned for Clinton and the  Visegrad presidents.    Before 3:00 PM, Clinton is to visit the Kmart-Maj department  store for a discussion on Czech-American trade and business  activities, which Klaus is also to attend. Clinton is then to  have 15 minutes of "private time" as part of the Kmart visit.  Afterwards he will head for the airport, where he is to spend  an hour meeting with U.S. embassy employees. At 5:30 PM he will  depart for Moscow.    According to some reports from American sources, original  plans for an "entertainment programme" will probably be cut back  due to the Thursday [6 January] death of Clinton's mother. He  was originally to visit the Na Zabradli Theatre, the U Zlateho  Tygra pub and the Reduta Jazz Club on Tuesday evening. Clinton  may go jogging on Wednesday morning.    Official spokespersons for both the American and Czech sides  say that the programme has not yet been definitively set down.</p>

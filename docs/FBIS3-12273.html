			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Tunis, Feb 26 (AFP) -- Palestine Liberation  Organisation (PLO) chief Yasir 'Arafat called the massacre of 52  Palestinians in a Hebron mosque Friday a "serious blow" to the  peace process. [passage omitted]    A member of the PLO Executive Committee, Jamal al-Surani  called for the PLO to break off negotiations with Israel and for  Arabs to unite against Israeli violence, the Egyptian news  agency MENA reported.    The United Arab Emirates said the mosque killings  demonstrated the "complicity" of the Israeli government.    "This savage killing, carried out under the eyes of the  Israeli occupation forces, demonstrates the complicity of the  Israeli government," the UAE news agency WAM quoted an official  spokesman as saying.    The spokesman called on the UN and states sponsoring the  peace process to take "firm and concrete measures to protect the  Palestinians". He called for the "settlers to be disarmed,  Jewish settlements in the occupied territories to be dismantled  so as to avoid a repeat of such killings".    Qatar called on Israel to carry out an official and "public"  investigation into the massacre.    In London, Israeli deputy foreign minister Yosi Beilin said  the mosque shooting was "the most terrible thing that has  happened to us in many years, but we hope it will not be a  reason or pretext to put an end to the (peace) process."    He added: "What we have to do is to accelerate the  process.... We hope the Palestinians will share with us this  view despite this horrible event."    In Amman, the Jordanian branch of the Moslem Brotherhood  fundamentalist organisation urged the Arabs to "pull out of the  peace negotiations" with Israel.    The Moslem Brotherhood called on the "PLO leadership, the  Arab countries, and in particular Jordan to withdraw from the  negotiations," and appealed to the PLO "to return to the armed  struggle."    Jordan has called for three days of national mourning  starting on Saturday for those killed in Hebron.    Leaders of Christian communities in Jordan, quoted by PETRA  NEWS AGENCY, also "firmly condemned" the killing and called for  UN protection for the Palestinians.    The leader of Egypt's Coptic Christians Patriarch Shanudah  III likewise condemned the killing and urged Christians to  consult the Moslems before making a pilgrimage to Jerusalem to  show solidarity with the Palestinians.    The Islamic Resistance Movement HAMAS has put all its  fighters "on a maximum state of alert" and called on them "to  retaliate as hard as possible to avenge the slaughter in  Hebron." [passage omitted]    Iran, which opposes the peace talks and backs Islamic  militant groups, declared three days of mourning.    A group formed to oppose the autonomy accord, Black  September  13, vowed to "commit a series of attacks against Jewish  institutions inside and outside the occupied territories" until  the collapse of the self-rule deal.</p>

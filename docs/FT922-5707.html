			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Observer: L of a reason Venture capital director Stephen Hill permitted himself a small, wry smile yesterday as news broke that Canary Wharf was going into administration. Hill, managing director of LICA Development Capital, a 'boutique' venture capital company, had just dusted down an investment assessment he produced in 1984 for his then boss Bill Norris, the legendary founder of Control Data. The American computer group was thinking of setting up a new UK Business and Technology Centre where resources and facilities are shared. Hill's boss was not best pleased by his verdict that the centre would not be viable in the short term and things would only get worse in future. The November 1984 report quoted the UK property industry adage that there are three main ingredients for a successful development: 'location, location and location'. Control Data indeed decided not to go ahead and dropped its option on a development site. It was later snapped up by none other than Olympia &amp; York - for Canary Wharf.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Syarhey Plytkevich: "State Power Is Means of </F> Winning Post of President"]    [Text] We have learned the preliminary data regarding the  number of signatures collected in cities and rayons in support  of the main candidates for president of Belarus. These figures  are of particular interest, and provide reasons for pondering  this issue.    Thus, Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich received  more supporting signatures than his rivals. He was supported  not only by 203 deputies, but also by 400,000 Belarusian voters.  These are impressive results, however, they can be explained if  we consider that state officers were actively participating in  this signature campaign. We have evidence of all these facts,  therefore, it is ridiculous to cite any of them. Our editorial  office as well as the editorial offices of other newspapers, and  the Civilian Election Committee have such evidence. By the way,  when we queried Alyaksandr Abramovich, chairman of the Central  Commission for Holding Presidential Elections, he admitted that  state bodies participate in election battles.    However, a question arises: Is this good or bad? Can state  bodies be really depoliticized and perform only the so-called  function of social management? There are various opinions on  this point. State bodies in states with the old democratic  traditions are to a certain degree affected by a ruling party.  Thus, what can be said about the states that are, in fact,  shifting from one political system to another? The role of  state bodies in these countries is continually increasing. The  results of the first stage of a presidential race in Belarus  demonstrate this very vividly. Belarusian Prime Minister  Vyachaslaw Kebich, for whom the entire state system worked,  collected a majority of votes. This could not be otherwise:  Any other presidential candidate constitutes a certain threat  to many employees of the Cabinet of Ministers, the oblast and  rayon executive committees.    Earlier we wrote that only Supreme Soviet Chairman  Myacheslaw  Hryb could change this situation by entering the campaign. In  this case, the officers of state bodies would have to choose  between him and Kebich. However, Myacheslaw Ivanavich did not  risk taking this step. So, state officers could do nothing but  work for Kebich. Only Molodechno became an interesting and  peculiar exception. You know that Molodechno Major Henadz  Karpenko is also a candidate for president. Therefore, the  Molodechno Executive Committee did not work for Kebich. The  result is very strange: Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich has no  supporters (zero!) there at all. This is a vivid example of the  role of state bodies in political battles!    By the way, the same refers to the role of powerful party  structures. For example, the Belarusian Popular Front [BNF],  which has devoted supporters in many cities and rayons of  Belarus, managed to collect over 230,000 signatures during the  signature campaign. The Party of Communists of Belarus [PKB]  was also characterized by good organization: They collected  some 200,000 signatures in support of Vasil Novikaw, secretary  of the PKB Central Committee. Other candidates, who were  supported by small or secondary parties, or by nonstable allies,  had more difficulties. For example, the number of signatures in  support of Henadz Karpenko was slightly over 100,000. If he did  not have a list with 79 deputies' signatures, he would have been  very upset now. It is clear that many difficulties are awaiting  the candidates. However, we should realize that only a  candidate, who is able to win in an honest battle, could become  a proper president of the state. His rivals will have to take  him into consideration. However, if the presidential battle is  manipulative, when the Central Committee for Holding  Presidential Elections comes under someone's influence and winks  at law violations, then elections of such a president will only  increase antagonism in the Republic. This situation could  trigger a social explosion.</p>

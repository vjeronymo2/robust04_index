			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Thomas Pickering, U.S. ambassador to Russia, </F> and Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for  International Affairs, by announcer Nikolay Svanidze in Moscow;  from the "Details" program -- live, Pickering in English with  simultaneous translation into Russian]    [Text] [Svanidze] Good evening. Our program Details is now  being broadcast live on Russia's TV. It will focus on the  Bosnian crisis, in which a peaceful settlement has become  possible after the initiative put forward by Russia yesterday.  Today's guests are two politicians: Vladimir Petrovich Lukin,  the chairman of the Duma Committee for International Affairs  and, until recently, Russia's ambassador to the United States;  and Mr. Thomas Pickering, the present U.S. ambassador to Russia.  My first question is to you, Ambassador: Do you think that  under the present circumstances the possibility of air strikes  being delivered on the Serb positions near Sarajevo is still  real?    [Pickering] I think that under the current set of  circumstances, when the diplomacy of President Yeltsin has made  a serious difference in the attitude of the Bosnian Serbs, and  we are working together to carry out the evacuation and control  of heavy weapons around Sarajevo -- if all this continues to  successful, then the main problems to be resolved in connection  with the possible air strikes, will be the questions of  violating the cease-fire. As you know, such attempts were made  and the UN secretary general has asked for NATO's help in this  respect. We hope no one will break the cease-fire. We hope for  further success of Russian diplomacy. We hope that the process  will reach a new stage and that we will perform that complicated  work together and in partnership, which could bring a more  permanent peace to Bosnia.    [Svanidze] I have the same hopes as the ambassador. Now a  question for you, Vladimir Petrovich. This current achievement  of the Russian diplomacy -- if everything is resolved  peacefully, as we all hope it will do -- that will really be a  great achievement. What effect is this going to have on the  relations between the legislative and executive branches of  power? What is the Duma's attitude to this at the moment? I  mean the Duma as a whole -- Mr. Zhirinovskiy, I know, will think  it was all his work -- but the Duma as a whole?    [Lukin] The Duma, as a whole, is a very complex notion. I  must say that your suspicions are confirmed. The Liberal  Democrats leader said today that all good things that are now  happening or will happen in Bosnia, in Yugoslavia, have come  about as a result of his visit there.    [Svanidze] Sure.    [Lukin] We all understand that he is exactly right. I will  even say that there could not have been any other explanation,  but the real problem is that I could not see any substantial  differences in Duma's and our executive power's initial  approaches to this problem. As you know, during the first days  of this crisis, when the ultimatum was made, the Duma took a  decision that said very clearly and unambiguously that it was  against any sort of ultimatums, and expanding the scope of air  raids. In the Duma's opinion one cannot reduce air raids and  shooting by expanding the scope of air raids.    At the same time, the Duma stressed the need for a very  intensive search for political solutions. I think that the  president and the executive power acted in line with this  decision, and developments that have taken place or are  happening now in line with this decision can only upset those  who are not interested in coordinating the efforts of all the  elements of the Russian state structure.    [Svanidze] So do you think that the Duma shares this, let us  hope, possible success for Russian diplomacy?    [Lukin] The Duma shares all Russia's successes, including  those made by Russian diplomacy, as long as they are successes.    [Svanidze] Yes, of course. Ambassador, in your opinion,  whose success is it -- if it turns out to be a success? Was it  achieved by Russian diplomacy, working together with the Duma,  of course, the United Nations, or NATO? What do you think?    [Pickering] I have been in diplomacy long enough not to get  involved in discussions of internal affairs in countries where I  am accredited. But I think that there is enough credit to go  around here. I think the most immediate step, and obviously (?a  very important one), was produced by President Yeltsin's  (?leadership) and various people working on the ground, and  somehow (?we ended up with) a situation in which obviously the  Bosnian Serbs had to consider very carefully what steps they  took (?and they had to take account of) the work of the  secretary general and the development of the UN position under  the resolution. It all helped in the process of moving ahead.  Realistically, I think we are not engaged in any fight or  discussion about who takes credit [passage indistinct].    [Svanidze] Thank you. Vladimir Petrovich, what do you think  about frequent talk of the contradiction in Western and Russian  interests in the Balkans? This is stated frequently. What do  you think about it?    [Lukin] I think that we have a lot in common. I think that  in the long term our victories and defeats will be the same,  although, I agree with my friend Tom here. Listening to him, I  remembered a French proverb saying that victory has a lot of  father and that defeat is an orphan, but as far as long term  prospects are concerned, what sort of interests can people, not  wishing to see a conflict, have? They want to stop the  conflict, to reach an agreement, finally to put an end to people  being killed and see the observance of slight balances of  national interests both within various communities -- who  brought about the explosion of the whole process -- and on a  more general scale in Europe. I am convinced that we can  achieve this but one has to be careful. Every country has to  look, not just in the mirror, but also in the window so that it  can see its opponent, appreciate his arguments, and listen to  them carefully from the very beginning. Only then will we  achieve the settlement, we most definitely will because, of  course, Russia wants fraternal and friendly nations -- and that  is what they are -- to stop shooting each other. Finally, there  is a chance, but I would like to emphasize that we are only  talking about the possibility for settling this particular  critical situation, however morbid it might be. After that  there will be a very complex stage of settling the whole Bosnian  problem. All sober thinking people, professionals and  non-professional, will have to make a huge effort to resolve it.    [Svanidze] Incidentally, I did not know you were personal  friends, Vladimir Petrovich, I was not warned about this. You  may have agreed on this before the program began, or is that  ruled out?    [Lukin] We have known each other long enough, and when Tom  was leaving the United States we got together and had a lively  and detailed discussion of our professional matters. We have  met regularly since, and I have a great respect for this  outstanding diplomat.    [Pickering] Thank you.    [Svanidze] Gentlemen, I have a question to you both. In the  past few days, there has been a lot of talk about the health  condition of President Yeltsin and his ability to work. More  specifically, President Clinton failed to reach him on the  telephone, and there have been many other rumors. Now it is  known for sure that the message to the president of Serbia was  signed by the Russian president who played an important role in  -- well, at this stage let us call it an attempt to resolve the  crisis. Let me ask you first, Vladimir Petrovich: Do you think  that this stance of President Yeltsin will boost his rating and  raise his prestige both in Russia and abroad?    [Lukin] Well, first and foremost, I would like to say that I  saw the president with my own eyes when John Major was here on a  visit. I participated ex officio in some of the protocol  events, and he was then in a normal working condition. The  other side of the question -- excuse me, what did you ask?    [Svanidze] The question was if Yeltsin's prestige would grow  now because there has been a lot of talk about this recently --  about his ability to work.    [Lukin] I think the prestige of everyone involved in this  work will grow. I agree that in Russia the president was the  person most involved in it, together with the people who worked  on the spot. So, all the people who did this work deserve that  their prestige should increase and it will increase.    [Svanidze] And what is your opinion, Ambassador?    [Pickering] I heard with interest what Vladimir was saying.  I had great pleasure in being able to take part in the summit  in January, and I thought that President Yeltsin's state was as  Vladimir has said. I think that the leadership of President  Yeltsin has played a significant role, as well as that of our  country's president, since both them became involved in joint  work. Unfortunately, due to a number of technical reasons, they  failed to contact each other on the telephone, but they have  been in touch several times since, including just this morning,  and I have had several very good messages from President Clinton  to your president, on developments in Bosnia, among other things.    [Svanidze] Our time is up, thank you very much. I remind you  that the guests of the Details tonight were Vladimir Lukin, the  chairman of the Russian Duma Committee for International  Affairs, and Thomas Pickering, the U.S. ambassador extraordinary  and plenipotentiary to Russia. Goodbye.</p>

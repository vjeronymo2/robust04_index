			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Opec's September oil output above new ceiling ESTIMATES of September production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries show that it will have to cut output to reach its new ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day agreed last week in Geneva. Opec wellhead crude oil output edged back up in September to 24.68m b/d after an August dip, but it seems to have remained below this year's peak, according to a Reuter survey released yesterday. The September estimate compares with a revised 24.49m b/d in August and the 1993 high in July of 24.79m b/d. The agency attributed the August drop mainly to a temporary reduction by Iran, which it said appeared to have restored volume in September. The Middle East Economic Survey estimated this week that Opec's September production was likely to be around 24.7m-24.8m b/d. But neither the Opec production estimates nor political events in Russia have had any substantial impression on the oil markets. 'They have decided in their collective wisdom that there is no danger to the supply of Russian oil,' according to Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London. 'And as for Opec, they are just waiting for the dust to settle.' The price of Brent blend for November was Dollars 17.10 in late London trading yesterday, compared with a closing price on Monday of Dollars 17.12. Nigeria has implemented a contingency plan to enable lifting of crude oil at loading terminals during a strike by inspectors, oil industry sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Lagos. 'They are still on strike,' said an official of a major oil company. But 'as far as I know loading is going on normally now'. The inspectors at loading terminals began an indefinite strike on Monday to press their demand for autonomy from the petroleum ministry.</p>

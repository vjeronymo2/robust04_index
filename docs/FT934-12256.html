			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Regulation of OTC derivatives satisfies CFTC THE USE of over-the-counter derivatives is expanding rapidly, but the risks associated with the transactions are vastly overstated, and there is no need for fundamental changes in the way they are regulated, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission concluded in a report delivered to Congress yesterday. 'After detailed analysis of default and credit risks in these markets we have concluded there is no cause for concern,' said Ms Shelia Bair, acting CFTC chairman. 'However, we have identified several areas where greater co-operation between regulators would be beneficial, particularly for sharing information,' she said. The CFTC is the primary US regulator of exchange-traded futures and options, and last year was given exemptive powers over off-exchange instruments such as swaps. However, Congress is still contemplating how OTC derivatives should be regulated. The House banking committee will hold a hearing in Washington tomorrow to discuss the issue, and the CFTC's recommendations. Finding that the 'systemic and public policy issues suggested by these products are not confined to any single market or the province of any one regulator', the CFTC report recommends an inter-agency council of federal financial regulators be formed to consider common approaches to OTC derivatives. The agency ducked suggestions that its powers be merged with its larger arch-rival, the Securities and Exchange Commission, saying such a merger would not address the problems posed by derivatives dealers not governed by either agency. In the report the CFTC for the first time said that non-regulated subsidiaries of broker-dealers might require a second look by the government. Several broker-dealers, including Salomon Brothers, have set up separately capitalised subsidiaries to deal in swaps this year. These affiliates are subject to less regulation than their parent companies or US banks dealing in swaps. The CFTC study, conducted with the co-operation of the Federal Reserve and the SEC, said a top priority for an interagency regulatory council should be the lack of comprehensive information on the OTC markets. The absence of standardised disclosure, pricing, and risk valuation was also cited as a concern, as was the fact that end-users of OTC derivatives may need to be better versed in managing risks associated with the instruments.</p>

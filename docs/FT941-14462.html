			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Mud-flinging finds vulnerable targets: The withdrawal of Clinton's defence-secretary nominee highlights White House troubles If the manner of Bobby Ray Inman's acceptance last month of President Bill Clinton's offer to run the defence department was peculiar (he arrogantly said he had to find a 'comfort level' with the president and then gratuitously added he had voted for George Bush), then his performance on Tuesday explaining why he was withdrawing from the nomination was downright bizarre. But sometimes messengers do come in strange forms. And in the near-paranoid rationale that Mr Inman offered - accusing the media and politicians alike of a 'modern McCarthyism' and saying that he was unwilling to accept the 'garbage' of scrutiny that now came with public service - there could be found some truths that ought to trouble both the president and the Washington establishment. Among them are the chronic problems this administration has in making senior appointments, especially in the foreign and security fields; the extent to which the minutiae of an individual's private life can be considered disqualifications for government service; and the curious phenomenon that this president seems snake-bitten, unable to string together for more than a few weeks a confidence-building record without being stuck in some poisonous new controversy or another. The most immediate concern is Mr Clinton's own 'comfort level' with the US military establishment, now awaiting a third secretary of defence in a year. This is, after all, a president who never served in uniform and who opposed the war in Vietnam, but who has already asked much of his military - to end its ban on homosexuals, to cut its budget and bases, to realign its force structure, to serve in distant hot spots not always with clear direction, as in Somalia, and to cohabit, in Nato's Partnership for Peace, with old foes from the former Warsaw Pact. Les Aspin, the outgoing secretary, was somehow thought not quite up to implementing these policies. Mr Inman, a veteran of the Navy, the CIA and the shadowy Washington intelligence community, was almost universally seen as the perfect solution. Even though he had been out of government since 1982, he was always breezing into the capital from Texas, keeping his many contacts alive. Even a less than glittering business career, including association with James Guerin's International Signals and Controls, seemed a minor matter in the eyes of Congress, because it thought it knew him. Yet the truth seems to be that the Clinton team's knowledge of Mr Inman was confined to his resume and secondhand reputation. Perhaps the president himself, so proud of his own persuasive abilities, missed warning signals when the two men first talked about the job. But perhaps the admiral never revealed then what he said on Tuesday: that he had lost his enthusiasm for military affairs and, in any case, had reservations about the extent of the cuts in the defence budget. Whatever the reality, Mr Clinton ended up with the worst of both worlds: having nominated a man who would have been unsackable in office, he had no control over his extraordinary second thoughts about taking the position at all. Presidents are not supposed to get themselves into this sort of bind. As it now stands, the civilian command at the Pentagon is in disarray. The Aspin team, never fully complete anyway, expected to be dismembered by Mr Inman and one of them, Morton Halperin, nominated but never confirmed to run a new peacekeeping and human rights division, had already fallen on his sword and withdrawn. The military side, too, is under the new management of General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs. The ship is not happy, whether the men are wearing suits or uniforms. The same is true, to a degree, of the state department, where prominent heads have either rolled - Clifton Wharton, ex-deputy secretary, Samuel Lewis, ex-policy planning chief, and Warren Zimmerman, ex-head of refugee programmes - or are hanging by a thread, like Tim Wirth. The former senator from Colorado was appointed to run a new division for global affairs, but its authorisation is still held up by congressional conservatives, and Warren Christopher, secretary of state, is believed to be growing cool to the reorganisation, preferring instead a department run by regional tsars and new stars like Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary-designate. Second, the Inman affair highlights the appalling selection problems the Clinton administration has encountered, many of its own making. Ever since Ms Zoe Baird, the first nominee to be attorney general, fell foul of Nannygate a year ago, the White House has been running scared of skeletons in closets, including, as Mr Inman noted, memberships of clubs that are not politically correct. At the same time, it has continued to insist on putting forward minority and women candidates for as many positions as possible. The extensive nature of the background checks on prospective nominees has acquired an intrusiveness capable of discouraging those with far thicker skins than Mr Inman's. Worse, the White House personnel office, directed by Bruce Lindsey, an old presidential friend, and through which appointments pass en route to the Oval Office, has been almost cruelly self-indulgent in allowing candidate files to stack up without response, as any number of bitter denizens of Washington will attest. Additionally, conservative politicians and their media allies, copying the tactics of their liberal counterparts in the Reagan-Bush presidencies, have relentlessly pursued those they dislike - like Mr Halperin and Lani Guinier, nominated to the justice department's civil rights division. In the process, they have discovered that the current administration is not always prepared to fight for those it wants on board. Thus, as it enters its second year, barely half of the nearly 1,000 senior jobs subject to Senate confirmation have been actually filled, a sorry record that does the administration's reputation in the capital no good. Third, Mr Inman's assault on the press, specifically the New York Times and William Safire, its columnist, suggests one of two things: that he could not stand the heat of criticism - on the basis of his press conference an entirely reasonable conclusion and an indictment of the president for picking him for such an important position; or that media headhunting has lost all sense of proportion, which is at least arguable. Mr Inman did not exactly help his own case by saying he believed there was an unholy conspiracy between Senator Bob Dole, the Republican leader, and Mr Safire, whereby the politician would create trouble for his nomination and the columnist would go after the Whitewater affair, the tangled skein of the Clintons' Arkansas real estate venture. But their natural denial of any such complicity cannot disguise the fact that relations between the media, particularly the White House press corps, and the president are still sour, and were made no better in Europe last week by Mr Clinton's refusal to answer Whitewater questions. The White House media charm offensive, including remarkable access to the president's table and private movie theatre, has not succeeded, but perhaps it never could have in the current media mood. The tenor of much of its coverage of his European tour was reflexively critical, and even if many reporters have doubts about the seriousness of Whitewater they are now almost duty-bound to pursue this classic paper chase. This hostility still does not approach the current UK level, perhaps because Mr Clinton's poll standings are more than twice as high as Prime Minister John Major's. But praising the president is not popular in macho media circles, as witnessed this week in a singularly nasty attack in the Washington Post on a New Yorker magazine writer for producing 'cream puffs' about the president's first year. Mr Clinton may console himself that he is well rid of the bizarre Bobby Ray Inman, but he is still left with a problem. He may have no alternative but to follow the practice of Capt Renault in Casablanca, round up the usual suspects and hope that one of them actually wants the job. It is not a good way to start a second year in office.</p>

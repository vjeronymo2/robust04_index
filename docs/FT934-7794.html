			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / International Company News: Nutricia warns of food recall damage SHARES in Nutricia, one of Europe's largest producers of baby food, fell sharply yesterday after a warning that a recall of 1m jars of baby food would affect its profit forecast for 1993. It could also influence results in 1994, the company cautioned. Nutricia, a Dutch-based company 30 per cent-owned by Unigate of the UK, is recalling some lines of its Olvarit brand of baby food because jars containing pork and beef may contain traces of a disinfectant. The recall affects jars in the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece and Portugal. More than 1m jars of the food still stored in Nutricia's warehouses will also be destroyed. Nutricia's shares fell steeply on the Amsterdam stock exchange yesterday, closing down Fl 13.20, or 8.7 per cent, at Fl 138.20. In London, Unigate's shares ended the day down 12p at 355p. Nutricia, the biggest European baby food producer after Nestle of Switzerland, said the source of the disinfectant was not its own Olvarit factory in Wells, England, but the premises of one of its Dutch suppliers of pork and beef. The disinfectant, p-TSA, is used to clean meat-cutting tables and equipment. The Olvarit jars were recalled after traces of the disinfectant were found during a routine check in the Netherlands by Dutch food inspectors. Olvarit products without meat, or with other types of meat, were not included in the recall. The company said there was no danger to health unless the suspect food was eaten frequently and over a long period. The company said the recall would affect its profit forecast for 1993, which earlier called for a 'clear' increase from 1992 net profit of Fl 87.2m (Dollars 30.7m). Meals, drinks and cereals for babies and toddlers accounted for around 16 per cent of Nutricia's 1992 sales of Fl 1.25bn.</p>

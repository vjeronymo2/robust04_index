			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Guinness jealously guards liquid gold More valuable than all the gold in the Bank of England? Casks of whisky lie maturing in Guinness' warehouse complex in central Scotland. The whisky, from more than 50 distilleries, will be stored for up to 25 years. Some 2 per cent of it evaporates each year, a loss known as 'the angels' share'. Said to be the largest warehouse complex in Europe, the 250-acre site has 49 buildings each the size of a football pitch. Guinness, which reports its interim results on Thursday, tries to keep the precise location secret, although local people could hardly miss it. Tradition has it that the stocks are worth more than the gold in the Bank of England. The claim is impossible to verify but a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests the Bank can sleep easy in the knowledge that it, not Guinness, sits on the biggest hoard of hard assets in the country. Guinness' 1993 accounts show Pounds 1.47bn worth of maturing spirits stocks, more than half of which are likely to be in the warehouse complex. But they are carried at Guinness' manufacturing cost. The 'street value', including hefty tax could be up to five times higher. The Bank of England is no more forthcoming. The UK has 18.4m ounces of gold reserves worth about Pounds 4.8bn. But it refuses to say how much of it lies in its vaults beneath Threadneedle Street. Moreover, the vaults also contain an unknown quantity of gold it stores for foreign clients. The Bank welcomes speculation about Guinness' wealth. An official said: 'For security reasons, we're glad of anything that takes attention away from the gold in our vaults.'</p>

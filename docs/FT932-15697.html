			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sun Alliance down A sharp reduction in losses at Sun Alliance, the composite insurer, to a level very much in line with most market forecasts, failed to stem a sustained bout of selling in the shares after analysts registered their surprise at the level of property write-downs that were announced by the group. The write-downs were partly responsible for a substantial fall in the company's solvency margin - net assets as a proportion of non-life premiums  -from 69 per cent to 54 per cent and a decline from 286p to 280p in the net asset value. The solvency margin is expected to fall a further 4 percentage points to 50 per cent after the group completes its purchase of Hafnia's Danish operations. One analyst said the drop in the solvency margin would 'impose a severe limitation on the group's dividend prospects'. Nevertheless, Mr Trevor May, a keen supporter of the shares, said he was keeping the stock on the 'buy' list and shifting his current year forecast from Pounds 115m to Pounds 128m. Mr Youssef Ziai, Morgan Stanley's insurance specialist, forecast that for the shares to make progress Sun needs an improvement in operating profits. Mr John Russell of Hoare Govett increased his 1993 profits estimate to Pounds 182m but warned that prospects for the dividend are very constrained. Sun shares settled 5 off at 349p on turnover of 4.3m.</p>

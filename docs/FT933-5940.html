			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Canada slashes cod fishing THE Canadian government has shut down virtually all of the east coast cod fishery and announced deep quota cuts on other fish species, AP reports from Halifax, Nova Scotia. The measures could put 12,000 people out of work. Last year, Ottawa shut down the northern cod fishery off the east coast of Newfoundland, affecting over 20,000 fishermen and plant workers. Mr Ross Reid, federal fisheries minister, said yesterday he would ban cod fishing in four more areas in the region and sharply reduce quotas on other valuable species. 'We are facing an unprecedented ecological crisis in Atlantic groundfish stocks,' Mr Reid said. 'Immediate action is needed to permit this fragile resource to rebuild.' The extended ban will cover cod on the eastern Scotian shelf off Nova Scotia, the southern Gulf of St Lawrence, the Sydney Bight area off Cape Breton and the south coast of Newfoundland.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Today the foreign currency market almost  overshadowed all other problems on Turkey's agenda. Yes, an  earthquake took place in currency markets. The dollar rose to  20,500 Turkish lira [TL], and all economic forecasts went  topsy-turvy. The currency stands stopped selling cash dollars  to people. The Central Bank remained a mere spectator. The  stock exchange transactions continued to fall, and the Treasury  and the banks are getting ready to increase interest rates.    [Begin offscreen reporter recording] The Turkish lira is  experiencing a real shock. The Turkish people started to  frantically exchange their money for dollars in the aftermath  of developments that resulted from increasing the amount of  money in circulation beyond TL66.4 trillion. The people started  withdrawing their money from the stock exchange and started  buying up dollars following the new bank interest rates and the  bad mark given to the Turkish economy by international financial  circles. People formed lines in front of currency stands to buy  dollars or marks, and the cash foreign currency sales almost  came to a halt in Istanbul and Ankara. Businessmen are  unwilling to sell their dollars because they are finding it  difficult to predict how much the dollar will continue to rise.  All the predictions so far have been wrong, and at one point  the dollar was selling at TL22,000 and the mark at TL11,500 at  the currency stands. The dollar is selling at almost TL20,000  in Tahtakale [Istanbul financial district].    The businessmen's associations such as TUSIAD [Turkish  Association of Industrialists and Businessmen] and the  government had predicted that the dollar would reach TL24,500  and TL26,000 only at the end of 1994.    The stock exchange transactions fell and shares fell by 403  points to 25,503. Despite this activity in the currency market,  the Central Bank is keeping silent. [passage omitted]    How did this happen to the currency market? According to  economists in Istanbul, the clash between the Treasury and the  Central Bank is the reason behind the rise in the value of  foreign currency. In line with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's  request, the Treasury is trying to lower interest rates. Unlike  in the past, the Central Bank is not selling its foreign  currency reserves to collect the excess Turkish lira, which is  now escaping the lower interest rates and is being changed into  foreign currency. Because of this, the price of the dollar went  out of control. [passage omitted]    It is not known how the TL2,000 gap between the official  exchange rate and the market will be bridged. Regarding the  money shuttling between the stock exchange and the foreign  currency market, and the government stance on this issue,  business circles are warning that the excessive amount of money  being printed in Turkey has opened the way for a considerable  amount of speculative money to be accumulated. The economists,  who have said that dollar prices have not gone up so fast  anywhere else in the worl, now say: For the first time ever,  speculative money is being used to buy up dollars. People are  being dragged by this process. This money could leave the  dollar market and return to the stock exchange at any time, and  then people will suffer. The government is aware of this and is  expecting such an occurrence. [end recording]</p>

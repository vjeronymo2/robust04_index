			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 19 KYODO -- The continued stalemate in  the Diet may delay implementation of planned tax reductions and  further prolong Japan's recession, government officials said  Saturday [19 March].    The government plans a total of 5.85 trillion yen worth of  cuts in income, residential and other taxes this year as  envisaged by the latest economic stimulative package unveiled in  early February.    For such reductions to be implemented on schedule as  originally planned, the Diet would need to pass the bills by the  end of March, according to the officials.    Chances are increasing, however, that some of those bills  cannot become law on time due to a boycott of Diet business by  the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    The LDP has refused to start deliberations on the fiscal  1994  budget, already two months behind schedule, over its demand that  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa clear up questions surrounding  a 100 million yen loan he received from scandal-ridden trucking  firm Sagawa Kyubin.    The LDP also maintains that the tax cuts are an important  matter that cannot be discussed in haste. Some LDP members also  oppose a government plan to limit the tax plan to one year.    The LDP stance is causing worries at the Finance Ministry.    Ministry officials said it takes at least two months before  tax plans are put into practice after Diet approval because of  the need to publicize them to companies and work out procedural  matters.    If passage of the bills is delayed to mid-April, they said,  income tax returns may not come in time for employees at  companies which pay summer bonuses in early June.</p>

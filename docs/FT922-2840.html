			<p>920615 FT  15 JUN 92 / International Company News: Euro-equity placing by Sappi is completed SAPPI, the South African pulp and paper group, has successfully completed its Dollars 268m Euro-equity placing, the largest such offer by a South African company since the lifting of sanctions against the country. The proceeds will be used to finance Sappi's purchase of Hannover Papier, the leading German manufacturer of coated paper. However, it is understood that several investors were put off by African National Congress plans for a mass action campaign, which gave rise to renewed fears about political instability in the country. The placing, at market price with no discount involved, was heavily oversubscribed. Mr Eugene Van As, executive chairman, said although demand from Europe had been less than he hoped, he was satisfied with the outcome. He said Sappi had been forced to cut back severely the allocation to South African institutions in spite of the fact that Gencor, Sappi's parent company, had agreed to take up less than 50 per cent of the South African tranche to ensure a reasonable portion of South African requests for equity were satisfied. He would not disclose what portion of shares were placed offshore, but had earlier expressed the hope that at least half, and possibly more, would go abroad.</p>

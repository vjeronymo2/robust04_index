An active participant in last May's and last October's riots  in Moscow, Konstantinov left the Lefortovo prison as a result of  the amnesty proclaimed by the State Duma on February 23rd.    According to Konstantinov, the amnesty granted to "those who  defended the Supreme Soviet and the Constitution is first of all  an act of justice", since "the people charged together with him  are not to blame for anything".    Konstantinov described the attempts to link the amnesty with  the start of another spiral of civil war in Russia as "political  provocation". According to him, in Russian society there are  forces interested in "inciting political hysteria" with a view  to using the resulting situation as a means of pressure on the  State Duma and on the opposition.    When asked about his short-term plans, Konstantinov said  that  he intends to "have a rest and get his bearings".</p>

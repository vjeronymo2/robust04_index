			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Personal Injury Risk of Blue Ice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters request that all actions applicable to the aft lavatory drainage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> systems be deleted from the proposed rule, since the risk of injury caused by ``blue ice''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forming at an aft lavatory, dislodging from an airplane, and striking a person on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ground is extremely remote. As justification for their request, these commenters cite an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis that was performed in 1990 to determine the probability of personal injury. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis concludes that such probability is on the order of 1 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per flight.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA does not concur with these commenters' request. The criteria of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> probability of injury being on the order of 1 &times; 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> ^9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  per flight hour is relevant when an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aircraft system is originally certified. However, once an unsafe condition becomes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> known to the FAA, an analysis is not necessarily sufficient to refute the unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA considers that the numerous reported cases of ``blue ice'' striking and damaging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> houses, cars, and populated areas is sufficient to support the conclusion that ``blue ice''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling from aft lavatory drain systems presents an unsafe condition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Moreover, the FAA does not find the analysis submitted by the commenters to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusive. That particular analysis was based on several assumptions whose adequacy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FAA questions. Among them are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. The analysis assumed that a piece of ``blue ice'' falls to the ground once every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two weeks in the United States. These figures were based upon language that appeared in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a newspaper article and are apparently anecdotal data. The FAA points out that the cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed in the newspaper article (and, therefore, in the analysis) may be only the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``reported'' cases; however, the vast majority of cases go unreported, and are likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the order of many magnitudes greater than the number reported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Additionally, the crux of the analysis is based on assumptions that the size of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shadow of a person on the ground is two square feet. This appears to assume that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person is standing up, the ice comes straight down, the ice falls as a single projectile, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ice does not break into smaller pieces as it comes through a roof and ceiling. None of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these assumptions are proven or representative of a typical scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the FAA points out that demographic studies have shown that population  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> density has increased around airports, and probably will continue to increase. These are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> populations that are at greatest risk of damage and injury due to ``blue ice'' dislodging  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from an airplane during descent. Without actions to ensure that leaks from the aft  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lavatory drain systems are detected and corrected in a timely manner, ``blue ice'' incidents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would go unchecked and eventually someone would be struck, perhaps fatally, by falling  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``blue ice.'' To discount the unsafe condition to persons on the ground presented by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> falling ``blue ice'' would be a gross breach of the FAA's safety obligations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commitment to the public.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Reliability Targets for Leak Check Intervals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter requests that the FAA provide reliability targets so that operators  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would know what data were necessary to obtain FAA approval of any request for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extension of a leak check interval. The FAA cannot concur with the commenter's request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has not provided such a ``reliability target'' because of the difficulty involved in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifying a target that would be applicable to and appropriate for all or most operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the FAA recognizes that larger operators are more likely to be able to provide a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistically significant data package, it considers that the approach to the development of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``reliability targets'' must also allow smaller operators to participate. For these reasons,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and until a universal reliability target program can be developed, the FAA will review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual requests on a case-by-case basis. Paragraph (c) of the final rule provides for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the submission of data to be considered for the approval of extensions to leak check  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals; these data can be summarized and accompanied by recommendations from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry groups.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

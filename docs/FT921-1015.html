			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / International Company News: Skopbank to receive FM1.5bn SKOPBANK, the Finnish bank rescued from the brink of collapse last autumn, is receiving an injection of FM1.5bn (Dollars 333.3m) in capital from the Bank of Finland, the central bank which is Skopbank's majority shareholder. The capital injection is intended to ensure Skopbank meets demands set out by the Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy, where-by banks must achieve a minimum capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent by the end of 1992. The announcement comes after the Bank of Finland unveiled a package of measures intended to strengthen the Finnish banking system. These include a plan for the government to make up to FM8bn available to invest in banks' core capital to improve the banks' lending capacity. The FM1.5bn earmarked for Skopbank is structured as core - or tier one  - capital, consisting of perpetual preference capital which can be converted into equity at a later stage. Mr Kaarlo Jannari, chief executive officer at Skopbank, said the injection of capital was necessary as Skopbank's capital adequacy ratio was in danger of falling below 8 per cent based on credit loss forecasts for 1992. He said Skopbank's capital-to-assets ratio had been 8.2 per cent at the end of 1991, while its tier one capital had been about 4.1 per cent. This would not be adequate to sustain the losses forecast for 1992, he said. Last year, Skopbank's credit losses were FM2.55bn, with additional losses of FM3.8bn. Credit losses for 1992 are expected to be about FM2.5bn.</p>

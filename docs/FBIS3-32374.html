			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] For the first time ever, Defense Minister General  Mario Rene Enriquez Morales admitted yesterday that the Army has  always opposed the establishment of a Truth Commission because  it considers that such a commission would be used for actions of  revenge instead of to reconcile the Guatemalan people.    Enriquez Morales, who participated in the Peace Commission  for two years, said the talks have always had this objective as  their sole purpose and that the Truth Commission, which he  called "the vengeance commission," would only polarize society  further.    He added: The formation of this commission has always been  opposed, and I will tell you why. We object to it because it  will attempt to open the wounds of events that occurred in 1980,  1981, and 1982, and this would not help the country at all but,  quite the contrary, would promote confrontation.    The defense minister concluded: We would accept the  formation  of a commission, but of real truth and not the one you formed  because, in this case, the actions are aimed against the Army  and the government in general, because the clandestine guerrilla  would not be identifiable.

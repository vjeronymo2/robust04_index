			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Books: A very inside job THE SERVANT by Alistair McAlpine Faber and Faber, Pounds 11.99, 98 pages THE DEDICATION to this book almost says it all: 'To the most magnificent, Baroness Thatcher of Kesteven, Prime Minister of Great Britain 1979-1990, from one of her many servants, who believes she could have been better served.' Alistair (now Lord) McAlpine was treasurer of the Conservative Party from 1975-1990 and deputy chairman from 1979-83. In other words, he served Mrs Thatcher longer and more faithfully than practically anyone else. Clearly he wishes that she was still prime minister. McAlpine has had a simple, if mannered idea. He thinks that Machiavelli was not machiavellian enough. Instead of writing a book advising the Prince how to behave, he should have concentrated on giving advice to the Prince's servant - or possibly servants: it is not obvious how many of them there can be at the same time. McAlpine was the servant par excellence. Of independent means and well-connected, he never had to worry much about his own position. But even with assets like those, you cannot succeed by merit alone. You need a Prince, who must be perfect, and an Idea which embodies the Prince's aims and ambitions for the people. The Servant merely does the dirty work, much of it behind the scenes, while trying to keep his hands reasonably clean, at least in public. Mrs Thatcher was the Prince. The Idea was - well, this is not exactly explained. Presumably it was what Mrs Thatcher wanted for Britain. No specific policies, indeed no specific persons are mentioned. The Servant is simply a handbook of how to behave. Some of it is mildly amusing. Certainly it is much more elegant than (say) the memoirs of another servant, Bernard Ingham, who was Mrs Thatcher's press secretary. Where Ingham tells you in some detail how the news was managed, McAlpine merely observes that 'timing is crucial and must be carefully studied . . . When something objectionable has to be done, the Servant will want as little public reaction as possible . . . The Servant needs to choose a day when there is plenty of other news . . . He may even find it convenient to create other news as a diversion.' McAlpine must be smiling at the handling by Downing Street of some current events, for obviously servants are not what they used to be. For the rest MaAlpine outlines a number of principles that were successfully practised during the Thatcher era. For example, 'if you propose to destroy a possible enemy, do so by promoting him.' Again, 'having encouraged a man to behave like a noble, a hint to his colleagues that it would not be against the Prince's will if he were destroyed will cause them to tear him apart.' And, of course, the point about meetings is that 'what needs to be done must have been dealt with before the meeting begins.' The fascination of the book lies in the fitting the real scenes to the theoretical advice. It is a very inside job; the Servant wore gloves throughout.</p>

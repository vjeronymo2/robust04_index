			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / OFT life insurance proposals: Insurers attack 'unfair' disclosure demands - Treasury wants agreement soon, Business may shift from life houses, Annual statements for policyholders urged DEMANDS from the Office of Fair Trading for life insurance sales agents to tell prospective clients much more about costs were attacked by many figures in the industry. Mr Brian Richardson, chairman of the Association of British Insurers' life council, yesterday expressed 'regret and disappointment'. But Mr Tony Baker, public affairs director at the association, described the new proposals as 'unnecessary and unfair' and said that some of them were likely to discourage sales of new products. The association's objections focus on two main elements of the Office of Fair Trading report. The first is its suggestion that independent financial advisers should be required to disclose their commissions in cash terms to prospective customers. The second is its suggestion that customers should be told what the value of their policy would be in each year if it is surrendered before maturity. 'It would serve to put some people off buying that product,' Mr Baker said. 'It would have an unnecessary and unfair effect on sales.' Ms Julia Leisching, regulatory consultant to the financial services industry, argued that consumers would be unable to understand tables of such complexity. Independent financial advisers (IFAs) reacted furiously to the report's call for commission disclosure, although the other proposals met with broad approval. Mr Kenneth Davy, president of the Life Insurance Association, a trade body for both independent and tied intermediaries, condemned the proposals for commission disclosure as 'quite ridiculous'. He said: 'It will be extremely detrimental for the IFA sector. The banks and building societies will be delighted because they will be able to give essentially biased advice. The OFT's own research provides no compelling evidence for commission disclosure.' His views were echoed by Ms Joanne Hindle, chief executive officer of IFA Promotion, which promotes the use of independent advisers. She described the pursuit of commission disclosure as 'misguided'. She added: 'It is in everyone's best interest that full commission disclosure is held in abeyance. Should the OFT recommendation be accepted by the Treasury, there is a very real danger that we will see the level playing field tilt away from the IFA sector, making it all too easy for a tied agent to claim that he or she is paid less commission for selling a product than an IFA.' There were some dissident voices. Mr Tony Shepherd, a fee-charging independent financial adviser and chairman of the Institute of Financial Planning, welcomed all the report. He said: 'I personally am in favour of commission disclosure because I think commission is the principal cause of malpractice in the insurance industry.' Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for independent financial advisers yesterday said it would try to convince the Treasury that IFA commission disclosure is inappropriate. Meanwhile, industry analysts say that the proposed rule allowing low-cost sales outlets to price their products more cheaply may well hasten the rise of so-called bancassurance. Banks and building societies which act as the 'tied' sales outlets for a single insurance company have lower costs and consequently could, if current rules allowed, try to compete on price. Until now, regulators have forbidden this but the OFT argues that rule is anti-competitive.</p>

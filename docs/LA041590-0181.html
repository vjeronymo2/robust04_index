			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DENIAL OF EXEMPTION FOR CHEERLEADER WHO GOT 'F'  </P> <P> Re "Prospective Cheerleader's Parents Fail to Win Her Exemption From 'No F'  Rule" (April 7): Let me get this straight. The cheerleader's mother blames: 1)  the school district, for discriminating against cheerleaders; 2) the school and  its advisers, for allowing her daughter to take the class without the math  prerequisite; and 3) the teacher, who didn't "interface" with Melissa when she  was failing.  </P> <P> Why wasn't Mrs. Passy "interfacing" with her daughter when Melissa's grades  dropped from a "C" to a "D" to an "F"?  </P> <P> And, most importantly, why didn't Melissa seek help from her mother or her  teacher before it was too late? I shudder to think of what kind of lesson  Melissa is learning from this experience.  </P> <P> SUZANNE HOUGH  </P> <P> Fountain Valley  </P></p>

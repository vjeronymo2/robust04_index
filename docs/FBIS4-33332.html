			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "RPC Television News" newscast] </F>   [Text] In the presence of top members of the boards of  directors of the country's media, President Guillermo Endara  Galimany signed the Chapultepec Declaration, a document that  guarantees freedom of expression and freedom of the press in the  democracies of the hemisphere.    The Palace of the Herons was the site for the signature of  this important document, during a ceremony headed by President  Guillermo Endara Galimany.    The Chapultepec Declaration is the product of an historic  hemispheric conference held at the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico  City on 11 March 1994. It includes 10 principles, which  establish that freedom of expression is a right. It also points  out that the media and journalists must not be the object of  discrimination or favors because of what they may or may not say  or write. The declaration points out that the credibility of  the media is linked to its commitment to truth, the search for  accuracy, impartiality, and fairness in the information being  released.    [Begin recording] [LA PRENSA Director Roberto Eisenmann] It  is said that freedom of expression is the mother of all  freedoms. I want to tell you, colleagues, that the president of  the Republic, is not signing this document for simple protocol.  We can testify that he has personally studied the document. He  has consulted us, he has thought it out very well because we  know of his deep convictions regarding freedom of expression.    [EL PANAMA AMERICA Director Rosario Arias de Galindo] This  document is especially important because of the events in our  recent history. We hope to be able to understand it so as never  to allow our freedom of expression to be taken away. [end  recording]    President Guillermo Endara Galimany, when delivering his  speech, said the ceremony was a protocol event because  Panamanians enjoy freedom of expression and democracy.    [Begin Endara recording] I have respected freedom of  expression. It has hurt me, I must confess it. The use of this  freedom has hurt me, but the injury to government officials in  general, not only myself, can never cause us to say that because  it hurts us we will not allow the media to make use of its  freedom of expression. A democratic president has the duty of  defending this freedom no matter how much power he may have,  including constitutional and legal powers. A democratic  president must tolerate, as Panamanians say, he has to resist  it. [end recording]    The president of the Republic noted that freedom of  expression has to be defended at all costs and he said he was  optimistic the new government will respect that right.    [Begin Endara recording] Despite certain doubts we may have  had, I have the conviction that the new government will respect  freedom of expression, but if it does not respect it -- and I do  think it will respect it -- we all have the duty, including  myself, to take to the streets to defend freedom of expression.  [end recording]    At the conclusion of the ceremony, the participants agreed  that the Declaration of Chapultepec, which places an emphasis on  freedom of expression, is a key element for strengthening  democracy.</p>

			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / International Company News: Swedbank cuts bad debt 46% The improving fortunes of the Swedish banking sector were underlined yesterday when Swedbank announced a SKr1.7bn (Dollars 220m) first-quarter operating profit after a SKr864m deficit a year earlier. The turnround was spurred by a 46 per cent cut in bad debt and a SKr1.58m capital gain from the sale of Robur, a fund management unit. The bank's recovery has been assisted by cost-cutting and a SKr8bn programme to rebuild its capital base. It intends to seek a stock market listing early next year. The group's consolidated result before loan losses was SKr3.2bn, a 67 per cent improvement. Loan losses of SKr1.5bn were equal to 1.5 per cent of group lending. Problem loans were down 30 per cent at SKr15.4bn at the end of the quarter. The group's capital adequacy ratio was 10.9 per cent. The bank expects full-year credit losses of around SKr6bn, down from SKr11.7bn last year. It expects to return to profit after last year's SKr3.66bn deficit. Mr Goran Collert, chief executive, said: 'Continued efforts to cut costs as well as sustained low interest rates and increased credit demand are of vital importance for a favourable result development in 1994.' Swedbank still suffers from weak credit demand, with lending to the public falling by SKr22bn to SKr387bn over the 12 months to March 31.</p>

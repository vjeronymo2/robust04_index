			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / First building block wedged in place: Prospects for UK commercial property Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, this week celebrated the beginning of the end of his 35-year struggle to build 'an outstanding example of modern architecture' at One Poultry, in the heart of the City of London. Soon after claiming victory in his long-running battle with the planning authorities, he overcame another important obstacle. He secured sufficient funds for his project by going into partnership with Mr Dieter Bock, the German entrepreneur who is joint managing director of Lonrho. Lord Palumbo is convinced that his building will have a place in history. The scheme, the only London office designed by the late Sir James Stirling, is already notorious for the skirmish it has provoked between traditionalists and modernists. Conservationists bitterly opposed to the proposed demolition of the existing buildings - fine examples of Victorian commercial architecture - and loathe the so-called masterpiece that is due to replace them. Prince Charles described an early modernist design for the site by Mies van der Rohe as a 'glass stump' and the design by Sir James as a '1930s wireless'. Lord Palumbo now believes that his uncompromising stand will be vindicated. 'The buildings for which we have the greatest affection today received the greatest hostility at their time of construction,' he says. 'Architecture is an emotional art form. The great validator is time.' Although the debate over One Poultry has focused on rival architectural visions, there may be a wider significance to the announcement that goes beyond arguments over heritage and the future face of the City. Lord Palumbo's success in arranging funding, details of which Mr Bock has kept to himself, suggests that sceptics who regard conditions in the London office market as too depressed to justify such an extravagant new building, were over pessimistic. 'This partnership (with Mr Bock) is an indication that the recession has turned a corner,' says Lord Palumbo. However, it might be wrong to read too much into this for the wider property development market in the City. One Poultry is, in many ways, a special case. Though relatively small, it occupies one of the best positions in the City. And Lord Palumbo's desire to build the development is as much the fulfilment of a lifetime's obsession as a hard-headed commercial venture. There is little other evidence that the property development market has turned the corner. Only 6.2m sq ft of offices are currently being built in the UK's cities, compared with the 15m sq ft completed in the peak year of 1991, according to Chesterton, chartered surveyors. More than 72m sq ft of office space remains in the planning pipeline. The development boom of the late 1980s and the severe recession of the last three years have left deep scars. More than 15 per cent of offices in the UK's city centres are empty. Rents are still falling, except in parts of the retailing sector, and demand for new space from tenants remains feeble. But the gloomy outlook for developers contrasts starkly with the buoyancy of another sector of the property market: investment in buildings that are already generating income. The investment market has been transformed in recent months. Property values, which fell by an average of 42 per cent between November 1992 and May this year, have begun to recover. This recovery has resulted in large part from sterling's traumatic exit from the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago, which some in the property industry believe saved the market from collapse. High interest rates were triggering defaults by tenants and putting pressure on companies' balance sheets, forcing them to sell property. Once interest rates came down from 10 per cent to 6 per cent, the tensions eased and the cycle of decline went into reverse. Buying commercial property to rent out was no longer seen as a recklessly risky investment; a cool appraisal of its prospects demonstrated that it had considerable attractions to investors. Property prices had tumbled to a level where yields - the ratio of annual income to capital value - were significantly higher than on gilt edged securities. As a result, property appeared to offer an each-way bet: a combination of a high, secure income together with growth potential. Some now believe the opportunities are exceptional. Richard Ellis, the surveying firm, is predicting that returns on investments in office buildings will reach 25 per cent by the middle of next year. The investment market is seeing a spending surge resembling the one that reached giddy heights in the mid-1970s and the mid and late 1980s. After years of minimal investment in property, financial institutions have earmarked more than Pounds 7bn for property investment over the next 12 to 18 months, according to recent surveys. The sudden rise in interest from institutions has even raised fears that parts of the market are overheating. Fund managers report a scramble to invest in the sector, creating a shortage of suitable properties. Mr Matthew Oakeshott of Olim, the fund mangers, points to the 'white hot' market for retail warehouses. 'The institutions are being sheeplike. They have gone from panic selling to panic buying in three years. It is quite dangerous.' 'There is a limited amount of stock and a multitude of desperate purchasers,' according to Mr Robert Maxted of Pillar Property Investment. 'Yields have moved quite dramatically in the last two weeks.' The strong demand for property is currently centred on properties occupied by financially secure tenants on long leases. But, gradually, frustration at the difficulty of securing such properties will force investors to be more adventurous. As confidence grows, the activity in the investment market may eventually spill over into property development. Finance for property development remains scarce, because banks are reeling from losses incurred in the market over recent years, but there is evidence that small schemes by developers with a strong understanding of local markets are emerging. High profile schemes, such as the City landmark that Lord Palumbo wants to create, will probably remain rarities for some years. Nonetheless, the One Poultry project provides palpable evidence that developers are prepared to risk a comeback.</p>

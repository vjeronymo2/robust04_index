			<p>940601 FT  01 JUN 94 / Tokyo takes step forward on optical fibre highway Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry yesterday took its ambitions to build an information superhighway a step forward, with the announcement of a three-stage plan to lay optical fibre throughout the country, with 100 per cent population coverage by the year 2010. The ministry's vision, based on a government advisory panel recommendation, calls for laying optical fibre to connect 20 per cent of the population within six years, extending that to 60 per cent by 2005, with nationwide hook-up over the following five years. The laying of the infrastructure will be entrusted to telecommunications companies and cable television network operators. The government should provide support in the form of interest-free loans and tax incentives to encourage investment in the infrastructure, the report says. 'During the network's preliminary stage, it is important for the government to play a leading role in triggering future development, particularly with regard to the development and introduction of public applications,' the panel's report states. The ministry plans to put public network applications into practical use by the year 2000, and intends to ensure budgetary allocation will have high priority. A pilot project to test applications of multimedia services such as video on demand, via fibre to the home, will begin in the Kansai area around Osaka in July. The ministry estimates the cost of laying optical fibre cable to homes could total Y33 trillion (Pounds 210bn) at the least, but believes the information superhighway will generate markets worth Y123 trillion and create about 2.43m jobs. It is studying the benefits which multimedia services offer a society such as Japan's: heavily populated, concentrated in urban areas, experiencing structural industrial changes, and rapidly ageing.</p>

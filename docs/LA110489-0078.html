			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'DEATH-TO-AMERICA' RALLY TO MARK EMBASSY TAKEOVER;  </P> <P> IRAN: U.S. FLAGS WILL BE TORCHED ON THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY TODAY IN A  DEMONSTRATION AT THE SITE OF THE FORMER COMPOUND IN TEHRAN.  </P> <P> Ten years after Islamic militants seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and made  hostages a cruel symbol of Middle East politics, Iran will mark the anniversary  today with an orchestrated outpouring of anti-American rage.  </P> <P> Once again, as on previous anniversaries of the takeover, radicals will march  down Taleghani Avenue to the iron gates of the embassy compound, now a military  school of the Revolutionary Guards, chanting, "Marg bar Amerika" -- "Death to  America" -- before invited representatives of the foreign press.  </P> <P> "The dismay and shame resulting from this humiliation will always remain on the  face of the oppressor ringleaders of the United States," the Ayatollah Ali  Khamenei declared this week as the radical fervor moved toward crescendo.  Khamenei was named Iran's spiritual leader last summer after the death of the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, founder of the Islamic revolution and the man who  branded Washington "the Great Satan."  </P> <P> Today's demonstrations will include the burning of American flags and the  opening, on the former embassy grounds, of a five-day exhibition of documents  and other purported evidence of U.S. espionage in Iran. Military men accused of  taking part in a U.S.-organized spy ring will be presented to the foreign  press.  </P> <P> The 160 flags put to the torch will commemorate 16 Kuwaiti Shiite Muslims  beheaded two months ago by Saudi Arabia on charges of planting bombs in  connection with this year's pilgrimage to Mecca. The Saudis accused Iran of  ordering the terrorist incident, and Tehran authorities have labeled it a  U.S.-Saudi plot.  </P> <P> Seizure of the embassy created a political gulf between Washington and Tehran  in the first months of the revolution that drove U.S.-backed Shah Mohammed Reza  Pahlavi from power. The remaining year of President Jimmy Carter's term was  scarred by the takeover of what student captors called "a den of spies."  </P> <P> Iran Television released a steady barrage of film clips of the 52 captive  diplomats and military men. A U.S. rescue raid collapsed in disaster at the  staging point called Desert 1, and a spiritual leader deepened the wound by  gleefully poking at the remains of American casualties.  </P> <P> The hostages were finally released after 444 days of captivity, on the day  Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as President. Iranian leaders still crow over the  episode.  </P> <P> "Its main thrust was that the colossal empire of wealth, might and deception  which pushed around nations and their leaders . . . was itself humiliated,"  Khamenei declared in remarks monitored in Nicosia. "The world was shown that  the power of the bullies is not absolute."  </P> <P> However, the embassy takeover served to ostracize the Khomeini regime among  Western nations, and Khomeini's pledge to export fundamentalist Islam raised  opposition in neighboring Muslim states. Iran's decade-long war with Iraq saw  Arab nations, with few exceptions, pledging solidarity and providing funds to  their brother government in Baghdad in the struggle against non-Arab Iran.  </P> <P> The death of Khomeini left the Iranian leadership in rival camps of pragmatists  and radicals. Today's activities at the embassy are a radical show. The  Militant Clergy Assn. of Tehran has taken the lead in organizing the program,  which it said in a statement would be conducted "more fervently than in the  past so that the last hopes of our enemies are crushed."  </P> <P> Significantly, a major speaker will be Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, the hard-line  former interior minister dropped by pragmatist President Hashemi Rafsanjani  from his new government. Mohtashemi had not been seen in recent weeks and was  once rumored to be under house arrest.  </P> <P> In an interview made public Friday by the official Islamic Republic News  Agency, Mohtashemi said he had been on a visit to Lebanon. He did not disclose  the reason for his trip or his itinerary, but the bearded cleric is known to  maintain close relations with fundamentalist Shiite groups in Lebanon,  including Hezbollah, the umbrella organization whose radical factions are  believed to hold foreign hostages there, including eight Americans.  </P> <P> In the news service interview, Mohtashemi denied reports of a power struggle  between the two leadership camps, saying: "Conservative or extremist in the  Western sense of the words are just alien expressions in Islam. When a common  enemy is concerned, a Muslim has just one single outlook."  </P> <P> While no Iranian leader speaks ill of the embassy seizure, Rafsanjani, in a  Tehran press conference two weeks ago, commented on today's anniversary with  less fervor than has been heard from the radicals this week in Tehran. He  called the takeover "an important incident . . . an important decision."  </P> <P> In his evident desire to improve relations with the West for help in rebuilding  Iran's war-devastated economy, Rafsanjani has found himself dogged by the issue  of hostages -- in this case those held by pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiites -- and a  legacy of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy. In response to the takeover,  then-President Carter froze Iranian assets in the United States.  </P> <P> In last summer's hostage crisis in Beirut, Washington sent word to Tehran  asking for Iranian help. Rafsanjani responded positively but sent signals back  that the Bush Administration should offer a sign of good will, mentioning  specifically the impounded funds.  </P> <P> 444 DAYS OF TERROR  </P> <P> 1979  </P> <P> November 4: Militants seize U.S. Embassy, 66 hostages  </P> <P> November 10, 12, 14: U.S. deports Iranian students, halts import of Iranian  oil, freezes assets worth $8 billion  </P> <P> November 19, 20: 12 black and female hostages released  </P> <P> November 21: Blindfolded hostages paraded before huge crowds chanting "Death to  Carter"  </P> <P> December 12: U.S. expels 183 Iranian diplomats  </P> <P> December 15: Shah leaves U.S. for exile in Panama  </P> <P> 1980  </P> <P> Jan. 13: U.N.

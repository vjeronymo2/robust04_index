			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Romantics from the north - Reinhart Foundation exhibition at the National Gallery Romanticism is one of those useful terms of critical labelling that means just what we choose it to mean. It may be no more than a mood or attitude - a long cloak, a wide hat and a dark look. Precisely applied, it invokes the refinement and self-conscious celebration of sensibility that found particular expression from the 1770s on, the age of Goethe, Byron, Beethoven, Gericault, Delacroix, Turner . . . In taking us from Friedrich to Hodler and into the 20th century, A Romantic Tradition at the National Gallery seems to want it both ways. At the start, with Wolf we have the celebration of nature and the sublime, with Friedrich himself the yearning melancholy of heightened feeling, with Fuseli all the melodrama of sturm und drang. At the end, with Bocklin and Hodler, we have sexual symbolism and incipient expressionism. And in between we have a lot of interesting, unfamiliar and lovely works that are Romantic only if we say they are. To trace the evolution of early 19th-century Romanticism into fin-de-siecle symbolism would be as good a peg as any on which to hang an exhibition, but it would require either a broader international scope than this admits, or a sharper critical focus. As it is, the exhibition is limited to the northern European schools, principally German and Swiss with the odd Dane and Norwegian, by the very nature of the Reinhart collections. Its positive virtue - and it is indeed a lovely exhibition - lies rather, and paradoxically, in its uncritical miscellaneity. We are in this country grievously unfamiliar with the later northern European schools. The National Gallery has long recognised the deficiency in its own collections and has begun to repair it - but only begun: the constraints of our funding policies are ever to be endured. The chance to see this range of work, to recognise masters hitherto unknown to us, to take them as they come and to draw fresh comparisons is most welcome. Friedrich himself is now familiar enough, but his works here are especially fine and, beside his usual images of setting suns and distant towers, fraught with the religious symbolism of our path through life, includes more straight-forward and cheerful landscapes, most remarkable the vertiginous view down the chalk cliffs at Rugen, which he and his wife visited on their honeymoon in 1818. No less remarkable, and rather more to the point, are the looming mountains and glaciers of the 18th century painter, Caspar Wolf, all painted in the 1770s, the decade of Friedrich's birth. The Swiss, Jacques-Laurent Agasse, who studied with David in Paris in the 1780s and spent much of his career in England - the Tate rescued him from our ignorance a year or two ago - features prominently. His affinity with Stubbs in particular, that famous Romantic, and English sporting and genre Realism in general, is manifest. It is Agasse who establishes the thread of Realism that runs through the show, and bourgeois or Biedermeier Realism at that. The connection with Victorian anecdotal painting, the pre-Raphaelites and later Social Realism throughout Europe - Ring, Guthrie, Bastien-Lepage - is easy to sustain. There are 'The Village Politicians' of Wilhelm Liebel (1877); the portraits and domestic groups of Albert Anker, notably the large and delightful Creche (1890), in which a host of children is given soup by a young and beautifully serious deaconess; the mid-century landscapes of Zund, Koller and Calame; the looser proto-expressionist studies of Carl Blechen in the 1820s and 30s. Most remarkable and beautiful of all is the Dane, Christen Kobke's view of a sailing party just returned (1839), the sail furled, the wind dropped and the evening coming on, and all so still and febrile in its clarity. There is much else to recommend, and the works on paper, shown separately in the Sunley Room, are not to be missed, most especially the pastels and gouaches of Adolph von Menzel. A fine woman sits with her arms folded, her eyes shaded by her straw hat, a strong image beautifully realised. It was made up from a note taken on a boat-trip. The sketchbook source, we are told, shows that the poor woman, shortly before, had been violently sick. There is Romantic for you. Caspar David Friedrich to Ferdinand Hodler: A Romantic Tradition - 19th century paintings and drawings from the Oskar Reinhart Foundation, Winterthur; the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square WC2, until September 4, then on to Geneva.</p>

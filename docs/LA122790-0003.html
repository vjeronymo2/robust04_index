Open Tuesday through Friday  for lunch, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Tuesday through Saturday for dinner, 5 to 10 p.m.  (714) 633-5654.  </P> <P> A family-run restaurant that's intimate yet casual, classy yet reasonable, and  serves deep red, rich, garlic-laden sauce straight from the soul of Sicily.  Pasta dishes are popular, and the steak a la Sicilian is extraordinary. But no  place is perfect. It's closed Sunday and Monday.JIM COLONNA  </P></p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / International Company News: Fall in bookings hits hotel chain THE slow-down in inter-national travel drove Four Seasons Hotels, the Toronto-based chain which operates some of the world's most expensive hotels, into a first-quarter loss, writes Bernard Simon. Four Seasons blamed the CDollars 4.1m (USDollars 3.56m) loss, equal to 19 cents a share, on a 'dramatic downturn' in bookings. The company's properties include London's Inn on the Park. Earnings in the first quarter of 1990 were CDollars 1.7m. Revenues dipped to CDollars 139.6m from CDollars 143.4m. Operating losses from the group's hotels rose to CDollars 8.8m from CDollars 1.4m.</p>

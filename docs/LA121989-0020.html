			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LATINO GROUP OFFERS ITS DESIGN FOR DISTRICTING;  </P> <P> POLITICS: A COUNTERPROPOSAL LEAVES LITTLE FOR SCHABARUM. THE KEY QUESTION  EMERGES: WILL DANA GO FOR IT?  </P> <P> The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund has made the Los  Angeles County Board of Supervisors a counteroffer in efforts to settle a  federal voting rights lawsuit, proposing to carve up the San Gabriel Valley  among three supervisors and create a new 1st District in which a Latino has a  chance of being elected.  </P> <P> The offer was made in response to a settlement proposal offered by the county  board last week that also makes Supervisor Pete Schabarum bear the brunt of  redistricting by forcing him to face reelection in the predominantly Latino 1st  District.  </P> <P> The latest map, endorsed by the Justice Department and the American Civil  Liberties Union, which joined MALDEF in the lawsuit, would make a Schabarum  reelection bid even more difficult, as Latinos account for 70% of the  population in the district and 47.4% of the registered voters. Registered  Republicans, in what was once a solid conservative district, would drop to  25.9% of voters.  </P> <P> Under the county's proposal, the district would have been 63% Latino by  population, 36.5% Latino by voter registration and 34.2% Republican. Many  observers, including Latino politicians interested in the seat, said that under  the county's proposal it would be possible for Schabarum to hold on to the  seat.  </P> <P> But the counterproposal adds high Latino voter registration areas of Pico  Rivera and Montebello to the proposed 1st District and cuts out solid Schabarum  conservative areas of Covina and Walnut.  </P> <P> MALDEF officials could not be reached Monday for comment on the proposal. The  organization has said that it will also file a plan for drawing district lines  as part of a proposal to expand the board to seven members.  </P> <P> In addition to the drastic changes to Schabarum's 1st District, the proposed  redistricting also would herald big changes for Supervisor Deane Dana, who  broke ranks with his fellow conservative supervisors and joined two liberals in  voting to begin settlement negotiations.  </P> <P> Dana's 4th District now runs along the coast from Malibu to Long Beach and then  juts inland to Paramount and Bellflower. Under the latest proposal, it would  continue along like a skinny finger up into the San Gabriel Valley -- taking in  Whittier, La Habra Heights, Diamond Bar, Walnut and Covina.  </P> <P> Many Republican politicians in these areas have close ties to Schabarum, and  they have answered his call to urge Dana to reverse his position and withdraw  from settlement talks.  </P> <P> But Dana would also benefit under the MALDEF proposal, which takes out of his  district Santa Monica and Malibu, two high Democratic voter registration areas  where he has had problems over issues concerning development.  </P> <P> Dana, through a spokesman, would say only, "We will confer with the attorneys  and see where we stand." But some observers speculated that the possibility of  a settlement could evaporate if Dana is not satisfied with the plan. If he  changes his vote, and joins conservatives Schabarum and Mike Antonovich, the  case would go to trial on Jan. 2.  </P> <P> "That's the big question," said political consultant Allan Hoffenblum. "Will  Dana buy it?"  </P> <P> Under the MALDEF proposal Supervisor Kenneth Hahn would remain in a solid  central Los Angeles Democratic district. Antonovich, while shifting eastward to  take in the foothill region of the San Gabriel Valley, would still have a  solidly Republican district.  </P> <P> Liberal Supervisor Ed Edelman would see his district expand to include heavily  Democratic areas in Malibu and Santa Monica, and parts of the West San Fernando  Valley, where his environmentalist views are popular.  </P> <P> As the various maps are proposed and debated in the secret negotiations, San  Gabriel Valley communities are up in arms over the proposals, contending there  should be public comment on the redistricting plans that threaten to  drastically change the political representation of hundreds of thousands of  county residents.  </P> <P> Schabarum has promised to "pack" today's board meeting in an attempt to force  Dana to drop out of settlement talks. Many local Republican politicians have  written letters of support to Schabarum and missives of disapproval to Dana.  </P> <P> Dana, often seen as the quiet, soft-spoken member of the board, emerged in  recent weeks as the political force behind the settlement talks. Dana has said  his motivation for negotiating a settlement is that it would be better for the  supervisors to draw the new district lines than to have a map imposed on them  if they should lose the lawsuit.  </P> <P> And in drawing the lines in his own favor, Dana said, "I wasn't going to shoot  myself in the foot."  </P> <P> The lawsuit accuses supervisors of breaking up the Latino neighborhoods among  three districts, thereby weakening the political clout of many of the county's  2 millions Latinos in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Maldef Redistricting Proposal  </P> <P> The map below has been proposed by the Mexican American Legal Defense and  Educational Fund as a way redraw county board of supervisors districts to  concentrate Latino voters in a single district and settle a federal lawsuit the  organization brought against the county under the federal Voting Rights Act.  The proposal is a counter offer to a map submitted by the county last week. It  adds Latino areas in Pico Rivera and Montebello to the 1st District and cuts  out Whittier, Walnut and Covina.  </P></p>

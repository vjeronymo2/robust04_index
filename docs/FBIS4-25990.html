			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, 15 Jun (XINHUA) -- Li Ruihuan, member of  the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee  and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], had a meeting at the  Great Hall of the People this morning with the delegation of the  Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong headed by its  president Herbert Liang.    When the meeting began, Li Ruihuan congratulated the  association on its 60th founding anniversary and welcomed the  association's friends to visit Beijing. He said: The Chinese  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong is a business group with  extensive influence. Over the years you have accomplished a  great deal of work in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and  development, as well as in supporting China's reform, opening  up, and modernization. I hope you will continue to work hard to  make new contributions to Hong Kong's stability and prosperity  before and after 1997.    Li Ruihuan said: The "one country, two systems" principle is  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great creation which is in line with the  interests of all the Chinese people, including our countrymen in  Hong Kong, and it has important and far-reaching significance.  We will unswervingly implement this principle. He pointed out:  Much work remains to be done in implementing the "one country,  two systems" principle and in maintaining Hong Kong's smooth  transition and its stability and prosperity after 1997. Just  like accomplishing all other projects, we must strategically  despise them but tactically take them seriously. So not only  must we have the determination and confidence, but we must also  have the capabilities and methods for accomplishing them.    He urged countrymen in Hong Kong to unite as closely as  possible and contribute more to the process of achieving the  goal that "Hong Kong is to be governed by Hong Kong citizens  themselves."</p>

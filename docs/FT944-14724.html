			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Kleinwort Endow Kleinwort Endowment Policy Trust had a net asset value of 116.9p per share at September 30, up from 115.7p in March and 109.6p a year earlier. The trust concentrates on achieving capital growth through investment in mid-term endowments with a projected final net asset value of 311p at its planned conclusion in October 2003. The value at its launch in July 1992 was 96.3p. The directors warned, however, that investment markets had been 'very mixed' in the first nine months of this year 'and this may have an impact on eventual returns.' Losses per share were 0.3p (earnings of 1.95p). Kleinwort Second Endowment Policy Trust reported net asset value of 98.5p per share, against 44.9p, partly paid, following its launch last December. Net losses for the period October 4 1993 to September 30 1994 were Pounds 1.34m, for losses per share of 6.71p.</p>

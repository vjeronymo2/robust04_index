			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ramey <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is binding in the District of Columbia Circuit where a great many of the employees within the Board's jurisdiction are employed and would be bringing suit. While there exists the possibility that another circuit might some day render a different interpretation, it is clear that the Board has no authority to define the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. A Board regulation on this subject, therefore, could not be binding and might have the effect of giving employees erroneous advice on their judicial remedies. For this reason, the Board has decided to confine the scope of its regulations to the conduct of matters before the Board, and to eliminate any interpretations concerning what alternate judicial remedies might be available to employees. The Board has, therefore, deleted &sect;28.100 in its entirety and eliminated all cross references to that section. See changes to &sect;&sect;28.17, 28.90, 28.100, and 28.101.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board will retain &sect;28.90 which informs employees of the procedures for seeking judicial review of a final Board decision before the Federal Circuit. This is retained because such appeals are explicitly authorized by the Board's governing statute and because there is no legal dispute about an employee's right to file such appeals. The legal uncertainty highlighted by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ramey <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  case concerns whether GAO employees have any other options for obtaining judicial consideration of their claims of discrimination. The Board will leave that matter for resolution by the courts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4 CFR Part 28  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Equal employment opportunity, Government employees, Labor-management relations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 4 CFR Part 29  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Equal employment opportunity, Government employees.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, Title 4, Chapter I, Subchapter B, Code of Federal Regulations, is amended as follows.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.

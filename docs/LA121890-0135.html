			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAM FANS RUN INTO TROUBLE AT ANAHEIM STADIUM, TOO  </P> <P> Snarled traffic and a few fender-benders accompanied the sellout crowd at  Anaheim Stadium for the Los Angeles Rams' Monday night football game against  the San Francisco 49ers.  </P> <P> "It was extremely congested for a long time," said Anaheim Police Lt. Ray  Welch.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of late arrivals because of the traffic."  </P> <P> Welch said the stadium parking filled to capacity, along with several nearby  lots, forcing many spectators to park "a greater distance away" than during  most Rams games. He said there were several vehicle mishaps, but no major  accidents.  </P> <P> Six additional officers were stationed in the stadium area to contend with the  football traffic and rush-hour gridlock.  </P> <P> Police Sgt. Richard Zschache said the extra officers were on duty to keep  traffic moving. They were stationed at entry and exit points of the stadium.  </P> <P> "When the stadium lots fill up, we get a lot of people trying to make turns  from the middle lane of traffic when they see a parking space," Zschache said.  "We are prepared for that."  </P> <P> Earlier in the day, police were advising motorists to steer clear of the  stadium-area freeways and streets before game time if travel wasn't necessary.  Traffic began to build up about 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> "It's just like other Monday night games," Zschache said. "There are more cars  on the road because people are leaving work to come to the game and don't have  time to go home and pick up their friends."  </P></p>

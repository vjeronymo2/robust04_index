			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MELLOW DESIGNER FASHIONS WILD AND CRAZY CLOTHES  </P> <P> Linda Stokes' voice is so soft and her demeanor so reserved, you'd think the  Woodland Hills clothing designer specialized in pleated skirts, paisley blouses  and navy blazers.  </P> <P> But Stokes' personality and fashions don't quite match. Stokes goes for gold  sequined bustiers, mile-high shoulder pads and ruffled organza miniskirts.  </P> <P> "I'm not as wild as all of these," she said, pointing to the dozens of glitzy  garments hanging on racks in her living room. "People think that's where I  become talkative, and I guess that's true. The crazier it is, the more fun I  have making it."  </P> <P> Stokes, 35, has been having bolts of fun lately. Her flashy, futuristic  fashions have earned her increasing recognition among a celebrity clientele,  and she says her company, LSO Designs (Linda Stokes Originals), is growing  rapidly. Her clothes are modeled in fashion shows about once a month.  </P> <P> Stokes makes and sells her garments out of her home, but she hopes to open her  own boutique by year's end. Her designs should be available in retail stores  soon.  </P> <P> "I would love to carry her line," said Maria Atanasio, owner of 818 Freight, a  large boutique in Woodland Hills. Atanasio says  </P> <P> that she has just expanded her store to include black-tie garments and that  Stokes' designs will fit right in.  </P> <P> "Linda is really on a couture level," Atanasio said. "She has a very good eye  for color and style. In this business, you see a lot of people come and go, and  many copy their designs. It's hard to find a designer who is really a creator,  and Linda definitely is."  </P> <P> Designing for both dressy and casual occasions, Stokes uses a variety of  fabrics -- silk, cotton and wool among them -- and decorates many of her  garments with leather and snakeskin appliques. She also makes earrings and  covers shoes to match her designs.  </P> <P> "I've always been willing to go a little further," she said. "I've taken a lot  of chances, gone way out."  </P> <P> Too far out for some, perhaps. Stokes would eventually like upscale department  stores to carry her line. But she said buyers have asked her to alter her  designs. "I'm not ever going to do that," she said. "Not for anybody."  </P> <P> Stokes' garments sell from $200 to $1,800 and rent for $50 to $150 a day (about  25% of her business). Spokesmen for several department stores said similar,  handmade items typically run from $1,000 to $10,000.  </P> <P> The mother of four teen-agers, Stokes works on her designs almost every day,  sometimes for up to 18 hours. She and her six employees can make most dresses  in about three hours (her living room is full of sewing equipment, fabrics and  racks of clothing), although designs with beads can take more than a week.  </P> <P> Stokes does much of the sewing herself, which she says is unusual. "Most of the  designers I know will just sketch," she said. "Most of your big designers can't  sew."  </P> <P> Stokes, a Detroit native, learned to sew in a junior high home economics class.  It wasn't long before she was making prom dresses for her friends. After high  school she moved to New York to attend the Pratt Institute of Fashion, but six  months later she was bored and moved back to Detroit. "I was already beyond  that point, and I was too anxious to work."  </P> <P> Stokes and her family moved to Woodland Hills six years ago. They chose the San  Fernando Valley because it is a "peaceful atmosphere for kids," but most of  Stokes' clients live in Beverly Hills. "My clients are always asking for me to  move," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Close to Home'  </P> <P> She says she will probably open her first boutique in Beverly Hills, but would  like to open a store in the Valley too. "I'd like to be close to home because  that's where I'm comfortable," she said.  </P> <P> Stokes has built a clientele primarily through connections in the entertainment  industry. Her husband Michael is a record producer for Motown, and she is part  of an R &amp; B singing duet called Magic Lady, which has issued three albums  and toured Europe.  </P> <P> One of Stokes' best customers is Marla Gibbs, star of NBC's "227." Gibbs met  Stokes five years ago at a charity fashion show. "We all fell in love with her  clothes," said Gibbs, who recently wore a Stokes design -- a full-length purple  knit dress with gold and silver appliques -- for a scene in "227."  </P> <P> Gibbs says Stokes is very easy to work with. "She's very quiet and shy, but  she's confident about her fashions. And she's very good about matching your  personality. I get a lot of compliments, and she gets a lot of business."  </P> <P> In addition to sewing for celebrities, Stokes has made prom dresses for  students at Taft, Reseda and Chatsworth high schools. However, she does offer  special prices for high school students: $150 to $300.  </P></p>

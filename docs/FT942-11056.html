			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Societies consider loyalty bonuses for savers Building society savers could be given loyalty bonuses or a share of the profits under schemes being considered by some of the larger societies. The aim would be to underline to members their ownership of the society and the advantages of mutuality, encouraging them to look on their membership as a continuing benefit rather than an asset which they should sell for a one-off payment. Such schemes might have the added benefit for societies of attracting retail deposits. Societies have suffered a net outflow of retail deposits in each of the last five months for which figures are available. Since Lloyds Bank's Pounds 1.8bn offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society last month, societies have become more conscious that their members might want to 'unlock' some of the value of their ownership. C&amp;G members will receive cash payments of up to Pounds 10,000 each if the deal goes ahead. The schemes being considered fall into two forms. One would involve handing a share of profits to members as a 'dividend'. The other would give savers a bonus after, for example, five or 10 years. Among the traditional arguments in favour of mutuality has been that societies are able to offer more competitive rates to both saving and borrowing members than banks are able to do, because they do not have to divert any income to pay dividends to shareholders. Some of the more innovative societies, however, now believe that they should seek to provide benefits with a higher profile. The sector as a whole is better-placed to consider payouts than it has been in recent years. The 1993 results for 19 of the 20 largest societies show an average increase in pre-tax profits of 53 per cent over 1992, and a fall of 18 per cent in provisions for bad debts. Schemes are being considered both by societies that are determined to remain independent mutual institutions, and by those that would be ready to convert to plc status, but which do not wish to come under pressure from their members to do so immediately. The Building Societies Commission, the sector's statutory regulator, said yesterday that there was no legislation preventing societies from paying out cash to their members. It added, however, that it would expect to be informed in advance of any scheme in order to satisfy itself that planned payments would not damage a society's underlying strength.

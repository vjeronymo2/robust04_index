			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Kantor seeks EU alliance on Japan The US is to ask the European Union to join an effort over the next month to persuade Japan to open its domestic markets further. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, will propose today to Sir Leon Brittan, the EU trade commissioner, that trade ministers from the so-called Quad countries - the US, EU, Canada and Japan - hold a special meeting probably early next month to discuss the issue. Mr Kantor told the Financial Times in Brussels that 'a window of opportunity' was open between January 29, by which time Japan is expected to have passed new economic stimulus measures, and the middle of February. Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, is due in Washington on February 11, while Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of Gatt, has invoked a February 15 deadline for new market access proposals. Noting European dissatisfaction with recent Japanese offers on white spirits, copper and other commodities, Mr Kantor said it was time for the US and the EU to go 'shoulder-to-shoulder' to impress on Tokyo the need for greater initiatives. Quad officials already have a meeting scheduled for January 19. Assuming Sir Leon attends, that could be followed by a full ministerial session roughly two weeks later. Mr Kantor emphasised that it was incumbent on all industrialised nations to open and build their domestic markets. He put this challenge on a par with US proposals to make Europe's security appropriate for the post-cold war era. Mr Kantor was added to President Clinton's European travelling party last week not only, he said, to propose a harder line with Japan. Also on his EU agenda are following up on the Uruguay Round agreement and reaching a new agreement opening up European procurement policies on heavy electrical equipment.</p>

			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / US urged to slash N-arsenal: Report backs nuclear weapons as deterrent to third world THE US should cut its strategic nuclear arsenal by 60 per cent and completely revise its missile targeting strategy, according to a report by a high-level Pentagon advisory panel. The panel recommends cutting the number of strategic nuclear warheads to around 5,000, roughly half the level that would be permitted by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty signed last year by the US and the Soviet Union. It advocates, however, using the nuclear threat not only to deter nuclear aggression but also as a deterrent to third world countries which might possess chemical or biological weapons, and as a symbol of US power in the world. The recommendations would represent a significant shift in US nuclear strategy, but still fall some way short of the changes that some analysts have suggested in light of the collapse of the Soviet Union. President George Bush announced in September a series of unilateral measures that significantly cut the number of tactical nuclear weapons deployed by the US, but some critics in Congress and outside have urged him to go further in cutting strategic weapons. According to reports in the Washington Post and Los Angeles Times, the panel, chaired by former air force secretary Mr Thomas Reed, recommends preserving a nuclear arsenal that remains larger than the combined total of warheads possessed by China, France and the UK. It also argues that maintaining a substantial nuclear deterrent helps discourage Japan and Germany from developing their own nuclear weapons. Defence analysts noted yesterday that the report's emphasis on preserving a nuclear deterrent against third world threats, now that the Soviet threat has diminished so dramatically, parallels the arguments made by the Defence Department for keeping weapons systems which were originally designed with Cold War objectives in mind. The B2 stealth bomber, for example, was originally devised to penetrate Soviet air defences. Its backers have faced an increasingly difficult task in persuading Congress to maintain funding, but have argued that the success of the F117 stealth fighter in Operation Desert Storm justifies preserving the B2 for conventional missions. The report argues for abandoning the US's 1979 pledge not to use its missiles against third world countries that do not themselves possess nuclear weapons. It says the nuclear arsenal could be used as a deterrent against a wide range of threats, such as the annihilation of countries such as Israel and Taiwan, the seizure of vital raw materials or foreign domination of a segment of space.</p>

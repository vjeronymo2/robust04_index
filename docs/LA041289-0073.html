			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRANCE WANTS TO SLAM EUROPE'S OPEN DOOR TO U.S. TV  </P> <P> The rally was called by an organization with a French revolutionary name, the  States General of Culture, and the several hundred French screenwriters, actors  and directors gathered in the old Mogador Theater were in a rebellious mood.  </P> <P> However, the main target of their wrath Monday night was not the Bourbon  monarchy, but the American television industry.  </P> <P> They were assembled in a last-minute appeal to the government to change its  mind about a compromise decision it made in the European Commision last month  to eliminate quotas on non-European -- mainly American -- programs on European  television. A critical vote on the proposed "Television Without Borders"  project of the European Commission is scheduled for Thursday or Friday in  Brussels.  </P> <P> For years, a large segment of the French film community, including such famous  actors and directors as Jean-Paul Belmondo and Claude Berri, has called for a  quota on non-European content of televised features. The artists see the quota  as a protective measure for their national industries, especially when the  commission-sponsored "Television Without Borders" project takes effect in 1992.  </P> <P> Most members of the 12-nation European Community, particularly Britain and West  Germany, opposed the quota system.  </P> <P> But until recently, the French government had backed the artists in their  demands, calling for 60% European content. Because news, sports, commercials  and even such things as quiz shows would not be counted in the formula, the  quota would mainly affect television series and feature films, the main imports  from the United States.  </P> <P> On March 13 in Brussels, the French government gave up the fight, agreeing to a  vaguely worded proposition that only requires that European television networks  "whenever possible, by means available," attempt to achieve a majority of  European produced programming.  </P> <P> "France was totally isolated on this point," Edith Cresson, French minister for  European affairs, explained in an interview in the newspaper Le Monde. Cresson,  who has been the object of fierce criticism in the French press for giving up  the quota, said the government decided not to exercise its veto."  </P> <P> However, the States General of Culture, which claims to represent more than  6,000 artists in France and Europe, urged Cresson to reconsider, using the veto  if necessary, when members of the Council of European Ministers meet again  later this week.  </P> <P> "The March 13 decision," said States General leader Jack Ralite, a former  Communist Party minister in government, "is a virtual coup d'etat against the  cultures of European countries."  </P> <P> He and other impassioned speakers at the Mogador Theater, including actor  Claude Pieplu, singer Guy Beart and actress Genevieve Fontanel, portrayed a  bleak future for the already troubled European film industry if "Television  Without Borders" is implemented without a quota system.  </P> <P> The organization claims that more than 60% of all films distributed in Europe  originate from the United States, an increase of 50% in the last decade. In  addition, they say that more than 40% of all audio-visual purchases consist of  purchases of American programs by Europeans.  </P> <P> Despite the appeal, officials in Brussels said Tuesday tat they think the full  text of the proposal will be approved this week "with only minor changes."  </P></p>

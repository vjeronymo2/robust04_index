			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Fleming reduces buying price of Wellcome shares ROBERT FLEMING, the merchant bank which organised the Pounds 2.16bn sale of 270m Wellcome shares last month, has cut the price at which it was buying shares in the company from 800p to 780p. The mid-market share price fell from 800 1/2 p to 782p. Fleming has been stabilising the share price since the sale was concluded on July 27 by bidding for shares at 800p, the price at which the Wellcome Trust sold the shares. However, the fall in the stock market since the issue was priced left Fleming vulnerable to sellers looking to raise cash. On Monday it had to buy 10m shares when four large institutions - two in Scotland and two London merchant banks - decided to sell stock. After the London market closed on Monday, Fleming was understood to have instructed Morgan Stanley to cut the price it was buying back shares in New York. Fleming's bid price in London was then reduced yesterday morning. It was thought that Fleming bought less than 2m shares yesterday, under a third of the volume done in Wellcome shares. The FT-SE 100 index stood at 2377.2 on the day the Wellcome tender closed and has fallen 2.8 per cent to yesterday's closing level of 2309.6. The 20p cut in Fleming's bid price is a slightly smaller percentage fall. Under the 'green-shoe' option attached to the share offer, Fleming over-alloted 40.5m shares. It is thought to have over-alloted another 10m to 15m shares giving it a short position. This enabled Fleming to buy back shares - to stabilise the price - without reducing the size of the issue. If Fleming does not buy back all the shares by August 26, when the stabilisation period ends, it can buy more shares from the Trust to meet the over-allotment - in effect increasing the size of the share offer. Before Monday Fleming had used up about 10m of the 'green-shoe' option, and has now bought back more than half the shares it can. The idea of stabilisation is to create a price level where there is good two-way business rather than to keep the price artificially high. Under stabilisation rules Fleming can lead the market down, but cannot push the price up unless another market maker puts its bid up first.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the  South Korean puppet Unification Board contended in a far-fetched  way that the kidnapping of the North's lumbermen to South Korea  from the far eastern region of Russia was a "defection" and even  slandered the North with the absurd allegation that the North  "is making it a political issue", according to a radio report  from Seoul.    This is a brigandish logic reversing black and white which  can convince no one and a malicious challenge to the DPRK and an  unpardonable criminal act.    As has been reported, the South Korean puppet clique on May  18 and 20 kidnapped again six citizens of the DPRK engaged in  regular Tree-felling in the far east of Russia and took them to  Seoul. This kidnapping is really an inhumanitarian act of  destroying happy families of members of the nation and producing  more separated families and a heinous crime of leading the  frozen North-South relations to an extreme phase of strain.    It is needless to say that the kidnapping of lumbermen of  the  DPRK was a product of the intentional and premeditated  anti-communist, anti-North intrigues of the South Korean puppet  Security Planning Board to impair the international image of the  DPRK and aggravate the North-South relations.    The puppets describe our kidnapped lumbermen as "displaced  persons," which is totally nonsensical. In general, a displaced  person means a war refugee or a sufferer from a natural  calamity. But what a war or a natural disaster hit the far east  of Russia to make the lumbermen of the DPRK "displaced persons"?    Still more preposterous is the claim of the South Korean  puppets that the lumbermen of the North went to South Korea  voluntarily.    The DPRK Government shows all solicitude for the lumbermen  who are devotedly working in the far east of Russia to do their  bit for the prosperity and development of the country so that  they may not feel the least inconveniences, and grants large  state benefits to their families in the homeland.    It is quite unimaginable that our lumbermen who devote  themselves to tree felling with patriotic enthusiasm, inspired  by the benevolence of the socialist system, should betray the  beloved motherland and voluntarily go to the cursed land of  South Korea, a barren land of human rights.    The "exile" of the North's lumbermen advertized by the  puppets is a fiction to cover up their brigandish kidnapping.    Foolish, indeed, are the puppets who, after committing the  anti- national and inhumane crime, are attempting to mislead  public opinion by alleging that the North is making the kidnap  case "a political issue".    The very one making it a political issue is none other than  the South Korean puppet clique which took away the North's  workers to South Korea and is using them for a sinister  political purpose.    In order to organize the kidnapping of the North's  lumbermen,  the puppets "decided" a "policy of receiving exiles" at a  "unification and security coordinating meeting" on April 15 and  then formed even the "working measure committee" to launch into  a full-scale kidnapping operation.    This fact alone shows well that the puppets made the  kidnapping of the North's lumbermen a political issue from the  beginning.    The South Korean puppet clique must stop the ridiculous acts  of a thief turning on the master with a club, and  unconditionally and immediately send back all our lumbermen they  kidnapped this time and apologize to the nation for committing  inhumanitarian act, impairing the dignity of the nation even in  an alien land.    If they continue kidnapping our lumbermen, not sending back  the spirited ones, that will bring irrevocable grave  consequences to the North-South relations as a whole and the  puppets will be held wholly responsible for them.</p>

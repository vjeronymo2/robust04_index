Speaking at the congress of the National Revival Movement,  the head of state assured the Russian-speaking population that  in the state he heads, there will be no infringement of their  civil rights, nor of the national feelings of all those for whom  Turkmenistan has become the motherland. From the lofty tribune  of the congress, the president declared that the state and the  government guarantee equal democratic rights to all their  citizens -- regardless of nationality. He pointed out the  importance of the Turkmen-Russian agreement on dual nationality,  which was signed recently, stressing its role in further  strengthening peace, stability, and national accord in  Turkmenistan.</p>

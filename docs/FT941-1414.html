			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Britain opposed to milk quota cut Britain is to resist European Commission proposals for a 1 per cent cut in its common agricultural policy milk quota from April 1, Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, told the Commons last night. She said the existing quota was insufficient and a further reduction would deal 'a severe blow' to the British dairy industry. Her pledge was welcomed by MPs on both sides of the Commons. Mrs Shephard insisted that such a reduction was not justified by the Commission's own analysis of the market. Nor was it necessary to meet obligations imposed by the general agreement on tariffs and trade. Britain, which had fought against the use of quotas in the first place, was ideally suited to produce milk and wanted the jobs that were provided through the manufacture of milk products. Mrs Shephard said the proposed cuts would have an adverse impact on the European Union's 1995 budget, largely because of the effect on the beef sector and the need to provide a compensation package for producers. Mr Gavin Strang, shadow agriculture minister, warned that some multinational companies were threatening to switch investment elsewhere because they feared there would not be sufficient milk available for the high-value products they wished to make in Britain.</p>

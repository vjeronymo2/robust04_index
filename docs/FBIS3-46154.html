At a weekly press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry  Spokesman Wu Jianmin said, "At the moment, I can say that there  is no preparation (to meet Kim Il-song)."    Early this month some South Korean press reports said that  Kim Il-song would visit China to observe economic reforms and  that North Korean Party Secretary Hwang Chang-yop's recent visit  to Beijing was to prepare for Kim's visit.    Spokesman Wu said Hwang's visit was a scheduled tour and had  nothing to do with any visit by Kim Il-song. "Kim's visit was  not among the matters discussed between Hwang and Chinese  officials," Wu said.    He also voiced China's objection to the reported plan to  deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles in South Korea. "We do not  approve a conduct that undermines stability and peace on the  Korean peninsula," he said.    Wu further demanded the retraction of the U.S. plan to  create "Radio Free Asia," calling it an act of interference in  other's internal affairs.    "The true purpose of the radio is to interfere in the  internal affairs of and set off confusion in China and other  Asian countries," Spokesman Wu said.</p>

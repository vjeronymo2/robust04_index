We are trying to help solve all the difficulties  you and all other Angolan populations are facing. We have been  meeting in Lusaka for seven months now, trying to achieve a  peaceful solution for the Angolan crisis. Quoting the words of  Dr. Savimbi, we have already gone 90 percent of the way.  Following the fruitful talks we held this morning, we believe  there will be a way out of the current situation in Angola. We  know that you have no food, that there is war in Angola, and  that everyone wants peace. If you support your leaders, we  believe we will soon achieve peace in the country.    I thank you very much for your presence here this morning. I  am aware that you have faced innumerous hardships, you have been  brave, since you have been keeping us company the whole day.  Thank you very much. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, June 25 (XINHUA) -- The water of a major  reservoir in northeast China's Liaoning Province is becoming  cleaner thanks to the local government's continuous efforts for  water resources protection over the past few years.    According to a water resources management official, the  latest survey shows that the reservoir meets the national  standards for drinking water and its transparency is increasing.    The Dahuofang Reservoir, covering an area of 5,437 sq km and  with a water storage capacity of 2.187 billion cu m, is one of  the country's biggest and provides drinking water for millions  of urban dwellers in Fushun and Shenyang cities, as well as  water for industrial use.    To protect the water resources in the reservoir, the  provincial government formulated a special regulation as early  as in 1990 to shut down all industrial enterprises that could  cause pollution in the area of the reservoir.    Other steps taken to keep the water from pollution were a  ban  on swimming and sports in and around the reservoir and the  removal of several poultry and pig farms.</p>

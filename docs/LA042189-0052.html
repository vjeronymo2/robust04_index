			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GRANT ERRORS VAULT MONROE TO 6-1 VICTORY  </P> <P> Monroe High took advantage of four Grant errors in the first three innings to  score three unearned runs and build a lead that proved insurmountable in a 6-1  win Thursday in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game at Monroe.  </P> <P> The miscues started early for Grant (10-4, 7-3 in the East Valley League),  which Wednesday had defeated Monroe, 5-2, with the help of Viking errors.  </P> <P> Monroe's first batter, Ernie Echeveste, hit a routine grounder that rolled  between first baseman Raul Montero's legs.  </P> <P> Tony Rolando, who was two for four, then tripled to right field, scoring  Echeveste. Rolando scored three pitches later on Tim Costic's ground out to  give Monroe a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> After Grant scored in the second on a run-scoring single by Stan Spancer, the  Lancers gave away two more runs on two third-inning errors to fall behind, 4-1.  </P> <P> "Those four errors killed us," Grant Coach Tom Lucero said. "We made those  errors at very crucial times and just gave them runs. I just don't understand  it."  </P> <P> Monroe pitcher Sean Henson (3-3) pitched well with the lead, scattering seven  hits and walking only one.  </P> <P> "I was tired the whole game," said Henson, who struck out only two. "I knew  Grant would hit me, but with the lead I told myself to just take it easy and  keep the ball low and I'd be OK."  </P> <P> Monroe (9-5, 7-3 in the Mid-Valley League) added a run in the fifth. Josh  Lawrence squeezed home John Langley, who had tripled.  </P> <P> The Vikings scored their final run in the sixth after three walks loaded the  bases. Adam Clark hit a sacrifice fly to drive in David Van Gorder, who was  pinch-running for Henson.  </P></p>

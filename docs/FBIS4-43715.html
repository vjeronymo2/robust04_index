			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, June 16 (AFP) -- French Prime Minister  Edouard Balladur said Thursday [16 June] France would urge its  European and G7 partners to provide aid that would enable  Ukraine to shut down the volatile Chernobyl nuclear plant.    He said France would call on its partners to help resolve  the  Chernobyl "problem" at the European Union [EU] summit on June 24  and 25 at Corfu and at next month's meeting of the G7 leading  industrial nations in Naples.    The question of closing Chernobyl -- which Ukraine says it  cannot afford to do unaided -- is on the agenda for both  meetings.    The plant at Chernobyl -- the site in April 1986 of the  world's worst civilian nuclear accident -- constituted "a very  serious danger" on safety grounds, Balladur added.    The main priority was to "put an end to the production of  electricty from the Chernobyl plant," he said.    "We must help the Ukranian Government to build three more  modern and risk-free power plants.... That presupposes helping  Ukraine, whose economic and financial situation is disastrous,"  he said, adding: "Helping Ukraine is a major priority."    Balladur stressed that electricity produced at Chernobyl and  sold in Central Europe was one of Kiev's few assets. [passage  omitted]</p>

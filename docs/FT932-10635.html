			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Bonds: SmithKline Beecham returns to the Eurosterling sector THE EUROBOND market saw a flurry of new issues as borrowers tapped the dollar, lira, sterling and D-mark sectors of the international capital market. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American drugs and consumer products group, returned to the Eurosterling sector with a Pounds 100m, five-year deal. The bonds, which have a coupon of 7.75 per cent, were priced to yield 64 basis points over the 7.25 per cent gilt due 1998. Lehman Brothers, the lead manager, said the yield spread held steady. The proceeds will be swapped into either floating-rate dollars or floating-rate sterling to give funding at around Libor plus 5 basis points. Other participants in the deal noted that some investors were rather disappointed to see SmithKline Beecham returning to the Eurosterling sector. 'The yield spread for the latest deal is more attractive than the yield spread of about 57 basis points which we are quoting for their existing issue,' said one house. SmithKline launched a 5 1/2 -year issue - the 8 1/8 per cent bond due November 1998 - in January and then increased it in size in early April. Eurofima, the rail equipment financing agency, launched a DM500m five-year Eurobond with a 6.25 per cent coupon. Dresdner Bank, the lead manager, said the issue was one of the largest D-Mark bonds to have been issued by this particular triple-A borrower. Dresdner claimed there was quite good demand for the bonds against the backdrop of a weak bund market. The bonds were issued at a price of 101.35 and traded at between 99.67 and 99.72, or 'at fees'. Also in the D-Mark sector, Europaische Hypothekenbank increased the size of its reverse floating-rate note by DM100m to DM275m. The bonds pay a fixed coupon of 7.75 per cent in the first two years, and a coupon of 12 5/8 minus six-month DM Libor thereafter. Deutsche Bank, the lead manager, said the deal was placed mainly with retail investors in Germany. Air Gulf has raised a Dollars 307m loan to finance the purchase of eight new Airbuses, Reuter reports. The loan is managed by Banque Indosuez and guaranteed by European export credit agencies.</p>

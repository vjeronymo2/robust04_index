			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Technology (Worth Watching): Big Brother is watching Sales staff, traders, and analysts in banks and securities houses are used to having their performance monitored - but probably not to the extent envisaged by Synchronocity, a London-based software house. At a glance, managers using its Profit-Line system can see on screen the cost, performance and profit ratios of their employees and decide how best to direct their efforts and make them most productive. The information can be viewed in grid format, against time taken for work, or ranked by performance, with the analysis carried out hourly, daily, weekly and monthly and targetted to sales employee, customer, analyst, trader or deal. Synchronicity claims one decision made with Profit-Line's analysis could save far more than its Pounds 10,000 cost. Synchronicity: UK, 071 729 6404.</p>

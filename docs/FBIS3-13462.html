			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ihsan Bakr: "So That They May Not Stand Alone in </F> the Open"]    [Excerpts] Despite the abundant Arab blood that was  unjustly shed by Israelis in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque Square in  Hebron in Ramadan; despite the ugly, revolting, and cowardly act  committed by an Israeli who bears U.S. nationality accompanied  by a group of killer settlers under cover of the Israeli Defense  Forces; despite the cosmetic attempts and deception in which the  Israeli prime minister is proficient, such as releasing a few  hundred detainees and disarming some settlers; and despite the  whole world's condemnation of the crime and criminals, we  reiterate and affirm -- backed by historical evidence and the  history of Israel, its rulers, institutions, and people--that  Israeli violence inside the al-Ibrahimi Mosque is not the first  and will not be the last. Israeli society, which was implanted  inside the live Palestinian flesh, has shown the unique ability  to spawn, foster, and protect terrorism. We do not exaggerate  when we say that Israeli extremism was fostered in the lap of  the military establishment and in the settlement institution  itself, which views the entire Palestinian territory as the  natural right of every Israeli. [passage omitted]    Slaughterer Baruch Goldstein, the killer of Muslims at  prayer  in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque, who bears dual Israeli-U.S.  citizenship; and before him Former Israeli Prime Minister  Menahem Begin, the champion of the Dayr Yasin massacre; former  Israeli Defense Minister Ari'el Sharon, champion of the Sabra  and Shatila massacres; Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, who  advocated breaking the bones of the intifadah heroes, whose  hands are dripping with the blood of innocent Palestinians; and  dozens of generals and leaders, who committed massacres against  defenseless Palestinians, are calling on the Arabs to turn over  a new leaf and salvage the peace process, as if peace can only  be achieved with the corpses of Arabs and Palestinians.    We will never be content with a Security Council meeting and  passing resolutions condemning the massacre, because this would  be mere ink on paper. The situation now requires an overall  Arab assessment of all developments from the Oslo agreement to  the Cairo agreement in order to define our path. In other  words, we do not want to leave the Palestinians alone to face  this ordeal. Whether we like it or not, the Palestinian issue  will remain primarily an Egyptian issue and an Arab issue that  affects pan-Arab security. We do not want to leave the  Palestinian negotiator alone in the open to face killers,  executioners, and the schemes of the Israelis who claim to seek  peace.    Since all Arab countries have condemned and denounced the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and since all Arab governments have  defined their position on the planned Israeli terrorism, and  since all Arab regimes have agreed that the crux of the problem  is due to the existence of the armed Israeli settlements and the  lack of protection for the Palestinian people, we do not want to  leave Yasir 'Arafat to stand alone to face the plotting and to  declare the continued suspension of the negotiations. There  will be no solution. A real solution lies in a call by the Arab  League for an emergency meeting of the Arab foreign ministers to  be held urgently at the Arab League or in any Arab capital, to  agree on a unified Arab stance on negotiations and the peace  process.    Israel continues to build settlements and to arm settlers  and  to distribute arms on a large scale inside the West Bank and the  Gaza Strip in preparation for a civil war after implementing the  self-rule agreement. It is a time bomb that Israel has planted  to go off at a certain moment. We are not exaggerating when we  say that Israel itself is a real threat to Arab security. It  poses a threat to the entire Arab region. The Israeli society  poses a constant threat to the Palestinian people. Despite  this, Israel negotiates and says in a loud voice that its  security is threatened and that it wants the Oslo agreement and  the Cairo agreement to guarantee its security. Such an  opportunistic stance will prevent genuine peace with Israel.    We are in dire need of a new Arab will, new approach, and  new  peace that fulfills all Arab rights. The peace that we seek  means withdrawal, dismantling of the settlements, departure of  the settlers, and granting the Palestinian people the right to  determine their future and establish their state. There is a  dire need for a new Arab decision that will put things right and  not leave the Palestinian negotiator alone in the open while we  continue to repeat statements of condemnation and denunciation.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, June 26 (CTK) -- The renewal of economic  cooperation with Arab countries and expressing support for the  Middle East peace process were the main goals of Slovak Foreign  Minister Eduard Kukan's visit to Egypt, Jordan, and Syria, Kukan  told journalists today.    Speaking upon his return to Bratislava Kukan said that his  talks with Egyptian President Muhammad Husni Mubarak, Syrian  President Hafiz al-Asad and League of Arab States Secretary  General were not just polite meetings.    He said that Slovakia maintained a good reputation in the  Middle East and called for the renewal of the broken ties  existing at the time of the Czechoslovak Federation. "Arab  countries are interested in developing relations with Slovakia  and they are just waiting for the political signal. It is now  up to economic circles how they utilize this political capital,"  Kukan said.    Minister of the Economy Peter Magvasi will sign an economic  agreement in Egypt next week, said Kukan. He said that Slovakia  was not trailing behind the Czech Republic although it still did  not have a Slovak-Arab Chamber of Commerce similar to the  Czech-Arab one.    Kukan said that with its largest trade partner, Syria,  Slovakia could continue cooperation in the military area, the  power industry, engineering and agriculture. Kukan pointed to a  chance which is appearing for Slovak companies to cooperate with  Egyptian and Jordanian partners in building infrastructure in  Palestine.    Slovakia's trade turnover with Syria is about $48 million,  with Egypt about $20 million, and with Jordan $7 million.    Asked by CTK Kukan elaborated that a contract on supplying  250 Slovak-made tanks to Syria was close to implementation and  he did not know about any other under preparation. However, he  said that Slovakia was ready to participate in military  cooperation, including the modernization of tanks, also with  Egypt.    On the unblocking of Syria's debt towards the former  Czechoslovakia which is worth billions of dollars Kukan said  action had first to be coordinated with the Czech Republic.  "However, the Syrian side is very reserved in this issue," he  said.    Kukan stressed that Slovakia's efforts to improve  cooperation  with Arab states, from which it has no diplomatic relations only  with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, does not mean a change in the  balanced approach towards individual countries of this region  and in Slovakia's interest in cooperation with Israel.</p>

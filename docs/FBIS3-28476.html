This ill-boding war confab set us on our guard because it  took place at a time when the U.S. hardline conservative forces  and war-thirsty elements in the military were letting loose war  blasts without hesitation, shouting themselves hoarse that "a  strict reaction must be shown to North Korea" and "the United  States must make a showdown with North Korea with arms."    Facts prove that the South Korean puppet clique is a group  of  bellicose elements who are bent on lighting the fuze of war to  exterminate the nation, not wanting to fundamentally resolve the  nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.    However, it is a foolish dream for the South Korean war  maniacs to overpower our republic by military force.    If the South Korean puppet clique recklessly start a war at  the instigation of the outside forces, our people and the heroic  People's Army will mete out severe punishment to them.</p>

			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Arts: It's the way that you spend it - Architecture Architectural debate is particularly lively at the moment, with two events in the last week making useful contributions to the changing climate. The first was the Royal Society of Arts' symposium on one of the most important subjects for architects, developers and clients: 'Better Buildings Mean Better Business'. It was chaired by Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover and addressed by Mr Michael Howard. the Secretary of State for the Environment. The symposium raised a fundamental question: 'What is better business and how can it be helped by better building?' The principle speakers, the Secretary of State and Mr Vincent Wang of Stanhope Properties, followed a similar line to the chairman in discussing the main issues affecting quality. Six factors were discussed as parameters for judging what makes a building 'better'. The right timing of development (just as essential as the right location) A good relationship between the client and the professionals Design quality Efficiency of planning and operation Relationships with the neighbours A successful balance of quality and price. Mr Howard continued to argue for Compulsory Competitive Tendering for public authority architectural services. The Secretary of State's view is that: 'There is a trade-off to be made between price and quality, and those responsible for spending public money must ensure they strike the right balance.' It is interesting to observe a minister - who clearly appreciates quality and has directed government departments to try to raise building standards - struggling with an unnecessary dogma which can put those very standards in jeopardy. I wonder how lawyers would enjoy the compulsory application of the competitive fee bidding system applied to their services? Mr Richard MacCormac, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, insisted that the issue of fees cannot be divorced from the issue of quality. When you pay an architect, you are paying for time and quality of work. The lowest tender approach to architecture would be like asking Shakespeare to write his plays as quickly as possible. 'Selecting architects by fee competition, on the same basis as street cleaners, simply invites architects to give the minimum time to the design process to minimise fees.' The views of Mr Wang, an innovative developer with a track record of success at Broadgate and Stockley Park, were based on wide understanding and experience. He pointed out that high quality can save money in the long-term. 'Productivity, absenteeism and sickness are all affected by a building's design. And a well-designed building will cost significantly less to run, in adaptation, maintenance and energy costs.' But he also pointed out that the perceived quality of a building's finishes is only a small part of the total cost, perhaps 10 per cent. 'Architectural quality is not just to do with the quality or cost of the finishes. It is not a question of cost at all. It is purely a question of skill, commitment and loving care. Spending more money certainly does not assure a better result.' The other event that sparks debate is a small exhibition at the RIBA called Before and After Planning. It runs until February 6 at 66 Portland Place, London W1, organised by Hawkins Brown and GMA Planning. It shows the designs of architects 'before and after' the actions of planning committees. Rather an introspective exhibition, it is not designed to make the problem very clear to the public. I did not consider the planners to have been wrong in all cases although some of their interventions were undoubtedly destructive and ignorant. The whole area is a subjective one: it is difficult to argue for non-intervention from elected planning bodies when a nominated and largely self-selecting group - the Royal Fine Art Commission - plays the role of an arbiter at the national level. Also at the RIBA is a fascinating, well-designed exhibition about new museums in Austria organised by August Sarnitz and presented by the Austrian government. It raises a great many questions about the links between new and old buildings and the mixture of modern and Baroque cultures. Anyone who has recently been in Vienna will realise that Austria has a more relaxed approach to the location of new buildings in old settings than many other European countries. There are some good examples here of the intervention of modern artists and architects in the expansion plans of Austrian museums and there is clearly a well-funded and intelligent government approach to the question of museums. (Peter Brooke, please note). I would recommend this exhibition to museum directors as well as the public  -especially to Mr Nicholas Serota of the Tate Gallery as he plans the growth of the Tate. One scheme worries me, and that is the proposed new museum quarter at the heart of the Imperial Forum of Vienna, opposite the marvellous stables by Fischer van Erlach built in 1720. To turn the former imperial stables into a museum quarter is a difficult task demanding immense sensitivity. I find the proposals for a giant media tower and multipurpose hall and museum of modern art strange and arbitrary - and curiously reminiscent of the 1960s. Can Vienna be serious about this plan? I will return to this subject when I have had the opportunity to look closely at the site. As shown at the RIBA I can scarcely believe that this scheme is, as it is claimed to be, 'a direct modern counterpart of an ancient Greek acropolis'.</p>

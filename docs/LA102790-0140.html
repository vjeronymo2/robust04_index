			<p><P> October 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIFFICULTIES COLLECTING ON METZGER SUIT TOLD  </P> <P> Now that Tom Metzger and his white supremacist organization have been ordered  to pay nearly $9 million for inciting the murder of an Ethiopian student in  Portland, Ore., the victim's family faces a task that might be even more  formidable than winning the judgment -- collecting it.  </P> <P> It is unlikely that Metzger and the White Aryan Resistance -- his organization  to promote racial hatred -- have $9 million. Metzger lives in a modest  Fallbrook home worth little more than $100,000, according to estimates. He  drives two older cars, and from all appearances, his television repair business  has not made him rich.  </P> <P> But no one knows just how much Metzger and WAR are really worth. The  organization collected most of its revenue in cash or money orders, and there  is no telling how much of that money has been spent or stashed away.  </P> <P> State law says that whatever goes uncollected in 20 years will remain beyond  the grasp of the law.  </P> <P> "For 20 years, Tom Metzger and his son, John, are going to have me or someone  else following them around with our hands out," said James McElroy, the San  Diego lawyer who is assisting civil rights attorney Morris Dees in collecting  the award ordered on Monday by a Portland jury.  </P> <P> "Our top priority is to compensate the family of the decedent. We want to give  them some money. A side benefit of that is that, if we can shut down Mr.  Metzger's hate business, he'll no longer be preying on these 15- and  16-year-old skinheads. He won't be selling hate to them, and reaping the  rewards from their violent acts," McElroy said.  </P> <P> In what was cast as a major setback to the white supremacist movement, the jury  awarded $12.5 million to the family of Mulugeta Seraw, a 27-year-old Ethiopian  immigrant living in Portland who was beaten in the head with a baseball bat  when he was attacked by skinheads in November, 1988.  </P> <P> The jury found that the two assailants who pleaded guilty in the slaying were  incited by the Fallbrook-based Metzgers and WAR's racial hate campaign. Tom  Metzger, 52, was ordered to pay $5 million in punitive damages; his son, John,  22 -- who heads WAR's youthful skinhead faction -- was ordered to pay $1  million; WAR was assessed $3 million, and each of the two skinheads was told to  pay $500,000 each. Each of the five also was ordered to pay 20% of the  $2.5-million balance, which represented compensatory damages.  </P> <P> Because Metzger's actions were found by the jury to be willful, he cannot file  bankruptcy to avoid the judgment.  </P> <P> Metzger -- who was not criminally charged in the slaying -- did not return  telephone calls. But after the jury's verdict last week, Metzger said the  judgment elevated him as a martyr to white America and that, with nothing else  to lose, he was free to promote his cause.  </P> <P> So what happens next?  </P> <P> The Portland judgment will be transferred to San Diego Superior Court so it can  be executed locally. The necessary filing of documents is expected on Monday,  McElroy said.  </P> <P> Within several weeks, the two Metzgers will be subpoenaed to testify as to  their assets. Then, with a judge's permission, the San Diego County marshal's  office could seize personal assets -- ranging from the television business  equipment, to a trailer used for Metzger rallies, to the cars. They could be in  authorities' hands within weeks, to be sold at auction.  </P> <P> The Fallbrook house would be appraised and sold at auction. This should happen,  McElroy said, within "the next several months." However, no matter how much  money the house fetches, Metzger, under the state's homestead laws, gets to  keep $45,000.  </P> <P> Next, a judge will determine how much of the income from Metzger's television  business should go to paying off the judgment. Metzger would be allowed to keep  some money to support himself and his wife.  </P> <P> Getting WAR to pay will be more difficult.  </P> <P> Among the possibilities, McElroy said, "is to create a receivership and  actually take over WAR, and then the receiver would have the key to the box."  </P></p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Matrix case would see little change THOUGH the furore that surrounded the Matrix Churchill trial might have been one of the factors prodding the government into reforming its freedom of information policy, yesterday's white paper seems unlikely to have made much difference to the issues that dominated the case. For although the paper promises better rights for individuals wishing to gain access to their personal files, it does not guarantee that a government department would reveal the type of documents that proved so central to the Matrix Churchill case. The controversy about the release of documents in the case centred on two issues. The first was why the government had been able, in the late 1980s, to withhold from parliament documents showing that it had privately changed its policy towards arms sales to Iraq - a change that led companies like Matrix-Churchill to believe they could deal with Iraq. Under the new code of practice, the Ministry of Defence would, in theory, now be under considerably greater pressure to reveal this type of policy change. In addition to parliamentary questioning, the department could also face policing from the parliamentary ombudsman if it failed to open its files, and would have to comply with written requests for information. But, since the code reiterates that parliament remains the main vehicle for prompting disclosure, critics yesterday pointed out that without parliamentary pressure, there would still be no means of forcing disclosure. Mr Maurice Frankel, from the Campaign for Freedom of Information, yesterday said: 'Under a Freedom of Information act that would have been a disclosable document - it was only a minor policy change. That is not the case in this white paper.' The second issue was whether government ministers should be able to use public interest immunity certificates to prevent the release of sensitive documents. On that matter, the white paper promises little change. Although, in the Matrix case, the application was overturned, the white paper envisages that ministers will still be able to use the immunity clause in cases affecting national security. Mr Paul Henderson, a former Matrix director, said yesterday: 'It was only the release of documents that stopped us from being convicted.'</p>

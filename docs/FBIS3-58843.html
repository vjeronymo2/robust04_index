			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "Fz": "Wehner Case: CSU Does Not Rule Out </F> Investigating Committee"]    [Text] The Christian Social Union [CSU] group in the  Bundestag has requested that the GDR contacts of Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] officials Herbert Wehner and  Karl Wienand be clarified. The CSU does not rule out  establishing an investigating committee in this connection.    In Bonn yesterday, Michael Glos, head of the CSU group in  the  Bundestag, said one must clarify the extent to which foreign  powers had an influence on activities in the old FRG.    Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt, the widow of former SPD Chairman  and Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt, who died in 1992, disclosed  notes of her husband that create the impression Mr. Wehner, who  died in 1990, was involved in secret cooperation with Moscow and  East Berlin.    With a view to the "confessions" of young Wehner in Moscow,  which have now become public and in which he denounced comrades  in Germany during the Stalin era as deviationists, Glos stated  that it had to be clarified whether the former chairman of the  SPD Bundestag group was liable to blackmailing. Glos added that  clarification was also necessary in connection with the  suspicion that Karl Wienand, Wehner's long-standing Bundestag  group manager, might have spied for the GDR or the Soviet KGB.    Guenter Verheugen, federal manager of the SPD, spoke of a  "campaign" that, considering the treatment of hitherto  unpublished files, provided a foretaste of the 1994 super  election year. The SPD's attention was to be deviated from the  election campaign and its party leadership was to be presented  in a suspicious light.    Former SPD Chairman Hans-Jochen Vogel told Cologne EXPRESS  that Brandt never accused Wehner of espionage. SPD Deputy Klaus  Lennartz accused Brigitte Seebacher-Brandt of suffering from an  image neurosis.    Wienand rejected the accusation that, regarding Willy  Brandt's overthrow in 1974, Wehner served the cause of the  former Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] rulers or  intercepted Honecker letters to Brandt. Wienand said Wehner,  who was a member of the German Communist Party until the 1940's,  used his former contacts to achieve progress in inner-German  relations.</p>

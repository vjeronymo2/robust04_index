			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian fleet is significant and it must be  based in Sevastopol, People's RUKh [Ukrainian People's Movement  for Perestroyka] leader, Vyacheslav Chornovil, told  INTERFAX-Ukraine.    He said if Ukraine had to share with somebody military bases  and a part of the fleet this must be carried out under generally  recognized international principles.    Chornovil estimated the Ukrainian position at the talks as  "the only right one." He considered the conduct of Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as improper. Chornovil said this  had once again manifested the "boorishness of a superpower."    He suggested that Russia's position at the talks had  reflected its gradual pro-imperial policy.    Given that the U.S. possess "certain influence" and are  interested in normalization of Russian-Ukrainian relations the  U.S. mediation in settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issue could  be useful, Chornovil said.    "Grachev would hardly slam the door if there were a U.S.  representative at the talks," Chornovil suggested.    He said in Kravchuk's place he would have addressed the  Russian president to make him show "his ministers their place."  "A kind of demarche is definitely needed. Such an offense  should not be ignored," Chornovil added.</p>

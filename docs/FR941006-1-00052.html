Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region II announces its intent to delete the Radium Chemical Company site, Woodside, Queens County, New York from the NPL and requests public comment on these actions. The NPL constitutes appendix B to the NCP, which EPA promulgated pursuant to section 105 of CERCLA, as amended. The EPA identifies sites that appear to present a significant risk to public health, welfare, or the environment and maintains the NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subject of remedial actions financed by the Hazardous Substances Superfund Response Trust Fund (Fund). Pursuant to &sect;300.425(e)(3) of the NCP, any site deleted from the NPL remains eligible for Fund-financed remedial actions, if conditions at the site warrant such action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA will accept comments concerning the Radium Chemical Company site for thirty days after publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites from the NPL. Section III discusses procedures that EPA is using for these actions. Section IV discusses how the sites meet the deletion criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. NPL Deletion Criteria <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NCP establishes the criteria the Agency uses to delete sites from the NPL. In accordance with 40 CFR Section 300.425(e), sites may be deleted from the NPL where no further response is appropriate. In making this determination, EPA will consider whether any of the following criteria have been met: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that responsible or other parties have implemented all appropriate response actions required; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implemented and EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Based on a remedial investigation, EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that the release poses no significant threat to public health or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures is not appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Conference backs steps for Unctad reforms THE UN Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad VIII) has approved an institutional reform package designed to revitalise the organisation, Sarita Kendall reports from Cartagena, Colombia. The 171 member-nations have been working for change which, many delegates hope, will influence other UN bodies. Four new standing committees on commodities, poverty alleviation, economic co-operation among developing countries and service sectors are to replace most existing committees. Ad hoc working groups will deal with special issues related to trade and development, such as investment, privatisation, trade efficiency, exports and technology. The declaration, 'The Spirit of Cartagena' agreed by members stressed: 'It is important to overcome confrontation and foster a climate of genuine co-operation and solidarity'. Unctad would give priority to problems facing least developed countries and to the fight against poverty. The conference showed strong agreement on economic growth policies: market economies, with trade liberalisation and some privatisation, are almost universally accepted by developing and industrialised nations.</p>

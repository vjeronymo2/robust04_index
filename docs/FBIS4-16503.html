			<p>BFN     [Text] The Moldovan leadership intends to examine the  memorandum on border cooperation between Russia, Ukraine and  Belarus signed in Moscow on April 15, Moldovan President Mircea  Snegur told Interfax before leaving Moscow. "I am not familiar  with this memorandum. It was not discussed at the CIS summit.  However, we must study this issue. It would be quite useful  for us," Snegur pointed out.    Snegur welcomed Ukraine joining the CIS economic union as an  associated member. "This would enhance economic cooperation  between Ukraine and Moldova," he stressed. However, Snegur  underlined that economic relations between Ukraine and Moldova  were based primarily on a bilateral treaty.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, Apr 19, BNS -- The opposition Centrist  faction in the Estonian parliament today submitted to the  legislative body a draft decision on setting up a new 10-member  delegation for the country's talks with Russia.    The draft foresees that nominations for the new delegation  would come from the parliament speaker's office within five days  after adoption of the decision by the legislative body.    The same draft proposes to the government to recall the  current governmental delegation for the Russian talks after the  setup of the new delegation is approved.    Centrist faction members say their move was called by the  talks between Estonia and Russia having run into a deadlock,  which, they say, is caused by the Estonian delegation's  unclearly determined status, lack of authority and of flexible  tactics, as well as by insufficient preparedness.    The opposition politicians point at what they call dangerous  tendencies for Estonia at the talks, where the border issue is  being resolved by ignoring Estonia's interests, concessions are  made as to the fate of the retired Russian military, and that  the agreements already signed may "provide for the remaining of  a part of the Russian army in Estonia for another three years."    The Centrist faction says the new delegation should receive  its powers from the parliament. It must include people who  "know Russia," today's statement says.    Centrist Party member Hardo Aasmae in his comments to BNS  called the tactics used by the current delegation wrong. He  said the delegations at the talks should start from decisions  over which a compromise is possible. A moratorium should be  imposed on other issues so far, Aasmae added.    He said it is most important at present to reach an accord  with Russia on the troop withdrawal, establish the status of  Paldiski without letting it be declared a special area, as well  as to resolve a number of economic issues.    Aasmae suggested that Endel Lippmaa, a minister for Eastern  relations without portfolio in the government of the country's  former Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar, should be appointed the  head of the delegation. Savisaar is the leader of the Centrist  Party.    "A situation has emerged currently at the Estonian-Russian  talks when virtually no political delegation exists; there are  only work groups. This provides to Russia the possibility to  use protraction diplomacy. If we manage to set up a broad-based  political delegation, it must above all make changes happen in  the Russian delegation and its powers," Aasmae said.    He said a breakthrough at the talks will come when one of  the  parties is put in a situation when it is no longer possible to  postpone decision.</p>

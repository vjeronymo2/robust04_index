This is the  first official visit to Cambodia since the setting up of the  constitutional monarchy government in that country in September  last year.    Vietnam always attaches great importance to friendship and  good neighborliness with Cambodia. Immediately upon setting up  the new government, Cambodia affirmed its continued  strengthening of relations with Vietnam. In such a situation,  this visit by Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam is an important  contribution to consolidating and strengthening mutual  relations. The results of the talks between Vietnamese Foreign  Minister Nguyen Manh Cam and his Cambodian counterpart signal  good news in bilateral relations. They both discussed  preparations for the coming official visit to the Kingdom of  Cambodia by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet. Cambodian  Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Prince Sirivut remarked:  These events will open up a new stage in relations between  Vietnam and Cambodia.    Cambodia remains faced with many difficulties due to the  lack  of goodwill of the Khmer Rouge, but developments in Cambodia  tend to be positive. This is due to the important and great  role played by King Norodom Sihanouk in the process of peace and  national reconciliation in Cambodia.    In the implementation of its open-door and diversified  foreign policy, Vietnam is determined to establish and broaden  multifaceted relations with Cambodia. This Cambodia visit by  the Vietnamese foreign minister and the coming visit by the  Vietnamese head of government will be a vivid expression of  Vietnam's stance.</p>

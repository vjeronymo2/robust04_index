			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These provisions would expand the factors of financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility of an institution to take into consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over both other existing institutions (as opposed to only defunct institutions) and third-party servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 498(e) of the HEA clearly contemplates this expansion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, these requirements are needed for the same reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that similar requirements recently were adopted for persons with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over defunct institutions. A person might be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for incurring liabilities for Title IV, HEA program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violations because of his or her substantial control over  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers or other institutions. The person could,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nevertheless, have the same level of control over a participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution while avoiding responsibility for repayment of those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities. These requirements are intended to prevent those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> persons from continuing to participate either directly or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> indirectly in the Title IV, HEA programs without assuming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for their prior actions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary also proposes technical changes to this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section to remove as factors of financial responsibility the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consideration of matters that would instead be included in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.12 as conditions for participation in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs, for the reasons given in the discussion of that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.23&blank;Audits, records, and examination. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary proposes to specify that in addition to current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, an institution would be required to cooperate with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a guaranty agency in whose program the institution participates  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the State postsecondary review entity designated under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, in the conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of audits, investigations, and program reviews. These requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would clarify existing responsibilities to be accountable to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized persons or organizations for the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities with respect to the sound management of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs. The Secretary further proposes to apply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these requirements to a third-party servicer that contracts with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution to administer any aspect of that institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in a Title IV, HEA program. This change would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merely clarify existing responsibilities of a third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, as an agent of an institution, to be accountable and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide access to authorized persons for the servicer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities on behalf of the institution's participation in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to add a requirement that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer that administers funds or determines student  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eligibility under contract with an institution would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have prepared, at least annually, a compliance audit of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aspects of the servicer's administration of the participation in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs of each institution with which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer contracts. (This requirement would be satisfied by an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit report submitted in accordance with the Single Audit Act or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Office of Management and Budget Circular A&hyph;133.) This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is necessitated by section 487(c)(1)(C) of the HEA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary, however, believes that the contractual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obligations of some third-party servicers do not necessitate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audits of the servicers' activities. Accordingly, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to require annual audits to be performed only by those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers that administer funds or determine student eligibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on behalf of institutions. The consequences of the activities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those servicers to the integrity of the Title IV, HEA programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> justify stricter accountability to the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Secretary proposes certain additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions to the annual audit requirement in the discussion that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> follows. A third-party servicer that is required to have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit performed would be excused from the annual audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement if that servicer contracts with only one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participating institution and if that servicer's administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a Title IV, HEA program would still be covered fully in that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's compliance audit. (In proposed regulations to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published shortly after these, the Secretary intends to propose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to excuse certain institutions from having an annual audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed. If an institution were to be excused from an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, the activities of that institution's third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer would not be fully covered, and thus the servicer would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to have an audit performed to meet the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of this section). This provision would not harm the integrity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Title IV, HEA programs as the servicer's activities still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be covered fully by the submission of an institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance audit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third-party servicer that is required to have an audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed and that contracts with more than one participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution could have performed, to meet the requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this section, a single comprehensive compliance audit that covers all of the servicer's activities for all of the institutions that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the servicer contracts with for Title IV, HEA program purposes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if the audit is conducted in such a way as to satisfy each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual audit requirement and if the audit covers all aspects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the servicer's administration of the participation in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs of all institutions with which the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer contracts. The Secretary believes that, by allowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicers to have one inclusive audit performed,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instead of many individual audits, the burden associated with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these regulations would be reduced (regulatory burden reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is an objective under Executive Order (E.O.) 12866).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Furthermore, the Secretary does not believe that this provision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would in any way affect the soundness of the information required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by these regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Rothmans suspends Asian restructuring Rothmans International has given up its attempts to create an Asian holding company to attack the Chinese and Japanese cigarette markets. It said yesterday that there were no immediate prospects of presenting new proposals for the creation of such a company to the boards of its separately quoted subsidiaries in Malaysia and Singapore. Its plan to merge these companies with its north-east Asia operation were thrown out by the local shareholders in Rothmans (Malaysia). The group said it was committed to the development of its north-east Asian markets which would be financed from its own resources. A new management team has been recently established in Hong Kong with responsibility for the Asia region.</p>

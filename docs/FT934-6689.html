			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Israel and PLO draw the line in Jericho sand: Julian Ozanne on talks over the size and shape of the area for Palestinian self-rule Within a few months Mr Yassir Arafat will take up residence in the dusty, palm-fringed town of Jericho, the planned de facto capital of Palestinian self-government, after nearly half a century of exile. Yet, so far, no one knows what area around Jericho Mr Arafat and his embryonic government will control. Yesterday Palestinian and Israeli peace negotiators began talks on the size of the Jericho area from which Israeli troops will begin to withdraw in less than three weeks. It is certain to prove one of the most difficult and sensitive issues on their long peace agenda. The fact that the two sides are now discussing Jericho is a sign of how far they have come and how far they still have to go to reach a protocol, due to be signed on December 13. It will provide for a phased four-month Israeli troop pull-out from the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho and the handover of policing and administration to Palestinian hands. Palestinian elections are planned for next July. When negotiators began discussions on how to implement the historic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord the task seemed well-nigh impossible. Although the peace agreement provides only for an interim and partial solution to the problem, many of the issues that have had to be solved, such as security and claims to territorial sovereignty, cut to the heart of the conflict. But in the past five weeks the two sides have proceeded at a furious pace, reaching broad agreement on a range of complex security problems such as policing, the future role of the Israeli military and the first release of Israeli-held Palestinian prisoners. By all measures the negotiations have been a remarkable achievement in beginning to solve one of the world's most intractable conflicts. Now the size of Jericho and the future economic relations between Israel and the Palestinian economy, which is also being discussed in Paris this week, are the most substantive issues left on the agenda. The eventual size of Palestinian-controlled Jericho could be anywhere between 25 sq km (the present area of the town's municipal boundaries) and 345 sq km (the size of the old British mandatory Jericho district). Israel is pushing for the smallest possible area while the Palestinians are demanding the full 345 sq km. For both sides the shape and size of the Jericho area is critical. Israeli military officials say the Jericho district includes two significant defence lines - the Jordan line east of Jericho and the fortified hill line west of the town. Military experts say the Jordan line is essential for defence against external threats and are demanding Israel continue to hold a 5km strip west of the river to control the Jordan river and prevent armed infiltration of guerrillas into Israel. The hill line, they say, is critical to controlling the area around the town and the road to Jerusalem and has several army facilities. The second big concern for the Israelis is security of the Jewish settlers who will continue living in the Jericho district. There are three Israeli settlements close to the town - Vered Jericho, Mitzpe Jericho and Beit HaArava. Israeli officials say they could evacuate Jericho town and the Palestinian refugee camps of Ein Sultan and Akabat Jaber without surrendering the two defence lines and the three settlements. The Israelis are likely to press for three Israeli-controlled enclaves in the Palestinian-controlled areas to protect a total of six settlements, including the three close to Jericho town. The Israelis also want to build a bypass road around Jericho to allow settlers to travel on roads controlled by Israeli security and police. The Israelis will also demand full control over the Allenby border crossing into Jordan. Palestinian officials say they could accept most Israeli security concerns if Israel is generous with its surrender of a large area of territory. Palestinian concerns about the size of Jericho focus on the viability of the area, control of economic and water assets and access to Jordan. Mr Khalil Tewfakji, a Palestinian cartographer, says the Palestinians are largely concerned with economic interests and want to secure the agricultural and tourism resources of the Jericho area and have a large enough area to allow the construction of houses, offices and industry. The Palestinians are pushing for the control of all major religious and tourist sites around Jericho. They also want the area to extend to the northern shore of the Dead Sea to allow the Palestinian entity to begin its own salt-producing industry and to give the Palestinians a direct and independent crossing to Jordan by ferry. Also critical to the Palestinians, especially for agriculture, is control of the water resources of the area, in particular the water springs at El-Ouja and control of the Almog junction which provides access to the Dead Sea, Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Abdullah bridge. The Palestinians seem prepared to concede Israeli control of the 5km strip east of Jericho along the Jordan Valley but are demanding a corridor to the Allenby and Abdallah bridges and joint-administration of the border crossings. Although the Palestinians have been saying that the border between the Jericho area and the rest of the occupied West Bank is likely to be temporary, both sides realise there is much to play for at this stage of the negotiations.</p>

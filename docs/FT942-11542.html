			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Observer: Right stuff In Brazil, plagued by near hyperinflation and bad governments for more than a decade, success stories like Ayrton Senna don't come round too often. Hence the death of the Formula One racing driver almost brought Latin America's biggest country to a halt yesterday, when his coffin was paraded through the street of Sao Paulo, atop a fire engine. President Itamar Franco had already declared three days of mourning and delayed the announcement of a new currency until next week, while Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's new finance minister, compares Senna's death to the loss of the US space shuttle Challenger. 'For a country which has still not sent people into space, Senna was the hero in the vanguard of technology and proof of our ability to win among the most modern and new. Senna was our astronaut,' says Ricupero.</p>

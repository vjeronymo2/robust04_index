			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / Romance added to firm's accounts A small north London accountancy firm has decided to capitalise on the consequences of the profession's unfortunate image as boring. In what must be the most unusual diversification yet from the core work of audit and tax advice, George &amp; Co, based in Enfield, has launched a dating agency for accountants. Just in time for Valentine's Day, it placed an advertisement this week announcing its services in Pass, a magazine for trainee accountants. 'Prolink' is now taking calls from romance-seeking accountants and other professionals seeking similar types for meals, films and discussions on double-entry bookkeeping. Mr Paul George, who dreamed up the idea, said there was a market for accountants wanting to meet each other because of their reputation of being boring, and to allow them to talk to each other about their work. Dateline, the computer dating agency, said more than 10 per cent of all new male applicants were accountants. 'Accountancy is one of the most difficult professions for people trying to find dates,' said Ms Frances Pyne of Dateline. She said this was because it was male-dominated and many accountants worked alone or in small offices. Young accountants were sceptical yesterday. 'I think we meet enough accountants here already,' said Ms Natalie Marchant, who works for Price Waterhouse. 'In principle there's nothing wrong with it,' she added hastily. Mr Giles Davies, a colleague, said: 'It's a bit sad. I would only use it as a joke. The assumptions behind it come right out of Monty Python.' He added: 'Accountants do date a lot, but largely when they are training and no-one else understands the pressures. It's a shame if you don't broaden your horizons afterwards.' But Prolink has already received nearly 50 inquiries from romance-seeking accountants.</p>
